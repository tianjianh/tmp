The Wales prop was on the bench on Friday when the Blues won 37-27 against the French side in Cardiff.
Lloyd Williams, who led the side in Jenkins' absence, drops to the bench as Tavis Knoyle takes over at scrum-half.
Italy number eight Manoa Vosawai is fit to start, with Lou Reed coming into the second row. Centre Garyn Smith will make his European debut.
Smith, 20, replaces the injured Gavin Evans, who joins Sam Warburton, Cory Allen, Gareth Anscombe, Ellis Jenkins and Dan Fish on the casualty list, while Matthew Rees continues to serve a suspension.
Montpellier have made nine changes - five in the pack - to the side that started at the Arms Park, with South Africa hooker Bismarck Du Plessis among those to be dropped entirely.
The Blues are second in the group behind leaders Harlequins, who have a five-point advantage after picking up maximum points from their first three games - including an away win over the Blues in their opening fixture.
"To progress from the group it is a game we ultimately need to look to win," said Blues coach Danny Wilson.
"If we can beat them away it probably comes down to a winner-takes-all against Harlequins in January, but we are fully aware of the task ahead of us now in France.
"To go and beat the squad that Montpellier have at their place will be a big ask. But we have made good strides in recent weeks to get a far better performance.
"Over the last three games we have taken steps in the right direction. This is another huge challenge before we come back to two derby games, so the games are coming thick and fast.
"They are tough games for us at the moment. But if we can keep players fit and be competitive then we can challenge for results."
