Ciara Mageean impresses in Diamond League race in Rome

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ciara Mageean ran the second fastest 1500m of her career as she clocked 4:04.49 to finish 10th in a high-quality Diamond League race in Rome.

After a modest 2:03.12 for 800m to finish down the field in Belgium two weeks ago, this was a better run by the Portaferry woman.
In a race run at a frantic pace, Mageean held her form well to pass a number of athletes on the final lap.
Dutch star Sifan Hassan set the fastest 1500m time so far in 2017 with 3:56.22.
Emerging German talent Konstanze Klosterhalfen duelled with Hassan for much of the race but was passed for second place in the closing stages by Kenya's Winny Chebet.
Klosterhalfen had the consolation of going under four minutes for the first time as she clocked 3:59.30 to finish 0.16 seconds behind Chebet.
Mageean's time was well under the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games consideration standard although that was never going to be a difficulty for last year's European Championship bronze medallist.
In a loaded field, Poland's European champion Angelika Cichocka (4:01.84) and a number of other world-class Africans were also ahead of Mageean.
Mageean appeared to be baulked as she opted to stay on the kerb near the back of the field on the first lap but regained her poise as the field began to be strung out.
