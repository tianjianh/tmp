The fires are the worst in decades and have spread to affect 480,000 hectares so far. That's around the size of 576,000 football pitches.
The blazes spread quickly in the dry and particularly hot summer that many South American countries are experiencing.
They have struck mainly in rural areas in the central regions of O'Higgins and El Maule, which have small populations living there.
