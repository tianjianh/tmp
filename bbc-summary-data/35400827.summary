The 26-year old rejoined Stanley in the summer after spells at Stockport, Barrow and Chester on an initial one-year contract.
McConville has scored five goals in 28 games in his second spell at the club.
"Goals and assists are a plus but the most important thing is working hard for the shirt and I think I've done that," said McConville.
Stanley boss John Coleman said: "He won't be the last to sign up. We expect a few more to be putting pen to paper over the coming weeks."
