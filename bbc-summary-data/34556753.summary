Ross County 2-0 Aberdeen: Derek McInnes backs side to halt slump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derek McInnes insists Aberdeen are better than their recent results, after a 2-0 defeat by Ross County took the leaders' losing streak to four matches.

McInnes' side made a blistering start to the season with eight consecutive league wins but have since faltered.
"We never got too high when we were winning week after week," he told BBC Scotland. "We're not going to get too down as difficult as it is to take.
"We know we're better than what we've shown recently."
After a lacklustre first half, the Dons succumbed to a Brian Graham double in Dingwall, but McInnes - who has seen his team crash to four straight losses for the first time under his stewardship, three in the league - is confident that, with the endeavour his players showed after the interval, the slump in form will soon be arrested.
"You can never question my boys for effort and you can see the willingness to try and make things better," he said.
"We need to try and find better form individually from some players and as a team, but I thought it was harsh on us tonight.
"Ross County's front two caused us problems in the first half; I thought physically they dominated us a wee bit at times. But I thought in the second half we changed the system, we were far better, created chances, kept the back door shut."
Luck, the Dons boss suggested, has not been on Aberdeen's side of late.
"We are a good team," McInnes continued. "Possibly little things were going for us in the early part of the season.
"I think tonight one or two things didn't - we hit the post, had one cleared off the line, the ball falling to defenders rather than attackers. They get a bit of a break for the second goal.
"If we keep working as hard as we did tonight, the players are good enough to find better form; we're all good enough to start finding ways to win again."
Counterpart Jim McIntyre said the victory over the league leaders was the perfect tonic after the derby loss to Highland rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
"I'm delighted with the performance tonight," he said. "We wanted to bounce back after the derby defeat and we did that with a bit of style, I felt.
"We created numerous opportunities against a very good side. They're not sitting top of the league for nothing. There was some great individual performances out there as well as team.
"Our target from the start is top six. That won't change. We know there'll be ups and downs. Tonight is a good night for us, we'll enjoy it."
