[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Terry Pratchett sculpture for Salisbury art trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A life-sized fibreglass sculpture with the face of Sir Terry Pratchett decorated by long-time Discworld collaborator Paul Kidby is to go on display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The author died on 12 March following a public struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
Up to 25 statues of medieval barons, decorated by local artists, will be placed around Salisbury from 12 June.
Illustrator Mr Kidby said the statue was a "tribute to Terry's writing".
The fantasy artist, who illustrated a number of Discworld publications, said his baron did not sport Sir Terry's trademark hat and glasses
"It has a beard so I'm making mine look as much like Terry as I can," he said.
"He's got a shield with Terry's Discworld on it, a helmet with a famous Discworld motto, and on his back he has a cloak made up of about 70 of his most famous characters.
"Its always nice to remind people of the books that Terry wrote and I'm hoping lots of people will come and see it and enjoy it."
The statue will form part of an art trail of 5ft (1.5m)-tall sculptures in Salisbury to mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.
The Barons' Charter Trail, which includes work by local artist Louise Luton and children's book illustrator Lee O'Brien, will run from 12 June until 6 September before the barons are auctioned off in October.
