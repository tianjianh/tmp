Emergency services attended the house at Llwydcoed near Aberdare, Cynon Valley, at 0530 BST on Monday.
South Wales Police said they were not speculating on the cause of death but there were no suspicious circumstances.
Cable, who left the Stereophonics in 2003, had hosted his rock show on BBC Radio Wales on Saturday.
South Wales Police confirmed they were investigating the sudden death of a 40-year-old man at an address in Llwydcoed.
A post mortem examination is due to be carried out later this week.
Floral tributes have been left outside his home.
It is understood Cable had been drinking at a local pub, where his car was left overnight, and had had some friends over at his house on Sunday night.
It is also believed a number of bottles of alcohol were removed from the property by investigators.
His death comes just two days after Cable's former band Stereophonics played at Cardiff City Stadium.
Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones, back home for a family funeral, told BBC Wales they had only been speaking in the past few days and he could not believe what had happened.
The band were formed in Cwmaman near Aberdare in 1992 by school friends Kelly and Richard Jones along with Cable, who was four years older.

Tributes to 'well loved' drummer

Within five years they were rising stars, supporting bands such as the Rolling Stones and U2.
Cable, who said he was planning to leave the band before he was sacked in September 2003, said he had no regrets.
He later formed a new group called Killing for Company, who were due to play at the Download festival Donington Park on Saturday.
The band's new album is due for release to coincide with it.
A simple tribute message on their website says "you will be missed".
Among other tributes from the music and entertainment industries,  Mike Peters, lead singer with The Alarm, said Cable's band had only recently played with them and his death was a "real shock" and a "real tragedy".
His mother Mabel, 79, told Wales Online she had worried when he travelled all over the world.
"He is now settled down and then this has happens," she said. "It has not sunk in yet."
His manager John Brand said Cable had been looking forward to his performance at Download, and "really excited about drumming his way back to the top".
He said: "He will be remembered for his big heart and booming voice, his bonhomie and his compassion for those less fortunate than himself.
"I will always remember him as a loyal friend. Someone I shared many of the best and often the funniest times in my life."
Cable's autobiography, Demons and Cocktails, was released in 2009.
The autobiography shed light on tensions which eventually led to the drummer's departure.
Cable revealed the split was mainly sparked off by Kelly Jones' desire to produce the band's third album.
There were also said to be tensions in the band about Cable's burgeoning career as a presenter.
Cable hosted his own TV show, Cable TV, and radio show, Cable Rock, for BBC Wales.
He has also been involved in a variety of other projects.
In March 2002, he took part in a BBC Wales social action campaign urging young men to look out for the warning signs of testicular cancer.
In autumn 2007 Cable quit the BBC to launch a Cardiff-based branch of rock station XFM, which closed after six months on air.
He was also a presenter for the Birmingham-based commercial radio station Kerrang!
But he returned back at BBC Radio Wales with his Saturday rock show in April.
BBC Radio Wales producer and friend of Cable, Darren Broome - who worked with  Cable on his final show on Saturday - said: "He was a warm-hearted person who loved Aberdare and the Cynon valley and chose to live there.
"He was a huge personality. I feel very numb. He was so passionate about music."
Mr Broome said the musician was "a scream" to work with.
"It was the best two hours, playing good music in the company of Stuart Cable," he said.
"He was a total, total music fan and inspiration to performers and so proud of his home town. A diamond geezer, a top dude."
Steve Austins, editor of Radio Wales said: "We are all profoundly shocked and saddened at the news of Stuart's death. He was an extraordinary man.
"He was well loved by both colleagues and listeners and he will be deeply missed. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and friends at this difficult time."
Tributes were being emailed by fans and musicians alike to BBC Wales
One fan, Ian Gravell, said: "I met Stuart with my son (a keen drummer at the time) after watching Scarlets at Stradey a few years ago. Despite him being with friends, Stuart took the time to chat to my son about his drumming and what he should do to improve. This is a tragic event for Wales."
