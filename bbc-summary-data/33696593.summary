'Punching game' man cleared of Erith party manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of killing a father-of-two in a party prank that went wrong has been cleared of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Desmond Bartley, 21, was charged with the unlawful killing of Tommy Main at a birthday celebration in June last year.
The court heard Mr Main, 23, had collapsed and died during a "macho" game of "blow for blow" in which the two men exchanged punches.
Mr Bartley denied the charge, saying they had been "playing" and was found not guilty at Inner London Crown Court.
He explained they took turns to hit each other but each had no intention of seriously hurting the other man.
The court heard the men, who had known each other for 10 years, had both taken cocaine.
They were among 30 adults, teenagers and children attending a 16th birthday party at a house in Erith, south-east London.
Mr Bartley said that after being punched twice by Mr Main, he took his turn and struck him in the chest.
He told the jury: "Basically he (Mr Main) said 'ah, I felt that', looked at me, laughed and then collapsed."
Mr Bartley said he thought Mr Main had just lost his breath until he started turning blue and people began trying to resuscitate him.
The formal cause of death was given as cardiac arrest following blunt chest impact and the presence of cocaine and alcohol.
Mr Bartley told police he had "hardly touched him", adding in court: "The punch that I threw, I never thought it would do something like that, him collapsing."
