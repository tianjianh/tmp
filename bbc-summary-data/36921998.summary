It's thought to have been made by an Abelisaurus, a predator that lived around 80 million years ago.
These massive creatures once roamed South America, according to palaeontologist Sebastian Apesteguia.
The print was found by a tourist guide in Maragua, a place well known for dinosaur tracks.
Other dino remains have also been found in the area.
