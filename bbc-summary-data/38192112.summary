[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-0 Queens Park Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham secured their first win since August with a 1-0 victory over QPR in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isaiah Brown's first-half goal handed the division's bottom side just their second three points of the season.
The breakthrough came in the 24th-minute when Brown, a Chelsea loanee, collected Danny Ward's ball to surge through the QPR defence and fire home.
Millers' goalkeeper Lewis Price kept his side ahead, before Joe Newell should have killed the game off.
Rotherham's first victory in 112 days moves them to within eight points of Wigan, and 10 points off safety.
It was a thoroughly deserved win for caretaker boss Paul Warne's side as they created a host of chances and kept only their second clean sheet of the season.
Ian Holloway's QPR, who have now won just one of their last seven league matches in the Championship, fall to 18th place in the table and sit just three points off the drop zone.
Rotherham caretaker manager Paul Warne: "It's a better feeling, winning. For them to win gives me great pride, they left nothing on there, they should be proud of themselves.
"They are buzzing like we have won a cup final. I want good, proper, football players and they are a group of lads that have got a bit closer and I think that was shown in the performance.
"I think you could see at the final whistle how much it meant to everyone.
"It would have helped my heart rate no end if we would have got a second but it was nice to get the win."
QPR manager Ian Holloway: "It is very, very disappointing, but we have to take the positives.
"A goal has changed the course of the game, it gave them a lift and they held on to it far easier than I would have liked. I saw too many shoulders drop.
"It's early days to get what I want, unfortunately it's not going for them.
"When I look back at that I can't believe we didn't take a point. I am far more encouraged than I ever have been, I believe in what we are doing, these results are impostors."
