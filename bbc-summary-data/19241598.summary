Here are some of the events taking place around the country.
Celebrations took place in Henley-on-Thames to mark the achievements of Team GB's rowers, including members of the Leander Club.

A Victorian act of Parliament was used to give a quick go-ahead to the family of double Olympic gold medal cyclist Laura Trottto hold a street party in her honour in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.

But officials learned they could use the 1847 Town Police Clauses Act which allows "thronging on the highway".
At least 200 people attended the private street party to welcome Trott home.
"It's amazing, I'm so glad so many people came out. It's mad, I can't believe it," she said.
Royal Mail said a postbox in Lymington, Hampshire, would be repainted gold in honour of four-time Olympic gold medallistBen Ainslie.

A trio of Team GB rowers showed off their medals during a day of celebrations in Coleraine.
Brothers Richard and Peter Chambers took silver in the lightweight fours, while Alan Campbell won bronze in the single sculls.

The pair, who fought for Team Ireland - not Team GB - arrived back at Dublin airport on Monday and were honoured at a reception at Titanic Belfast in the evening.
Given that if Yorkshire was a country it would have been 12th in the medal-winners' table, it is hardly surprising it hosted some of the first homecoming celebrations.
About 5,000 people attended an event to mark the achievements of Leeds' Olympic athletes - including triathlon stars Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, silver-medal cyclist Lizzie Armitstead and Nicola Adams, who made history as the first ever Olympic women's boxing champion - at Millennium Square.
