Ciarán Maxwell: Full list of charges
Mr Maxwell - who is originally from Larne, County Antrim, but now lives in England - has previously pleaded not guilty to bank card fraud and intent to supply cannabis.
He has not yet been asked to enter a plea on the terrorism charge.
The 30-year-old was arrested in Somerset on 24 August following searches in Larne, County Antrim, and Devon.
His arrest was understood to be connected to two arms dumps found in County Antrim this year, and came after a long-running investigation involving the Security Service (MI5), the PSNI, South West Counter-Terrorism Unit and Scotland Yard's Counter-Terrorism Unit.
