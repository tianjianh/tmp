A Swansea-based company has received a record fine of £570,000 for "coercing clients" into making payment protection insurance (PPI) claims.

Rock Law Ltd left "vulnerable people at risk of being exploited", Claims Management Regulator (CMR) said.
In December 2014, the UK government introduced fines for firms who breach the regulator's rules of conduct.
Companies can be fined up to 20% of their annual turnover and have their trading licence suspended or removed.
CMR is a unit of the Ministry of Justice that regulates companies that offer a service for people hoping to claim compensation.
Head of CMR Kevin Rousell said: "Our investigation showed that Rock Law Ltd were taking unauthorised payments which meant vulnerable people were at risk of being exploited.
"The size of this record fine demonstrates how seriously we take protecting the public from this exploitation."
The regulator added that the fine was a record and the second to be issued in as many months.
