What looked like a normal wedding ceremony soon turned special when Frank Gregoire surprised his bride Simran Malhotra with his rendition of popular Bollywood love song Kyunki Tum Hi Ho  (Only you are there) on their wedding day.
Ms Malhotra, who is of Indian origin, burst into tears when Mr Gregoire sang the love song after several days of "secret" rehearsals to perfect it.
A few days later, a video of Frank's performance went viral on several social media platforms with millions of shares and likes. (It currently has 4.3million views on YouTube)
"I never thought in a million years that this [the video] would get this much attention," Mr Gregoire told the BBC.
Ms Malhotra said she was "still trying to believe this beautiful act of love was done for me".
"I know Frank loves singing but never would I have imagined that he would learn a Hindi song and sing it to me at our wedding. When I first heard him sing, I just felt like I was in 'shock'. There are no words to describe how I felt in that moment and truthfully it is probably one of those feelings I will never experience again," she said.
She confessed to being surprised that so many people liked the video on social media, but added that "love is pure, it's organic. Love causes us to laugh, other times it causes us to cry".
In a more unusual consequence of the wedding, Mr Gregoire has been getting multiple requests to sing for other people's weddings, something he says he has been "completely humbled" by.
"I'm sure Simran will have many requests now that she knows I am willing to learn Hindi songs," he said.
Ms Malhotra is also looking forward to Mr Gregoire possibly making a debut performance at a wedding in India.
"We have a lot of cousins in India. So hopefully we will be invited to a wedding soon," she said.
Apart from a possible alternate career as wedding singers, the couple have plans to use their newfound fame as social media stars to urge people to "show some love".
They have urged people to make a video or take a selfie with their loved ones and share their stories on social media.
"We challenge the world to make a headline news story of love and a positive message that takes precedence over all the hate, war, crime, and negativity showcased in the world," Mr Gregoire said.
