Court issues warrant for ex-Celtic player Islam Feruz

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A warrant has been issued for former Celtic footballer Islam Feruz after he failed to turn up for a court appearance in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old had been due to go on trial for allegedly driving an Â£80,000 Porsche while banned.
He has also been accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice and driving without insurance.
At Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court, it was said Mr Feruz was in training in Tanzania.
Sheriff Frances McCartney issued a warrant for his arrest.
The Somalia-born player joined Celtic as a 10-year-old. The club had successfully campaigned for him and his family to be allowed to stay in Scotland.
He moved to Chelsea six years later and has had loan spells with a number of clubs, including Hibs.
