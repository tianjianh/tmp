The video shows how a new 5km section of the new M8, between Shawhead and Baillieston, is taking shape.
It also shows 5km of new pedestrian and cycle routes running alongside the route, which is due to be completed by spring 2017.
The drone footage also shows other upgrade work to the M73 and M74.
The £500m project aims to upgrade central Scotland's busy motorways and significantly reduce congestion.
It has been estimated that the road improvements could reduce the average daily car commute between Glasgow and Edinburgh by 20 minutes.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: "This drone footage provides the public with a unique perspective of these major construction works that are currently under way to improve the connection between Glasgow and Edinburgh, but are largely out of sight to road users on the existing A8.
"The significant progress achieved is clear to see, and, as we enter the final phase of works along the A8 corridor, I hope the public can be reassured that, once complete, the benefits will far outweigh the current disruption.
"I'd like to thank road users for their patience to date and would ask that they bear with us during this final push to complete the M8 missing link."
