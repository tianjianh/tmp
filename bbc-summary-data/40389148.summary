Camden Council says residents in 161 flats in the Taplow block, one of five towers on the Chalcots estate, will be moved for "urgent fire safety works".
Similar cladding was used on the building to that on the Grenfell Tower.
A total of 79 people are feared dead after the Grenfell fire.
Camden Council had said it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the estate.
The council said it would carry out regular fire safety patrols and safety checks to reassure residents.
Council leader Georgia Gould said: "Camden Council is absolutely determined to ensure that our residents are safe and we have promised them that we will work with them, continue to act swiftly and be open and transparent."
She said London Fire Brigade had completed a joint inspection of the blocks with Camden Council technical experts.
"Together we decided the Taplow block needed to be temporarily decanted while we undertake urgent fire safety works so that residents can be fully assured of their safety. This means that we need to move residents from their homes and into temporary accommodation."
Ms Gould said the work is expected to take three to four weeks.
The announcement came as the Metropolitan Police said the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests.
Detectives say manslaughter, health and safety, and fire safety charges will be considered as part of their investigation.
A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests.
The Department for Communities and Local Government said 14 residential high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas have now been found with cladding that raises safety concerns.
