Unbeaten Donegal fighter Jason Quigley clinched the North American Boxing Federation middleweight title to earn his 13th straight win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Quigley earned a unanimous points win over Glen Tapia after a tough contest in California.
The Ballybofey man, a silver medallist at the world amateur championships in 2013, earned a 100-90, 99-91, 98-92 verdict in Indio.
However, he was given a tough test by former world title contender Tapia, 27.
Quigley was well on top in the opening two rounds as he wobbled the American before Tapia started to produce good work of his own midway through the contest.
Tapia landed a big uppercut on the Irishman in the fifth round but Quigley regained control in the closing rounds to take a dominant win on the judges' cards.
The Donegal fighter, whose career is being steered by Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions, is currently ranked 10th by the World Boxing Association.
