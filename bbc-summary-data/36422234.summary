Former Gloucestershire seamer Fuller added to his two overnight wickets either side of a rain-delayed lunch.
Jimmy Adams (78) offered some Hampshire resistance in the follow-on before James Franklin trapped him lbw.
Middlesex's first win of the season saw them secure maximum points and move up to fourth in Division One.
Hampshire resumed overnight on 100-4 after a rain-affected third day at Merchant Taylors' School, still 237 runs shy of making Middlesex bat again.
County Championship debutant Joe Weatherley was bowled by Toby Roland-Jones after just nine runs had been added.
Wicket-keeper Adam Wheater (25) and Adams added 53 for the sixth wicket, but victory was firmly in sight for Middlesex as three wickets then fell without a run scored.
Ryan McLaren struck five boundaries in an unbeaten 33 before James Tomlinson edged Ollie Rayner to slip.
Middlesex captain Adam Voges told BBC Radio London:
"I think we've played a brilliant four days of cricket. Set up well by our batters on day one and then the bowlers have done a fantastic job really.
"It was a bit of punt to bat first under the skies we had, but seeing the scores and talking to the guys from last year, they felt that batting first was the right option.
"We were able to set up what became a really good first innings total.
"I think we've been playing some really good cricket in the last couple of weeks and as a bowling unit, that's probably the best we've been this season.
"It always felt like a result like this was coming. We've been frustrated a bit by the weather this season, but it's nice to get a win finally."
Hampshire stand-in captain Will Smith told BBC Radio Solent:
"I thought after day one, we didn't do too badly. I know the outcome wasn't ideal, but we acquitted ourselves pretty well with the ball.
"We were perhaps a shade unlucky as well. The sun was out when they batted and then it's been cloudy and a lot more bowler-friendly since that.
"On the flip side, the first session on day two we've let them get away. Then the way we've batted, against what was a very high-skilled, resolute and relentless attack really was below par.
"It's the right result absolutely. It's good we've got a break now before our next four-day game to give us a look and review a few things to make sure this doesn't happen again."
