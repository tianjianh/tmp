East Kilbride come from behind to seal play-off draw at Buckie Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Kilbride battled back to draw 2-2 at Buckie Thistle in the League Two play-off semi-final first leg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Highland League champions took the lead through Chris Angus and he was then downed in the box by Fabio Capuano for a penalty that Sam Urquhart scored.
Paul Woods pulled one back for the Lowland League champions before half time and Russell McLean squared it with a header seven minutes from time.
The return leg will be played at K Park on 6 May.
The hosts had made a bright start to the first leg thanks to Angus' goal but EK showed their threat soon after when Sean Winter rattled the bar with a fine shot. Joao Victoria fired the rebound goalwards but Buckie keeper Daniel Bell made a good stop.
Following Urquhart's spot-kick and Woods' close-range finish, Buckie had a great chance to make it 3-1 but Kevin Fraser was unable to connect at the back post.
That proved costly as McLean rose to meet a long throw and seal a draw for the visitors.
The winner of this tie will play the side finishing bottom of League Two in the play-off final, with the victor of that contest earning a spot in the SPFL League Two for next season.
