Hants were bowled out for 423, in reply to Surrey's 637-7 declared, after Lewis McManus (132*) and Brad Wheal took their 10th-wicket stand to 96 runs.
The hosts, forced to follow-on, lost regular wickets but looked comfortable on 198-6 with 10 overs left in the day.
But Gareth Batty (6-51) and Stuart Meaker (4-40) took the last four wickets for three runs to seal victory.
McManus and Wheal added 25 to Hampshire's overnight total of 398-9 at the Ageas Bowl before Wheal was run out before lunch, leaving Hampshire 214 runs behind.
With only Ryan McLaren (59) offering real resistance with the bat in the follow-on, Hampshire slumped to 121-6.
McManus and Gareth Berg looked to have steadied the ship but Surrey skipper Batty trapped the former lbw for 35 and had Gareth Andrew caught in the slips three balls later.
Meaker then finished off the innings, removing Berg (38) lbw before Mason Crane was caught behind for a duck.
Surrey's second County Championship win of the season moves them up to seventh in the table, 10 points ahead of Nottinghamshire and 23 ahead of bottom side Hampshire, who have a game in hand.
Hampshire acting captain Will Smith told BBC Radio Solent:
"The story of four-day cricket is you've got to get over the line, whether you're fighting to win or draw the game.
"It's been shown here over the last couple of years that you've got to go hard right to the very end.
"That's the sign of a good game of cricket that you have four days of hard fought cricket and it goes right down to the last session.
"We're obviously bitterly disappointed that we couldn't get over the line and get those extra five points. They're obviously crucial in our situation."
Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
"It was a flat wicket and the young fella, McManus, for Hampshire made it incredibly hard.
"He's one for the future, obviously, but for us to get over the line was a monumental effort from the fast bowlers, from the fielders, everybody - it was very hard graft for the 200-odd overs we fielded for.
"The boys were brilliant, they looked after each other throughout. Everybody, to a man, was magnificent, doing the little things that go unnoticed.
"We've got a wonderful coach, some wonderful people behind us and I think we've got some good cricketers. We'll got from strength to strength with this."
