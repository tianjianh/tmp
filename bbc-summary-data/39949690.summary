Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes has praised Daryl Mitchell's contribution in securing a home semi-final in the One-Day Cup.

Former captain Mitchell hit 67 from 71 balls in a five-wicket win over Derbyshire on Tuesday, taking him past 3,000 runs in List A cricket.
"He has proved his worth as a fantastic one-day player," Rhodes told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"He is very resilient and always pops up with performances."
Worcestershire finished top of the North Group and will play the winner of the South Group play-off in the last four on 16 or 17 June at New Road.
Mitchell, 33, was relived of his role as Worcestershire captain at the end of last season, after six years in the job and replaced by Joe Leach.
But he responded in fine style in the One-Day Cup, with both bat and ball, hitting half-centuries against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire and taking 3-38 against Durham on Sunday.
"He missed out at the start of the campaign and Moeen [Ali] was playing," Rhodes said.
"But since he's come back in he's had three scores of over 50 and also took wickets the other day. He's done a marvellous job."
