Michael Onyema Ezenagu, 28, of White City, London, was due on trial at Bristol Crown Court but admitted two charges of ill-treating a patient.
He and the 10 other defendants were originally detained after secret filming by the BBC's Panorama at Winterbourne View, near Bristol.
The other defendants pleaded guilty at previous hearings.
Judge Neil Ford said they would all be sentenced at the same time, but this would not take place for at least three weeks.
