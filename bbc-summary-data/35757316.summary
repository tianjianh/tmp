The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil to tour Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A classic Scottish play revived last year at Dundee Rep Theatre will tour in the autumn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil tells the story of the Scotland's history, from the Highland clearances to the arrival of oil.
The production will once again be performed in Dundee before embarking on a Scottish tour visiting Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Glasgow.
It will be the first professional tour of the play in over 20 years.
The play, which was written by John McGrath, was first performed by the 7:84 Scotland group at the "What Kind of Scotland?" conference in Edinburgh in March 1973.
Last year, Dundee Rep Ensemble was granted permission to present it in a professional production for the first time in over two decades.
Director Joe Douglas said: "Directing The Cheviot has never been anything but a terrifying honour.
"Dundee was jumping when we performed the play last year and we're very excited to take the Ensemble out on the road.
"McGrath's philosophy was that the audience must have 'a good night out' and that's something that we aim to ignite across the country."
Dundee Rep Theatre chief executive Nick Parr said: "The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil was a huge success in Dundee last year.
"I am delighted that we can share this outstanding and timely production in Dundee again and also across Scotland.
"John's script is as powerfully relevant today as it was 40-odd years ago."
The play will run at the Rep from 31 August until 10 September.
It will then visit the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh, His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, Eden Court Theatre, Inverness and the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, until 22 October.
