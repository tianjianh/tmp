The 74-year-old Welsh singer and The Voice judge, famous for hits like Delilah, It's Not Unusual and Sex Bomb, will take to the stage at Great Tew Park, Oxfordshire in July.
Organiser Hugh Phillimore said: "We had a long, long negotiation with Sir Tom and finally he's coming to join us, so we are very excited about that."
Also on the bill are Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, Lulu and Razorlight.
Other acts include The Fratellis, Blue, Billy Ocean and Chas & Dave.
Mr Phillimore added: "It's been an ambition of ours for a long time to get Tom on board.
"I started negotiating the line-up in August for my dream team."
Cornbury Festival, which is in its 12th year, takes place from 10 to 12 July.
