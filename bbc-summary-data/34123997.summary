Chuka Umunna: 'We must support our new leader'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour's Chuka Umunna has urged his party to unite around its new leader, in an apparent offer of reconciliation with left-wing leadership candidate Jeremy Corbyn.

Mr Umunna said the party should not "simply dismiss out of hand those who hold critical views of New Labour".
He added "solidarity is key" and the party must "accept the result".
But asked whether he would serve under Mr Corbyn, he said he had "misgivings" about many of his policies.
A new grouping of moderate party figures, including Mr Umunna, will meet for the first time next week.
This new group, called Labour for the Common Good, will meet when MPs return to Westminster, and is being jointly led by Mr Umunna and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Umunna was "at pains to claim this group will not be a faction; a party within a party with the immediate aim of toppling Ed Miliband's successor".
In a speech to centre-left think tank Policy Network, Mr Umunna said his party must support "our new leader in developing an agenda that can return Labour to office".
Jeremy Corbyn, the bookmakers' favourite, is up against Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall in the leadership contest, with the winner due to be announced on 12 September.
Mr Umunna, who withdrew from the contest in its early stages, acknowledged Islington North MP Mr Corbyn had enthused many who had previously been turned off by the party.
"Over half a million people are now members, supporters or affiliated supporters of our party, with hundreds of thousands joining in the last few weeks," he said.
"Some have joined in order to thwart the pursuit of Labour values but many more have joined to further the pursuit of those values, including lots of young people.
"At a time when so many are walking away from centre-left parties across the Western world, and many young people do not vote let alone join a party, this is surely something to celebrate.
"It is vital that we embrace our new joiners and harness their energy," he added.
But Mr Umunna said he disagreed with Mr Corbyn on a range of issues, such as his support for national insurance tax rises, greater public ownership and a downsizing of Nato, while he also had concerns over his stance on EU membership.
Asked if he would remain in the shadow cabinet if Mr Corbyn won, the shadow business secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that it would "completely depend on the programme" he was asked to endorse.
"If one was asked to adopt all of those positions, I would find it difficult. But you don't only contribute by serving in a shadow cabinet."
Whoever was elected leader, he suggested, would have to adopt policies "around which a degree of consensus" could be formed.
Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show, Mr Burnham said he respected the "positive" energy that Mr Corbyn had brought to the campaign although he disagreed with him on many things.
He also said he would not stand for the leadership again if he lost, saying it was "now or never" for him.
