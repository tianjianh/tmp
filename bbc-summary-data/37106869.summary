Chris Todd: Eastleigh sack manager four games into new season

Eastleigh have parted company with manager Chris Todd just four games into the new National League campaign.

The 34-year-old becomes the first managerial departure in the top five divisions in England this season.
The Spitfires took four points from their first two league games, but have since suffered back-to-back defeats.
Todd took charge at Ten Acres in September last year, initially on an interim basis, and led the club to seventh place in the table last season.
The former Exeter and Torquay defender's departure came only 12 days into the new campaign, almost three weeks earlier than last season's first sacking in the top five tiers, when Dave Robertson was dismissed by Peterborough on 6 September.
"We might have thrown Chris in at the deep end too quickly," Eastleigh chairman Stewart Donald told BBC Radio Solent.
"The gut instinct is it is a big job and we need a more experienced manager. This season is only four games in, but we haven't started well. I thought I'd act early and get someone new in with fresh ideas."
Former Barnet, Dagenham and Wycombe striker Ben Strevens has been asked to take training and could be in charge of the team at Wrexham on Saturday, but Donald aims to move "pretty quickly" to appoint a new boss.
"I would be very surprised if we didn't have a manager in place for Saturday," Donald added.
"We have identified two or three people, but they have got to want to come. We are confident we can sell them the vision we have."
