He has agreed a three-year deal but has immediately been sent out on a two-year loan to German side Werder Bremen.
Zhang, 20, made his international debut in June 2016, scoring twice against Trinidad and Tobago.
"His progress will be the subject of great interest here at Albion but also in Germany and in China," said Albion technical director Richard Garlick.
