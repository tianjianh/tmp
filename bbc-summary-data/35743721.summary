A caller to BBC Radio Oxford, who lives in Chinnor, said: "The whole place shook - it was more than a wind and rattled the windows."
People also took to social media to post comments after experiencing the late-night movement.
Anna Edwards tweeted: "Earthquake or explosion? Something moved n S Oxon. Felt in Chinnor & Thame."
Chris White tweeted: "Bucks earth quake? We felt it, house shook, low noise!"
Emily Smith also posted: "Magnitude 2.3 earthquake in Bucks last night, that explains the house shaking then."
The BGS said the quake was one of about a dozen felt in the UK each year.
Mr Ford said: "Old geological faults still get activated by the stresses which are put on them from the major fault lines we have, and every now and again these pressures are released with a small earthquake."
He added: "It was a very small earthquake, but in UK terms it was significant as it was actually felt by the general public - 90% of earthquakes go completely unnoticed."
