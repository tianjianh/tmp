Transfer window in numbers: Man Utd & rivals break records

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A busy transfer deadline day capped a record summer of spending in the Premier League.

Manchester United's £59.7m signing of Angel Di Maria was one of six club transfer records broken since the end of last season.
What were the other big deals? With the help of financial analysts Deloitte, BBC Sport takes you through the transfer window in numbers.
Di Maria, 26, cost a British record £59.7m from Real Madrid, while Radamel Falcao, 28, joined in a £6m loan deal from Monaco - with the club having the option to sign him for £43.5m next summer.
Louis van Gaal, named as manager this summer, has rebuilt a squad that finished seventh last season under David Moyes, their first campaign since Alex Ferguson retired as manager.
The Dutchman has already spent more than any English club in a transfer window - Manchester United's previous record outlay had been in the summer of 2007 when they parted with £62m.

Their transfer extravaganza beats that of Manchester City's reported £148m in 2009 and Chelsea's £111m in 2003 - which followed billionaire owner Roman Abramovich's arrival.
Rob Wilson, a football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport: "United don't really want to be out of the Champions League for another year - they can cope with a year out - it's no big deal - but a second or even a third outside of that competition will hit them very hard.
"Their new shirt sponsorship deal is effectively performance-related - obviously attracting players in the future if they remain out of that competition will become more difficult.
"United certainly won't be spending the same amount next year if they don't qualify for the Champions League this season. At a rough estimate, they are losing £80-100m by not being in the Champions League - £40m in prize money, £10m in terms of matchday ticket sales and matchday sponsors, and so on."
The record amount of money spent by the 20 Premier League sides this summer. This comes after the clubs pocketed their first season of vastly increased TV money. Last year was the start of a three-year domestic TV deal with Sky and BT worth £3.018bn, a 70% increase on the old deal.
In fact, the previous record of £630m - set last summer - was broken this year on 14 August - before a ball had been kicked.
Dan Jones, partner at Deloitte's Sport Business Group, believes the 2014 World Cup in Brazil also helped to swell the figures.
He said: "There are a number of factors contributing to this summer's spend, including the showcase for global talent a World Cup provides.
"However, one of the main drivers of Premier League spending continues to be the increased resources clubs now have as a result of improved broadcast deals."
Football agent Rachel Anderson said: "Is the spending reckless? It depends how you look at it. If you compare the spending to normal people in normal life then, yes, it is reckless.
"But if you compare it to blockbuster movies or a singer from a TV reality show who can't sing very well, then it is worth it.
"It is worth it for the  entertainment they produce."
Liverpool joined Manchester United in spending more than £100m, thanks in part to their £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the third biggest transfer ever.
Their outlays totalled £117m, with almost £50m going to Southampton for Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert.
Chelsea did their business early, paying £91.3m in total on deals including Diego Costa and Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid and Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas.
Arsenal followed up last year's dramatic £42.4m signing of Mesut Ozil by spending £82m in the window, with two big-name strikers coming in - Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez for £35m and Manchester United's Danny Welbeck for £16m.
Manchester City bought £50m worth of players and Southampton about £58m (although they received £92m for sales). Newcastle and Hull - also the busiest team on deadline day with four signings - spent more than £30m each.
The four Premier League clubs in this season's Champions League had a combined transfer spend of £342m - over 40% of the total Premier League outlay. Add in Manchester United's 18% and that is almost 60% by a quarter of the teams in the English top flight.
Six of the 20 Premier League clubs made their record signings this summer - Manchester United, Everton, Hull, Leicester, West Brom and Crystal Palace.
Dan Jones, partner at Deloitte's Sport Business Group, said: "Last season the average Premier League club received around £25m more in central broadcast distributions than they did in 2012-13, which helped fuel a record transfer window last summer.
"We are again seeing Premier League clubs use these resources to contribute to what is a new record this summer."
Almost two thirds of the money spent by Premier League clubs this season has gone to foreign teams, with £305m staying in England. The figure of 63% is considerably lower than last year, however, when 78% of the total spend went abroad.
Luis Suarez joined Barcelona from Liverpool for £75m, but English teams were busy buying some of the best that Spanish football has to offer.
BBC World Service's Steve Crossman said: "It's the second season in a row that the single most expensive deal in the summer transfer window has seen a player leave the Premier League for La Liga.
"At least it's a two-way street. The top three clubs in Spain all lost a major player to the Premier League over the summer. Angel Di Maria was the most expensive import, with Diego Costa and Alexis Sanchez also arriving.
"And the emphasis on recruitment from abroad is not reserved to the Premier League and La Liga either. Many of the big signings in Italy, France and Germany have not come from their own leagues, with the likes of Ciro Immobile swapping Serie A for the Bundesliga, Alvaro Morata heading to Italy from Spain and Xabi Alonso arriving in Germany from Real Madrid."
The top spending league in Europe outside the Premier League spent just over half the amount of the 20 English sides, with La Liga leading the way for the continent with a total outlay of £425m.
Next was Italy's Serie A with £260m, followed by the German Bundesliga with £250m and France's Ligue 1 - with Paris St-Germain and Monaco cutting back with Uefa's Financial Fair Play rules in mind - spending £100m.
BBC World Service's Steve Crossman said: "The Premier League swept all before it and only Spain could even come close. Both Ligue 1 and Serie A held back this year. In France, PSG and Monaco spent 75% less money than this time last year.

"In La Liga the top three spenders in Spain were ahead of the Premier League's three most adventurous clubs in summer transfer window spending until Falcao's transfer to Manchester United took the Premier League elite back above them.
"The likes of Mario Mandzukic, James Rodriguez and Luis Suarez have all arrived with massive price tags.
"Likewise, in Germany the vast majority of it was forked out by a small number of teams. In this case, two.
"Some £81m of the total bill came from the efforts of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. Add in the £20m outlay from Hamburg and you've got nearly half of the activity coming from only three of the clubs."
From next season, spending could again rise. A new Champions League television deal comes in worth £897m over three years, worth more than double the current arrangement.
But it is not just the top teams in the Premier League who will have spending power.
Stats published by Sporting Intelligence show that last season's bottom side in the Premier League, Cardiff City, earned £62m in Premier League prize and TV money - more than the previous season's champions Manchester United pocketed.
The top four sides last season all earned between £90m and £100m. There are still two years left of this lucrative deal.
Rob Wilson, football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, does not believe spending will continue to increase.
He said: "Over the last three or four years there has been an acceleration in the amount of money spent in each transfer window.
"There is a lot of talk about whether we'll reach £1bn worth of spending in the next one. I think that is probably bit of a stretch, the reason being Uefa's Financial Fair Play and the impact that will undoubtedly have on the top six or eight teams.
"The truth is that if you removed Manchester United's spending then in this transfer window you would be looking at something we'd consider normal - well, normal in the most liberal sense of word because I don't think spending £600m can be considered normal."
