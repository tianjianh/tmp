Birmingham boss Gianfranco Zola says an argument between several players after the draw at Rotherham was "normal".

Full-back Emilio Nsue had to be held back from team-mate Ryan Shotton as the pair clashed at the end of Blues' post-match warm-down.
Birmingham's draw with relegated Rotherham left them four points above the Championship relegation zone.
"Things like this happen everywhere, even with teams in a better position," Zola told BBC WM.
Zola, who has won just two of his 23 games in charge since replacing Gary Rowett as Blues boss in December, also denied reports that damage had been done to a dressing room at the New York Stadium.
"There have been some discussions obviously, strong discussions. I can guarantee you they happen everywhere," the Italian added.
"It is not a problem. Sometimes it is good to come out strong and have a strong discussion."
