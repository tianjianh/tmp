Baby born in toilet 'could have been saved' from sepsis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A baby who was born in a toilet and later died of sepsis could have survived if he had been given antibiotics, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlie Jermyn died in May, about 30 hours after he was born in his parents' toilet in Penryn, Cornwall.
Microbiologist Dr James Gray told the inquest in Truro that Charlie had shown some signs of illness but he was not sent to hospital for treatment.
Sepsis happens when the body's immune system goes into overdrive.

Charlie's parents went to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro on 8 May when Hayley Jermyn was heavily pregnant.
The couple were worried the baby would arrive quickly like one of their other children.
Mrs Jermyn was assessed by midwife Jane Calvin, who said the mum-to-be was "not in established labour" when she examined her five hours after arriving.
"She came in at 22:00 and by the time I got to examine her at 03:00, in all that time nothing had changed," she said.
Ms Calvin told the inquest there was "no sign of infection anywhere" and "I advised her to go home and get some rest".
Hours later Charlie was born at home but he died of sepsis on 10 May.
Dr Gray said: "If Charlie had been in hospital at a time when, or soon after, he first showed clinical signs of early-onset sepsis he would have received intravenous antibiotics at least 12 hours, and maybe more than 15 hours, before he died.
"In my opinion, he would, on balance of probability, have survived in such circumstances."
However, Dr Gray said he it was "impossible to say" what condition Charlie might have been left in if he had survived, for example he might have been left with brain damage.
He added that the form of Streptococcal infection Charlie had was "a very serious condition and has a high mortality rate".
The inquest continues.
