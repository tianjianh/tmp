Darren McInally admits assault and possessing a machine gun

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was caught with a sub-machine gun after police were called to a disturbance with his partner, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren McInally, 28, pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to possessing the gun and ammunition.
He also admitted assaulting his partner Hazel King, 22, at her cottage in Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, last November.
McInally faces a minimum of five years in jail when he is sentenced next month.
The court heard that McInally had turned up at Ms King's home and started yelling abuse at her as well as accusing her of being unfaithful.
Prosecutor Angela Gray told the court the accused had refused to leave Ms King's home. He grabbed her, threw her onto a sofa, brandished a bottle at her and left her fearing she was going to be hit.
Police were called and traced McInally to his father's home in Neilston, Renfrewshire, where they found a loaded Scorpion sub-machine gun in the boot of his Audi car.
McInally's DNA was later found on the weapon and the ammunition.
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 8 April at the High Court in Edinburgh.
