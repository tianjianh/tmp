Lincolnshire wind turbines: No Windfarm at Gayton protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners fighting the erection of eight wind turbines in Lincolnshire have taken part in a protest march ahead of a public inquiry.

No Windfarm at Gayton (NOWAG) and East Lindsey District Council both oppose the planning application.
The protest march on Sunday morning raised money for legal costs as well as highlighting the campaign.
The developers say wind turbines contribute to renewable energy targets and help combat climate change.
But campaigner Melvin Grosvenor, who is working with NOWAG, questioned how efficiently the turbines would generate energy.
"It's a huge price for Lincolnshire to pay to host a suspect technology," he said.
"The developers say we need renewable energy, but at what cost to the landscape?"
Earlier this year Lincolnshire County Council issued a statement advising district councils not to grant planning permission if wind farms fail to meet strict criteria.
The council's leader, Martin Hill, said he did not want Lincolnshire to be "covered by a forest of the things".
Mr Grosvenor said wind turbines have more of a visual impact in Lincolnshire because the landscape is relatively flat.
"The issue we've got with Lincolnshire is because it's predominantly big open skies there are few visual detractors, and of course you've got the Lincolnshire Wolds [an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]," he said.
About 60 campaigners walked from near Theddlethorpe Church to Great Carlton, and many were sponsored.
They walked along a bridleway known as the Two Mile Bank, where the turbines would be erected.
The campaigners also flew a blimp at about 377ft (115m) to demonstrate the maximum height of the turbines.
There are already wind farms at Gayton le Marsh and Theddlethorpe, and Mr Grosvenor said the proposed turbines would "give the impression of a continuous line of turbines on the landscape."
The public inquiry is due to begin in January and the government will decide whether permission is granted or not.
Developer EnergieKontor said on its consultation website: "The UK is the windiest country in Europe and the deployment of wind farms could contribute significantly to renewable energy targets which aim to assist in combating climate change."
