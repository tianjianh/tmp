An Edinburgh mother has told how "touched" she was after a mystery donor left money on her car windscreen towards a parking ticket she received while in hospital with her son.

Mairi Holden had parked in Sylvan Place so she could rush her son, Oscar, 4, who was having difficulty breathing, to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
She had not thought she was staying the night when she parked on Wednesday.
When the 35-year-old returned to her car on Thursday she had two tickets.
However, when she looked closer, underneath the tickets was a note, which read "Pay it then forget it happened!" with Â£25.
Ms Holden, from Restalrig, told the BBC Scotland news website how she was "overwhelmed" by the "random act of kindness".
She said: "I drove home in a daze when I found the money and note.
"I was so shocked someone could have done that and I just hope I can find them so I can thank them.
"It was just so lovely and kind."
Ms Holden, a lifestyle coach, has now doubled the mystery person's donation and used it to set up a Just Giving page for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.
She said: "I thought I would set up a Just Giving page so the mystery person can see that their random act of kindness can snowball and to show how much it helped.
"I really hope I can find this beautiful person who did this for me.
"I'm still overwhelmed at the kindness of it. I'll never forget it, and if anyone has any idea of who it could have been, or recognises the writing or note paper, please let me know, I'd love to be able to thank them."
Ms Holden said the money was left on the windscreen of her pink Honda Jazz.
An Edinburgh city council spokeswoman said: "Anyone is entitled to appeal a parking ticket, and we do take a sympathetic view of those fines incurred as a result of a medical emergency and other extenuating circumstances."
