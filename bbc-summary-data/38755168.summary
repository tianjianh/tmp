Worth the risk?

Ready for takeoff? As the prime minister boards the RAF Voyager today for her first visit to the United States she faces a massive opportunity but is also taking a risk.

It is a coup to be the first international leader into the Trump White House. Whatever you make of the new American president, only Theresa May's most ardent critics would suggest that she shouldn't be meeting him.
Why wouldn't you want the most powerful politician in the world as an ally?
The relationship between the US and the UK though is always a special source of neuralgia for British leaders.
David Cameron's team was almost embarrassingly pleased with the images of him and Barack Obama turning the sausages and burgers on the barbecue in the Number 10 garden.
Look how cool David is! He's grilling alongside a really popular and glamorous President! Michelle and Samantha are doing the salads together! It's just like they are friends!
And Gordon Brown's team sank to particular levels of frustration and despair when the press got wind of a meeting their man was forced to have in a kitchen in New York when the White House didn't find time and space for a formal meeting.
A snub to meet among the ketchup bottles, to chat over the pastrami.
And now? Theresa May is walking into a meeting with the most unorthodox president in decades, a man who today she will flatter, calling for the US and UK to "lead together again" as he starts to "renew his nation".
A man who has found huge popularity among millions of voters precisely because he doesn't care for politician norms.
But also a man with whom Theresa May disagrees overtly on a very long list of issues, whose views millions of other voters are deeply worried about, who has just suggested he might support torture as president.
The prime minister believes that she can draw on the relationship and traditions between our two countries to talk frankly to President Trump, to disagree as well as discuss.
Her aides say "she's not scared of anyone" and that the potential advantages of getting closer to the United States are well worth the risks of accusations of cosying up to a president who is not afraid of offending anyone - who has even made it a trademark.
They say the tone will be "business like". We are not going to see the president and the prime minister high fiving at the basketball.
We 're not going to see Philip May and Melania Trump popping off to hug American schoolchildren.
But as prime ministers know, visits like this are never entirely in their control. The unpredictability of Donald Trump means means this time the special relationship could be a special headache.
