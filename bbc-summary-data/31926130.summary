[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work on the A487 Caernarfon to Bontnewydd Bypass project could get under way next year.
The 10km (6 mile) route is earmarked to run between the Goat roundabout (A499/A487 junction) and Plas Menai roundabout.
Plans for the bypass have long been mooted with proposals proving controversial.
The first exhibition takes place at Caernarfon's Celtic Royal Hotel on Tuesday until 20:00 GMT.
Others will be held at The Old School, Bontnewydd, on Wednesday, 10:00-20:00 GMT, and the Chapel Centre, Caeathro, on Thursday, 10:00-17:00 GMT.
