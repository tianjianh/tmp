Rio 2016: Hurdler Rhys Williams hard done by Olympics omission, says Colin Jackson

Rhys Williams has reason to feel aggrieved about his omission from Team GB's squad for the Rio Olympics, says former 110m hurdles world record holder Colin Jackson.

The Welsh 400m hurdler, 32, met the Olympic qualifying time in May, but failed to win automatic Rio selection at the British Championships.
The 2012 Olympian failed in his appeal against the decision.
"I'm pretty disappointed he hasn't been selected," Jackson told BBC Sport.
"I think what he's capable of is under 49 seconds - I truly believe that - and if you can get under 49 seconds, you can be in the final."
A British Athletics statement explained that because Williams was only eligible in round four of the organisation's selection process, the "selection panel would need to believe he would win a medal in Rio or at a future Olympic Games" in order for him to be included.
Williams has never won an Olympic medal, but did claim gold at the 2012 European Championships.
Asked if Williams could feel hard done by, Jackson said: "I think so. I have really mixed emotions with that [British Athletics' stance]. Sometimes it feels like they favour some athletes over others.
"They say Rhys may not be able to do it [win a medal], but I know Rhys had a really good, consistent winter and he's put a lot of time and effort in there and has no injuries.
"He's always scrapping for that great result he's capable of, and when you've had the winter preparation he has, he's more than capable of doing that.
"You just never know what you can do when you go to a major championship. It's not like he won't get through the first round - he's likely to get through to the semi. And when you get through to the semi, anything can happen."
Williams, who received a four-month ban for doping in 2014, had previously spoken of his belief that he could be selected for Rio.
But he was left out of the squad after missing out on a place in the top two at the British Championships in June and finishing fifth at the European Championships in July.
Seren Bundy-Davies was the only Welsh track and field athlete named in Great Britain's team for the Olympics when it was announced on Wednesday.
It means Wales will have just one athletics competitor at an Olympics for the first time since the 1952 Helsinki Games.
