Rovers, currently sixth in the National League, are keen to address a run of three draws which has seen them drop two points adrift of a play-off place.
Fenwick, 25, has scored 12 goals in 49 games for Pools since moving from non-league side Dunston in November 2014.
He is in contention to make an immediate debut in Friday's game at home against Lincoln City.
"Scott is someone we have kept a close eye on this season," said Tranmere manager Gary Brabin. "He is a strong lad, a willing runner and has an eye for goal."
Fenwick's arrival comes within 24 hours of another Rovers striker Jonny Margetts being allowed out on loan to relegation-threatened National League neighbours Southport.
