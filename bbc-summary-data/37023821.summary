The 35-year-old joined from Middlesex ahead of the 2015 campaign.
Berg has taken nine wickets in five County Championship games this year and was the club's leading wicket-taker in the One-Day Cup, with 11.
"An extension is great but we need to make sure we stay in Division One," the South African told BBC Radio Solent.
