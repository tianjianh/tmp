Mark Wood (4-25) turned the game for Durham with four wickets, including England team-mates Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance in the same over.
Adam Lyth's 64 was in vain as Yorkshire finished on 149-9 with Durham seamer Chris Rushworth also claiming 3-19.
Ben Stokes earlier struck 56 off 36 balls for Durham to help them to 156-6.
Yorkshire looked well placed in the chase at 86-3 after Rushworth had removed Joe Root and David Willey cheaply.
But Wood, who clocked above 90mph regularly, was rewarded for a superb spell when he yorked Bairstow and then had Ballance superbly caught second ball by Paul Collingwood at leg-slip.
Opener Lyth took the target down to 37 required off 22 balls, but cut the impressive Rushworth to Mark Stoneman at point.
His departure left the Vikings' lower order with too much to do, Wood returning to dismiss Liam Plunkett and Tim Bresnan in the 19th over.
Durham, whose innings was interrupted by rain three times, looked to have posted a below-par total despite some lusty blows from England all-rounder Stokes as Plunkett bowled tightly to finish with 2-22.
But Wood outshone everyone on the pitch to finish with his best Twenty20 figures and send Durham to their first ever final.
