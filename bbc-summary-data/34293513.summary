A campaign has been launched to raise £100,000 to restore chapels at a Cardiff cemetery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chapels at the Grade II listed Cathays Cemetery need the work and cash-strapped Cardiff council hopes people can help.
A £37,000 target has been set for the first phase of work to restore the Episcopalian chapel.
Cabinet Member for Environment Bob Derbyshire said money was "tight" but "even small donations soon add up".
