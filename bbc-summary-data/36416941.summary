The Pre-TT Classic races act as the curtain raiser for racing on the Mountain Course and feature bikes made before 1972.
The Yorkshire racer won the Superbike Post Classic, 850cc Classic and Geoff Duke Junior Superbike races on Monday.
In the final race he broke the lap record four times.
His quickest lap for the 4.25-mile circuit, in the south of the island, was an average speed of 104.55 mph.
"Not a bad day in the office," he said. "Three wins and a new lap record."
Coward later recorded a lap of 122.5 mph in practice for the TT on the Mountain Course.
Eddie Wright and Kieran Clarke won both sidecar races with Alan Oversby, Ewan Hamilton and Rob Mitchel-Hill also claiming wins.
