A new version, adapted by Duncan Gates, has its world premiere at the Old Red Lion Theatre in December.
Set on a stormy night, the story sees a couple abandon their car and seek refuge in a crumbling mansion.
The novel was adapted into a film version called The Old Dark House - starring Boris Karloff - in 1932.
"Benighted was my father's second novel which was totally unlike his first novel, Adam in Moonshine, and indeed unlike anything he wrote later," said Priestley's son, Tom.
"It will be fascinating to see how it now translates for the stage, a new and very different medium. Of course the blend of characters will be as written but the setting must be adapted for the theatre."
Author and playwright Priestley, who died in 1984, is best known for works including An Inspector Calls - which returns to London's West End this November - Dangerous Corner, Time And The Conways and When We Are Married.
