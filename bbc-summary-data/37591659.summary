Scotland will only accept win - Lithuania boss Edgaras Jankauskas

Lithuania coach Edgaras Jankauskas says Scotland will accept nothing other than a victory against his team in Saturday's World Cup qualifier.

Lithuania arrive at Hampden Park having lost all four of their previous games in Scotland and failing to win any of their past 11 away matches.
"All the facts are against us," said Jankauskas, a former Hearts striker.
"We accept that we are not favourites, but all good and bad runs have to end at some point."
The 41-year-old added: "I am not too concerned a lot about the stats, the facts. What bothers me more is my team - the way we approach the game, the way we face such a strong, physical team as Scotland.
"The last few games gives us a good feeling, a good reason to build on that, to be positive [and] to have more confidence in ourselves. That's important before such a big game.
"I have no doubt that Scotland will have a go at us and the only result they would accept is victory."
Jankauskas, who had a brief spell in charge of Lithuanian side Trakai in 2014 before taking on the national job this year, has guided his team to successive draws against Poland and Slovenia.
And he says the first half of Scotland's game in Malta - where the score was 1-1 at half-time before Gordon Strachan's side ran out 5-1 winners as the hosts were reduced to nine men - "gives us a little hope".
"When Malta [had] all players on the pitch, they were defending quite well," added Jankauskas.
"We know how strong [Scotland] are. We know that we have to put in a very good performance to match the Scottish team.
"We have a very united squad and that is our main force - the unity."
