[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston North End 1-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegated Rotherham United maintained their improved late-season form with a draw against top-half side Preston North End at Deepdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Richard Smallwood scored his first goal for the club in over a year to put them in front on nine minutes with a left-foot shot from outside the box into the bottom right corner.
But Stevie May levelled on 41 minutes, with an effort into the top corner.
Rotherham have now picked up five points from their past four matches.
But this was only their second point in 23 away league games throughout the entire campaign.
Had they lost, they would have set a new record for the most defeats in a second-tier season but, going into next Sunday's final game at home to Derby, they currently share that with Wimbledon, who also lost 33 times in the 2003-04 season.
They still need to conceded three more goals to become the first team to concede 100+ goals in a season at this level since Stockport County in 2001-02.
Preston's point betters their tally of 62 from last season, when they finished 11th, which is where they again currently stand ahead of 7 May's trip to face Wolves at Molineux.
Preston boss Simon Grayson:
"We wanted to get that feel-good vibe back and put the last few results behind us, so it wasn't the best way to finish the home season, but we can still be very proud of what we have done.
"We are very close to getting more points than last year, we've scored more goals, we are on course to finish higher positionally and that was always the aim.
"I'm a little bit disappointed with the performance because we have had some really good ones against some good teams, we have played some free-flowing football and we wanted to produce a performance for the supporters today.
"But we started too slowly, we didn't ask question of Rotherham and it was a little bit predictable and ponderous."
Rotherham boss Paul Warne:
"The lads stuck to the game plan really well, we defended resolutely to the last minute.
"Back to front I thought we were great. We got on top with a great goal from Richie and their goal was a wonder strike and that is what it has taken to get past us.
"A few games ago I told the lads to use this as a mini-season and I think their standards in all of those games has been excellent.
"I am pretty proud of what the lads have put in and I think there are green shoots for next season, so I am a proud manager."
