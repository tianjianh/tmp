[SN]TITLE[SN]
Housing impact on Welsh language communities call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning decisions should fully account for their likely impact on the Welsh language, opposition AMs have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows claims that major housing schemes could dilute the Welsh-speaking character of certain communities.
Montgomeryshire Tory AM Russell George said there was a "golden opportunity to enshrine the importance of the Welsh language" in council decisions.
The Welsh government said "all practical suggestions" to bring this about would be considered.
Liberal Democrat AM William Powell and Plaid Cymru member Llyr Huws Gruffydd have also backed the call.
The Planning Bill will be debated in the assembly on Tuesday.
