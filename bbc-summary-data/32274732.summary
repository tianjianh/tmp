They were flagged down just before midnight on Saturday near the block of flats in Roland Gardens, Chelsea.
London Fire Brigade said it was called to an apartment on the second floor, but the fire had already been put out.
The man was taken to hospital, but his condition is not believed to be serious.
Four officers were also treated for smoke inhalation but they have since returned to duty.
Insp Chris Downs said: "These officers acted with great courage. Their quick thinking and heroic actions in entering a burning flat and rescuing the occupant have averted a potentially lethal situation."
