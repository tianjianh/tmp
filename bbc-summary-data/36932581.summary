Joel Richards, from Wednesbury, died alongside uncle Adrian Evans, grandfather Patrick Evans and 35 others in terror attacks near Sousse in 2015.
The Birmingham County FA announced the Joel Richards Legacy Fund - a bursary for young coaches, referees and volunteers - at an event in his honour.
Joel's family also attended the event.
Joel's mother Suzanne Richards said: "Joel was all about grassroots sport and getting young people into sport, whether it was coaching, refereeing or just playing football.
"It's just nice to feel that Joel's still helping the community, even though he's not here to actually do it himself."
Joel, who studied at the University of Worcester and was a passionate Walsall fan, would have been 21 on 3 August, and had planned to get into coaching in the US after finishing his degree.
The Joel Richards Legacy Fund will be available to anyone in the Birmingham area, between the ages of 12 and 25, who need financial support to help them get involved with football.
Joel's friend Kirsty Dixon, chairman of Birmingham Country FA's youth council, said the fund will continue his legacy as "an amazing role model" for young people involved with football.
"Joel dedicated his time to support as many people as possible, and always knew how to put a smile on your face," she said.
"We hope to continue the support he personally provided through the fund, which will benefit many - especially those who need some support to kick-start or help them on their own football journey."
