A Dutch artist has unveiled an exhibit which features a million photos that were uploaded to Flickr, Facebook and Google over a 24 hour period.

Erik Kessels said he wanted to demonstrate how internet users are bombarded with images on a daily basis.
The Photography In Abundance installation is part of the What's Next display at Foam Amsterdam.
"The idea was to present it as a sea of images that can you drown in," Kessels told the BBC News website.
Visitors are being encouraged to walk over the mountain of photographs and pick them up, which Kessels said could leave visitors feeling strange as "you're walking over personal memories".
Kessels only downloaded and printed the photos that were free for people to look at on the internet.
"We consume images so fast nowadays, that I was wondering what it would look like if you physically printed off all the images that became available in a 24 hour period," he said.
"When you're downloading them and you have one million images on a server, that's not impressive but when you print them out and put them all in one space, that's when it really overwhelms you."
The artist said he hopes the installation also shows people "how public your private photos have become".
He added: "Before, you had your photo album and only your family and friends could look at. Now people all over the world can look at it if they find it."
The artwork was created as part of Foam's 10th anniversary.
Jefferson Hack, Alison Nordstrom and Lauren Cornell have also provided installations for the What's Next exhibition, exploring the theme of the future of photography.
