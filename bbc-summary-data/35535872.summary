The properties in Bolton have suffered due to drainage problems in nearby land owned by water company United Utilities, and broken culverts under the ground.
The problems first began during the deluge that hit many parts of the region over Christmas.
United Utilities has apologised to the residents and repairs are under way.
Stuart Flinders from BBC North West Tonight reports.
