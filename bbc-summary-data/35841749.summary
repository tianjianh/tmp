Ross County have paraded the League Cup for supporters after winning the trophy in the club's first appearance in the competition's final.

The Staggies beat Hibernian 2-1 at Hampden in Glasgow last Sunday.
The parade started from County's stadium in Dingwall following the team's game against derby rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Inverness are the holders of the Scottish Cup but were knocked out of this season's competition by Hibs.
The Edinburgh side beat Caley Thistle 2-1 in Inverness on Wednesday.
But Ross County failed to notch up a win in the derby game ahead of the parade, losing 3-0 to their Highland rivals.
An open-top bus took the team and the cup from the stadium around the Highland town before returning to the football ground.
Club spokesman David O'Connor said: "The messages of congratulations have been overwhelming since the victory over Hibernian and the procession on Saturday evening will allow all sections of our support and the community to join in the celebrations.
"There will be many photo opportunities but safety will be a priority and well-wishers are asked to consider their safety and that of others on the night."
