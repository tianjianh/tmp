[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Hamish Marshall ton in vain as Kent beat Gloucestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamish Marshall's third Championship century of the season was not enough to save Gloucestershire from an innings defeat by Kent in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Needing 312 in their second innings to make Kent bat again, Gloucestershire were bowled out for 243 on day four.
Marshall (118) was the ninth wicket to fall, while no other batsman passed 25.
Kent are now 24 points behind Division Two leaders Essex with three games left to play, while Gloucestershire's slim hopes of promotion appear to be over.
