Tackling bullies 'top priority' for Welsh children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tackling bullies was the top priority for the majority of children aged seven to 18 who took part in a survey aimed at giving youngsters in Wales a voice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The top priority for three to seven-year-olds was more places to play.
The What Next? consultation was initiated by the Children's Commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland.
It is one of the largest consultations of its kind, involving more than 7,000 children.
Other priorities raised in the consultation were: better protection from violence and abuse in the home; more timely support on mental health and emotional well-being issues; less poverty; and safer local areas.
The results will inform the commissioner's priorities for the next three years.
Ms Holland said: "The consultation included many groups who often don't get a chance to take part in large surveys like this: very young children, and those not in school because they are in hospital, in custody or homeless.
"Wales will be stronger if all of its citizens get the chance to play their part."
