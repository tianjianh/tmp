Parts of Scotland could offer the best views of the International Space Station (ISS) following UK astronaut Tim Peake's arrival on it, weather forecasters have said.

The station passes the UK twice on Tuesday, first late in the afternoon and then again in the evening.
BBC Weather said north west Scotland could potentially have skies clear enough to catch glimpses of it.
US space agency Nasa provides timings on when ISS comes into view from Earth.
The station appears as a bright star-like object.
On Tuesday, Mr Peake will head off on his six-month mission on-board the station.
He is set to launch aboard a Russian rocket with fellow crew members Tim Kopra and Yuri Malenchenko.
