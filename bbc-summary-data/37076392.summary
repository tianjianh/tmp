The 35-year-old  spent the 2006-07 season in Scotland with Dunfermline before joining Swansea, where he worked under Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers.
After four years in South Wales, he moved on to Wolves and has been at Forest for the past three seasons.
Rodgers has already indicated De Vries will provide competition for current Celtic number one Craig Gordon.
"I need a goalkeeper who, when we have possession, we have 11 players," Rodgers explained after Celtic's 2-0 friendly defeat by Inter Milan in Limerick on Saturday.
"I need someone who can distribute the ball and pass it. Dorus is as good as I've seen at that in all my travels.
"He comes into what is already a good number of keepers here and his game is perfectly suited to how I want to work.  He's there to push Craig."
