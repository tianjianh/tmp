[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 0-2 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood recorded their first victory against Southend as goals from Chris Long and Ashley Hunter handed Uwe Rosler's side a straightforward win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fleetwood, who had not beaten the Shrimpers in six previous attempts, were largely untroubled by their hosts and should have won by a more comfortable margin.
Town broke the deadlock in the 18th minute when Long collected Amari'i Bell's pass forward and drilled a low, 25-yard shot into the bottom-left-hand corner of the net.
Eggert Jonsson's header from a corner was then headed off the goal-line by Southend full-back Jason Demetriou before Nathan Pond headed another corner just inches wide of the left post.
After the break, the lively Devante Cole fired inches over from 20 yards after robbing Ben Coker of the ball before the striker saw another effort parried away by Southend goalkeeper Mark Oxley.
Hunter's goalbound effort was cleared to safety by Coker but Fleetwood sealed a comfortable win in the 77th minute when Hunter netted from a narrow angle after being played the ball by James Ryan.
