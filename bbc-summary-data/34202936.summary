Kim Davis, jailed in gay marriage row, delays return to work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Kentucky clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses has said she "needs time to rest" before she returns to work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kim Davis, an elected official, has said that her Christian faith should exempt her from signing the licences.
She was released from jail on Tuesday the under the condition she not interfere with her deputies as they issue licences.
The US Supreme Court declared gay marriage legal in June.
According to her lawyers, Ms Davis will return to her work on Friday or Monday.
Ms Davis and her lawyers would not say whether she would comply with federal Judge David Bunning's conditions. If she does not, she could be jailed again.
After she was released, Ms Davis was greeted by thousands of cheering supporters who gathered outside the Carter County Detention Center.
Ms Davis has become a heroine among conservative Christians who view marriage as only between a man and a woman.
Her case has also become an issue in the Republican presidential campaign with several candidates - including former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Texas Senator Ted Cruz - championing her cause.
Two federal courts and the US Supreme Court have ruled against Ms Davis after she repeatedly refused to issue marriage licences since June.
Ms Davis, a Democrat who serves Rowan County, a rural area in eastern Kentucky, was found in contempt of court on Thursday and jailed.
Because Ms Davis is an elected official, she cannot be fired. She could be impeached by the Kentucky legislature, but the body is not in session.
