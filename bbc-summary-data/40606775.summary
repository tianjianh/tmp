A journalist in a news conference said Sam Querrey was the first US player to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since 2009 after beating Murray on Wednesday.
The Briton corrected him by replying "male player", as Williams alone has won 12 Grand Slams in that period.
"That is who he is and what we love about him," said American Williams, 35.
The world number four set an open-era record of 23 career Grand Slam titles when she defeated sister Venus in the final of the Australian Open in January.
Williams announced in April she will miss the remainder of the season as she will give birth in the autumn.
She told ESPN show The Six: "I do not think there is a woman player who is not totally supportive of Andy Murray.
"He has spoken up for women's issues and women's rights, especially in tennis, forever. He has done it again.
"He has such a wonderful mother, who has been such a strong figure in his life and he has done so much for us on our tour. We love Andy Murray."
The world number one's mother Judy told BBC Sport: "Andy is a great advocate for women's tennis. Having had female coaches for most of his formative years has helped as well. But he does his bit to help the girls."
