[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of campaigners have marched through Stoke-on-Trent in a bid to stop a council from demolishing a toilet block.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the North Staffs Pensioners Convention and the British Toilets Association held the protest.
Stoke-on-Trent City Council has said it will replace Hanley's Crown Bank toilets with new, free, staffed ones in or near its indoor market.
The plans are part of a set of Â£10m improvements.
Barry Brockbank, from the council, said: "We carried out detailed consultation on the proposed work and had more than 100 responses.
"We're committed to listening and acting on the views of residents, and the majority of responses to the consultation were positive."
