Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says his side must still believe they can reach the League Two play-offs.

The Grecians lost 3-2 at home to Mansfield Town on Tuesday to slip to 10th place, five points off the play-off places with three games left.
"We have to believe we can do it. There's no reason why we can't," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"When you look at the last 10 games there's no reason why we can't win our last three," he added.
Exeter were unbeaten in their previous 10 games, winning six of them, as they moved to within two points of the play-off spots before the Mansfield loss.
But that defeat, coupled with Cambridge's 7-0 win over Morecambe, Wimbledon's victory at Dagenham & Redbridge and Wycombe's goalless draw with Yeovil, compounded Exeter's poor position.
"It's an increasingly difficult situation and we've just got to move on and try to get our minds very much focused on Bristol Rovers on Saturday," said Tisdale.
"We have three games to go and we have to concentrate on those and see what happens.
"Anything's possible, it's one of those leagues. Teams you think will win will lose and vice versa. We've just got to stay with it and you never know."
