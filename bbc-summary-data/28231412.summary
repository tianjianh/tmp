It will look into the "book building" process used ahead of a share sale to gauge investor demand, and whether this could be improved.
Former City minister Lord Myners will lead the review.
It comes ahead of a select committee report on the Royal Mail sale which is expected to be critical.
The review will look at recent UK private and public sector stock market listings which have seen significant rises or falls in share trading prices following flotation.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said the review would help him to "assess whether changes are needed to the current system government operates for the sale of its assets".

Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary said: "By announcing this inquiry, the Government is admitting what everyone else has known for months - that its privatisation was a first-class short-changing of the taxpayer.
"Taxpayers have been short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds while large City investors, who were placed at the front of the queue by ministers, have been laughing all the way to the bank at the public's expense."
