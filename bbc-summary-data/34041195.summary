Chasing an unlikely 413 to win, and beginning the fifth day on 72-2, the hosts collapsed to 134 all out.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took 5-42 and leg-spinner Amit Mishra 3-29, while Dimuth Karunaratne made 46.
India's victory levels the three-match series at 1-1, with the two teams meeting again in Colombo on Friday.
Sangakkara, 37, was dismissed for 18 on the fourth evening at the P Sara Oval, leaving him with 12,400 Test runs at an average of 57.40.
He retires as Sri Lanka's highest run-scorer, and the fifth highest overall in Test history.
