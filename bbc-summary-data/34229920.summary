In a tight first half, Tom Hooper nearly opened the scoring for the Iron but his driven shot was saved by keeper Josh Lillis.
After the visitors' Kevin Van Veen hit the crossbar, Joe Bunney's drive put the home side ahead.
Murray Wallace's header equalised for Scunthorpe but Vincenti rifled home to seal the win for Rochdale.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I think performances get forgotten about. It was important that we responded as a team to last week (losing at Burton) because last week was a psychological disappointment in the manner that we didn't perform.
"If we perform well and we lose games, you remain confident.
"Last week we went too far away from our DNA and our template of the way we want to play, it's taken a lot of rescuing this week."
Scunthorpe boss Mark Robins told BBC Radio Humberside:

"There was nothing in the game really between the two teams. I think we defended pretty well and they've defended pretty well and restricted play to the middle third of the pitch.
"We've hit the bar, we've had some good attempts on goal, we've scored a goal from a corner and we've done ok. It's come down to defending a cross in the final five minutes of the game which is disappointing.
"We've got to dust ourselves down, get on with things and prepare for the game next week away at Southend and can we get our first away win there."
