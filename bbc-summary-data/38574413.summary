[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wood Group has secured a five-year deal to continue providing engineering and project management services to Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil firm Saudi Aramco.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Aberdeen-based oil services company said the multi-million dollar framework agreement involved onshore capital programmes.
The contract also includes three one-year extension options.
The services will be supported by Wood Group's office in Al Khobar.
Wood Group first won a contract to provide general engineering services for Saudi Aramco in 2010.
Dave Stewart, from Wood Group, said: "This contract renewal demonstrates Wood Group's proven technical and engineering capabilities in working with Saudi Aramco to deliver projects and modifications, automation and control, pipeline and industrial engineering over the last five years."
In 2015, Wood Group was awarded an offshore contract with Saudi Aramco for greenfield and brownfield engineering services, procurement and construction management support for new facilities in the Arabian Gulf.
