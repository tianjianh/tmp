Doyle clocked 54.53 seconds to beat Bahrain's Kemi Adekoya into second.
Reigning Commonwealth champion Kaliese Spencer of Jamaica finished third.
Doyle, 29, is hoping to compete at her second Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer, having failed to make the final in London.
The European champion, formerly known as Eilidh Child, was competing under her married name for the first time.
In the women's 800m, South Africa's Caster Semenya was victorious in a time of 1 minute 58.26 seconds - the fastest in the world this year.
It was a first Diamond League victory since 2011 for Semenya, who was subjected to gender testing after winning gold at the 2009 World Championships.
