Tributes have been paid to former Mactaggart & Mickel chairman Derek Mickel, who has died while on holiday in the Canary Islands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood Mr Mickel, 79, drowned while swimming at Fuerteventura on Saturday.
Mr Mickel served as chairman of the Glasgow-based housebuilder for eight years up until 2012.
His son Andrew, a fourth-generation family member, is group director of the company.
A spokesman for Mactaggart & Mickel and the Mickel family said it was "with great sadness" that his death had been confirmed.
He added: "Mr Mickel was a prominent Scottish businessman, having joined the housebuilder as a third-generation family member in 1961, becoming a director in 1966 and serving as chairman of Mactaggart & Mickel for eight years up to 2012. He continued to be a director of the business.
"There will most likely be a post-mortem given the sudden nature of his death, therefore no further details are available at this time.
"The family would request for a period of privacy and respect to be observed at this time."
