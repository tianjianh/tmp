[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who arranged for a 14-year-old girl to be taken from a Lincolnshire children's home to London for sex has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billal Amin sent a taxi to collect the teenager and her 15-year-old friend and take them to a hotel in East London.
The two girls were given alcohol before the 14-year-old performed a sex act on Amin and had sex with another man.
Amin was jailed for 12 years and put on the sex offenders' register for life at Lincoln Crown Court.
Martin Hurst, prosecuting, said after the assaults Amin took a taxi with the girls telling them they were going to his home.
When they left the taxi Amin disappeared abandoning the girls in London in the middle of the night.
The court was told they sought help and police were contacted resulting in an investigation that led to Amin's arrest.
The inquiry revealed two months earlier Amin had met the girl in London when she had also performed a sex act on him.
Jailing him for 12 years, Judge Simon Hirst said he acted "disgracefully".
He told him: "Abandoning a 14-year-old girl in London in the middle of the night beggars belief."
Amin denied a charge of trafficking for sexual exploitation in March 2013 and two charges of sexual activity with a child but was convicted by a jury on a 10 to two majority.
He was cleared of a further charge of trafficking for sexual exploitation.
The 33-year-old, of Lea Bridge Road, Leyton, was also given an indefinite sexual harm prevention order banning him from having contact with any child under 16.
