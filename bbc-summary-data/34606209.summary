[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster produced a strong finish to send defending champions Glasgow crashing to a third defeat in their five Pro12 matches this season.

The Warriors led 13-6 at the break, Zander Fagerson going over for a try with Duncan Weir and Leinster's Fergus McFadden kicking two penalties apiece.
Luke McGrath and Taqele Naiyaravoro swapped tries in the third quarter.
With winger Naiyaravoro sin-binned, Leinster edged ahead with a penalty try and McFadden landed a late penalty.
The visitors, boosted by six returning Scotland internationals and seeking a first away win over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, with a multi-phase attack that finished with the 19-year-old prop Fagerson muscling over from close range.
Weir's conversion was quickly followed by McFadden's first successful penalty.
A second right-sided kick from the winger closed the gap to one by the 21st minute, rewarding Aaron Dundon for a well-won ruck penalty and accurate line-out throw in the build-up.
Weir then punished Leinster for collapsing an advancing maul, punching over a fine 43-metre strike.
He repeated the trick from the opposite left wing as Mike McCarthy infringed at a maul six minutes before the interval.
Leinster missed a chance to close out the first half with a third penalty, McFadden wobbling an injury-time effort wide after Pat MacArthur saw yellow for a 'reckless' forearm-led tackle that ended Dundon's involvement in the game.
The home side made their numerical advantage count on the resumption.
Scrum-half McGrath's blindside switch led to Garry Ringrose racing up the right touchline and following a bout of forward pressure, McGrath stretched over for McFadden to convert.
Leinster were only level for six minutes, the Scots hitting back with a terrific spell of attacking and a power-packed finish to the right of the posts by big Fijian Naiyaravoro.
But the hosts took the lead for the first time through the penalty try.
Replacement Isaac Boss exploited a gap and Isa Nacewa's well-weighted kick set up a foot race between McFadden and Naiyaravoro. The latter was deemed to have deliberately slapped the ball over the end-line as the pair lunged for the ball.
After consulting with the TMO, referee Ian Davies awarded the penalty try and sin-binned the Fijian, with McFadden's conversion splitting the sides on the scoreboard.
Leo Cullen's men saw out the result with McFadden nailing his third penalty of the night.
