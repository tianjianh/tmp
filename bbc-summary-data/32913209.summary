India's beef dilemma: to eat or not to eat?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
To eat beef or not to eat? This question may not generate much reaction in most parts of the world, but the situation is different in India, writes BBC Monitoring's Vikas Pandey.

Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP party came to power last year, the voices in favour of banning beef consumption have grown louder.
Two states, Haryana and Maharashtra, have already banned the sale and consumption of beef.
The question of faith appears to be at the heart of the problem.
Hindus, who comprise 80% of India's 1.2bn population, revere cows. But for the remaining 20%, that includes Muslims and Christians, beef is one of the cheapest source of nutritious meat.
It's a delicate situation. A complete ban on beef is likely to anger Muslims and Christians, but ignoring such calls can hurt BJP's political fortunes in their strongholds in Hindu-dominated states.
So it's not surprising that Mr Modi has largely been quiet on the subject, while fringe radical Hindu groups have been allowed to repeatedly call for a ban on beef.
But the situation changed this week when two cabinet colleagues of Mr Modi took pot shots at each other on the issue of beef consumption.
Federal Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi recently said that those who want to eat beef can "go to  Pakistan or some Arab country".
Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday rejected Mr Naqvi's demands.
"I eat beef, I'm from Arunachal Pradesh [in northrtheastern India], can somebody stop me? So let us not be touchy about somebody's practices," he reportedly said.
Mr Rijiju, however, later accused the media of distorting his statement.
"India is a secular country and food habits cannot be stopped but the Hindu faith and sentiments must be respected in Hindu majority states in the same way as other communities have rights in their own dominant states," he later clarified his statement.
A close look at the spat explains why this issue is not likely to be settled in the near future.
The politics of Mr Naqvi's party is rooted in Hindu-dominated northern states, but the beef-eating people are in majority in Mr Rijiju's state.
As an article in Scroll.com explains that the difference between "Mr Naqvi and Mr Rijiju is only in the form of majoritarianism each espouses. Naqvi is for brute majority. Rijiju is for local brute majority".
But should majority be allowed to always win in a democracy?
Many, including this article in the First Post website, feel that ensuring victory for majority groups is not what a secular India represents.
"This is really not about beef at all. It's about the kind of country we want India to be," it says.
So to eat or not to eat beef? As the debate suggests, there is no simple answer to this question.
