[SN]TITLE[SN]
Struck off university solicitor Rajesh Babajee hired in 'good faith'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberystwyth University has defended its appointment of a solicitor who was later struck off for being dishonest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rajesh Babajee, 46, was employed in "good faith" as a law lecturer at the university's Mauritius campus in September 2015.
He was investigated by the Solicitor's Regulation Authority after 12 allegations were made against him while working as a solicitor in London.
Mr Babajee was struck off the Roll of Solicitors in May 2016 and resigned.
The tribunal, which Mr Babajee did not attend, heard he had charged an "incredible and unrealistic" fee for conveyancing work and that he had acted dishonestly in misappropriating funds.
In a statement, Aberystwyth University said: "The university was not aware of the allegations until the tribunal's judgement was published in May 2016.
"It is our understanding that the confidential allegations were made to the SRA after he had been employed by Aberystwyth University Mauritius.
"The SRA only disclose information when they publish their findings."
