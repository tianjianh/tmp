[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kevin Pietersen's career in numbers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin Pietersen has been told that he is no longer part of the England Cricket team's plans, bringing his 10-year international career to an end.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We took a look back at some of Pietersen's key stats since his first one-day international.
His highest score of 227 against Australia, at Adelaide in 2010, was made in just 308 balls.
He leaves the national team as the all-time leading run-scorer across all formats. His total of 13,797 puts him ahead of Graeme Gooch (13,190) and Alec Stewart (13,140).

His final total of 23 Test centuries leaves him second only to Test captain Alastair Cook.
When you include his one-day centuries, he overtakes Cook and heads the list of hundreds made for England.

He scored 8,181 runs at an average of 47 in 104 Tests. Only six other players have played more Test matches for England.
He amassed a further 4,440 runs in 136 one-day internationals and 1,176 runs in 37 Twenty20s with his hard-hitting and improvisatory batting.
He is regarded by some as England's greatest player and by many more, who may not agree with that assessment, as the most entertaining.
