[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Funding concerns have delayed the signing of the new contract for Guernsey's bus services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Wednesday States members rejected amended proposals for the introduction of a width and emissions vehicle tax.
An Environment Department spokesman said signing the contract, due to take place on Friday, would be put off until a meeting with treasury next week.
Dai Powell, from preferred bidder CT Plus, said it would not cause issues.
He said: "We understand the position of the States and they have kept us informed during their process.
"Whilst obviously disappointed with the delay as we want to start moving things forward as soon as we can, a short delay in signing the contract will not have a material impact on the roll out of the new contract."
CT Plus is the current operator of the island's public bus services and some school bus services.
Its contract is due to finish on 31 March.
