The chairman of Derry City Football Club has said he has "serious concerns" that the redevelopment of the Brandywell stadium could be delayed by up to a year.

Brandywell is the home ground of Derry City Football Club.
Derry City FC Chairman Philip O'Doherty has blamed a council consultation project which has affected the start of the tendering process.
Work on a new pitch and dog track was due to begin at the end of October.
Mr O'Doherty said if work does not begin soon "it may be delayed until October 2016".
"Two weeks ago, Derry and Strabane Council received the final letter of offer, allowing work on the Brandywell project to begin," said Mr O'Doherty.
"We immediately met with council to request a programme of work so that we could discuss options with the FAI (Football Association of Ireland) to reschedule early home games in the 2016 season to later in the year to facilitate work on the pitch.
"Unfortunately, we have been informed that the tender process can't begin due to continued consultation on the project.
"We are concerned that should the work not begin this month, the start of this long overdue project would be delayed until October 2016 - a full 12 months.
"Derry City, other local football clubs, and the people of the Brandywell area, in particular, should not have to wait yet another year for this project to start."
He said the facility would be "highly beneficial to the community" due to the 3G pitch being able to be used almost continuously throughout the year.
Mr O'Doherty told BBC Radio Foyle that there are concerns that a one-year delay may result in some or all of the money being returned to Stormont.
"That would be disastrous," he said.
"Derry City FC will be left out of pocket if games are to be played, possibly in Ballybofey, with lower numbers attending our games. This will affect the budget for next season which will not help our challenging for European football.
"We are happy to pay the market price for use of this facility, along with the other users in the city, and we would urge council to start the work urgently."
A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said: "Elected members of the Health and Community Committee unanimously agreed to defer a decision to progress with the tender for the football stadium and 3G element of the council-owned Brandywell and Daisyfield Masterplan project.
"This is to allow for further consultation with the greyhound fraternity on proposals to ensure a new greyhound track is included in the plan.
"The matter will now come before members at next months meeting for consideration and decision."
