Two men have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and are in custody, said Thames Valley Police.
The fight, involving weapons and a number of men, was in Banbury, Oxfordshire, at about 19:45 on Friday.
The arrested men, aged 38 and 26, are both from Banbury. Police said it was a serious incident, but they believe there is no danger to the public.
There are road closures in place in Coopers Gate and Cope Road while officers investigate.
Det Insp Jon Capps urged anyone who saw a silver Volkswagen Passat in the area at the time to come forward.
He said: "This was a serious incident and we continue to investigate and there are a number of scene watches in place.
"We are keeping an open mind at this stage, but we do not believe that there is a wider danger to the public."
