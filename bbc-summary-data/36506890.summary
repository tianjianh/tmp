An elderly man hit by a bus in Oxford Street has died on the day safety campaigners staged a vigil highlighting the deaths of cyclists and pedestrians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bus driver involved in the collision with the 82-year-old was not arrested and is assisting police.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has previously announced he is looking into making Oxford Street a pedestrian-only zone.
He plans to reduce pollution and create a "tree-lined avenue from Tottenham Court Road to Marble Arch".
In Mr Khan's election manifesto, he said he wanted to start with car-free days before making the area fully pedestrianised.
The death on Friday of the 82-year-old man, who has not been named, came as campaigners mounted a vigil outside City Hall to highlight the deaths of 11 cyclists and pedestrians on London's roads in May.
