The hoard, dating back 3,000 years, includes three socketed axes and two spearheads discovered by Gareth Wileman while metal detecting in Trevethin.
It was described as a "significant" Bronze Age discovery.
A decorative late 16th or early 17th Century gold ring found in Cwmbran will also be on show at Pontypool Museum as part of Torfaen Treasure Day.
"The Trevethin hoard is a significant Bronze Age discovery in this area of Wales, where little was previously known," said Mark Lodwick, of the Portable Antiquities Scheme for Wales.
"The quick reporting by Gareth enabled us to carefully excavate the find-spot and ensured that we can now better understand these communities living in the Torfaen area 3,000 years ago."
The collection will be presented at an event at Pontypool Museum, opened by Lord Murphy, the former Torfaen MP and secretary of state for Wales.
The hoard has been bought with a grant from Museum Wales, via the Heritage Lottery Fund, to acquire archaeological objects discovered by members of the public for public museum collections across Wales.
