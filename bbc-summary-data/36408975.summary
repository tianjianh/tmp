The 24-year-old was wounded in an incident at  Milldale Crescent, Currynierin, on Saturday 21 May. He was taken to hospital, but later died.
At Requiem Mass, Father Michael Canny said the circumstances of his death were "heartbreaking".
"His life was cruelly cut short," he told mourners.
"That we are here in these circumstances is heart breaking and challenging."
There were emotional scenes among the hundreds of people  who packed into the church at Ardmore for the funeral Mass.
The cortÃ¨ge was flanked by members of Ardmore Gaelic Athletic Association and Nierin football club as it made its way from Mr Quinn's home in Currynierin.
Floral tributes spelling "brother" and "father" adorned the coffin and a floral tribute of Nierin FC rested on top of the hearse in the team's blue colours.
Addressing mourners at the funeral Mass in St Mary's Church, Ardmore, Fr Canny said the Quinn family had been "devastated and numbed" by his death.
"Your lives have been changed and will never be the same again," he told them.
"For the remainder of your natural lives, you will have to live with the reality of this life-changing event. It will not be easy; indeed you will have many difficult days," he said.
But he also called for forgiveness and appealed to the wider community not to act in any way that might bring further suffering.
Mr Quinn's twin brother was wounded in the incident, but he was later released from hospital.
A 16-year-old youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with Mr Quinn's murder.
