[SN]TITLE[SN]
Heart of Midlothian v Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts have injury doubts over Bjorn Johnsen, Don Cowie, Jamie Walker and Aaron Hughes ahead of their Premiership game with Ross County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Esmael Goncalves is suspended while Prince Buaben, John Souttar and Callum Paterson remain out.
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre is sweating on the fitness of defenders Jay McEveley and Paul Quinn.
Midfielders Christopher Routis, Ian McShane and Chris Burke definitely miss out.
Hearts defender Andraz Struna: "We always want to fight for the top of the table. That is good and we expect things from ourselves like this. We know recent results are not what we want now but we are trying to find a solution.
"It was a bad week but this is sport, we must get up and try to get out of this bad situation. We'll start by looking to get some positive things like a good performance on Wednesday.
"We know it will be hard. Nobody likes to be in a situation like this - but this is no time to look back. We must look forward and have faith."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "We've not been on the best of runs, we've lost our last three matches very narrowly by the odd goal. They all seem to be late goals too.
"So we're just looking to bounce back ourselves, both teams will be desperate to make up for some recent results.
"They haven't had the results they would have wanted recently but they still have really good players, guys who can hurt us, so we will have to be fully focused."
