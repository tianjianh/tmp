[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old, who also keeps wicket, spent two months in Bristol last season, scoring 192 Championship runs.
He has since played for Australia A, and scored two fifties for Western Australia in this season's one-day Matador Cup competition.
"I can't wait to get back over and score runs," Bancroft said.
"There's an excellent culture. We showed we can be really competitive in all forms."
Bancroft was a 2015 Test call up for the Australia side for the abandoned tour of Bangladesh, and made his international Twenty20 debut in January.
