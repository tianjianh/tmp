Family fury at Thomas Cook 'apology'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of two children who died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Corfu have criticised Thomas Cook for not apologising to them directly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokesman for the company said a letter of apology had been sent from chief executive Peter Frankhauser to Neil Shepherd and Sharon Wood.
However, Mr Shepherd and Mrs Wood said they had only been shown the letter by reporters.
Christi and Bobby Shepherd died while on holiday with their father in 2006.
In a statement, Mr Shepherd and Mrs Wood said: "We haven't had this so called letter of apology.
"Its not an apology for their wrong doing but a general offer of sympathy.  It does not address the central issue that their Safety Management System failed and it does not apologise for that."
The children's parents were responding to a Mail on Sunday report that suggested Thomas Cook received Â£3.5m in compensation for loss of profits and other expenses.
They said they had only received around a tenth of that figure.
