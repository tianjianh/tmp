Kyle Johnson, 15, was seriously injured and still has fragments of air rifle pellet lodged in his brain.
Steven Thompson, 39, admitted shooting the teenager in Sunderland in October and was jailed for 11 years and 10 months at Newcastle Crown Court.
"He won't make me feel like this forever," said Kyle.
He has lost most movement in the left side of his body and can only walk for short spells, using a wheelchair for longer distances.
"I have the fight and determination to make my life better, and I will," he said.
"I just want to get back to being my old self.  I will get there one day."
A court order preventing Kyle being identified has now been lifted by the judge, Northumbria Police said.
His mother Lindsy said is was "truly heart-breaking to see a once active young boy fighting to get his body and mind back to what it once was".
"He is inspirational and his determination is unbelievable," she said.
In March, Thompson, of Hewitt Avenue, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of an air rifle without a firearms certificate.
He had been angered by the noise of the bike, the court heard.
Det Insp Ed Small said Kyle was lucky to survive and had been "extremely brave throughout this investigation".
"No 15-year-old should have their freedom or dignity taken away from them in this way," he said.
