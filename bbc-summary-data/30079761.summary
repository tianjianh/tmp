A group of noisy students have had their games console, DVD player and surround sound speakers seized after weeks of complaints from residents.

Police and council officials raided the house in Fallowfield, south Manchester on Friday afternoon.
Neighbours complained the students would hold gaming sessions at full volume at 04:00 after returning from a night out.
The council said the students had "disregarded" a noise abatement order.
"Residents should not have to put up with noise until the early hours of the morning," said a council spokesman.
Police and council officials took a PS3, five Philips surround speakers, two laptop speakers, a Philips DVD player and Samsung television from the house in Brailsford Road, Fallowfield.
It is also believed they were using the console to play music as well.
A Manchester City Council spokesman said: "This seizure demonstrates that we take these concerns from residents very seriously and we work closely with the police and universities to take action against any households that cause problems for their neighbours.
"We started receiving complaints from people living near this house several weeks ago, and after issuing a noise abatement notice, they continued to disregard the impact their behaviour was having on their neighbours and we have now visited them to take their speakers and noise making equipment."
