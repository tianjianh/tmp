Porthcawl swimmers brave sea on Christmas Day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the UK's largest Christmas Day swims has taken place in Bridgend county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 52nd Porthcawl Christmas morning swim started at 11:45 GMT.
Last year, more than 900 people took part - breaking the event's record.
Organisers hope this year's event, which has an "All Things Christmas" theme and raises money for children's cancer charity Latch, has broken the record once more.
