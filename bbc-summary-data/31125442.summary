CCTV captured in Bartley Green, Birmingham, shows the victim being pulled into the road opposite her driveway.
West Midlands Police said she suffered a fractured finger and "significant bruising".
A 25-year-old man from Weoley Castle was arrested on suspicion of robbery.
He was released on police bail on Tuesday pending further inquiries, the force said.
The woman had parked outside her home in Kitwell Lane and left the keys in the ignition, police said.
In the footage, a man can be seen entering the car, causing the victim to run towards it.
She can be seen opening the driver's side door before the vehicle moves off, dragging her along with it.
Police said the car was recovered on 30 January, the day after the recording was made.
They said the car was being forensically examined and appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
