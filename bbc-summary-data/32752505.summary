[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A map has been published to show the worst roads for collisions involving wild animals in the New Forest.

Ponies, donkeys, pigs and cattle have roamed the national park for centuries but were hit by vehicles 138 times in 2014.
The map comes after reflective collars were fitted on ponies and a speed enforcement officer was employed.
Accident numbers have fallen from 182 in 2013 but the park authority does not want motorists to become complacent.
Out of the 138 accidents in 2014, more than a third took place on three roads in the Hampshire national park:
• B3078 from Cadnam to Godshill - 24 accidents
• B3054 from Hatchet Pond to Portmore - 16 accidents
• B3056 from Hatchet Pond to Lyndhurst - 13 accidents
The map also shows a cluster of accidents from Picket Post to Burley Street and by Bolton's Bench in Lyndhurst.
Forest organisations teamed up to set up traffic-calming measures, including a mobile speed camera that clocked 495 speed offences in March alone, on unfenced roads where animals can wander into the road.
Out of 9319 roaming animals in 2014, 68 were killed and 23 were injured. The rest of the 138 escaped uninjured.
Nigel Matthews, of the New Forest National Park Authority, said: "Local motorists should never assume that it won't happen to them.
"One day, that animal beside the road will step out at the last minute, so go slowly and give it a wide berth.
"Animals are on the road day and night, and unfortunately have no fear of cars."
