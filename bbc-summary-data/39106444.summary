Wagner sprinted to join his players in celebrating their late winner on 5 February before clashing with Monk.
He will be in the stands for the FA Cup replay at Manchester City and the home Championship game against Newcastle.
Monk has been given a one-match touchline ban and fined £3,000, while both clubs have been fined £10,000.
The Leeds boss, whose side are fourth in the Championship table, will serve his ban at Birmingham City on Saturday.
In a statement, the FA said Wagner admitted breaking the rules by going onto the pitch but had "denied a further breach that his behaviour upon his return to the vicinity of the technical area amounted to improper conduct".
The Terriers held Premier League Manchester City 0-0 in the FA Cup fifth round earlier this month and travel to Etihad Stadium on Wednesday for the replay.
They are currently third in the Championship table, four points ahead of Leeds and five points behind second-placed Newcastle, who travel to leaders Brighton on Tuesday.
