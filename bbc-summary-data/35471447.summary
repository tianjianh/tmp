British Transport Police (BTP) said about eight teenagers caused the disturbance between Larbert and Linlithgow on 23 January.
The men are believed to have been returning from East Stirlingshire's game against East Fife at Ochilview Park.
Officers said their behaviour resulted in the train being delayed.
The men, aged in their mid to late teens, travelled on the 17:28 Dunblane to Edinburgh service and left the train at Linlithgow station.
BTP said CCTV footage from the train and stations will be reviewed and appealed for witnesses to the incident.
