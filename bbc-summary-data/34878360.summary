Newcastle Falcons player Rob Hawkins has completed his first shift as a volunteer officer for Northumbria Police.
The 32-year-old hooker, who previously played for Bath and Leicester Tigers, said he is considering a career in the force when he retires from rugby.
Northumbria Police said they hope he will inspire others to volunteer.
Ch Insp Sarah Pitt, said: "We're really pleased that Rob has joined us as a special constable and we hope it encourages other people to think about getting involved.
"Our volunteers are a vital link between us and the communities we serve and we welcome the different skills they bring from their own professions."

SC Hawkins said: "I'm probably in my twilight years with my rugby career, so I'm starting to think heavily about the transition into the real world and I've always been interested in the police.
"Whilst I've got the opportunity to give it a whirl as a volunteer I decided to try it.
"I've played in front of 80,000 people before but I don't think I was as nervous then as I was starting my first shift.
"I've been getting a bit of a ribbing. I'm not looking forward to seeing a few of the boys in town when they've had a couple of jars as I'm sure they will probably try to steal my hat and other pranks, but I've told them they'll be in trouble."
