[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Peter Bazalgette, the man credited with bringing Big Brother to Britain, has been appointed as chairman of ITV.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He replaces Archie Norman, who has chaired the broadcaster since January 2010.
The former Endemol UK chairman is already a non-executive director at ITV and will take over from Mr Norman on 12 May.
In January, Sir Peter said he would step down as chairman of the Arts Council England in 2017.
The announcement sparked speculation that he may move to ITV after the FTSE 100 company said last month that Mr Norman would be leaving.
Sir Peter is also president of the Royal Television Society and has enjoyed a long career in broadcasting.
He began as a researcher on That's Life in the 1970s before establishing his own production company that was responsible for programmes including Ready Steady Cook and Ground Force. It was later sold to Endemol.
While at Endemol, Sir Peter brought the formats including Big Brother and Deal or No Deal to UK vierwers. He stepped down as its UK chairman in 2007.
Sir Peter said: "ITV has gone through a remarkable resurgence during Archie's chairmanship and there is still so much more that we can achieve.
"This is an incredibly exciting time for everyone in the media sector with change happening at an unprecedented rate, and I'm absolutely delighted to be working with Adam [Crozier] and the management team. TV is my first love."
Mr Norman said: "The last six years has been undoubtedly challenging but also extremely rewarding and enjoyable, and an experience I would not have missed for the world."
Shares in ITV fell 0.7% to 241.9p in morning trading in London. The stock has risen 180% over the past five years following Mr Crozier's appointment as chief executive.
