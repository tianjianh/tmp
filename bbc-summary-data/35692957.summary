[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milan 5-0 Alessandria (agg 6-0)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On-loan Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli scored as AC Milan cruised into the Coppa Italia final after an easy win over third-tier Alessandria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading 1-0 from the first leg, Milan scored three first-half goals through Jeremy Menez (2) and Alessio Romagnoli.
Alessandria brought more than 15,000 fans to the San Siro, but an own goal by Roberto Sabato and Balotelli's late strike ensured there would be no shock.
Milan will play Juventus or Inter Milan in the final.
