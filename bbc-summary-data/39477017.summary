A 17th Century Shakespearean notebook with "enormous scholarly value" has been valued at more than £30,000.

The tiny pad, featuring "scientific scholarly notes" written during the Bard's lifetime, left Antiques Roadshow manuscript specialist Matthew Haley "trembling".
The notebook is believed to have come from the collection of 18th Century antiquarian John Loveday of Caversham.
It was found by his five-times grandson in an old piece of music.
Mr Haley said: "This is a 17th Century hand, this is somebody making notes in the same century as Shakespeare. Anything, really, from the same century as him, about him, is of huge interest."
He added: "I think at auction you could see this easily making in excess of £30,000."
Mr Haley, who appraised the "extraordinary" item at Caversham Park on Sunday's episode, said it features a critique of the playwright's work, detailed notes in Latin and some of Shakespeare's own phrases.
"There is so much research that can be done on this item. It's amazing, it's almost completely illegible, but you can pick out the odd word."
He said it was "one of the best things" he had seen on the programme "by a fairly good stretch".
"I was completely knocked for six," he added.
