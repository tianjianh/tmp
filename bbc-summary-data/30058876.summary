[SN]TITLE[SN]
Devon and Somerset Staghounds illegal hunting charges dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No charges will be brought against three members of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds accused of illegally hunting stags.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Huntsman Donald Summersgill and joint hunt masters Rupert Andrews and David Greenwood faced charges relating to alleged incidents of hunting with dogs.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said their cases were dropped after new evidence came to light.
It dismissed the charges after consulting Avon and Somerset Police.
The cases were based on video evidence gathered by the League Against Cruel Sports in two separate incidents in September and October 2013.
A spokesman for the League said it will be writing to complain to the CPS, as it "strongly believes" its footage contains evidence that stags were being hunted contrary to Section 1 of the Hunting Act.
