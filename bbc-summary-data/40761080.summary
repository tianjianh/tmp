[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 1-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Last season's League Two play-off finalists Exeter opened the new season with a comfortable win against Cambridge at St James' Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The only goal of an entertaining game came from Reuben Reid in the fifth minute after Jordan Moore-Taylor's long ball was needlessly handled inside the penalty box by Jake Carroll.
Although Reid saw his penalty saved by David Forde, the ball came straight back to him to tap in the rebound.
David Wheeler saw a header come back off the inside of the post, while Cambridge almost levelled when Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym completely missed a kick, but he managed to get back to scramble Luke Berry's shot off the line.
Liam McAlinden then missed a golden chance for Exeter, heading wide from six yards, before Lloyd James skied another glorious chance for Exeter high from 10 yards with just Forde to beat.
McAlinden skied another great chance high shortly after half-time before being denied by Forde, while a rare Cambridge attack saw Berry volley over after good work by Uche Ikpeazu.
