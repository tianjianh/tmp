Recycling body criticises Pringles and Lucozade packaging

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pringles tubes and Lucozade Sport bottles are the "villains" of the recycling world, a trade body has said.

The Recycling Association named them in a list of products that pose the biggest challenges for reuse.
The greater the number of materials used in packaging, the harder it is for recycling machines to separate them.
The distinctive Pringles packaging - with its metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid, and foil-lined cardboard sleeve - was said to be a "nightmare".
Lucozade's bottle is recyclable but it is enclosed in a sleeve made from a different kind of plastic.

A $2m (£1.5m) prize for inventors to devise products that are practical and easily recycled will be launched by Prince Charles in London later.
Simon Ellin, CEO of the UK Recycling Association, welcomed the competition, adding: "Improvements are desperately needed in product design."

The Plastics Economy Innovation Prize, promoted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, is split into two sections.
One seeks ideas to prevent the sea being strewn with small plastic items like coffee cup lids, plastic straws and plastic bottle tops. The other seeks innovations in general product design and materials so items are easier to recycle.
One of the competition organisers, Chris Grantham from the London branch of the global design consultancy Ideo, agreed that Pringles and Lucozade Sport – and brands with similar packaging – were singled out by the industry as almost impossible to recycle.
He listed examples of easily-recyclable products:
In future, Mr Grantham said, designers would need to produce items that could be used again and again as pressure on materials increases from a growing population.
More new thinking is emerging with the growth in online grocery shopping - if the customer has already bought a product like a ready meal online, he says, that product doesn’t need branding.
The technology exists, Mr Grantham says, for a fridge to be fitted with a mini-projector to project branding on a blank container.
One task, he says, is to persuade supermarkets not to copy problematic complex designs.

The Pringles carton is iconic in the world of branding and has been replicated by own-brand retailers in what’s become known as the "Pringleisation" of packaging.
And Kelloggs, the owner of Pringles, said there was an environmental advantage to its design.
“All parts of a Pringles can act as a barrier to keep [the crisps] fresh. That means a longer shelf life, which minimises food waste," a spokesman said.
Lucozade said it was reducing carbon emissions, adding: "We recognise our responsibility to limit our impact on the environment and welcome any technological breakthroughs that support this ambition.”
Yes: (but check your individual council's policy as they vary)
No:
What can be collected from households varies between councils.
Many other items including textiles, electronics, plastic bags and batteries can also be recycled at designated centres and some supermarkets.
