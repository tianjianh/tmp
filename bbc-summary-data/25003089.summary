Bristol Sport Ltd wants to replace two of the ground's stands to increase its capacity.
It plans to redevelop Ashton Gate as an alternative to building a new ground at nearby Ashton Vale.
Bristol City Council planning officials have recommended the proposal for approval. It will go before a council vote on 27 November.
If approved, the revamp will increase capacity from 21,500 to 27,000 and could be finished in time for the 2016-17 season.
The Williams and Wedlock stands will be replaced and there will be a new conference, exhibition and entertainment centre for the city.
"It is essential that the basis on which any planning is granted must be implementable and financially viable," a spokesman for Bristol Sport Ltd said.
"The redevelopment of Ashton Gate would be a major catalyst for south Bristol in generating a significant number of full and part-time jobs during construction and on completion, thanks to the significant investment of private funds."
The proposal, following a public consultation exercise in July, also includes enhanced disabled facilities, improved public transport links and the addition of rail seating.
The newly-redeveloped stadium would be used by both Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club, both run by Bristol Sport Ltd.
Although the club has planning permission for a move to Ashton Vale, it has been held up by a row over a bid for town green status for the area.
Planners also recommended the approval of the South Bristol link road which councillors will vote on in a meeting on the same day as the Ashton Gate vote.
A Bristol Sport Ltd spokesman said: "At the conclusion of this planning process the Board of Bristol City Football Club will be in a position to make a considered choice between stadium construction at either Ashton Gate or Ashton Vale."
