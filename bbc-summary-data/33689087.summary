Frankie Boyle row: Féile park's link with Down's syndrome pioneer

A landmark west Belfast park provides an unlikely link between the row over the controversial comedian Frankie Boyle and the man who gave his name to Down's syndrome.

The Scot is due to perform at the part-publicly funded Féile an Phobail in Belfast next month.
Opponents have called for the event to be cancelled because of jokes he has made about people with Down's syndrome.
The Féile has grown to become a major community festival, since it began in 1988 with an open-air party at Dunville Park, on the Falls Road.
The park was the first to be donated to Belfast as a gift to the city, and was presented by Robert Grimshaw Dunville in 1891.
The Dunvilles were a wealthy family whose distillery on the Grosvenor Road in the city produced the popular Dunville Irish whiskey.
Robert Dunville's granddaughter Una was born in 1903.
She had Down's syndrome, although the condition was not known as this at that time.
Down's syndrome is named after Dr John Langdon-Down, who pioneered education and training of people living with mental disabilities in his own Normansfield Hospital in Teddington, Middlesex, from 1868.
He and his wife Mary, known as "Little Mother", ran a community surrounded by a farm and wooded grounds, where the patients would learn trades in an environment free of imprisonment and teasing.
His own grandson, born in 1905 nine years after his death, had what would become known as Down's syndrome.
Dr Langdon-Down published works classifying conditions by their mental and physical characteristics.
In line with popular theories of the time, he classed these types in racial terms, most of them long forgotten - but the term "Mongolism" was common until it was officially replaced by Down's syndrome in the 1960s.
Una Dunville was brought by her parents at the age of four to Normansfield Hospital, and she lived in the private institution until her death in 1958, having outlived her parents and three brothers.
The doctor who signed her death certificate was Dr Langdon-Down's grandson.
Una's brother Robert Lambart Dunville had taken over the running of the whiskey business in 1929 upon the death of their father John.
However, he had never fully recovered from being shot in County Louth by republicans during the Easter Rising in 1916 as he was being chauffeured from Belfast to catch a boat at Kingstown, now Dun Laoghaire.
He died in 1931 at the age of 38. The company was liquidated five years later.
His collection of animals that he kept in Holywood, County Down in his private zoo at Redburn House - the grounds of which are now Redburn Country Park - formed the basis of Belfast Zoological Gardens, which opened to the public in 1934.
While Dunville Irish whiskey is no longer a household name, the family's name has survived in the west Belfast community where its company was once a major employer.
The firm also gave rise to Distillery Football Club - now known as Lisburn Distillery - which was formed by employees at the whiskey factory in 1880.
At Dunville Park's official opening in 1892, the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava said the public park would benefit the distillery's workers.
He said that "the provision of such a park in an industrial area was symbolic of a new era when employers would think not only of the housing and sanitation of their workers but of their recreation as well".
Dunville Park itself fell into decline, but after years of dereliction it underwent a multi-million pound refurbishment - including the restoration of its ornate water fountain that once provided drinking water in the area - and reopened in 2013.
