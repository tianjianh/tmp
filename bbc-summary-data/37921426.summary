And actress Stacey Dash, best known for the film Clueless, another Trump fan, said: "America will be great again."
However, those celebrities were in the minority.
Parks and Recreation actress Rashida Jones said it was a "dark day", while fellow actress Christina Applegate said she was "heartbroken".
Clinton supporter Lady Gaga wrote: "In a room full of hope, we will be heard. @deray #blacklivesmatter Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us."
She had made a pledge for unity at a Clinton rally in North Carolina ahead of the election, while Madonna played an acoustic concert in New York in a bid to drum up support for Clinton, performing a cover of John Lennon's Imagine.
Singer Katy Perry, who had also campaigned for a Clinton victory, wrote a series of Tweets, including one saying: "We will never be silenced. #LOVETRUMPSHATE."

Actress Mia Farrow tweeted: "We must continue to stand for equality, our freedoms, for science and justice."
And American actor Chris Evans said it was "embarrassing" for America, adding: "We've let a hatemonger lead our great nation. We've let a bully set our course. I'm devastated."
Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood struck a more philosophical note, writing: "Dear Americans: It will be all right in the long run. (How long? We will see.) You've been through worse, remember."
There was also British reaction, with comedian Dawn French looking to the future, saying: "Michelle Obama for next president."
In reply to a question asking how to "move forward", Harry Potter author JK Rowling wrote on Twitter: "We stand together. We stick up for the vulnerable."
Singer Lily Allen wrote a series of messages on Twitter, including one saying: "Globalization is destroying democracy and the US just voted a man who built and named a golden tower after himself to live in, as president."
Comedian and writer David Walliams said of Trump: "Those who voted for him will bitterly regret it."
But Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan congratulated his "friend", describing Mr Trump's victory as an "astonishing achievement".
