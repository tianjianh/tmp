England v Australia: Tourists bid to wrap up ODI series at Headingley

Australia hope to gain a measure of revenge for their Ashes defeat by wrapping up the ODI series with victory over England at Headingley on Friday.

The tourists lead the five-match series 2-1 after wins at Southampton and Lord's, before England's 93-run victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
England bowler Chris Woakes has been ruled out with a thigh injury. Reece Topley or David Willey could come in.
Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc may be rested by coach Darren Lehmann.
Starc, the world's top-ranked ODI bowler, played in the five-match Test series this summer and has been involved in the three one-dayers played so far.
"His workload over the past 12 months has been exceptional - we'll see whether he plays or not tomorrow," said Lehmann.
"We're all tired, but that's international cricket. That's what you do when you're representing your country."
England spinner Adil Rashid has seven wickets in the three ODI matches so far and played a key role with 2-41 in the win in Manchester earlier this week.
Yorkshireman Rashid made his ODI debut in 2009 against Ireland and went on to play a further four that year, but did not earn another call-up until May.
"When I came into this one-day series I had a clear mindset of what my role is in this team and what I'm looking to do," said Rashid.
"It's a different set-up from when I first came in - a whole different environment. My mindset is a lot clearer, the coaches, the captain - the mindset of the team is a lot clearer.
"And playing against the best batsmen in the world gives you confidence, especially if you're taking a few wickets as well."
Since the Ashes defeat, four Australia stalwarts have retired: captain Michael Clarke, opener Chris Rogers, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin and all-rounder Shane Watson, although the latter is still available for shorter formats.
A succession of injuries have followed during the one-day series, with Watson, batsman David Warner and bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile all going home to leave Lehmann with a number of selection decisions to make.
"From a coaching point of view, we are all looking forward to it," said Lehmann. "The media are looking forward to seeing who we pick and play, and the style of cricket they will play as a group.
"That is exciting times for Australian cricket. We will have some ups and downs but it will be good to have a young group and to teach them the game."
Spinners Rashid and Moeen Ali contributed combined figures of 5-73 from 20 overs in England's Old Trafford win, compared to the 3-101 in 19 overs served up by Australia counterparts Ashton Agar and Glenn Maxwell.
Agar, who memorably scored 98 on his Test debut two years ago, was making his bow in the 50-over format and has been backed to settle.
"We've just got to play spin a lot better, as we've spoken about many times before," said Lehmann. "They out-bowled us in that department and had the advantage of bowling second, but we should've played better.
"Ashton was pretty good for a young guy in his first game. I thought he bowled reasonably well.
"He's only a young kid still so for us still trying to get some games into him and keep him improving."
