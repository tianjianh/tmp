Two people died in the crash, involving a car and three lorries, on the M271 southbound into Southampton at about 17:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Hampshire Constabulary said two men from Southampton who were travelling in the car were killed.
The drivers of two of the lorries were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.
Sgt Gabriel Snuggs of Hampshire Constabulary said the two men - one aged in his 30s and the other in his 40s - were work colleagues travelling in a Ford Mondeo.
He added: "Sadly this collision resulted in the death of two men and our thoughts are with their families.
"Our investigation into the exact cause of the crash is ongoing and as part of that we are appealing to the public for their help.
"The collision happened during the evening rush hour so we know there were a lot of other motorists around who may have seen something that can assist us with this investigation.
"We would also like to thank everyone for their patience as we carried out our investigation at the scene."
Police left the scene at 04:45 GMT but the southbound carriageway was closed until about 15:30 for repair work. It has since reopened.
