The 23-year-old American finished on 13 under par after a final-round 67 in the tournament in Memphis, Tennessee.
Americans Brooks Koepka, who carded a 66 on Sunday, Steve Stricker and Phil Mickelson, who both shot 67, ended in a three-way tie for second.
"You work so hard to get here, and to finally be able to put the trophy up, I can't describe it," said Berger.
He also became the fourth first-time winner at the TPC Southwind event in the past six years.
Dustin Johnson shot a 63 on Sunday, the best round of the tournament, to finish in fifth.
