[SN]TITLE[SN]
First woman bishop appointment to be rubber-stamped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The appointment of Wales' first woman bishop is set to be rubber-stamped at a Sacred Synod in Cardiff on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Canon Joanna Penberthy was named the 129th Bishop of St Davids in Pembrokeshire earlier this month.
The Sacred Synod will bring together bishops from the other five Welsh dioceses to check her election was carried out properly and there are no objections.
If her appointment is confirmed, she will be consecrated on 21 January 2017.
That ceremony would be carried out by Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan, who will also lead the Sacred Synod at Llandaff Cathedral on Wednesday at 18:00 GMT.
He said: "The constitution of the Church in Wales requires all Episcopal elections to be confirmed by the other bishops meeting in Sacred Synod.
"This will be a public meeting and, should any member of the Church in Wales wish to draw any matter to the bishops' attention in relation to this Episcopal election, they are invited to attend the meeting in person."
