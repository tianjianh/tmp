Plans to demolish landmark Hawick tower approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controversial plan to demolish a landmark building in Hawick has been approved by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officials had recommended agreeing to proposals to knock down the Wilton Mill clock tower, despite accepting that it was an "iconic" building.
Councillors were told it had been neglected and left to deteriorate.
Objectors claimed that it would be a "travesty" to demolish the historic building in Commercial Road.
A report to Scottish Borders Council's planning and building standards committee said the owner of the building had tried to sell it, without success.
Officers had recommended that the category B listed building was taken down "in a controlled manner" and councillors agreed to that course of action.
It will see the dome on top of the tower, the clock faces and stonework removed for incorporation in a new development on the Wilton Mills site
Earlier this year Aldi submitted plans to build a new supermarket on the site of the former mill.
The council's decision is subject to approval by Historic Scotland.
