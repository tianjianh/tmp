A firm associated with Holywood-based businessman BJ Eastwood has bought a property portfolio from the Cerberus investment fund.

The properties were previously owned by Eastonville Traders, but Cerberus controlled them after buying attached loans as part of its deal with Nama.
The portfolio includes the B&Q store on Boucher Road and Murray's Exchange in Belfast.
Also included in the deal is a number of residential development sites.
Eastonville Traders' last set of accounts, for 2014, valued its assets at around Â£36m, but terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
Mr Eastwood, a grandson of the well-known businessman Barney Eastwood, did the deal through Dialectic Partners.
It is the European arm of the New York asset manager in which Mr Eastwood recently acquired a major shareholding.
The deal also includes borrowing from Ulster Bank.
A spokesman for Dialectic told the BBC: "We are extremely bullish on the opportunities that exist within Northern Ireland and intend to deploy meaningful capital in the region in the near future.
"It is encouraging to see local financial institutions like Ulster Bank back lending on large real estate portfolios".
This is the latest Northern Ireland property deal involving Mr Eastwood and including his long time business associate Richard Irwin.
In July Mr Eastwood's company Wirefox Capital bought the land bank of the Lisburn-based housebuilder WJ Law.
Wirefox's other housing lands include the Bladon Pavilion site in south Belfast.
Neither Mr Eastwood or Mr Irwin were available to comment.
