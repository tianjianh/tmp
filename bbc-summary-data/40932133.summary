[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford thrashed west London rivals Queens Park Rangers in the EFL Cup to end a run of three games without a win.

Brentford took the lead when Ariel Borysiuk turned Florian Jozefzoon's cross into his own net and John Egan made it 2-0 with a free header.
Neal Maupay smashed into the roof of the net, but Darnell Furlong headed in from close range to pull one back.
Furlong then missed a crucial chance and the Bees' Joshua Clark fired into the bottom corner to complete the rout.
QPR manager Ian Holloway opted to make 10 changes from the side which beat Hull 2-1 on Saturday, with Alex Baptiste the only remaining player.
That decision proved costly as Brentford, who started with six of their weekend XI, made up for their winless start to the Championship season with a resounding victory.
The away side were 3-0 up after only 32 minutes, with Maupay in particular running riot, bombarding goalkeeper Matt Ingram with several attempts.
QPR contributed to their own downfall, giving the ball away to allow Brentford promising position, and although Furlong threatened, Clark's late strike made sure Dean Smith's side made it through.
Meanwhile, QPR defender James Perch will be out "for a number of months" with a dislocated knee cap it was confirmed after the match.
The 31-year-old picked up the injury in the Championship victory over Hull at the weekend.
