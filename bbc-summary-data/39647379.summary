Samir Hussain suffered severe burns and was scarred for life in the unprovoked attack in the Cineworld car park in Crawley, West Sussex, in August 2015.
Michael McPherson, 28, from south-west London, threw the acid after leaving a screening of Straight Outta Compton.
At an earlier hearing at Hove Crown Court, he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

He suffered severe burns to his face, neck and right arm.
