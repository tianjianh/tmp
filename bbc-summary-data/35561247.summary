Tarik Hassane admitted preparing what the prosecution claim could have been a drive-by shooting by sourcing a weapon and ammunition in 2014.
The prosecution has said Hassane, from west London, might have been inspired by so-called Islamic State.
The Old Bailey trial will continue on Monday with three other men.
They face similar charges.
