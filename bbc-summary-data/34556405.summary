The double Olympic champion added the title to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit on Thursday with a dominant performance in Grenchen.
This time Trott, 23, won individual honours over 40 laps of the track.
She had to bide her time before powering past the field to win from Kirsten Wild and Roxanne Fournier.
It was the ninth European title of Trott's career and something of a bonus as she was using the scratch event as preparation for the weekend's omnium
"The scratch race is the first race of the omnium. As it was just 40 laps, we thought 'why not, let's do it'."
Britain's Jonathan Dibben lies ninth in the overall standings after three of the six events in the men's omnium, 22 points behind leader Viktor Manakov of Russia.
The Southampton-born rider finished fifth in the scratch race and fourth in the individual pursuit, but could only take 14th place in the elimination race.
Ollie Wood finished 15th in the men's points race with three points.
