Glasgow Warriors: Training 'aggro' helps Pro 12 title bid - Fraser Brown

Glasgow hooker Fraser Brown says 'training ground aggro' has helped the team fight its way to the Pro 12 summit in the defence of their title.

The Warriors have won their last nine league matches since 19 February to qualify for a play-off spot.
A club-record 10th in a row on Saturday against Connacht in Galway will ensure they finish in top spot, with a draw enough to ensure a home semi-final.
"There's a bit of aggro at training between the guys," Brown said.
"It's that aggro and grit that spurs us on to put in really good performances and get the wins we needed to push ourselves up the league.''
A sign of the intense competition at Scotstoun sees centre Mark Bennett have to settle for a place on the bench this weekend, with fellow Scotland international Peter Horne taking over in midfield.
Bennett joins four other Scotland internationals, plus Fiji prop Jerry Yanuyanutawa and Italy flanker Simone Favaro, among the replacements.
''There's competition every week, but the guys respect each other enough to keep that on the rugby pitch," Brown noted.
"When we're on the training field there are a couple of scraps and it gets quite physical and a bit illegal.
"But that's what you're going to have to deal with at the weekend. It's all good competition and if you don't have that you don't get better.''
Glasgow found themselves 14 points adrift of the play-offs in eighth place back in mid-February, albeit with two games in hand, after some untimely postponements.
Their winning run since has matched the Warriors' stirring end to the 2013-14 season, which took them to their first Pro 12 final.
''We always knew it was going to be tough at the start coming off the back of the World Cup, with so many new players coming in and getting used to each other," Brown added.
''Then the Six Nations is always difficult for us with so many players away with the national team. But the guys who stayed here for that period put in a lot of very good performances and that was the basis for the good performances of the last few weeks.''
