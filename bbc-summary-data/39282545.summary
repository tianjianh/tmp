The visually impaired 18-year-old finished fourth in the giant slalom with guide Jennifer Kehoe.
On Wednesday she picked up a bronze in the Super G and said she was content with the meeting.
"I was a little disappointed with fourth, but there are plenty of positives," said Fitzpatrick.
The event is a test for the 2018 Winter Paralympics to be held in Pyeongchang.
"The meeting has gone really well for me," added Fitzpatrick.
"Despite perhaps not having the results we'd love to have, it's been a case of getting used to the environment ahead of the Paralympics and we have certainly done that.
"It was amazing to get the bronze, but results have not been our main target, getting used to the snow and environment was the main thing."
The bronze in South Korea followed a bronze in the giant slalom in the World Championships in Italy in January.
Next up for the pair are the British Championships in April.
Macclesfield-based Fitzpatrick became the first British snow sports athlete to win a World Cup title when she won in Aspen, Colorado in 2016.
