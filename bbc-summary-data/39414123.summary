County took an early lead when Tim Chow turned home Liam Boyce's cross before Darren O'Dea levelled from the penalty spot.
Jim O'Brien was sent off for a second booking before Boyce slotted home from the penalty spot to put County back in front.
Danny Williams saw red for Dundee late on as County sealed the points.
It was the perfect start from the home side and a perfect finish for manager Jim McIntyre.
This win cannot be underestimated. Just their second league victory of 2017, which significantly eases fears of a relegation battle.
After a good start, Chow slotted home after fantastic work by Boyce. He gathered in a deep position, sparked a break and burst forward to lay on for Chow to slam home.
Boyce was extremely unlucky moments after County conceded when he watched Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain produce a magnificent save to divert the ball off the bar and away.
He wasn't to be denied as County, up against it following O'Brien's second booking for a dive in the box, were rewarded for pressing on.
Michael Gardyne was clearly caught as he danced into the area and Boyce was cool as ever, slotting the ball up the middle to earn a crucial win.
County showed real character to deliver, down to 10-men, with the pressure very much on.
This is a fifth defeat in a row for Dundee, but they will feel hard done-by after a spirited display.
They responded strongly to falling behind with O'Dea and Mark O'Hara going close and showed character after the recent thumping by Aberdeen.
O'Dea took responsibility when the chance arose after Henrik Ojaama was upended in the box and slammed home the resultant penalty.
They held off a determined County in the second half and looked on course to maintain a two-point lead in the table over their hosts and a five-point advantage over bottom-placed Inverness until the dying embers of the match.
It all went horribly wrong with the concession of that late spot kick.
It got even worse when they claimed for another penalty, a melee ensued and Williams was ordered off for his second yellow.
Manager Paul Hartley will see positives, but the reality is their situation is becoming more concerning with every passing game.
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "It was a nervous affair. I think in the end we deserved it.
"We know that we have got character in that dressing-room.
"It's been a disappointing campaign for us, we can't hide from that.
"We've not won enough games at home. There's been several of those games that we should have, but people don't want to hear that.
"I know I've got a group of players who care, who try to do the right things and you saw that tonight."
Dundee assistant manager Gerry McCabe: "We can't fault the players for their commitment tonight, but so disappointing to lose the goal in the dying seconds of the game.
"It was a positive response. The boys are so disappointed.
"We'd have accepted a point and I'm sure Jim McIntyre would have been the same.
"When they went down to 10 men, it opened up a wee bit for us and maybe an opportunity to go and win the game.
"Seven games to go, seven cup finals for us. We've spoken to the players about this.
"They know the situation. It's all about the results, not the performances now."
