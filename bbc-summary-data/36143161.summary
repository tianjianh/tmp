Franklin, 28, who opens the batting for Birmingham League side Harborne, played to Under-19 level for Warwickshire and in the same county Under-17 team as England all-rounder Chris Woakes.
He has already worked with the women's team at Warwickshire for three years.
His new role also involves coaching and development of girls to Under-17 level.
"Darren has overseen the great progress made by the women's team in recent seasons, including our runners-up place in last season's NatWest Women's T20," said Warwickshire chief executive Neil Snowball.
"We're committed to developing the women's game and creating the best environment for our senior team to challenge for silverware."
He added: "Our intent for the new season has been underlined by the additions of Jenny Gunn and Anna Lanning to a strong squad, which already boasts England internationals Becky Grundy and Amy Jones, led by Marie Kelly.
"We also have many talented young cricketers coming through the development programme."
Warwickshire's women start their domestic season this Sunday, 1 May against Sussex at Portland Road.
They begin their NatWest Women's T20 campaign at home to Nottinghamshire on Sunday, 19 June as part of a day when the men's side will host Lancashire.
