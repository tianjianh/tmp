Amgen Cymru recycling firm staff contracts 'absurd'

Fresh concerns have been raised about employment practices at a council-owned recycling company.

The GMB union has claimed agency workers at Amgen Cymru, an arm's-length waste management firm near Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taff, have been told to sign "absurd" contracts.
It also claimed agency Smart Solutions Ltd previously paid staff less than the minimum wage and called for it to lose its contract.
Smart Solutions denied breaking rules.
BBC Wales has seen evidence of staff being asked to sign different contracts of employment with several different companies over the past 12 months.
One message to an employee told him he needed to sign or he "wouldn't have a contract of employment".
GMB regional organiser Gareth Morgans said he felt the way the company had acted fell outside Rhondda Cynon Taf Council's ethical procurement policy.
It states employment should be freely chosen, wages meet at least national legal standards and casual contracts not used in a way which is exploitative or seeks to minimise employer obligations.
Mr Morgans also said staff had received payslips in the past which included administration charges, which he claimed brought worker's earnings below the national minimum wage.
He added that while the council had responded to his request for Smart Solutions to employ people directly rather than through third party companies, there were still issues with the most recent contract staff were told to sign.
One of his members claimed he was told that if he did not sign and return it by Friday morning, then he would not receive any wages for that week.
"There are clauses in the contract such as mobility which indicated that my member is going from a fixed place of work to being able to be placed anywhere in the UK.
"He also has to be available at all times which, I am sure you will agree, is absurd - I must ask what does it take for a company to lose their contract?"
The agency said in a series of statements: "Smart Solutions takes its responsibility for the welfare of its workers extremely seriously and have always met our employer obligations, including paying at least the national minimum wage to all workers.
"Following recent discussions with Amgen and RCT council, it has been agreed that Smart Solutions will process payroll for all workers for the remainder of the contract.
"Workers have been informed of the change and reassured that all details of their work assignment, terms and conditions of employment and continuous service are unaffected."
It added no rules were broken with administration charges as workers would have given written consent but no charges have been made since 6 April.
A council spokesman said: "It was further agreed that in future there would be much closer working between Smart Solutions and the council and arrangements are in place to involve the GMB Union in the future working practices at the site."
The council said it had "received reassurances" and the BBC understands it will meet again with union again next week.
