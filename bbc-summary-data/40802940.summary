More than half of British adults watch more than one episode of the same show back-to-back at least once a month.
Of those, a third - almost 10 million - admit they have missed sleep or become tired as a result, while a quarter say they have neglected household chores.
Media watchdog Ofcom did the research into what it called "box set Britain".
82%
aged 16-24 watch multiple episodes at least monthly
67% of adults watch on demand to avoid adverts

91% watch live TV, but viewing time is down 14% since 2010

"But live television still has a special draw, and the power to bring the whole family together in a common experience."
