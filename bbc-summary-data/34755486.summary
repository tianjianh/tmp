Rimantas Karvelis, 56, was hit by a black Vauxhall Astra that failed to stop just before 18:45 BST on 24 October in London Road.
He was taken to a London hospital with serious injuries but died on 3 November, Kent Police said.
His family described him as a "magnificent dad" and "an amazing person".
Mr Karvelis had been on a one-month holiday to visit one of his two sons in hospital in Dartford.
His other son, Audrius Karvelis, who has travelled back from the US, said: "I can't believe he's gone, my magnificent dad, who came here to visit my brother and encourage him to fight Guillain-Barre syndrome at Darenth Valley Hospital.
"Our life has changed irrevocably - we are shocked and deeply saddened.
"He was an amazing person, a real example to others."
The Vauxhall Astra was later found abandoned in Grange Road.
Three people have been arrested and released on bail, Kent Police said.
