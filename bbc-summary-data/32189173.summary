Shane Williams leads 150 people on Defiance Cycle ride

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 150 cyclists, led by a former Wales rugby international, recreated history by retracing the journey of one of the first ever chain-driven bikes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Wales, British and Irish Lions and Ospreys wing Shane Williams followed the route Arthur Williams rode from Glanamman to Swansea and back in 1885.
The 36-mile (58km) course covered roads, country lanes and cycle paths.
Proceeds of Monday's ride will go to charity.
The original ride led to Arthur Williams's business, Defiance Cycle Works, taking off and more than 50 orders being placed in one day.
