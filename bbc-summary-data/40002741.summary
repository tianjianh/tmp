[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richie Gray and Sam Hidalgo-Clyne have been ruled out of Scotland's summer tour because of injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lock Gray was nursing a back complaint when he joined the Scots' camp from Toulouse and had also been suffering from illness.
Scrum-half Hidalgo-Clyne sustained a hamstring strain in training with the national side.
Uncapped Sean Kennedy has been called into the squad as a replacement for Edinburgh team-mate Hidalgo-Clyne.
As yet, no-one has been called up in place of Gray.
Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend, said: "Richie has been unable to do much training since the RBS 6 Nations because of his back issues, so it became quickly evident he wouldn't be able to play Test match rugby this summer.
"It was valuable having him in camp last week, spending time with the new coaching group, and we wish him well with his recovery and getting back to full fitness for next season.
"We're all disappointed for Sam, who came into camp full of enthusiasm and worked really hard in our first three days together.
"While it's a blow for him to miss the tour, at least his injury isn't too serious and he can get back into pre-season with Edinburgh at a later date.
"It's great that we have been able to call up a quality replacement in Sean Kennedy and we look forward to working with him over the next couple of weeks."
