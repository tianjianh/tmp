Billy Davies would love to return to Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Billy Davies says he has "unfinished business" at the club and would love to return.

Davies, 47, led Forest to successive play-off campaigns while at the City Ground but had an uneasy relationship with the board and was sacked in June.
When asked if he would go back to work for a new regime, Davies told BBC Late Kick Off: "I'd be delighted to go back. I have great feelings for the club.
"I did want to get them to the Premier League. I'd love to finish that job."
Forest have scored just 22 goals in 27 Championship games this season
Forest, who have lost nine of their last 11 games, are third from bottom in the Championship and sit four points adrift of safety.
Manager Steve Cotterill took over from Steve McClaren in October but, despite an initial upturn in form, the Reds have been in woeful form of late and have scored just four-goals in their last 11 matches.
But Davies remains convinced they can turn things around: "I am sad to see what has happened," the former Preston and Derby boss added.
"But I wish them well and have no doubt they will get out of their troubles.
"The club deserve to be in the Premier League."
