The PM will visit the Queen for a final audience ahead of the 7 May poll, marking the end of the five-year coalition government.
Later, he is expected to say the UK is on the "right track" and a Labour government would be "economic chaos".
Mr Miliband will say the Tories pose a "clear and present danger" to UK firms.
After months of unofficial campaigning, the five-and-a-half week race for No 10 begins in earnest.
Parliament is formally dissolved under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.
Government ministers remain in charge of their departments until a new administration is formed but MPs will cease to be members of Parliament and writs will be issued for elections in all 650 constituencies.
Issues likely to dominate the campaign include the economy and spending cuts, Britain's EU membership and immigration.

After meeting the Queen at Buckingham Palace, Mr Cameron is expected to make a statement outside Downing Street in the afternoon.
It is understood he will say that "after five years of effort and sacrifice... this election is about moving forward".

He will say the "next prime minister walking through that door will be me or Ed Miliband" and a Conservative government would oversee "an economy that grows, that creates jobs, that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving NHS".
He will say Labour leader Mr Miliband "pays lip service to working people while planning to hike taxes and increase debt".
But setting out Labour's policies on business on Monday, Mr Miliband is expected to warn that the Tory promise of a referendum on Britain's EU membership poses a "clear and present danger" to jobs and prosperity.
It also risks an "extraordinary loss of British influence", he will say, as he promises to "return Britain to a leadership role" in Brussels under Labour.
Labour has said the economic recovery under the coalition has been the slowest in more than 100 years and resulted in a cost-of-living crisis.
It has pledged to raise living standards of "everyday working people by ensuring those with the broadest shoulders bear the greatest burden" while cutting the deficit and securing the future of the NHS.
Elsewhere, Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will have a separate private audience with the Queen on Monday in his capacity as Lord President of the Privy Council.
Campaigning in Oxfordshire on Sunday, Mr Clegg said leaving the EU would be an act of "self-harm" and risked the UK's economic recovery. It came as one of his senior colleagues, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, suggested the Conservative's commitment to an in-out EU referendum would make a second coalition with them "incredibly difficult".
On Sunday, the Conservatives accused Labour of planning tax rises to meet deficit reduction targets, while Labour said the Tories should "come clean" on "secret" plans for further welfare cuts.
