Nadiya Hussain: From winning Bake Off to hosting Big Family Cooking Showdown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Big news for Bake Off 2015 winner Nadiya Hussain - she's going to co-host a new food series with Strictly's It Takes Two presenter Zoe Ball.

The Big Family Cooking Showdown will see 16 families cook their fave family recipes and compete against each other in a series of challenges.
There will be 12 hour-long episodes on BBC Two later this year.
But this isn't the first time Nadiya's been on TV since Bake Off...
While she's presenting on her new show, you might have seen her as a judge - on CBBC's Junior Bake Off!
She judged the junior bakers alongside chef and food writer Allegra McEvedy. The series was won by vlogger Nikki.
The baker has also been on her own show called The Chronicles of Nadiya.
In the two-part programme Nadiya travelled to Bangladesh, the country where her family is from. She got to explore different recipes and visit places she'd never been to before.
In April 2016, Nadiya baked for Her Majesty the Queen.
She said she thought it was a joke when she was asked by Buckingham Palace to make the Queen's 90th birthday cake!
And she's also been busy writing.
Nadiya popped in to Newsround to tell us about Bake Me a Story, her book that brings together baking and reading stories.
