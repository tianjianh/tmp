[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 2-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Madine netted a 74th-minute equaliser to earn Bolton an unlikely draw and prevent former Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson from tasting defeat on his return to Valley Parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 49-year-old led the Bantams to the League Cup final and promotion to League One during a near five-year spell in charge which ended last June.
But he was enduring a miserable afternoon when his rattled side conceded two goals to Charlie Wyke inside the first 16 minutes.
Wyke profited from two errors from Bolton goalkeeper Ben Alnwick to take his tally to three goals in four games since signing from Carlisle.
Alnwick then failed to keep out Wyke's low left-footed effort and, having raced to the edge of his area, was lobbed by Nicky Law to allow the prolific striker a simple tap-in.
Madine missed two chances to halve the deficit - but he and David Wheater both netted in the second half to earn the automatic promotion hopefuls a precious point.
After Wheater lashed home in the 62nd minute following poor defending, former Sheffield Wednesday striker Madine silenced the hostile crowd by heading home 12 minutes later.
Bradford, who stay fifth, six points behind third-placed Bradford, almost won it late on, only for substitute Timothee Dieng's shot to cannon back off a post.
