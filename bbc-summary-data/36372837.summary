Winger Nicky Adams wants to complete a promotion hat-trick with Carlisle United following his move from League Two champions Northampton Town.

The 29-year-old was a key figure in the Cobblers' title win, scoring three goals in 45 games in all competitions.
That success came after he helped previous club Bury to promotion from the bottom tier the previous season, playing 44 games.
"I've come here to get promoted," Adams told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"Last year was special, and the year before with Bury was special too. I just want to win.
"I've got real ambition. I love football and I want to repay the faith that was shown by the manager Keith Curle."
Curle's pursuit of the five-time Wales Under-21 international began in January, but it was only in post-season that the deal was completed.
"It's always nice to be wanted," said Adams. "I had a few people in for me, but after speaking to the gaffer and to Lee [Dykes, head of recruitment] and the plans they've got it was a no-brainer.
"It felt right, I spoke to him the last few days and we got it done."
Adams' exit from Northampton follows that of manager Chris Wilder, who was appointed boss of Sheffield United, with Rob Page coming in from Port Vale as replacement.
"I had a special year, (it's) a special group of boys and a really good club," said Adams.
"It's disappointing leaving somewhere where you've enjoyed yourself. They're gutted [I'm leaving] - though some of them are pleased because I do their head in.
"Things change, but the fact is I want to play football and the gaffer really wanted me."
