The man can be seen jumping onto a car bonnet in Leicester city centre and shouting at the driver, before the driver continues to drive.
Onlookers said the man then jumped off and began punching other cars.
Leicestershire Police said a man had been arrested for criminal damage and assault, and was treated at hospital for his injuries.
The drama unfolded along Burleys Way, close to the junction with St Margaret's Way, at about 17:50 on Thursday.
