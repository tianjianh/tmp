The 21-year-old scored 11 goals while on loan at the Blues as they finished runners up in the Women's Super League.
The England Under-23 international is the sister of Natasha Jonas - Britain's first female Olympic boxer.
"I'm really happy to have signed permanently. I'm so glad because here at City I feel I've got a place I can call home," she told the club website.
"It was an easy decision for me. I wanted to stay in WSL 1 and I didn't want to go to any other club."
