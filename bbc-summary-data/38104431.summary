Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is confident his future remains at the club despite five successive defeats.

Palace head to the Premier League's bottom club Swansea City on Saturday having not won since a 3-2 victory over Sunderland in September.
The Eagles sit one point above the relegation zone in 16th, but are also only four points off the top 10.
"This is my ninth Premier League season and I want 10 with Palace," said Pardew, who took over in January 2015.
"A win would make our position look clearer and take the pressure off of us. I'm an experienced manager and I have been in this situation before."
Palace will be without Loic Remy at Swansea after the on-loan Chelsea forward suffered a calf injury that will keep him out for up to three weeks.
Meanwhile, Pardew has tipped Wilfried Zaha for an England recall after the winger was said to be considering representing his country of birth Ivory Coast.
The 24-year-old has won two England caps, both in friendlies, but has not featured for his country since 2013.
"I think Wilf is hoping that England come for him," said Pardew. "I think he's done more than another to warrant a place.
"The ball's in England's court. He had a chance at junior level, but not enough at senior."
