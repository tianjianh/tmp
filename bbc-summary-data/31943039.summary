[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The joint operation is being conducted by the UK's HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the Guernsey Border Agency and the Manx and Cheshire Constabularies.
Raids took place in and around Douglas, on the Isle of Man, as well as across the UK and Guernsey.
An Isle of Man police spokesman said "significant amounts of cash and business records" had been seized.
However, the force declined to provide any further details about the suspects.
Insp Derek Flint, from the Isle of Man force, had earlier warned of "considerable police activity" in and around Hill Street in Douglas and Manor Park in Onchan.
He added: "The public should not be alarmed to see officers from HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency, who are supporting the searches on the Isle of Man.
"A considerable number of staff have been deployed to the various addresses, with a view to minimising the time it takes to search each address and reduce the impact on businesses and staff in and around those premises."
