High delivery charges to rural Scotland 'continues'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A million people living in rural Scotland continue to pay "unfair" delivery charges, according to a report from Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS).

The organisation has called for action from government and internet businesses to tackle the fees.
CAS revisited the charges of 534 online retailers it surveyed in 2012.
Fewer were charging extra delivery costs than three years ago, but those who did impose a surcharge had increased the charges "substantially".
Consumers in the Highlands now pay 17.6% more than in 2012 and those in the islands pay 15.8% more, according to CAS' report The Postcode Penalty: The Distance Travelled.
It said the extra costs were causing hardship to a large number of rural residents and was having a serious impact on businesses and the rural economy.
With support from the Scottish government, the consumer rights body has been campaigning for several years for fairer delivery costs.
Spokesperson Sarah Beattie-Smith said: "Our campaign has had some success in persuading individual delivery companies to change their ways.
"For example today's report shows that fewer retailers now refuse to deliver to remote areas than was the case in 2012, and fewer add a surcharge.
"Online retailers are also more likely to comply with regulations. These are important successes for the campaign.
"However, where a surcharge is applied, Highland and Island consumers pay even more than they did three years ago, despite average delivery charges falling in real terms. So these consumers pay roughly four times the average costs for delivery."
Business Minister Fergus Ewing said welcomed CAS's efforts to keep delivery charges under the spotlight.
He said: "Despite these minor improvements, we still find customers in the Highlands and Islands facing disproportionate costs when it comes to the delivery of their purchases.
"I would encourage all retailers to adopt the Statement of Principles for Parcel Deliveries, which will ensure that customers receive a better service.
"The Scottish government will study the recommendations of the report carefully and discuss them with CAS."
A UK government spokesperson said: "This report rightly highlights the need for online businesses to provide clear information about their delivery charges to consumers.
"It makes business sense for retailers to listen to the needs of consumers in all parts of the country."
