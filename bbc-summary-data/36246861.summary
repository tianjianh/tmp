Exeter Chiefs boss Rob Baxter calls for 'best ever' performance in Premiership play-offs

Exeter must focus on giving their best-ever Premiership performance in the play-offs, says boss Rob Baxter.

Their 62-24 demolition of Harlequins sealed second place, Exeter's highest finish in their 145-year history.
"Our whole focus shouldn't necessarily be on Wasps or the Premiership or getting to finals.
"It should be playing our best game that we've ever played in the Premiership, because the semi-final should deserve that," said Baxter.
As well as their second-place finish, this season Exeter also reached the quarter-finals of the Champions Cup for the first time, losing to Wasps after a last-second conversion, having led for much of the game.
Exeter will host the Coventry-based club in their fourth meeting of the season later this month as they vie to reach the Premiership final.
"We have only lost one game at home, so we haven't been taking things for granted or else we would have lost more," Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
"We've been very focused at home, but it's going to be our jobs as coaches, and the senior players' jobs, to get everyone back on track and everyone back on lien to make sure everyone gets the hard work done that needs to get done over the next two weeks to make sure we platy our best game of rugby of the season."
