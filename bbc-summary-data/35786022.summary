A group game between hosts India and Pakistan had already been moved from Dharamsala to Kolkata over security concerns, but the Pakistan government wanted further guarantees.
There has not been a Test series between the two fierce rivals since 2007 because of political tension.
Pakistan are due to play against a qualifier in Kolkata on Tuesday.
Its government had already issued one clearance to take part in the tournament at the end of February, but delayed the team's planned departure on Wednesday because of a perceived threat from Hindu extremists.
On Thursday, interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan ruled out sending the team until safety assurances were made by the Indian government.
"We have received communication from the International Cricket Council and Board of Control for Cricket in India. We have received a letter from the chief minister of Bengal and the police chief," said Pakistan Cricket Board executive committee chairman Najam Sethi.
"Our High Commissioner, Abdul Basit, met the Indian secretary and the assurances were given."
Pakistan's women have also been cleared to take part in the tournament and will begin against West Indies on Wednesday.
