[SN]TITLE[SN]
Heart of Midlothian v Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Hearts squad have recovered from the sickness bug that forced the postponement of their midweek match with Inverness and can face Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Head coach Robbie Neilson hopes Callum Paterson will return from a shoulder problem but Juwon Oshaniwa is suspended and midfielder Don Cowie remains out.
Aberdeen have an unchanged squad.
Midfielder Barry Robson completes a two-match ban, while Peter Pawlett (broken arm) and Adam Rooney (thigh) are still not ready to return.
Everywhere you turn at this late stage in the Scottish Premiership campaign there are meaningful matches but you will struggle to find a bigger fixture this weekend.
Questions about the credibility of Aberdeen's title challenge have now given way to questions about whether or not they can win it.
Derek McInnes' side have exactly the same points tally as they did at this time a year ago - but Celtic's recent slips mean they are three points closer to the champions this time around.
Four wins in the last five matches provides the proof of their current form but with just six games remaining, there is no more room for error.
Aberdeen have won just once in their last nine visits to Tynecastle but it was recent and convincing - a 3-1 scoreline in September last year.
Robbie Neilson is adamant his side are still capable of overtaking Aberdeen and finishing second - it's a long shot but the notion provides a carrot for a group of players who certainly don't lack hunger.
They may well lack some fitness though - a virus swept through the squad earlier in the week and even forced the club to shut down the training centre.
A quick glance at the stats shows Hearts have conceded six goals in their last two matches but that double defeat was preceded by four straight wins.
It will be another sell-out crowd and Tynecastle under the lights provides a special stage for what could be a special match.
