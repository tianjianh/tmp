[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 4-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Hylton netted a hat-trick as Luton hammered Wycombe at Kenilworth Road and stormed to the top of the League Two table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated the early stages, with Wanderers indebted to keeper Jamal Blackman who denied Stephen O'Donnell.
Luton broke the deadlock on 11 minutes when Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu's fierce cross was turned in by Hylton.
Wycombe created little, their best efforts being Danny Rowe's wayward attempt and Matt Bloomfield's low drive, which was turned aside by Christian Walton.
The Hatters missed a wonderful chance on 28 minutes as Cameron McGeehan's tame penalty, won when Jordan Cook was brought down by Stephen McGinn, was easily saved by Blackman.
Mpanzu put a fine chance wide just after the break, before Luton had the second goal their play fully deserved. McGeehan's low shot was parried by Blackman, with Hylton tapping home his second of the afternoon.
Wycombe were back in the game on 63 minutes as Bloomfield escaped the home defence to find the corner, while substitute Garry Thompson tested Walton low down from range, before seeing another shot parried by the Luton keeper.
After weathering the storm, though, Luton won their second spot-kick on 88 minutes when Hylton was fouled and he converted the penalty, before Cook notched a breakaway fourth in injury time.
