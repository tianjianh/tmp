Nottingham Forest have signed Poland centre-back Damien Perquis and goalkeeper Stephen Henderson on free transfers, while defender Hildeberto Pereira arrives on loan from Benfica.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Perquis, 32, who won the last of his 14 Poland caps in 2013, joins on a two-year deal after leaving Toronto.
Henderson, 28, who played 54 games for Charlton, has signed a three-year deal.
Pereira, 20, is yet to play for Benfica in the Portuguese Primeira Liga and joins on a season-long loan deal.
Instead the Portugal Under-20 international has featured for the club's B team in the second division.
The triple signing comes three days after Forest boss Philippe Montanier said the club would not rush to make more signings unless Lionel Messi or Neymar wanted "to come to Nottingham".
