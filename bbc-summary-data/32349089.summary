[SN]TITLE[SN]
Essex County Council moves disabled boy out of 'cluttered home'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A disabled teenager is to be taken into local authority care because his Essex home has been deemed "too cluttered".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Family court judge Lynn Roberts was told the 16-year-old boy had too little space to move around in.
His parents had "huge amounts of belongings" which had "taken over their home", the hearing in Ipswich was told.
The judge said the teenager, who was born with "profound disabilities", had been spending days "mainly confined to a very small space on the floor".
Judge Roberts said the youngster had been schooled at home and she had "great concern" he had not been seen in his "home environment" by education officials.
She was also concerned professionals with responsibility for his care had "just accepted" what his parents had said about his abilities without carrying out tests.
Judge Roberts made a care order following a request from social services at Essex County Council.
The judge did not identify the boy or his parents.
His parents were "loving" but had been "neglectful" and had caused him to become "socially isolated", she said.
"The parents, for their own personal reasons, had collected or inherited huge amounts of belongings which had taken over their home," the written ruling said.
"This meant (he) had very little space in which to move around and that, with his mobility difficulties, his ability to move around was greatly inhibited."
The judge concluded there was "too much stuff around".
