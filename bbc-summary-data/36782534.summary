Customers took to social media to complain of gridlock at Ikea Reading during the first weekend of opening.
Peter Coe tweeted he was "stuck for 4 hours trying to get OUT of the car park! Nightmare!".
Ikea said the car park was "closed for a short period to allow customers to exit the store".
Motorists had been warned to expect disruption and Ikea had put 40 "traffic guards" in place at the first store to open in the UK for seven years.
The retailer had spent £4m on new junctions and road widening and West Berkshire Council said it had spent £900,000 on the junction from the A4, which leads into the store, to "ensure traffic flows as smoothly as possible".
As temperatures reached 25C (77F) Anna McSherry from Wokingham told the BBC, stewards "let everyone on the top floor out first because of the hot weather".
Others said Ikea staff were "absolute superstars" handing out water to drivers.
Helen Grant, wrote on Facebook: "Stuck in traffic coming out of Ikea Reading still in the car park, however your staff are doing a fab job trying to get it sorted".
The £10m store created 370 jobs with 90% of people recruited locally, which the council described as "a real boost for the region".
Alok Sharma, MP for Reading West, welcomed the creation of new jobs but said he had "longstanding concerns" - which he first expressed during planning - "about the likely impact of heavy traffic on local roads".
