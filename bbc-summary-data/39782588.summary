[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premiership: Northampton v Harlequins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George North, Louis Picamoles and Tom Wood return to the Northampton Saints starting line-up following last weekend's defeat by Exeter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
JJ Hanrahan's shoulder injury means Harry Mallinder moves to fly-half and Nafi Tuitavake comes in at centre.
Kyle Sinckler will make his 100th appearance for Harlequins alongside fellow British & Irish Lions tour pick Joe Marler in the front row.
Karl Dickson replaces Danny Care at scrum-half for his last Quins game.
A losing bonus-point for Quins could be enough to seal qualification for the European Champions Cup next season, while Saints have to win to stand any chance.
