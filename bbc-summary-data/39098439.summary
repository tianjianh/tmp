[SN]TITLE[SN]
£116k for Llanfair Talhaiarn church where bard buried

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Conwy county church where a famous Welsh bard was buried has been awarded nearly £116,000 funding for repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Mary's Church, in Llanfair Talhaiarn, has secured Heritage Lottery Funding to carry out much-needed repairs and restoration.
It comes after the building was temporarily closed last year after plaster fell off the ceiling.
The gravestone of 19th Century bard John Jones, known as Talhaiarn, is in the church's grounds.
Maryann Williams, who has been involved in the grant application, said: "It will mean that we will be able not only to preserve what we have but also we can develop the church and its surroundings."
