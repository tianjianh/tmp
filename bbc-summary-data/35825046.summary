Equipment has arrived on site in preparation for the recovery of the missing men at the weekend.
It comes after the operation to find three missing workers buried after the collapse on 23 February was criticised by their families for being too slow.
The HSE said "returning the missing men to their families" was a priority.
The Labour MP for Rotherham, where two of the families live, called on the government to intervene following criticism of a "slow" recovery operation.
But now, Sarah Champion MP, said she is "really really pleased" that a rescue plan has been published by RWE Npower.
She added: "They are now putting up fences, bringing in heavy machinery and they have confirmed that by the weekend they will start lifting the steel so we can find the men and bring them home."
One person died and five were injured after half of the decommissioned Didcot A plant collapsed.
Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, are still missing in the rubble.
The body of Michael Collings, 53, from Cleveland, North Yorkshire, was found following the collapse.
Thames Valley Police said specialist officers are supporting the families of the missing men and are providing them with regular updates on the progress of the recovery work.
