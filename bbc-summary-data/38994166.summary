Cambridge American Cemetery appeals for photographs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US military cemetery is trying to source photographs of each man and woman it commemorates.

Nearly 9,000 Americans who died during World War Two are remembered at Cambridge American Cemetery.
Staff have found 3,000 photographs so far and are appealing to the public to help them find the remainder.
Guide Suzie Harrison said: "Being able to put a face to the name on a headstone or on the Wall of the Missing really resonates with visitors."
She added: "They have a deeper understanding of the sacrifice of these young Americans and their families."
The cemetery, at Madingley, near Cambridge, is the UK's only permanent US WW2 military burial ground.
It commemorates 8,914 people, including those for whom there are no remains because they were lost in the sea, or who took off from UK air bases but were not seen alive again.
Staff launched an appeal to match images to each person listed about six months ago, and have already added more than 2,000 photos to the cemetery's original database of 700.
These include pictures of twins Edward and Edwin Hensley, who died on their 17th mission on a B-24 Liberator.
It ditched in the sea nine miles (14km) north of Cromer, Norfolk.
Cemetery associate Tracey Haylock said staff had received help via Facebook and from the Daughters of the American Revolution, an organisation for women descended from soldiers who fought in the US War of Independence.
The 75th anniversary of the "friendly invasion", when US forces first arrived in the UK, is on Monday.
The cemetery will mark the anniversary during a weekend of events in the run-up to US Memorial Day on 29 May.
