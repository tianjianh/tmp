[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tigers are an endangered species, under threat from the destruction of their homes and from illegal poaching by people who want to make money from their fur and teeth.

But now there's some good news. The number of tigers living in the wild has increased from 3,200 in 2010 to 3,890 today.
It is the first time in conservation history that tiger numbers have gone up.
A big meeting is taking place in India on Monday. The governments of countries where tigers live, like India, Russia and Nepal, are meeting to see what else they can do to make even more improvements to the number of tigers living in the wild.
It is hoped that by the time the next Chinese Year of the Tiger comes round in 2022 the number of tigers living in the wild could double.
However, experts who protect the tigers are still not completely convinced. 100 years ago there were as many as 100,000 tigers in the wild. So even though these new figures are an improvement, there is still work to be done.
