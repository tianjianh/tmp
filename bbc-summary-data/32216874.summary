When they're done right, they can be incredibly artistic, or a real statement of individuality.
But not always. What looks like a cute kiss on paper can actually look like a slightly stylised vagina on Demi Lovato's arm, for example.

And to us, it looks like a kiss.
But now that she mentions it, we can see why she might have decided to get it covered up.
Which looks better? You decide...
