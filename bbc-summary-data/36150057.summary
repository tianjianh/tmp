The man suffered serious leg injuries after being struck by a Skoda Octavia, behind shops in Kyle Square, Croftfoot, at about 15:45 on 13 November 2015.
The car was later found burnt-out in nearby Croftmont Avenue.
Police have asked anyone who recognises any of the three men in the CCTV images to get in touch.
Det Insp David Scott said: "This was a targeted attack which left the victim with life-changing injuries and it is critical that we find whoever is responsible.
"A dedicated team of officers have been working on this inquiry over the last six months, however, we still need assistance from members of the public.
"If you recognise any of the men in the images I would ask you to get in touch with officers because we need to speak to them as part of our inquiries."
Police said in the aftermath of the incident that the man had been "deliberately struck" by the car.
The 63-year-old victim was later treated for serious injuries at the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
