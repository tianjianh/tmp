Police targeted the supply of crack cocaine and heroin in the city centre.
Operation Avignon was launched partly in response to a VBS.TV documentary called Swansea Love Story which showed addicts injecting themselves in public.
The Swansea Crown Court sentencing followed undercover offices targeting street dealing in the city centre.
Police said they were determined to disrupt the supply of class A, B and C drugs with a particular emphasis on heroin and crack cocaine.
It was partly in response to the number of drug deaths and overdoses in the area.
It was also motivated by the amount of discarded needles and other drugs paraphernalia found in the city.
Officers also said they wanted to tackle the image of Swansea portrayed in the film which followed the everyday lives of addicts.
During sentencing, Judge Peter Heywood said: "Heroin leads to a life of misery and degradation, it's a downward spiral for those who take it.
"The police very properly had concerns about the escalating problem of heroin use in the city.
"It was becoming readily available and easy to get hold of.
"It's almost at endemic levels in south Wales."
Supt Phil Davies of South Wales Police said the sentences reflected "the concerns that society has in respect of Class A drugs" and "in particular heroin supply within Swansea and the impact it has upon the the community".
"I also hope that these sentences will provide a focus for reflection upon the need to seek harm reduction advice for those who are addicted to this drug and a stark reminder of the likely consequences to those who continue supplying class A drugs within our community."
