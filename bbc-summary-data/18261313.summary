A collection of letters and paintings by the Kray twins have sold for around £10,000 at a Herefordshire auction.

The auction also included photographs of the Krays and the orders of service from their funerals.
One of the paintings sold for £2,000 and individual letters, mainly from Reggie Kray, sold for between £10 and £50 each.
The items were collected by Laurie O'Leary, who grew up with the Krays and wrote a book about their lives.
Toby Service, from Brightwells Auctioneers in Leominster, said: "There are lots of letters that give an insight into what they were thinking when they were in prison.
"It was rather interesting, rather different and not something we're used to selling here in the Herefordshire countryside - but it seems to always sell."
The paintings were mainly landscapes done by the Krays in prison.
The Krays were jailed for life in 1969, with a recommended sentence of 30 years, for two separate murders in London.
Ronnie died aged 61 at Wexham Park hospital, Berkshire, in 1995 after suffering a heart attack.
Reggie died from cancer at the age of 66 at the Town House Hotel in Norwich in 2000.
