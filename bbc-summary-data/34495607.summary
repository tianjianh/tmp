An astronomical observatory has officially opened on the "dark sky island" of Sark.

Sark Astronomy Society has been raising money to build it since the island was designated as the World's First Dark Sky Island in 2011.
The specially-designed wooden building houses several telescopes, star charts and books.
It was officially opened by Dr Marek Kukula, public astronomer from the Royal Observatory Greenwich.
A rich Milky Way is visible on Sark thanks to its offshore location, low use of residential and commercial electricity and its striking absence of public street lights, according to the International Dark Sky Association.
The observatory, which has a fully retractable roof, lies near The Mill in a high position.
Annie Dachinger, of the Sark Astronomy Society, described it s a "mega day" and said everyone there was "buzzing."
"I think we are beginning to get more and more professional astronomers and now we have the observatory, that's very much better for them," she said.
