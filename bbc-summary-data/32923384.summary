[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old has made over 200 appearances for the Stair Park club in six seasons and replaces departing Kyle Letheren in the Dens Park squad.
Bulgarian defender Kostadin Gadshalov, who joined the Dark Blues in January, agreed a new one-year deal last week.
Gary Irvine, Jim McAlister and Stephen McGinn have also been offered contract extensions but the latter is expected to move on.
Meanwhile, Dundee and Queen of the South remain apart on their valuation of Kevin Holt, with the prospect of the fee being settled by a tribunal.
Holt has signed a pre-contract with the Dens Park club, joining new recruits Kane Hemmings, Nicky Low, Rory Low and Daryll Meggatt.
The Doonhamers are believed to be looking for around Â£100,000 for the 22-year-old left-back.
Forwards David Clarkson and Paul Heffernan, defender Kyle Benedictus, and midfield duo Iain Davidson and Jamie Reid have all been released, along with goalkeeper Letheren.
