There are "serious and widespread" failings in the care of children in Sunderland, a watchdog has found.

An Ofsted report rated the city council as inadequate across a range of services including child protection, adoption, and children in care.
The government said a commissioner for children's services would be appointed to ensure improvements are made.
The council pledged to undertake a "root and branch overhaul" of its structure.
The report highlighted high case loads for social workers, a number waiting to be dealt with, and poorly co-ordinated services for children at risk of sexual exploitation.
It also criticised poor information sharing by Northumbria Police, which says it is working to improve its relationship with Sunderland Council.
Ofsted said: "Inspectors identified serious weaknesses in basic child protection practice and oversight of services for care leavers, alongside poor leadership at all levels.
Sunderland City Council said there is a growing demand on its services, with a 26% rise in the number of children with protection plans, and an 18% rise in the number of children in need in the past year.
Councillor Paul Watson, leader of the council, said: "We have increased the amount we spend on safeguarding and invested a further Â£5.4m to address some of the concerns we have identified.
"We have also increased the number of social workers significantly to help deal with rising demand, and we are investing in training and development."
The former head of children's services in Richmond-upon-Thames, Nick Whitfield, had been appointed as the commissioner for children's services in Sunderland to oversee improvements.
A Department for Education spokesman said: "Any failure in children's services is very serious and it is vital swift action is taken to tackle underperformance so there is a relentless focus on the protection of children."
