Abdoul Camara: Derby County winger leaves by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Winger Abdoul Camara has left Derby County after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Guinea international joined the Championship side from French top-flight team Angers in January 2016, playing 26 games and scoring once.
But the 27-year-old only made one substitute appearance under Gary Rowett, who took over as manager in March after Steve McClaren's sacking.
Camara's only goal came in a 3-1 FA Cup defeat by Leicester in February 2017.
