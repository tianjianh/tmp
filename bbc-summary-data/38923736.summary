[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An illegal immigrant beat a carer to death while out on bail, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jairo Medina, 62, was found with "devastating injuries" near Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park on 12 August.
A post-mortem examination did not find a cause of death, but showed he had been assaulted.
Prosecutors say Hani Khalaf kicked, punched and stamped on Mr Medina while robbing him and left him for dead. The 22-year-old denies murder.
Oliver Glasgow QC said Mr Medina's "nose, his eye sockets, the bones in his voice box and two of his ribs had all been fractured".
"The injuries to his head and face were devastating... in short, he had been beaten to death," he said.
Jurors heard the victim's belongings were strewn around the park, his rucksack searched and his wallet emptied.
Officers found his blood on Khalaf's watch, belt and shoes, the court heard.
Mr Glasgow told jurors that Khalaf, of no fixed address, came to Britain in August 2014 by hiding in the back of a lorry.
The prosecutor said he was in the country illegally and "liable for deportation".
The day before carrying out the alleged attack, Khalaf was arrested for shoplifting at the Superdry clothes shop in Regent Street.
He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was bailed hours before the killing.
The trial continues.
