Boos were aimed at Bruce, who had his family in attendance on Saturday.
He said: "It's not easy when your family are here and you're abused like that. But it's the game we're in and I've never walked away from a challenge.
"I won't be beaten with it. If others see fit to make a change then so be it but I'm ready for the challenge ahead."
Defeat to Wigan was Sunderland's sixth of the season and they sit just two points above the relegation zone.

A mistake from defender Wes Brown allowed Wigan's Jamie McArthur time to steal the ball and set up Franco di Santo for a late winner after Jordi Gomez's penalty had cancelled out Sebastian Larsson's early opener.
Despite yet another loss and their precarious position, Bruce is confident his side can turn it around.
He added: "I'm still convinced, no matter what people are chanting or saying, that the dressing room and the players we've got here are a good group and they will turn it around.
"I've got to try to get some belief back among the supporters - it isn't easy at the moment but I've never ducked away from anything or a challenge.
"Of course I can understand their [the supporters'] frustrations. It's happened too many times here and, when you're not winning matches in front of your faithful, of course I'm going to get the brunt of it.

"But I'm convinced we're on the right track and nobody is going to change my mind on that."
After Larsson had given Sunderland an eighth-minute lead, the home side had a number of chances to extend their advantage but Kieran Richardson and Brown missed opportunities.
Richardson also put a late header wide and Bruce bemoaned his side's wastefulness in front of goal.
"I keep coming out and saying the same sort of thing. We should have won the match comfortably. We've not taken the chances we've had to kill the game off.
"We can't make that same mistake because you don't get gluttons of chances in the Premier League. It has happened too often that we've created the chances but we've not taken them.
"It's not just one or two, it's a host and, when you don't take them, there's an edginess and a panic.
"Then we go a bit gung-ho and we've made a mistake. We've come away scratching our heads and a really frustrating afternoon has turned into a nightmare afternoon."
