The English Football League described the Premier League as "a friend" after criticism from five former Football Association chiefs.

An address to the Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport committee said the top flight's financial power has a knock-on effect "through the football pyramid".
But an EFL statement said the Premier League is "not an enemy of the game".
"The solidarity agreement between the Premier League and EFL benefits all EFL clubs," it added.
On Monday, David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and David Triesman said the Football Association has to "self-reform" and the governing body for the game in England is compelled to contribute tens of millions of pounds to the Premier League, rather than the grassroots of the game.
"The EFL has seen the letter written by Messrs Bernstein, Davies, Dyke, Horne and Triesman, regarding governance of the FA," said the EFL.
"The value of the contracted relationship between the Premier League and the EFL is more than Â£100m per season and the EFL views the Premier League as a friend, not an enemy of the game, as suggested by this letter."
