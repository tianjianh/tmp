[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men, one aged in his 20s and one in his 50s, were working at Harford Attachments in Norwich when they died shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday.
Their identities have not yet been released.
Police, fire investigators and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) remain at the scene.
It is understood the men had been working in a paint-spraying area.
Harford Attachments, on Spar Road, makes buckets for the front of diggers.
Three workers were treated for smoke inhalation, with staff evacuated to a nearby bathrooms company, the fire service said.
The HSE said it was looking at processes and would be gathering samples and other scientific evidence.
Radek Kaminski, who works at a nearby car valeting company, said he had been outside when he heard the explosion.
"We hear a lot of bangs here, people dropping sheet metal and things like that, but I felt the pressure change in my ears," he said.
"Then I saw the smoke."
Ed Fossey, of Blockbuster Drain Service, said: "We didn't hear the explosion, the first we were aware of it was thick black smoke pouring in the back.
"We had to pull the shutters down as it was coming into the workshop.
"The sky was really dark."
Harford Attachments said: "The thoughts of everyone at Harford Attachments are with loved ones of our two friends and colleagues who lost their lives yesterday.
"The company is co-operating fully with the authorities in their enquiries and are unable to comment further at this time."
