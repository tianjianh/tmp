Tait, who picked up a medal alongside Kate Hornsey in the women's pair, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013.
Australian Rowing head coach Chris O'Brien said: "Sarah has been, and will continue to be, an inspiration to many Australian rowers.
"She was a strong role model to young athletes, and particularly influential with our emerging female athletes."
Tait and Hornsey finished behind Great Britain's Heather Stanning and Helen Glover in the 2012 pairs final, which was GB's first gold of London 2012.
Glover became friends with Tait following the final and told BBC World Service she was an "incredible personality".
She added: "To achieve so much in her too short life - two beautiful children, a husband, an Olympic silver medal, the list goes on.
"Above all that, she was an inspirational and truly lovely person that has paved the way for women in sport at home in Australia and all over the world."
