The player, who came through the youth ranks at Toulouse, has six senior international caps.
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: "This transfer window has proved very productive for us and Moussa arriving is a massive plus for the club.
"He will bring drive and energy to the squad, he is a winner and that's why I'm especially pleased to have him with us.
"What all our signings this window bring is essential competition for places and that is great for the remainder of the season."
Toulouse had earlier revealed Sissoko would be signing for the north-east side.
"Moussa Sissoko will not go to the end of his contract. He found an agreement with Newcastle United for a definitive transfer," the club announced.
Before Haidara joined from Nancy, Gouffran was recruited from Bordeaux and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa from Montpellier, while Debuchy arrived from Lille.
Yohan Cabaye, Hatem Ben Arfa, Romain Amalfitano, Sylvain Marveaux and Gabriel Obertan are already at St James' Park.
Pardew's side finished fifth in the Premier League last season but they are 16th in 2012-13, two points above the relegation zone.
