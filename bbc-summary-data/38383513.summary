Match report
Watford v Tottenham (13:30 GMT)
Even before Tottenham put four goals past Southampton I looked at Spurs and thought they have just got something about them at the moment.

Watford, in contrast, looked ordinary in their draw with Crystal Palace. I don't see them stopping Tottenham from making it four wins in a row.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
RTJ's prediction: 2-1
Arsenal v Crystal Palace (16:00 GMT)
Crystal Palace should have beaten Watford in Sam Allardyce's first game in charge, but paid the price for Christian Benteke's missed penalty.
Allardyce obviously does something when he comes into a club where he changes the mindset of his squad but it will take time for him to have an effect.
I think the Eagles' improvement will be a gradual process, and all their players will get feedback from their manager along the way.
It is hard to see them getting anything against Arsenal, who were not at their best against West Brom last time out, but still found a way to win.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
RTJ's prediction: 2-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 13 v Tim Vine)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
