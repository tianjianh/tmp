It happened in the early hours of last Friday at a former quarry near the Lough Shore Road.
Firefighters from Enniskillen, Irvinestown and Lisnaskea spent more than five hours tackling the blaze.
The 20m x 12m shed, which contained 14 tonnes of woodchip, was badly damaged.
Investigators returned to the scene on Wednesday to try to establish how the fire started.
But a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said it was not being treated as arson.
