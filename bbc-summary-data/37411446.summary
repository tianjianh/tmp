Kyle Bennett: Portsmouth midfielder committed to club after Ipswich rumours

Portsmouth midfielder Kyle Bennett says rumours linking him with a move to Ipswich Town have not affected his commitment to the club.

Bennett, 26, returned to the Pompey line-up against Accrington on Saturday having missed the last two games.
"You just get on with it, whatever goes on," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"If I'm here, I'm playing for Portsmouth Football Club. That's the end of the story, I'm here and I'm willing to fight for my place."
Bennett's return could not prevent Pompey falling to a 1-0 defeat at Accrington - their first loss in five league games.
"I've been working hard on the training ground," Bennett said. "The gaffer will tell you that I've stuck my head down and I've supported the lads when I've not been involved.
"Hopefully, I've done enough to keep my place having come back."
