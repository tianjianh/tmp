Sr Clare Theresa Crockett, 33, who was from Derry's Long Tower area, died when a school collapsed in Playa Prieta.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed at least 480 people, and left more than 4,000 injured and 231 missing.
Shauna Gill said that it was a tribute to her sister that people were still so interested in her story a year after her death.
"Over the past year we have had a lot of support from people," Ms Gill told BBC News NI.
"Clare was always happy and loved life.
"To think that a year on people are still writing about her is unbelievable."
Sr Clare and another Irish nun injured in the quake, Sr ThÃ©rÃ¨se Ryan from County Limerick, were part of the Home of the Mother order.
They had been teaching guitar and singing with five young women postulants, who were entering the religious order, when the earthquake struck.
It is believed they became trapped on a stairwell as they ran out of the building.
