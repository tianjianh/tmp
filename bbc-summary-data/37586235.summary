Dorothy Jones Talysarn death crash: Unpaid work for driver

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iwan Roberts, 41, of Pwllheli, had a "momentary lapse of concentration," Caernarfon Magistrates' Court heard.
Joiner Roberts was found guilty of causing the death of Dorothy Jones by careless driving after hitting her in Talysarn.
He was banned from driving for a year and must also pay Â£910 in costs.
John Wyn Williams, defending, said: "This was a dangerous junction. His attention was drawn to the left because of the dangerous nature of the junction.
"He edged out into that junction, maybe concentrating on to the left and not seeing Mrs Jones on the right."
