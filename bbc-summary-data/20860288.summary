People living in Burton Fleming have been bailing water from their homes for several days after rising groundwater levels at Gypsey Race at Boynton.
More than a dozen homes have been flooded and councillors are meeting to discuss how best to protect properties.
Homeowner Zoe Clarke said: "We're frustrated and frightened. We're all really struggling."
Parish councillor Keith Wells said: "There are a number of properties in the village that people have given up trying to stop water coming in.
"It's coming up through the floorboards and quite a number of people are moving furniture upstairs or off the ground."
The Environment Agency said a flood alert was in place and pumps and officers were on site working to ease the situation.
A spokesman said more rain was forecast over the weekend but most intense downpours were expected in the west of the region.
East Riding of Yorkshire Council said some 2,000 sandbags had been provided in the village.
