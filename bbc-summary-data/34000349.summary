[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
(Close): The UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index has fallen for the eighth day in a row as concerns build about slowing global growth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The index has dropped every day since China devalued its currency last week, landing investors with the longest losing streak since 2011.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 35.56 points at 6,367.89.
The sell-off was reflected across other major stock markets, with the main indexes in Germany and France down 2%.
However, commodity-related stocks were boosted after the dollar fell in the wake of the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve, which left the timing of any US rate rise vague. Anglo American was one of the top risers, climbing 4.4%.
Shares in Kaz Minerals surged by nearly 14%. The company has been boosted by Kazakhstan's decision to allow its currency, the tenge, to devalue. Nearly half of Kaz's cost base is denominated in the tenge.
In China, the authorities intervened again on the stock market to little effect. Shares on the Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.4%.
The price of Brent crude oil was down 0.1% at $47.10 a barrel, although US crude recovered from earlier falls to stand 0.9% higher at $41.46.
On the currency markets, the pound was up 0.04% against the dollar to $1.5686 and dropped 0.73% against the euro to â‚¬1.3998.
