Mather, of Pearl Close, Oakwood, Derby, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to endangering the safety of rail passengers by obstructing the railway.
He also admitted breaching a suspended sentence.
Police said he drove his Vauxhall Insignia 220 metres down the track from Clay Mills Crossing before leaving it straddling the rails.
The crash cost the railway industry Â£650,000 in delays, compensation and damage to the tracks and train.
Det Sgt Shanie Erwin, of British Transport Police (BTP), said: "Mather claimed to have had an episode of memory loss as a result of post traumatic stress disorder.
"However he was fully assessed by an independent mental health team and deemed fit to be interviewed by police and prosecuted."
