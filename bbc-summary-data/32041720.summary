Edinburgh rail workers to strike on Good Friday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers at Virgin Trains East Coast in Edinburgh are to stage a one-day strike over the dismissal of an ex-colleague.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Doughty was sacked when the firm was operated by UK government-controlled East Coast Trains.
The Rail Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has confirmed the walk-out will take place on Good Friday, April 3.
The services run between Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness and London. Virgin East Coast said passengers should not be concerned.
The firm also operates trains to Peterborough, the East Midlands, Leeds, York and Newcastle.
It returned to private hands last month when Virgin and Stagecoach took over the franchise, under the name Virgin Trains East Coast.
The RMT has suggested Mr Doughty was sacked after he told passengers on an Edinburgh to London service that the crew could not provide first class customers with a full cooked breakfast due to staff shortages and a broken boiler.
General Secretary Mick Cash said he hoped the industrial action would make management "see sense" and reinstate Mr Doughty.
A Virgin Trains East Coast spokesman said: "It's disappointing the union has pushed ahead with action when nearly three quarters of members affected didn't vote for the dispute.
"We're still in a dialogue with the union but, should it go ahead, this action would only affect staff based in Edinburgh, and our services will run as normal, so our passengers shouldn't be concerned."
