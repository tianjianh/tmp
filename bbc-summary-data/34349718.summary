The company cut its forecast for revenues this year by $1bn to $48bn, adding that sales in 2016 would be about 5% lower.
Caterpillar - which has been hit by the downturn in the mining and energy sectors -also said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs by the end of 2016, and could shed 10,000 posts by 2018.
Later on Thursday, investors will be keeping a close eye on a speech being given by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on inflation.
It will be Ms Yellen's first speech since the Fed decided to hold US interest rates at its meeting last week, and will be scrutinised for any clues as to the timing of a rate rise.
