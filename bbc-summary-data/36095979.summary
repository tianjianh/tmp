Defender Christian Fuchs insists Leicester can cope without suspended top-scorer Jamie Vardy as they attempt to claim a first league title.

Vardy has a one-match suspension after being sent off in the 2-2 draw with West Ham and could get an extended ban following an improper conduct charge.
City are five points clear of second-placed Tottenham with four games left.
"It's a new situation for us because Jamie hasn't missed a game yet but I think we can cope," said Fuchs.

"We have this confidence, we have the quality. Every time Leonardo Ulloa comes off the bench he has done well and he's a big part of the team. I think we can definitely compete."
Striker Ulloa came on against the Hammers after Vardy, who has scored 22 league goals this season, was shown a second yellow card for diving early in the second half.
The Argentine scored his fourth goal of the season from the penalty spot in the added time to earn City a point.
He is likely to deputise for Vardy in Leicester's next game, at home against Swansea on Sunday, alongside Shinji Okazaki, who has scored six goals so far this campaign.
"Shinji played a big part so far in this season," Fuchs told BBC World Service Sport. "People know about his qualities and that he can also score goals.
"We know, we trust those players and we know that we can be a strong team together."
Tottenham gained ground on City courtesy of an impressive 4-0 win at Stoke on Monday.
"They played a really good game against Stoke but it's not putting any pressure on us," said 30-year-old Austria defender Fuchs. "We don't really feel the pressure.
"Nobody expected us to be five points clear with four games to go. So where is the pressure for us? We have nothing to lose.
"Nobody expected Leicester to be up there. It's very enjoyable for us. We're in a great position. It's our performance that we have to focus on."
Fuchs also praised the work done by manager Claudio Ranieri, who took over from Nigel Pearson in the summer and has led the Foxes to 21 wins from their 34 Premier League matches this season.
"He's making us focus on ourselves and the next game," added Fuchs. "He's telling us every time 'guys, what we can effect is our performance, our game' and he's very right with that.
"Tottenham can win every game now but we also have the chance to do that and that's what we have to focus on."
