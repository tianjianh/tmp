The flowers at Brookwood Military Cemetery in Surrey mark Canada's 150th anniversary and the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's centenary.
Dozens of the Canada150 bulbs planted in January, have flowered with white leaves and red flames to echo the national flag.
An exhibition has opened to the public.
The bulbs were donated to the Commonwealth War Grave Commission (CWGC) by the Canadian High Commission in London and planted at the beginning of the year.
David Richardson, CWGC's director of horticulture, said: "Being planted in late January, we weren't sure if the bulbs would flower in time for spring but they have come up a treat.
"It's a wonderful tribute to the Canadians buried at Brookwood in this the country's 150th year and the CWGC's 100th year."
Brookwood cemetery has more than 5,000 war graves in the 37 acre site, with just over 1,600 from World War One and more than 3,400 from the Second World War.
About 2,400 Canadian graves of those killed in during World War Two are in a plot in the west corner of the cemetery including those of 43 men who died of wounds following the Dieppe Raid in August 1942.
The Canadian Records building, which was a gift of the Canadian government in 1946, will be home to the CWGC's centenary exhibition between 20 May and 19 November.
