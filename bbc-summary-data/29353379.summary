Labour leader Ed Miliband: Politicians have a problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ed Miliband admits he has a problem. Not just him, but all politicians in Westminster.

It's the issue of how to get more young people engaged in politics ahead of the 2015 general election.
In a chat with Newsbeat after his speech at the Labour Party conference, he told me how he planned to tackle it if he becomes prime minister next May.
As he confirmed in his speech, the first thing on his list is to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 across the UK.
It's after 16 and 17-year-olds in Scotland were given the vote in the recent independence referendum.
"I think we need to change our politics and part of changing our politics is giving a voice to young people and part of doing that is giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds," he said.
That might be a small step to getting more young people involved with politics but it's unlikely to be the only answer.
At the 2010 general election just 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds chose to vote.
When I reminded him of this, the Labour leader nodded and admitted part of the problem was the spectacle of politicians shouting over each other in the House of Commons.
"People are definitely put off by people shouting at each other in parliament," he said.
"I find it pretty off putting as well. I think it's hard to change."
As you might expect, he says the best way to get people interested is to convince them their lives will be better under his government.
He points to his party's promise to get more young people into apprenticeship schemes and onto the housing ladder as evidence he's doing enough to earn people's vote next May.
Even if he can convince people of Labour's policies, his other challenge is to convince them he's the right man to lead the country.
A tactic he's using to appeal to a wider audience is boosting his social media profile.
He's just opened an Instagram account where, so far, the photos he's shared include a written copy of his speech and he and his wife holding hands.
He also revealed he often doesn't write his own tweets, nor does he get the time to read the replies.
"In the job I do I find it quite difficult to have the time to do it I'll be honest with you," he said.
"I write some of my tweets but I also have people draft them for me."
A quick glance at David Cameron and Nick Clegg's Twitter feed shows Ed Miliband is far from the only party leader to be on the receiving end of harsh responses from the public but the Labour leader insists he doesn't let it bother him.
"That is sometimes what happens on Twitter," he explained.
"There is a huge bar of cynicism we need to get over but what I ask people to do is look at what we're offering in terms of offering a voice for young people and changing the country for young people."
