It is the first time an album has been at number one for more than one consecutive week since Adele's 25 had a three-week run in March and April.
Blossoms' self-titled album held off a challenge by ELO's greatest hits, which looked like it was on course for the number one spot earlier this week.
But it ended up at number three, with rapper Drake separating them at two.
French singer Christine and the Queens has risen to number four with Chaleur Humane, while Bob Marley's Legend is back in the top five in its 734th week on the UK chart.
The highest new entry comes from Canadian singer and rapper PartyNextDoor, who has worked with Drake and Rihanna. His album PartyNextDoor 3 is at number 11 - giving him his first UK top 40 appearance.
Justin Bieber has continued his domination of the singles chart, occupying the top two places.
Cold Water, his collaboration with Major Lazer, has remained at number one for a fourth week, while Let Me Love You, with DJ Snake, has stayed in second place.
Britain's Got Talent contestant Calum Scott has stayed in third, while Chainsmokers' collaboration with US pop sensation Halsey, Closer, has provided the greatest movement in the upper reaches of the chart, leaping from 12 to number four.
