Stephen Jamieson, 28, tied bed sheets together to scale a wall and reportedly put a pillow around his waist to avoid being hurt by razor wire.
He was serving a 12-year sentence for armed robbery.
Jamieson escaped, reportedly after cutting through a gate at the back of a small secure exercise yard attached to his cell.
Australia's audacious prison breaks
Police arrested Jamieson late Tuesday following a high-speed pursuit along the Hume Highway at Marulan, about 15 minutes drive from Goulburn prison in New South Wales.
Road spikes were deployed about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from where Jamieson was first intercepted.
He faces court on Tuesday on a number of charges, including escape from lawful custody.
New South Wales Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Severin told ABC News Jamieson had a history of trying to escape and was put into solitary confinement after a man-made hole was discovered inside a workshop at the prison.
"He was clearly somebody that was in maximum security for all the right reasons and furthermore he was actually segregated in the maximum security section," he said.
The commissioner said that the escape was "a very serious matter" and would be the subject of an intensive security review because there was "absolutely no excuse for anybody being able to escape from maximum security".
