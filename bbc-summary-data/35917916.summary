The incident was reported near junction 16 at Johnstonebridge at about 14:20.
Police said that six vehicles had been involved and lanes on the southbound carriageway were blocked for a time but the route was subsequently cleared.
In another incident a car was reported to have ended up on its roof on the northbound carriageway.
It follows a string of incidents on the motorway on Sunday in similar weather conditions.
Policing units attended about 40 crashes - primarily on the A74(M) - throughout the day.
A number were also reported on the A75 near Carrutherstown.
"Thankfully the majority of the crashes were fairly minor in nature and as a result there were only three persons slightly injured," said a police spokesman.
"The crashes occurred as a result of freak hail showers in various locations throughout the region making driving conditions hazardous.
"Please remember that although it is now March and temperatures are generally higher, weather conditions are still very changeable so please take time to have a look at the weather forecast prior to your journey so that you may be better informed of the conditions ahead."
