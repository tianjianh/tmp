Gillingham 2-3 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Dempsey's injury-time winner kept Fleetwood's automatic promotion hopes alive after they twice came from behind to win against Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An unfortunate own goal from Alex Cairns and Rory Donnelly's effort looked to have secured three points for the Gills, but Fleetwood battled back to clinch victory courtesy of goals from Ashley Hunter, David Ball and Dempsey.
The hosts took the lead when defender Zesh Rehman headed an effort against the post from a Lee Martin corner and it went in via Cairns.
Town struck back in the 54th minute after a defensive error saw Hunter collect the ball 18 yards out and drill a low shot into the bottom corner.
Donnelly then restored his side's lead on the hour mark as his deflected free-kick fortunately dribbled into Cairns' goal.
But the visitors responded again through Ball in the 79th minute before Dempsey's first-time strike with seconds remaining clinched victory.
