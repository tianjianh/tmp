Ben Haenow is number one in the midweek charts with his debut single, just three days after winning the X Factor.

His version of One Republic's Something I Need is ahead of Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk by more than 30,000.
So far it's sold 107,453 units while last week's number one - Uptown Funk - has sold 73,594.
Leading the way in The Official UK Charts Company it is almost certain to be this year's Christmas number one.
If he manages to do it, he'll be the eighth X Factor winner to claim the Christmas number one spot.
Ben told Newsbeat: "It's incredible. The fact I got to release a single has already blown my mind.
"It's amazing to sing a One Republic song. Couldn't be happier with the song.
"It's exactly the sort of song I would want to make. It's kind of an anthemic rocky sort of soulful song and that's exactly the sort of vibe I want to go for when I'm releasing stuff anyway so it's a good start for me."
Listen to Radio 1 on Sunday from 1600GMT for the official Christmas countdown.
