Murphy, who won the World Grand Prix in Llandudno a fortnight ago, now plays Ben Woollaston in the Manchester event.
Ali Carter defeated fellow Englishman Judd Trump 4-1 to set up a meeting with Ricky Walden, who beat Marco Fu 4-2.

Allen, who hit a top break of 119, will be facing a player who will be competing in only his second ranking quarter-final.
