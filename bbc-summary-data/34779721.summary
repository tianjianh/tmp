[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
KK Fine Foods is to open a third production hall to meet new contracts from customers including Wetherspoons, Ikea, Aldi and Morrisons.
Its staff of 250, based at its premises on Deeside Enterprise Zone, will rise to 350 over the next six months.
The company's £833,000 expansion has been helped by a £100,000 Welsh government loan.
The business was started by chief executive Leyla Edwards in 1987 in her own kitchen, moving to Deeside in 2003 when it employed just 23 people.
Last year KK Fine Foods announced a £4.2m expansion backed by the Welsh government and Finance Wales.
The investment in extra manufacturing space and new equipment created 90 new jobs.
