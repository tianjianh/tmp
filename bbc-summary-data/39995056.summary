Middlesex v Surrey: Visitors' lower-order batsmen secure Lord's draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesex and Surrey settled for a draw on the final day at Lord's as the hosts' fourth-innings chase of 242 off 39 overs petered out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite dismissing Kumar Sangakkara for 120 at the start of play, reigning champions Middlesex were kept at bay by Ben Foakes (67 not out) and Sam Curran.
When Curran fell for 51, the visitors lost 5-46 to be bowled out for 339.
But two early Middlesex wickets ended any chance of a late run chase, and they were 92-2 when a draw was agreed.
Having added just four to his overnight score, Sangakkara nibbled James Franklin behind to be well taken by wicketkeeper John Simpson.
Surrey had a lead of just 112 at that point with only five second-innings wickets remaining, and the away side looked in danger of being bowled out cheaply before Foakes and Curran shared a vital 83-run sixth-wicket partnership.
The hosts continued to push for wickets, as they searched for their first Championship victory of the season, and spinner Ollie Rayner returned to dismiss both Curran brothers.
Foakes finished unbeaten, while Dawid Malan's spin accounted for Surrey's tail.
Middlesex's final-innings chase never looked likely after Nick Gubbins edged Sam Curran behind for five before tea.
The prized scalp of Nick Compton came off Mark Footitt's first ball but, with runs hard to come by and no further loss of wickets, the London derby ended in a draw.
Surrey ended the happier of the two sides, despite slipping to second in Division One and one point behind leaders Essex, who they face at Chelmsford on Friday.
