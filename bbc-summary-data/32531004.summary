The disruption struck between Wansdsworth Common and Clapham Junction during rush hour and trains in and out of Victoria station were suspended.
All Gatwick Express services were cancelled and passengers on Southern trains were badly affected
Some people said they had been stuck on non-moving trains for up to four hours.
Others struggled to get in and out of overcrowded stations.
Eventually rail staff started to evacuate stranded passengers from trains that were unable to move either at smaller stations or, in some cases, on to tracks .
Emergency services were sent to help some commuters who needed assistance after being held on trains for long periods.
Passengers spoke of nightmare conditions at Clapham Junction, while there were reports that a London-bound train that left Brighton at 06:56 was still outside Clapham at 09:30.
The disruption was expected to last until all day.
FiniasFinn tweeted: "Clapham Junction is worst station ever. I realise it's chaos but no staff helping and being arrogant is not a help."
Another tweet from Thomas Michael Jules said: "Avoid Clapham Junction today people! Mayhem!!"
Earlier there had been been a fire near Clapham Junction which caused hold-ups to services on London Overground.
A Network Rail spokesman said: "A major power supply problem between Clapham and Wandsworth Common has disrupted Southern train services into London Victoria this morning.
"Engineers are on site and we aim to resume services as quickly as possible."
South West Trains services to and from Waterloo via Clapham Junction were unaffected.
Clapham Junction passengers had also been held up last night due to overhead wire problems near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire.
