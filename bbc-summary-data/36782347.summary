The 19-year-old former Barcelona youth player spent last season on loan in the second tier with Brentford, where he scored seven goals in 39 matches.
Canos, who made one Reds appearance, has signed a four-year Norwich deal.
Bristol City also reportedly had a bid accepted for Canos.
Canos rejected the offer of a new contract at Anfield, with his Canaries deal including the option of a further 12 months.
He comes in following fellow winger Nathan Redmond's departure to Southampton.
Canaries boss Alex Neil told the club website: "We wanted to replace Nathan with someone exciting; someone who can dribble, can score goals and can provide assists.
"Hopefully Sergi can show everybody how good he can be."
