Vasilaki Kakko was the 14th teenager to be fatally stabbed in the capital this year.
He was found with stab injuries in Yoke Close, off North Road, Holloway, at about 20:50 GMT on Monday evening and was declared dead half an hour later, the Met said.
A post-mortem examination found he died from a stab wound to the neck. No arrests have yet been made.
Updates on this and more from around London
Vasilaki's case was raised at prime minister's questions on Wednesday by Labour's Emily Thornberry, who read out the names of four teenagers killed in her Islington South constituency this year.
She claimed there was a "growing culture of drugs, gangs and violence" in the borough and others like it.
"Every life lost in this way is a tragedy," Prime Minister David Cameron replied.
He said knife crime overall was down over the past few years, but there were still "too many people carrying a knife" without being aware of the risks.
The families of murder victims marched through central London on Sunday in a protest against knife crime.
