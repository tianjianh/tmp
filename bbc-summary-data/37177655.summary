Jane Wilson and her husband Gary, of Stockport, decided not to go to the summit during the walk on March 25.
Instead, using Mr Wilson's smartphone to guide them, they headed across the mountain's west face but Mrs Wilson fell 30ft (9m) down a vertical cliff.
The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.
The hearing was told Mrs Wilson, a librarian at Manchester University, fractured her skull and sustained other severe injuries in the fall.
In a statement to John Gittins, the coroner for north Wales east and central, Mr Wilson said his wife went a short distance ahead of him to look for a suitable route.
"I asked 'Is it OK? Is it safe?' and we said we would only go if we both agreed," he said.
Realising his wife had fallen, he climbed to a safer ledge and raised the alarm.
Mr Wilson was led to safety by members of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team, who found his wife's body.
Det Con Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, told the inquest: "The change in route was an attempt to traverse the west face to avoid the summit.
"It would have been better to have retreated the way they had come or gone to the north ridge, but unfortunately they probably saw a footpath and joined up the dots."
The inquest was told Mrs Wilson was a fit and active woman and that she and her husband had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years.
