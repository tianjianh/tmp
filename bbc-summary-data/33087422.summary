[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The operation to save a pilot whale which beached itself in Orkney appears to have been successful.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The young female was discovered on a beach in Deerness on the east of the Orkney mainland.
Local marine mammal experts worked alongside the Scottish SPCA and tourists in a bid to help keep the animal alive on Wednesday.
They managed to refloat the whale at high tide, and it has not been seen since.
Last week, 21 long-finned pilot whales stranded on the shore at Staffin on Skye.
While the majority were successfully floated back out to sea, several of the whales then stranded on the shores of nearby Staffin Island.
Eight whales died, including a female and her newborn calf.
