[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sister of a woman on trial for assisting the suicide of her best friend told a jury her sibling was "more like a child than a 21-year-old".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amelia Caller, who is now 22 and from Great Hale, Lincolnshire, is accused of buying gas that her friend, Emma Crossman, used to take her own life.
Fiona Caller told Lincoln Crown Court her sister was bullied as a teenager and Miss Crossman was her only friend.
The jury also heard Miss Crossman knew how to "manipulate" Miss Caller.
Emma Crossman, who was 21, was found dead at her home in Sleaford in January 2014.
Miss Caller bought the gas that Miss Crossman used to kill herself but did not think her friend would take her own life, the court was told.
Fiona Caller said Miss Crossman's expressions of wanting to die were "a continuous thing."
Giving evidence, she said: "I don't think anyone believed she would actually go through with it."
Ms Caller told the court Miss Crossman knew how to "manipulate" and "get things" from her sister.
The defendant would give Miss Crossman money and buy her presents, the court heard.
"She saw Emma as her only friend. She cared about her a lot," Ms Caller said.
William Galen Ives, a psychologist called to give evidence by the defence, also told the court Miss Caller had a personality disorder.
He said she was timid, childlike and was someone who does what she is told.
Amelia Caller was also described as the quietest of six children, who left school at 16 and who had initially gone to college to train to work with children.
She had attended confidence-building sessions in Boston to help her find a job.
Miss Caller denies one count of encouraging or assisting a suicide.
The trial continues.
