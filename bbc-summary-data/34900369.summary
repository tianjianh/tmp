The Scottish Enterprise grant will be used to take on up to 100 new staff and help safeguard 150 existing jobs.
The refurbishment will also allow the shipbuilder to invest in new equipment.
Last month, Ferguson was awarded a £97m Scottish government contract to build two new ferries. The firm was saved from administration last year by Jim McColl's Clyde Blowers Capital.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney announced Ferguson Marine had received a regional selective assistance grant from Scottish Enterprise while touring the Port Glasgow facility.
Mr Swinney said: "Commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde has a long history and it is important that we continue to support this vital industry.
"This £1m grant will enable the company to further invest in the site on the Clyde, which will create jobs and help ensure our shipbuilding industry continues to have a sustainable future."
Mr Swinney added: "Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited has also recently won a contract worth almost £100 million from Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited for the construction of two new ferries, the largest commercial vessels to be built on the Clyde since 2001.
"Since Clyde Blowers took over the company, they have done a fantastic job of turning the company around and I am delighted to visit their premises today to see just how much progress has been made."
Ferguson Marine now has an order book worth some £110m, including the £97m order to build two new dual-fuel CalMac ferries.
The firm's managing director, Liam Campbell, said: "We greatly appreciate this contribution by Scottish Enterprise to support us in rebuilding our yard and in doing so creating new jobs and skills for the local area."
Paul Lewis, managing director of Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise international operations, said: "Since last September we've been working with Ferguson Marine to help drive forward its plans of developing a successful, growing business with international ambition.
"Today's announcement marks a significant milestone for the company and we will continue to work with them as they realise their full growth potential."
