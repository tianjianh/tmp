A road in Monmouthshire has been closed after a lorry overturned, spilling palm oil which has "set like wax".

The crash happened on the A4042 between Hardwick and Llanellen at about 21:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Gwent Police said the driver suffered significant arm injuries and was taken to Nevill Hall hospital.
Police said clearance work would close the road for a "significant" amount of time, as the spillage had involved a substantial amount of oil.
A 40-mile (64km) diversion has been put in place at the Hardwick roundabout on the A4042 south bound, and on the A4042 junction with B4269 at Llanellen, adding at least 45 minutes to journey times.
