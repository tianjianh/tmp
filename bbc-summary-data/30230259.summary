A school has been told it cannot be rated as "outstanding" by Ofsted because pupils need to have more awareness of other British cultures.

St Lawrence School in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, which caters for 140 children with special needs, was visited last month.
It's the second school in the county to be criticised for a lack of diversity.
Executive head Lea Mason said finding cultural opportunities in rural Lincolnshire was a "big challenge".
Following the latest inspection, Ofsted said while it was a good school, it was not outstanding because pupils did not have a strong awareness of other cultures or wider issues of modern Britain.
Ms Mason said: "Our students are not immersed daily with cultures you might find in a city-based environment."
However, she added: "I still think we have a responsibility to make our students aware of different cultures, but we are doing a lot already.
"We have lots of other challenges too - some of out students are not able to sit on a mini-bus for a long time to get to somewhere that has more cultural opportunities."
Inspectors said while the school integrated spiritual, moral and social education into the curriculum, pupils had limited awareness of other faiths, cultures and traditions.
Last week it was revealed Ofsted reported that Market Rasen School in Lincolnshire could not be rated as outstanding because pupils lack experience of "the diverse make-up of modern British society".
The "large majority" of pupils at the school are white British and the number of disabled children and those from low income families is below average.
The school said it was looking at ways its pupils could interact with children from different backgrounds.
Ofsted's chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "Ofsted would never criticise or penalise a school just because of its intake.
"It's nonsense, for example, to suggest we would mark down a school for being "too white".
"We simply want to ensure children are receiving a good education and are being prepared for life in modern Britain."
