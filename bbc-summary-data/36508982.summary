A Gareth Bale free-kick and a late winner from substitute Hal Robson-Kanu saw Chris Coleman's side earn a 2-1 victory over Slovakia in Group B.
But who were the stand-out performers in Bordeaux? BBC Wales Sport's Dafydd Pritchard gives his ratings.
Called in to replace the injured Wayne Hennessey, who was forced out with a back problem, the 22-year-old Liverpool keeper was solid in his first international start, punching well from crosses and making a handful of decent saves.
Coped well with the threat of Slovakia winger Vladimir Weiss and gave Wales some useful width on the right.
Comfortable on the ball and focused in defence, the West Brom defender played his part in a determined team display.
The Swansea man led his defence with authority, making timely blocks and interceptions without ever seeming flustered.
As well as making a crucial block to deny Marek Hamsik a certain goal in the third minute, the Tottenham defender was excellent as he carried the ball out of defence.
A typically combative display from the Swansea full-back, who stood up to the robust physicality of Slovakia.
Playing in place of Joe Ledley, who is still regaining match fitness after recovering from a broken leg, the Wolves midfielder grafted and kept the ball well.
Typically industrious at the base of midfield and wise in his use of the ball. A pivotal player for Wales.
Guilty of over-complicating things in the first half, the Arsenal midfielder's ambitious passes and flicks did not come off - but he had a hand in the winning goal.
Repaid Chris Coleman's faith with an energetic and brave performance, always looking to run at opposition defenders despite being the target of heavy challenges.
His goal was not one of his best free-kicks, but the Real Madrid forward was his usual menacing self on the break despite being marked heavily by his opponents.

Bursting with energy when he came on after 71 minutes, Wales' cult hero ran tirelessly and, albeit with some fortune, struck a famous winning goal.

Given the committed nature of his 20-minute performance, it is difficult to believe the Crystal Palace midfielder broke his leg as recently as 7 May.
