More than 600 people have given their views on a £220m scheme that could see changes to a major route through Derby.

The Highways Agency has proposed new flyovers and underpasses at the Markeaton, Little Eaton and Kingsway roundabouts along the A38.
Consultation on the plans ended on Friday with more than 1,000 people attending sessions since February.
Assistant project manager, Kenny Guihen, said they had received more views than normally expected.
"It was very successful. Way more than what you normally expect with these things," he said.
"There is a lot to go through, but there is a recognition for the need of something to be done."
He said the next stage was now to go through the responses and work on a design for the scheme.
"Everything they said in the consultation will be considered in the future designs and proposals because nothing has been decided on yet," said Mr Guihen.
"We will take the comments on board and give people the scheme they want."
Similar plans for the A38 were originally suggested in the 1970s, but flyovers were rejected because of their visual impact on nearby park land.
The Highways Agency said the £4m roadworks carried out at the Little Eaton roundabout last year were "an interim solution" to keep traffic flowing through Derby until the proposed scheme was in place.
