Car parts and bikes retailer Halfords has reported a 11.3% rise in pre-tax annual profit to £83.8m.

The firm also passed a psychological sales barrier, reporting a 6.9% rise in revenue to more than £1bn, a year ahead of schedule.
Analysts had expected Halfords to report profits of about £79m.
The results are the first under the stewardship of Jill McDonald, who joined from McDonald's in May to replace Matt Davies as chief executive.
Mr Davies moved from the retailer after a successful two-and-a-half years in charge to take over as chief executive of Tesco's UK operations.
Halfords launched an investment drive to improve stores, customer service and cycling ranges in order to push sales to £1bn by 2016.
The retailer said total like-for-like retail sales were up 7%. Car maintenance revenue from Halfords' Autocentres rose 8.5%, while bike sales rose 11.4%.
Shares in Halfords, which has 470 stores and 305 car repair stores nationwide, rose 2.1% on Friday morning to 495p.
"New CEO Jill McDonald takes over a company with strong momentum," Investec analyst Kate Calvert said. "The job of modernising Halfords will be far from complete when the original three-year plan ends in 2016."
Halfords has been helped by British cycling successes including Team GB at the Olympics and Bradley Wiggins's win at the Tour de France in 2012.
Cycling has increased in popularity, with Halfords expanding its accessories, bike ranges and improving online categories to meet demand.
Last year, the firm reopened its specialist bike shop Cycle Republic, having shuttered it in 2009, with analysts at Deutsche Bank expecting the business to add 200 million pounds to sales.
Halfords said more remained to be done to complete its turnaround after years of under-investment and increasing online competition, with more staff training and store revamps scheduled this year, as well as a move to become a click-and-collect hub for other retailers in order to drive footfall.
