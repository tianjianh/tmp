A Scottish health board has offered adults with hearing loss taster classes in lip reading.

NHS Highland will hold the sessions in Dingwall from 14 September until the end of the month.
The classes on techniques will be run as part of this year's Lip Reading Awareness Week, which runs from 14 to 19 September.
Speech and language therapist Liz Kraft said the skill could help people feel less isolated.

She said: "Deaf, deafened or hard of hearing people, who do not use sign language, and are not part of the deaf community, can struggle to stay in touch with their own language and be part of any community.
"Lip reading and managing hearing loss classes have been shown to be of huge benefit and allow anyone with hearing loss to do the very best they can to help themselves."
