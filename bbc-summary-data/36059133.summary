Netball Superleague: Manchester Thunder v Hertfordshire Mavericks rescheduled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester Thunder's postponed game against Netball Superleague leaders Hertfordshire Mavericks has been rescheduled for 25 April.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thunder have been fined by the league for failing to provide a safe playing surface for the match.
Umpires halted the round 11 game, with the hosts leading 14-9 after the first quarter, because of water on the court.
Mavericks are level on points with Thunder at the top of the table, but have a superior goal difference.
