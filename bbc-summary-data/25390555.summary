The cash will be used to fund projects including housing and mental health support schemes for military veterans.
The biggest donation, of more than £2.5m, will go to Veterans First Point to establish a number of mental health support centres in Scotland.
The cash comes from fines imposed on the banking industry for rigging the Libor benchmark interest rate.
In the UK as a whole, a total of £35m from the armed forces covenant (Libor) fund has now been distributed to 96 military charities.
During the recent Autumn Statement a further £100m was made available.
The latest round of funding was announced by Chancellor George Osborne.
Veterans First Point Scotland, which provides welfare and psychological support for veterans and their families, will use the new funding to develop their centre in Edinburgh and establish a further three centres in Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen.
The four other Scottish charities that will benefit from this funding are:
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: "I congratulate the dedication and innovation of all those involved in these fantastic projects who will benefit from this latest round of funding.
"It is right that fines received from banks who attempted Libor manipulation is being used for good causes across the UK to provide those serving personnel, veterans and their families with the support they need.
"Charitable projects across Scotland, from Dumfries and Helensburgh to Edinburgh and Inverness have benefited from £5.5m of Libor funding this year.
"Scotland's armed forces community as a whole will also benefit from UK-wide projects which have received a share of the £35m of Libor funding."
