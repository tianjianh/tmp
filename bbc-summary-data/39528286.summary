[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collector who captured and killed the UK's rarest butterfly - the Large Blue - has been spared jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Cullen, 57, was given a six-month suspended sentence for capturing two butterflies at reserves in Somerset and in Gloucestershire in 2015.
He was convicted in March of six charges, relating to killing, capturing and possessing the endangered species.
His is believed to be the first prosecution in the UK involving offences related to the species.
Bristol Magistrates' Court heard that Cullen was seen chasing a Large Blue with a child's net at Daneway Banks in Gloucestershire in June 2015.
He was later spotted with a small net at Collard Hill in Somerset.
It was reported to police who raided his home and found up to 30 trays of butterflies, including Large Blues.
Prosecutor Ian Jackson told the court the charges had been brought "on the grounds of endangering a species".
Michael Hartnell, defending, said in mitigation the 57-year-old had accepted the "enormity" of what he had done and was "extremely remorseful".
Cullen, of The Grove, Warmley, Bristol, was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.
He was also given a five-year criminal behaviour order banning him from three nature reserves popular with the Large Blue and was ordered to pay Â£300 prosecution costs and an Â£80 victim surcharge.
The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust (GWT), said it was the "first UK conviction for collecting a butterfly" and a "breakthrough in the battle against wildlife crime".

The Large Blue (Maculinea arion) species became extinct in Britain 1979.
It was reintroduced at sites, including Collard Hill and Daneway Banks, in the 1980s and in 2004 it was found at nine locations in the country.
It has a wingspan of more than two inches and can be identified by a row of black spots on its upper forewing.
A person who collects and studies butterflies is called a lepidopterist after the branch of zoology that deals with butterflies and moths.
