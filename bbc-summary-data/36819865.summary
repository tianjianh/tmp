County Championship: James Anderson impresses for Lancashire against Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England paceman James Anderson ended a two-day spell playing for Lancashire with figures of 3-58 in an evenly-poised match against Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anderson dismissed Paul Collingwood (50) and Adam Hickey (0) on day two as he recovers from a shoulder injury.
Scott Borthwick (64) top-scored as England all-rounder Ben Stokes only made 21 with Durham dismissed for 291, a first-innings lead of 87.
Haseeb Hameed led the hosts' second-innings charge as they closed on 59-1.
Anderson, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, suffered a stress fracture in the right shoulder blade during the third Test against Sri Lanka, but could return to face Pakistan in the second Test at Old Trafford, starting on 22 July.
He helped Lancashire regain some momentum in the match after a dismal batting display on day one.
But it was Matt Parkinson who struck first on Sunday, taking a catch off his own bowling to dismiss Stokes with his first ball of the day.
Borthwick was bowled by spinner Simon Kerrigan soon after, and despite Collingwood's 61-run stand with Paul Coughlin (26), Durham failed to totally dominate.
