[SN]TITLE[SN]
England announce Pakistan & Sri Lanka home series dates for 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England have announced dates for home series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan next summer from May to September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England will play three Tests against Sri Lanka followed by four Tests against Pakistan, with both touring sides also playing five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match.
The first Test against Sri Lanka starts at Headingley on 19 May.
Pakistan, touring the country for the first time since 2010, begin their Test series at Lord's on 14 July.
The series could see a return for bowler Mohammad Amir, who will be eligible to play for Pakistan from next month after a reduced five-year ban for spot fixing during Pakistan's last tour of England five years ago.
Amir was found guilty alongside Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif of bowling deliberate no balls at prearranged times in the Lord's Test.
