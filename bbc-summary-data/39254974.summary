The home, on the shore of Lake Ontario, was captured by a local photographer after being battered by water whipped up from the lake by freezing winds.
The photographer said many people on social media refused to believe the images were genuine.
John Kucko said he was "amazed at how many people think I sprayed foam on the place" and posted video footage as proof.
He said he found the house after being "tipped off" by a local and "was on a mission to find the place before sunrise."
A frigid windstorm last week in western New York was strong enough to knock out power to over 200,000 people. Over 8,000 were still without power by Monday morning.
