The plaque for the iconic guitarist is located at the Red Lion Hotel in Spalding where he stayed for one night.
"It happened almost 50 years ago, but people still talk about it," historian Judy Chapman said.
Hendrix performed at the Barbeque 67 at Bulb Auction Sheds along with Pink Floyd and Cream.
"When I ask around about ideas for blue plaques, Jimi Hendrix's name pops up again and again," Mrs Chapman said.
"He appeared on 29 May 1967 at an event called Barbeque 67 at the Bulb Auction Sheds in Spalding - which have long since gone."
Colin Ward, who played with local band Sounds Force Five at the event, said: "There were thousands of people there - it held 6,000 but there were twice as many people outside as well.
"Not only did he play his guitar with his teeth and behind his head, but he set fire to it," he said.
The concert was one of the first rock festivals ever held in the UK, he said.
The blue plaque is part of a new tourism trail which is being developed in the Lincolnshire town.
Another blue plaque at 23 Brook Street in Mayfair in London marks the fact Hendrix lived in the house from 1968-69.
He died of an apparent overdose at what was then the Samarkand Hotel in Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, on 18 September 1970.
