What puts off so many of us from going swimming?
Whether it is a fear or phobia, a religious or cultural reason, a body image issue, a medical concern, or something else, it is easy to find a reason not to get into the water.
Make Your Move hosted a live Facebook Q&A with Rebecca Adlington, Mark Foster and Dr Victoria King to discuss anything and everything to do with getting started at the pool.
Make Your Move is a campaign, by the BBC Get Inspired team, which aims to show it doesn't take much to get moving.
