An old oak tree falling into a boulder field was believed to have caused the rocks to slide down onto the trunk road on Thursday.
Motorists have been advised of a 120-mile (193km) diversion.
FCS said it was on track to have the road reopened by the end of the weekend.
Two large rocks fell on to the A82 about two miles (3km) north of Invermoriston at about midday on Thursday.
Alex Macleod, from FCS, said: "Our geotechnical team Geo-rope yesterday completed the operation to break the boulders into smaller, more manageable pieces. However, the road needs to stay closed until the next phase of the operation - to secure and make safe the material on the slope - is completed.
"The challenges presented by the site mean that a helicopter has again had to be brought in to ferry more catch fencing and anchoring materials to the site swiftly this morning and the team is working hard to progress things quickly, and safely.
"There is also now heavy plant on site to break down and remove material that has fallen to the road surface and we anticipate this will be undertaken during the latter phases of the operation."
He added: "The good weather has been a boost to the operation and we are looking to be on track to see the road re-opened at the end of the weekend."
Any update on the traffic measures involved will be posted on Traffic Scotland's website.
