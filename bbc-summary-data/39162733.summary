[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameron Jerome's equaliser rescued a point for managerless Norwich as they were held by struggling Blackburn.

The Canaries, who sacked boss Alex Neil on Friday, had to play with 10 men for 69 minutes after Mitchell Dijks was sent off for fouling Marvin Emnes.
Jerome's close-range finish had given the hosts the lead but Lucas Joao fired in from six yards to make it 1-1.
The Portugal international then headed Rovers in front before Jerome struck from inside the box late on.
City had failed to win in their last five games under Neil and that record has continued against a Blackburn side that are 22nd in the Championship table.
But the draw has seen the Canaries close the gap on the top six from nine to eight points while Rovers have now gone five games unbeaten since Tony Mowbray was appointed their manager on 22 February.
Jerome put Norwich ahead early on when he slid the ball past keeper Jason Steele, who had half blocked an attempt by Josh Murphy.
Despite Dijks' sending off soon after, it took until midway through the second half for Blackburn to strike back.
Substitute Joao put the visitors back on level terms in the 73rd minute as he converted from Connor Mahoney's cross before then giving them the lead as he headed in from Danny Graham's delivery.
But Jerome joined the Portugal international in claiming a brace as he latched on to Murphy's pass to make it 2-2 at full time.
Norwich caretaker manager Alan Irvine told BBC Radio Norfolk: "We made a decent start, getting ahead but then the sending off changes all our plans.
"But despite going 2-1 down and a little spell when we wobbled, the lads showed great character to play as they did with 10 men for so long.
"There was no question it was a red card. It was a mis-timed tackle but I don't think it was malicious."
Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Radio Lancashire: "The frustration is that we only ended up with a point after being in total control.
"There was a lot of good positive stuff in that we were in in control of the game and weren't overly threatened by a Norwich team that was in the Premier League last year but we let ourselves down in the last 10 minutes after going in front.
"The game should have been won at 2-1, there should have been no way back, they couldn't get over the half-way line but we allowed them to score."
