Burnley boss Sean Dyche could manage England in the future, says Clarets defender Michael Duff.

Dyche, 43 and Burnley manager since October 2012, led them to promotion to the Premier League last season.
Asked if Dyche could manage the national team, Duff said: "He's managed to get the best out of us - why not?
"Most of our players have played most of their careers in the Championship or lower. We are up against multi-million pound squads and alive and kicking."
Burnley are 18th in the Premier League table with eight matches of the season remaining, and Duff said Dyche's managerial reputation will continue to grow if he keeps the Clarets in the top flight.
"Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and [Burnley will] achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here," he added.
Dyche began his managerial career at Watford, guiding them to 11th in the Championship in his one season in charge before being sacked in July 2012. He succeeded Eddie Howe at Turf Moor three months later.
Northern Ireland international Duff, 37, has followed Dyche's training methods closely and has gained his own coaching badges in preparation for a future managerial career.
"He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager," he said.
