Who benefits more from The X Factor? Contestants or live guests?

It's over for another year but the X Factor effect will probably last a bit longer in the run-up to the Christmas charts.

But it's not all about the contestants doing well out of it. What about the people who perform live on the show?
This week Mark Ronson clinched his first UK number one with Uptown Funk.
The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version from X Factor runner-up Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week.
The British DJ and producer had given her permission to perform the song during the live shows.
Ed Sheeran is also back in the charts and credits X Factor winner Ben Haenow after he performed Thinking Out Loud on the show.
They both did a duet together on Saturday before Ben was crowned the winner by the public, with 10 million votes cast.
Ed said: "I came back to say thank you 'cause he made me number one again last week."
Thinking Out Loud is currently number three in the Official Singles Chart and X is the UK's number one album.
X hit one million sales - the first to achieve that in a calendar year since Emeli Sande's Our Version Of Events in 2012.
The show has arguably even helped one of its judges.
Cheryl Fernandez-Versini holds the record for the most number ones by a British female artist.
Three of those singles were performed on The X Factor; I Don't Care, Fight For This Love and Promise This.
Even accusations she mimed during the performances hasn't stopped her from getting the top spot.
She also performed Crazy Stupid Love on Britain's Got Talent and she sang Call My Name on The Voice.
Good news for American singer Meghan Trainor too who's now back in the top 10 with All That Bass.
She sang it during the X Factor live final with the three finalists Ben, Fleur and Andrea.
The Official Charts Company says X Factor exposure can have an effect.
These aren't just songs sung during the live shows, but only ones performed at audition stage and ones used at key moments throughout the show as sound beds.
Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company says: "Anecdotally, it often does have an impact on the chart, as does other high-profile TV spots such as Chatty Man, Graham Norton, Strictly but extent of the impact can vary from week to week and artist to artist."
She says Ed Sheeran's songs have been doing particularly well in terms of streaming.
"He broke the record for most number of streams of a track in a week with Thinking Out Loud a few weeks back (with 1.72 million streams)."
But of course it's not just artists who do well.
The actual winner may secure the Christmas number one.
Ben is number one in the iTunes chart with the winner's song, his cover of OneRepublic's Something I Need.
Although most would argue, that when it comes to who benefits the most from X Factor, it's Simon Cowell and his record label Syco.
