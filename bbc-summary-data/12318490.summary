The group, best known for hits such as One Love and All Rise, will sing their new single I Can for the competition in Dusseldorf, Germany.
In 2009, Blue reunited for a series of gigs, four years after disbanding.
Band member Simon Webbe said: "I've always wanted to represent my country, so this is a truly exciting experience for Blue."
The group formed in 2000 and since then have sold more than 13 million records, won two Brit Awards and had three number one singles.
Duncan James said the band are celebrating their 10th year together and thought participating in the annual contest seemed "a great way to mark the occasion".
A one-hour documentary, showing Blue's preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest, will be broadcast on BBC One in April.
It will feature them recording the single, travelling to Europe to promote the entry, and receiving advice from fellow artists in the music business.
BBC head of entertainment and events Katie Taylor said: "We're enormously pleased to have found an act that not only meets but exceeds all the criteria for a great entry.
"Blue are the perfect choice and we're so proud to have them representing us at this year's Eurovision Song Contest."
Last year Germany's entry Lena Mayer-Landrut, emerged triumphant at the  Eurovision Song Contest.
Teenager Josh Dubovie, who represented the UK with a song penned by Pete Waterman, scored just 10 points, coming last.
The Eurovision Song Competition will take place on 14 May and be broadcast live on BBC One, with commentary by Graham Norton.
