Summer's mother Corrina Seymour told the court that since her daughter's death "there is no joy anymore".
She said: "We go through the motions of life but we are not really living. Every day is another day closer to being with Summer again."
The court heard Summer and Jake had been part way across the road when they were hit by Brown's single-decker bus.
Summer died at the scene while Jake suffered "potentially life changing and extremely serious injuries", spending 11 days in intensive care after the crash.
The bus was travelling at about 10mph when it struck the teenagers.
Prosecutor Gordon Stables said Brown would have had seen the couple about six seconds before hitting them.
He said: "It is the Crown's case that the defendant should and would have seen the children had he been concentrating properly on his driving, and could have stopped the bus prior to the point of impact and or steered away.
"Although dressed in dark clothing, the area was well lit and the children were there to be seen."
Jailing Brown, Judge Paul Watson QC said: "Both young people would have been in your sight and capable of being seen for several seconds .
"It is clear to me that you took little or no till it was far, far too late.
"The only conclusion to which I can come, given you are an otherwise conscientious and careful driver is that you were distracted by something rather than concentrating on your driving."
Through his barrister David McGonigal, Brown said he was "deeply sorry".
"Speaking after the sentencing Jake said the incident had had a "huge impact on mine and my family's lives and left Summer's family and friends devastated".
"Ultimately, today's sentence will not undo that," he said.
"I just hope drivers take more responsibility for their actions in future."
