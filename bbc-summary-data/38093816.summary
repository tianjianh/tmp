Coalville driver endures 'nightmare' parking fine saga

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver has won an 18-month "nightmare" battle over £1,000 parking fines on a car he no longer owned.

Andrew Horrobin, from Coalville, Leicestershire, sold his Renault in November 2014 but months later it was caught parked in a Sheffield bus lane.
Sheffield City Council said it twice sent bailiffs to Mr Horrobin's home after he had failed to make contact.
Mr Horrobin insisted he got in touch but once a deadline had been missed no-one would listen to his explanation.
The car was found illegally parked on 16 February 2015 and two £60 fines were issued.

Mr Horrobin, who has been left disabled from nerve and muscle problems, admitted he made mistakes with his documents and missed an appeal deadline.
But he said he tried to write, telephone and even travelled to Sheffield to visit the council with DVLA confirmation he sold the vehicle, without success.
"It's been a nightmare and depressing," he said. "You don't dare go out in case someone comes and takes your things, not that I have that much.
"People are putting that much pressure on you to pay stupid amounts of money when it's not you.
"Then they're saying to you when you ring them up, 'Well we've started chasing you, we're paid money to chase you, we're going to pursue you'."
He went to court to try to fight the fines - with the total cost rising to just over £1,000.
The council said at the time of the offence it was told by the DVLA Mr Horrobin was the registered keeper.
Mazher Iqbal, city cabinet member for transport, said: "We wrote to him on several occasions but those letters weren't responded to, leading us towards enforcement action.
"We always take this step as an absolute last resort.
"After being notified of impending enforcement, Mr Horrobin made us aware of the error, we investigated and have cancelled the penalty charges."
The DVLA has been unable to confirm when it updated its details on the sale.
