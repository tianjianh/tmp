Michael Clarke: Australia captain ruled out of ODIs v Pakistan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia captain Michael Clarke has been ruled out of October's one-day series against Pakistan in the UAE with a "significant" hamstring injury.

The 33-year-old batsman missed much of the recent tour of Zimbabwe, when George Bailey led the side.
Australia physio Alex Kountouris said: "The scans show tendon damage, which complicates the recovery."
The limited-overs series starts with a Twenty20 in Dubai on 5 October, followed by three ODIs.
The sides then meet in two Tests, for which Clarke - a veteran of 105 Tests and 237 one-day internationals - will be assessed nearer the time.
It marks the start of a busy period for Australia, who play South Africa at home in three T20s and five ODIs in November.
They also welcome India for four Tests before staging a triangular one-day tournament involving England and India in January.
They then host the World Cup, with their first game against England in Melbourne on 14 February.
