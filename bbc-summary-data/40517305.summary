Richard Smith, 37, flew the device over restricted airspace at Wellesbourne Airfield, in Warwickshire, as well as over homes and a school.
The drone had been modified to increase its flight distance capabilities, Warwickshire Police said.
Smith, of Alcester Road, Stratford-upon-Avon, admitted 15 offences under the Air Navigation Order 2016.

He was fined Â£259, ordered to pay costs of Â£185 and a Â£30 victim surcharge at Leamington Spa Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The drone was also seized.
Police said the offences took place over the course of four drone flights between December 2016 and January 2017.
Officers started investigating after a report of a YouTube video showing drone flights across South Warwickshire.
Warwickshire Police said Smith flew his drone over a mile away from himself where he could not see it.
He also flew it through fog and above the cloud base, as well as within the restricted airspace of Wellesbourne Airfield.
The force said the case was believed to be the first prosecuted by police under the 2016 legislation.
It said previous prosecutions had been carried out under old legislation and led by the Civil Aviation Authority.
