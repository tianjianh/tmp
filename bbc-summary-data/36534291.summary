But the Baby Blacks' win was not enough to keep contention for the title as Ireland U20 topped Pool A by beating Georgia 35-7 in Manchester.
Wales U20 and New Zealand U20 will meet again on Monday 20 June in a 5th-place semi-final.
Dan Jones kicked four Wales penalties and Joe Thomas scored an early try.
But Barrett struck after tries from Sam Nock and Shaun Stevenson.
Barrett is the younger brother of Beauden, who helped the All Blacks beat Wales in last weekend's first Test.
The defeat for Wales' junior team also came as Warren Gatland's senior team hope for redemption following Tuesday's 40-7 setback at Chiefs.
The 12 teams at the Junior World Championship will all battle for ranking positions in play-offs that follow the conclusion of the Pool stage.
The winners of the Wales U20 v New Zealand U20 will face either their Scottish or Australian counterparts in the battle for fifth spot.
