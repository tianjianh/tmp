A red Ford Fiesta travelling north at Drumjohn, near Carsphairn, was in collision with a white Asda delivery van heading south at about 10:40 on Friday.
The van driver Scott Kennedy, 46, was taken by ambulance to Ayr Hospital where he died a short time later.
The Fiesta driver,  50 year old Antony Sztuka, died at the scene.
Both men were from Ayrshire.
The A713 was re-opened around 18:45 hours.
Sgt Billy McEwan, of Police Scotland, said: "We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area of the time of the crash to contact police.
"We know from witnesses already spoken to that there was a white flat-bed pickup truck - the size of a transit van - on the road at the time of the crash.
"We are very keen to speak to the driver as he or she may have information that could prove vital to the investigation."
