Tywyn beach in Gwynedd, Poppit Sands in Pembrokeshire, Porthcawl Marina in Bridgend county and Whitmore Bay and Penarth Marina in Vale of Glamorgan were given the accolade on Thursday.
It takes the total across Wales to 47, up from 41 last year.
Lesley Jones from Keep Wales Tidy said she was "delighted" by the increase.
The blue flag award is run in 49 countries across the world and is managed in Wales by Keep Wales Tidy.
Ms Jones, the charity's chief executive, said: "The coastline is very important for Wales as it boosts local economies and the tourism industry and allows us to showcase our beautiful country."
