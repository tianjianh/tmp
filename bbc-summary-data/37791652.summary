The 25-year-old, whose existing deal was due to expire at the end of next season, took 43 wickets in County Championship Division Two in 2016.
The former England Under-19 player is a product of Gloucestershire's academy.
"He performed with great consistency, scored vital runs down the order and has been an integral part of the team," head coach Richard Dawson said.
