Derby are 10th in the Championship and sacked Steve McClaren on Sunday, five months into his second spell in charge.
Rowett is County's fifth manager in 13 months following Paul Clement, Darren Wassall, Nigel Pearson and McClaren.
Rowett, who was sacked by Birmingham in December, made 120 outings for the Rams from 1995 to 1998 and said he has a "special bond" with the club.
He added: "During that time, we tasted success when we were promoted to the Premiership (1995-96) and moved to Pride Park Stadium under [then-manager] Jim Smith.
"Living in the local area, I understand the expectation of the fan base and it goes without saying that Derby County has fantastic and committed supporters.
"I have coached in the academy in the past so I know the values of the club and I am looking forward to sharing my experience and knowledge of the league with the staff and players."
The ex-Burton Albion manager was also linked with the vacant Norwich job and also held talks with Rangers.
He has brought in Kevin Summerfield as assistant manager, Mark Sale as first-team coach, Kevin Poole as goalkeeping coach and Joe Carnall as head of performance analysis.
Current first-team coach Kevin Phillips will continue as part of the set up but Pascal Zuberbuhler has left his role as goalkeeping coach.
"Gary is being tasked with, and has the full responsibility for, leading our redevelopment programme," said Derby County Chairman Mel Morris.
"He is an exemplar of the qualities and values we want in our team and has clearly demonstrated his abilities to get that from his players too."
