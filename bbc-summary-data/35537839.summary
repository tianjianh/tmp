Cavubati, 28, was also ordered to pay Â£500 costs following a Rugby Football Union disciplinary hearing on Tuesday.
"I would like to apologise to my team-mates, the coaches and supporters," said the Fiji international.
"I was struggling to breathe and reacted in a way I would never normally do. I sincerely apologise to Jebb."
He added: "It was uncharacteristic and this is not the type of player I am."
Cavubati has made 12 appearances in all competitions since joining Warriors in September.
Warriors currently sit 10th in the Premiership table, one point above Irish and bottom-of-the-table Newcastle Falcons.
Worcester Warriors scrum-half Luke Baldwin, signed from Bristol last summer, has signed a new undisclosed-length contract at Sixways.
Baldwin, 25, has started Worcester's last four matches, having taken his chance following injuries to Jonny Arr and Charlie Mulchrone.
"As a young English nine Luke Baldwin has got potential," director of rugby Dean Ryan told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"At the moment he's got a great chance to show himself in the Premiership and he's maximising his opportunity."
