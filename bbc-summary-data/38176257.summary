Queen of the South have appointed East Fife boss Gary Naysmith as their new manager.

Naysmith, 38, will take over at Scottish Championship Queens following the Fifers' Scottish Cup replay against Edinburgh City on Monday.
The former Everton, Hearts and Scotland player took over at Bayview Stadium in 2013, having joined East Fife as a player earlier that year.
"I'm thrilled to be taking over at Queens," said Naysmith.
"They are a decent sized club with plenty of potential.
"I've loved my time at East Fife and thank them for giving me the opportunity, but I'm delighted to be making the move back to a full-time club and being able to work with the players on a daily basis.
"Queens have some decent players within the squad and I'm looking forward to working with them to achieve success."
The Palmerston club are currently sixth in the second tier, five points off the promotion play-off places, with coaches Jim Thomson and Graeme Robertson again looking after the team for Saturday's trip to Dumbarton following Gavin Skelton's resignation in early November.
East Fife are second bottom of League One, having won promotion last season.
Assistant manager Dougie Anderson is making the switch from Methil along with Naysmith.
Queens chairman Billy Hewitson added: "We are delighted to welcome Gary to Palmerston. With his involvement at another club, it's been a complicated process and not as straight forward as some would've liked, but we feel we have appointed the right person and we look forward to working with him."
