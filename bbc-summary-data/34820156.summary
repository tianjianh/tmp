A policeman has run 31 miles - visiting every police station in Wirral in Merseyside - in memory of PC Dave Phillips, who was killed in October.

The 34-year-old father died after being hit by a vehicle that mounted a central reservation on 5 October.
His colleague Sgt Chris Smith took four hours to complete the run, which is five miles longer than a marathon.
"It's just a way of showing my support to him and his family, and to say that he won't be forgotten," he said.
Donations for the run - between Heswall police station and PC Phillips's base at Wallasey - will go towards a fund in memory of the dead policeman.
PC Phillips's sister Hannah Whieldon said: "We want to try and invest back in the area the way Dave would have done - he was very much community-spirited, community-minded and he loved his job and he loved the area.
"And we're trying to make that live on as much as we can, and people like Chris doing what he does helps us amazingly."
Clayton Williams, of Wheatland Lane, Wallasey, has been charged with PC Phillips's murder. The 18-year-old has also been charged with burglary, aggravated theft of a motor vehicle and attempting to wound another police officer.
Five other people have been charged with offences in connection with PC Phillips's death.
