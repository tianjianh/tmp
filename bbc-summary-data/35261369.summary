Swansea City interim boss Alan Curtis has not ruled out staying in charge beyond the summer.

Curtis was appointed until the end of the season after picking up five points from five games as caretaker following Garry Monk's sacking.
The 61-year-old former Wales forward says his focus is avoiding the drop, not taking over full-time.
"It's difficult to say, in the past I've never seen myself as a manager, but you can quickly change," he said.
"I suppose once you get tasked with the opportunity to make sure the club stays in the Premier League obviously you can switch into manager mode.

"It's difficult because I've never really aspired to be a manager, especially a manager in the Premier League.
"We'll see how this period goes, the most important thing is that the club retains its Premier League status.
"These last 18 games are going to be vital to the club and to the surrounding area."

Swansea are one place and two points above the relegation places after 20 games, and face a crucial game at home to fellow strugglers Sunderland on Wednesday, 13 January.
Curtis is confident he can deal with the added pressure of being a manager.
He said: "It's a huge responsibility. It's pressure, but it's the responsibility really that you're tasked with making sure the club stays in the Premier League.
"But I'm quite willing to accept that.
"I don't suppose I was ever in a position where I was going to turn it down because that would have been impossible for me to have made that decision.
"I'm certainly not afraid to make a point.
"Even in the last couple of games I've had to make a point forcibly at half-time or the end of the game if I felt that certain individuals weren't playing particularly well or weren't responding.
"I'm quite comfortable doing that."
Curtis has confirmed that recruitment is under way for the January transfer window provided it's the "right player", stressing he would particularly like to sign a striker.
He does not believe the absence of a permanent manager will discourage potential recruits, and is confident of attracting players of the quality needed to steer the club to safety.
"A lot of people want to play in the Premier League these days," added Curtis.
"I still think our reputation as a club, as a team that tries to play football, would be inviting to any player who would want to come here."
