Kath Cassidy has served beverages to dozens of home and away players, managers and journalists at St James' Park since 1963.
To celebrate her retirement, the 88-year-old will be a special guest at the club's game against Norwich on Sunday.
Tributes have poured in from the likes of Alan Shearer, Kevin Keegan, Arsene Wenger, and Sir Alex Ferguson.
The club described her as "legendary" and "much loved".
Kevin Keegan said: "Players can be replaced, managers can be replaced, but people like you, Kath, are irreplaceable."
Sir Alex said: "Serving tea to the media cannot be an easy job so you well and truly deserve a long and happy retirement."
