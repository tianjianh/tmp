The 15-year-old was aiming to add the under-21 title to the under-18 title he had already won at the championships.
He had beaten fellow Welshman, 18-year-old Tyler Rees in the semi-final.
Page is now in the senior men's event in Cyprus with a game against Bulgaria's Viktor Iliev on Monday.
In February Page reached the third round of the Welsh Open in Cardiff before losing to Judd Trump.
