The £40m Bournemouth International Growth programme (BIG) will see roads, cycle routes and bus services around the airport improved by 2021.
Projects include 60 hectares of land near the airport at Aviation Business Park being released for new businesses.
A development of 350 new homes at Parley Cross also feature in the project.
The Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) said the programme could generate up to 10,000 local jobs over a decade.
Gordon Page, Dorset LEP chairman said: "Bournemouth International Growth programme is undoubtedly Dorset's most important and bold economic development project this decade."
The money will come from the £79m secured by Dorset LEP through the government's Growth Deal.
Dorset LEP was awarded £66.4m in July 2014 and an additional £12.6m was awarded in January 2015.
The A338 Bournemouth Spur Road rebuild is the first of the projects by DLEP in the programme to get under way.
The £22m scheme, due to finish in June, has been funded through £19.8m from the Dorset LEP and £2.2m from Dorset County Council.
