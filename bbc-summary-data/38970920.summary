In total, about 300 performers are expected on 12 different stages throughout the festival.
Co-director Meredith Langley-Vine said: "We can't believe the amazing amount of talented and revered artists coming to this year's Eden Festival.
"It really is starting to attract a stampede of established acts as the festival grows and evolves."
