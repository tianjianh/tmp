FA Cup first round: How to follow on BBC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2015-16 FA Cup proper is already under way, with more action to be broadcast across the BBC this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Non-league Salford City, part-owned by five former Manchester United players, have already caused a huge upset by beating League Two Notts County 2-0.
Following six rounds of qualifying, 32 non-league clubs remain and they are two victories away from a potential meeting with a Premier League club.
You can follow all the action on BBC television, radio and online.
BBC coverage highlights over the weekend include:
The lowest-ranked team left in the competition are Didcot Town, who play in Southern Division One South & West - the eighth tier of English football. They host League Two side Exeter City, who lost at this stage last season to an eighth-tier team, Warrington.
Bradford City, who have enjoyed remarkable cup success in recent years and beat Chelsea on their way to reaching the quarter-finals last season, travel to National League side Aldershot Town.
Wigan, who won the cup in 2013, visit fellow League One side Bury, while 2008 winners Portsmouth host Macclesfield Town.

National League North side Worcester City will be hoping for a repeat of last season's heroics when they face League One outfit Sheffield United. At this stage of last year's competition, Worcester produced one of the season's biggest upsets as they won 2-1 at League One side Coventry City.
There are six all non-league ties, meaning there will be at least six teams from outside the Football League in the second-round draw.
The draw for the second round takes place on Monday, 9 November, with live coverage on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website from 19:00 GMT.
The show will come live from London-based Civil Service FC, who played in the first staging of the FA Cup in 1871.
Mark Chapman will be joined by former FA Cup winner Garth Crooks, who will help conduct the draw.
