The death of a man whose near-complete skeleton was found at the side of a motorway is not being treated as suspicious, police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A single human bone was first found in March close to junction 45 of the M1 in woods near Temple Newsam, Leeds.
Searches at the scene in April later revealed most of a skeleton.
West Yorkshire Police said the man had now been identified as coming from eastern Europe. No further details have been released.
