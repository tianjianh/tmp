Inverness Caledonian Thistle ensured Kilmarnock remain in relegation danger after a victory that turned on a red card for goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald.

The visitors led 1-0 at half-time from Kallum Higginbotham's smart finish.
But when MacDonald pulled down Ross Draper and was sent off after 55 minutes, Greg Tansey's equaliser from the spot changed the game's dynamic.
Draper flicked home after a corner to put Caley ahead before Danny Williams wrapped up victory three minutes later.
The win lifted Inverness 11 points clear of Kilmarnock in 11th place with four games to go, to all but end any lingering fears of dropping into the play-offs.
But the visitors, who remain four points adrift of Hamilton ahead of their game against Dundee United, will have cause to regret Conrad Balatoni's disastrous back-pass, which effectively forced MacDonald into bringing Draper down for the game-changing penalty.
Kilmarnock appeared fortunate to escape an early red card when Miles Storey tried to outmuscle Mark O'Hara and went to ground, but referee John Beaton waved away the Inverness striker's claim.
The visitors' first real threat saw Greg Kiltie's powerful shot from distance off target, while a Storey burst for the hosts saw Williams, playing in a more offensive role, bend an effort away from MacDonald, who did well to save.
Gary Warren and Williams both had decent opportunities before Draper wasted a great chance, waiting for the ball to drop after a corner but only clipping the post with MacDonald racing towards him.
Tansey was fortunate to escape a red card when he blatantly pulled Kris Boyd back after already being booked.
Against the run of play, Kilmarnock pounced with a wonderful goal just before half-time.
Kiltie found Higginbotham on the left edge of the area. Tansey allowed him to cut inside and he curled a wonderful shot right-footed into the far corner
Kilmarnock seemed to be on course for a morale-boosting result until Balatoni tried to roll the ball back to MacDonald, Draper nipping in and Tansey confidently dispatching the penalty after Conor Brennan replaced the departed MacDonald in goal.
Despite that, a wonderful curling long range free-kick from Boyd nearly eased Kilmarnock ahead but his effort smacked off the post and Rory McKenzie was off target with the rebound.
Josh Meekings nodded wide with the goal gaping before Kilmarnock failed to clear an out-swinging corner and Draper knocked home from close range.
Williams tucked home his first of the season after a good passing move to increase the hosts' advantage.
Kilmarnock tried to mount a late comeback, Julien Faubert clipping the bar while Boyd was twice narrowly off target, but a self-inflicted defeat may prove costly for their hopes of avoiding that relegation play-off.
