US astronomer resigns over sexual harassment claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prominent US astronomer has resigned from the University of California at Berkeley after the school found he sexually harassed female students.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An investigation found Geoffrey Marcy repeatedly violated the campus sexual harassment policies.
The inquiry was prompted by complaints from students about Mr Marcy from as early as 2001.
He is one of the world's top experts on the planets outside of Earth's solar system.
Mr Marcy has publically apologised for his behaviour, which the university found included unwanted massaging, kissing and groping, in a letter.
"While I do not agree with each complaint that was made, it is clear that my behaviour was unwelcomed by some women," he wrote in the 7 October letter.
"It is difficult to express how painful it is for me to realise that I was a source of distress for any of my women colleagues, however unintentional."
Initially, the university only reprimanded Mr Marcy for his behaviour. However, students and staff criticised that decision and called for Mr Marcy to be fired.
A petition which reads "I support the people who were targets of Geoff Marcy's inappropriate behaviour and those who have spoken publicly about it. I agree that sexual harassment has no place in our community" is signed by more than 2,500 people.
A group of 268 astronomers and physicists wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Times after it published an article it felt was overly sympathetic to Mr Marcy and his wife, who has defended his actions.
