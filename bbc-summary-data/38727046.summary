[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 1-3 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves maintained the momentum from their FA Cup heroics at Liverpool with an eventful win at 10-man Barnsley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kortney Hause put the visitors ahead from close range after a flick-on by Dave Edwards, who then headed a second from Connor Ronan's free-kick.
Alex Mowatt was sent off on his debut for Barnsley, with Tykes manager Paul Heckingbottom then sent to the stands.
Edwards smashed in his second, before Marc Roberts scored a late consolation after Adam Hammill's shot was parried.
Barnsley created several chances to level after falling behind, with stand-in goalkeeper Harry Burgoyne making a fine reaction save to deny Mowatt when put clean through by Marley Watkins.
But it soon turned sour for Mowatt, who signed from Leeds United on Friday, when he was shown a straight red card moments before half-time for a sliding challenge on Jack Price.
Paul Lambert made six changes to the starting XI which won at Anfield, but his side could have had a third before half-time had referee Chris Kavanagh not overturned his own penalty decision when Adam Hammill and Bright Enobakhare tussled in the box.
Barnsley's defence, who have conceded more goals than any other team outside the bottom seven, struggled to cope with set-pieces, particularly from Ronan, who also hit the post.
Heckingbottom had to watch most of a ragged second-half from the Oakwell stands after a tussle in the Wolves dug-out.
The defeat, only Barnsley's second in eight league matches, dropped them a place to eighth, while Wolves moved up to 16th.
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: "It wasn't our night and I am disappointed that we conceded the first two goals like that - and it gave us a mountain to climb. Then came the sending off, so the game was all but over by then.
"The naivety has cost us. That's why we lost. It showed me that we weren't right tonight and we can't keep conceding goals like that."
"I have not seen it again, but on first look it did look like a red card - Alex [Mowatt] has been poor there and let us down. He apologised straight away at half-time. He was up for it, but he's just gone over the edge a little bit."
Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "I thought it was fantastic after coming off the highs of an emotional game on Saturday, possibly the highest emotionally that I can remember.
"The feelings of the players, supporters and staff and everyone was associated with Wolves has been draining after all that had happened at Liverpool, so I decided to change it around, but I thought the three young lads in the team were outstanding.
"This was always going to be a difficult place to come. It was never going to be pretty, it was always going to be direct and the Championship is like that, but I thought we were terrific."
