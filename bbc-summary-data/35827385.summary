Morgan Huelin trial: Lawyers call for case to be dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers for five Jersey teenagers on trial in connection with the death of a schoolboy have asked for their cases to be dismissed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morgan Huelin, 16, a pupil at Victoria College, Jersey, was found unconscious in a country lane after a party in July last year and died later in hospital.
The boys, who cannot be named, deny perverting the course of justice over the death.
Defence lawyers told Jersey Youth Court the evidence was insufficient.
Mr Huelin died after taking a mixture of drugs at the party, the court has been told.
The trial continues.
