[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Lumb made his first first-class century since September 2013 for Nottinghamshire as Warwickshire's bowlers toiled at Trent Bridge.

After the Bears were all out for 373, Lumb accelerated to a half-century from 48 balls, striking 20 fours in his 108.
Lumb was eventually caught by Rikki Clarke off Jeetan Patel, while opener Steven Mullaney made 56.
Keith Barker (2-57) was the most economical of the Warwickshire bowlers as Notts made it to 316-7 at stumps.
Warwickshire added just one run in 12 deliveries in the morning before Patel lifted Harry Gurney (2-64) to third man.
Nottinghamshire opener Greg Smith (26) was dropped by Jonathan Trott on 10 but failed to capitalise on the chance as he nicked Barker to Clarke in the slips.
Lumb's 98-run stand with Mullaney took Notts to 139-1, the England man hitting Bears captain Chris Woakes (2-89) for three boundaries in five balls.
Mullaney tickled Woakes down the leg-side before Brendan Taylor edged behind off Barker and Riki Wessels was trapped lbw.
Despite the middle-order wobble, Lumb remained patient, scoring just two runs in an hour before moving to his eighth first-class century after tea.
Following on from his 78 at Lord's last week, he eventually edged Patel to slip, leaving the lower order to guide Notts through to the close.
Nottinghamshire's Michael Lumb told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I felt pretty good last week at Lord's and it was nice to get a few on the board but to come back here and get three figures means a lot. Hopefully it can contribute to a win.
"It's been a long time since my last one. It's been a strange couple of years, last year with injury and I struggled the year before, so it's been a long time coming, with a lot of hard work.
"It's a tough game and you need a little bit of luck. There was an early edge. There was a scratch on the bat that wasn't held but that's the way it goes.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM:
"The day ebbed and flowed. There were really good passages of play from both teams and we've come out pretty evenly balanced.
"The pitch was better to bat on. It didn't seam around as much but maybe that's to be expected and I do think it will deteriorate.
"There was some up and down movement, which isn't going to get easier to bat on and certainly there's some spin to keep Jeetan Patel interested."
