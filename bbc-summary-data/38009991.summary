On the first anniversary of the Fresh Start agreement, James Brokenshire insisted Stormont is in a better, more stable place than it has been for some time.
Mr Brokenshire said he was "encouraged by the significant progress made."
He also emphasised there was still work to be done.
In September Mr Brokenshire said he was considering moving the debate about legacy issues into a more public phase.
There has not yet been any sign of a consultation.
"I'm very clear on the need to make progress but doing this in a way that is able to command support," he said.
"It's very easy to come forward with proposals but if they're unlikely to get the broad political consensus to enable them to happen I think that isn't the right approach, it's why I had been methodical in the approach that I've taken. "
The secretary of state also rejected any accusations from republican and victims' groups that he is "hiding behind national security issues".
"I don't accept the suggestion that the UK government would be hiding behind national security.
"I've said very clearly this is not about trying to hide embarrassment or anything of that nature.
"It is about how we  protect peoples' lives and the responsibility that I hold as secretary of state in that regard.
The Secretary of State also said that progress has been made on a range of issues, including
Mr Brokenshire added that there has been "significant progress in the past year in combating paramilitarism".
"New measures were agreed to enhance law enforcement aimed at tackling cross-border organised crime linked to paramilitarism and a Joint Agency Task Force was established to take this forward in December last year.
"The same month, a three-person panel was appointed by the Executive with the task of recommending a strategy to disband paramilitary groups.
"Their report was published in June, and the Executive has now published an action plan based on it. There's also now an obligation on Assembly Members to pledge to tackle organised crime and paramilitary activity," he added.
"The UK Government has also signed a treaty with the Irish government to establish an Independent Reporting Commission. This is an international body established to promote progress towards ending paramilitary activity, which is due to be in place by the end of the year."
