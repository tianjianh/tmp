The route 26 bus to Hackney Wick, a hybrid bus, was outside Liverpool Street Station when smoke started pouring out before catching fire.
London Fire Brigade was called just before 10:00 BST and put out the flames and cleared up the fuel spillage.
Ben Lewis, a local resident, who filmed the fire and explosion said people were left "aghast" at the sight.
No one was on board and the driver had left the bus.
London Fire Brigade said 50% of the energy-efficient hybrid bus was damaged by the fire, the cause of which is not yet known.
Bishopsgate was closed between Threadneedle Street and Wormwood Street until about 14:25 BST.
Tony Akers, Transport for London's head of bus operations, said: "At approximately 9.55am on Sunday 2 October, a route 26 double-decker hybrid bus, operated by CT Bus, suffered a fire at Bishopsgate Junction.
"No passengers were on board at the time, and the driver alighted safely. There will be a full investigation into the incident."
Ben Lewis, an engineer who lives in the area, was filming the bus fire when there was "a little explosion".
Mr Lewis said he had just come out of a supermarket when he saw the bus in flames, but decided "it's time to leave" after the explosion.
"Everybody seemed aghast, motionless. It's not something you see every day in London."
Isabelle Kiff who had planned to board the bus said: "Corner of Camomile Street and Bishopsgate near Liverpool Street station.
"I turned the corner and saw the bus I was planning to get on in flames.
"The police then arrived and told everyone to move away then the fire fighters arrived and started putting it out."
