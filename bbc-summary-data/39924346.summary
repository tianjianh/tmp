Some 30 young people targeted officers and vehicles during the seizure of drugs at a house in the city's Carnhill area, at about 18:00 BST on Sunday.
The PSNI found suspected Class A and B drugs, prescription medicines and drugs' paraphernalia, as well as a number of electronic storage devices.
About 200 bystanders watched the operation.
Det Insp Tom McClure said the investigation was ongoing.

The PSNI have appealed for information.
