Guernsey coastal repairs to cost extra £2m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost £2m is needed to complete repairs to Guernsey's sea defences after damage caused by the winter storms.

This includes significant work at Vazon and Fermain after both sea walls were breached.
The Environment Department has already spent its £77,000 annual budget for coastal defence maintenance.
Minister Roger Domaille said his department did not have the money and had asked the treasury to release it.
He said: "I should imagine they will say yes, if they are to say no I think they may have some problems... we'd have to take the matter to the States."
The Treasury and Resources Department has yet to comment on funding the repairs.
Last year the Environment Department was given £20m to improve coastal defences.
However, Deputy Domaille said this was earmarked to improve defences at three key areas - Belle Greve, the Bridge and Perelle - identified in a report as open to significant coastal flooding so could not be used for the repair work.
