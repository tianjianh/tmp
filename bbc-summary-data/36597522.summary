[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have made two changes for the final Test against New Zealand in Dunedin on Saturday with Rob Evans and Tomas Francis joining the front row.

Loose-head prop Evans replaces the injured Gethin Jenkins, while Francis comes in for Samson Lee at tight-head.
Centre Jamie Roberts starts after going through return-to-play protocols following a blow to the head last week.
The All Blacks have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series and Warren Gatland's side are looking to avoid a whitewash.
The tourists began the three-Test series with a 39-21 defeat at Eden Park, before a 36-22 loss in Wellington last weekend.
Wales have lost 28 consecutive matches against the world champions, with their last win coming in 1953.
Second-row Jake Ball is on the bench after recovering from soreness and a dislocated finger, with props Lee and Aaron Jarvis joining the replacements.
Wales are without injured forwards Jenkins, Bradley Davies and Josh Turnbull who have returned to the UK.
British and Irish Lions prop Jenkins, 35, suffered a calf injury in Wellington, while lock Davies has a knee concern.
Back-row Turnbull picked up a shoulder injury in the 40-7 loss to the Chiefs.
Wales coach Warren Gatland commented: "We have played some good rugby in the first two Tests and we want to finish the tour on Saturday with an 80 minute performance that we are happy with.
"We improved going into the second Test and fought to the end and this weekend we have to have the belief and confidence that we can take the victory.
"Playing under the roof in Dunedin will be a great atmosphere and a quick track and we need to take our game to the All Blacks."
New Zealand have made five starting changes for the game, with Beauden Barrett replacing Aaron Cruden at fly-half.
New Zealand: Israel Dagg; Ben Smith, George Moala, Ryan Crotty, Julian Savea; Beauden Barrett, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Dane Coles, Charlie Faumuina, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Elliot Dixon, Sam Cane, Kieran Read (capt).
