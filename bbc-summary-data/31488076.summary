Worcestershire have made their first overseas signing of 2015 by re-signing New Zealand all-rounder Colin Munro for this summer's T20 Blast.

Munro, 27, made 332 runs at an average of 27.67, finishing the county's second-highest scorer, as the Rapids reached the quarter-finals last summer.
He also took seven wickets at an economy rate of 9.27 runs per over.
Worcestershire have already revealed that they are keen to bring Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal back to New Road.
Ajmal is now available once more, having had his remodelled action approved by the International Cricket Council.
"To be the second overseas player, as the T20 player, it takes a special breed," said Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes.
"You don't play a lot of cricket and you can end up having quite a bit of time on the sidelines for a T20 hit once a week.
"You need the right type of cricketer for that - one that has an understanding of the club and dressing room and Colin has got that.
"He was very helpful towards our Second XI players and played in the second team to make sure he kept in nick.
"He is a very dangerous and devastating player in T20 cricket. He's a powerful hitter. He can disrupt a spinner, and therefore disrupt the pattern and game-plan of the opposition."
Munro added: "I said when I left last summer that I'd love to come back and play for Worcestershire again. It was an awesome experience.
"To beat Notts at Trent Bridge was a huge scalp and to beat Northants - the then holders - twice and Warwickshire at home were also great nights."
Worcestershire have never been beyond the last eight in 12 years of domestic Twenty20 cricket, but two quarter-final appearances in three years does hint at an upturn in fortunes, especially if they can keep Ajmal for the entire tournament.
