[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Below is a summary of the seven defendants:
Rebekah Brooks
Andy Coulson
Stuart Kuttner
Clive Goodman
Mark Hanna
Cheryl Carter
Charlie Brooks
Rebekah Brooks, nee Wade, was chief executive of Rupert Murdoch’s News International when the phone-hacking allegations broke in 2010.
A former News of the World editor, she had become one of Mr Murdoch’s trusted lieutenants having risen through the ranks of the family’s newspapers with astonishing speed.
In 2000 she became the youngest editor of a British national newspaper and went on to launch the controversial Sarah's Law campaign in which the paper began naming sex offenders. Three years later, she became the first female editor of the Sun before becoming News International’s chief executive in 2009.
Charges: Phone hacking, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice
Verdict: Not guilty of all charges
Andy Coulson stepped down as Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director in 2011, stating the row over phone hacking was stopping him giving the '110%' he needed in the job.
His role at the heart of government was far removed from his beginnings on the Basildon Evening Echo. The local news reporter went on to join the Sun and rose rapidly through the ranks of News International. He became the News of the World’s deputy editor in 2000 and succeeded Rebekah Brooks as editor three years later.
In 2007 he became director of communications for the Conservative Party before taking up the same role for Number 10 in 2010 after the general election.
Charges: Phone hacking, misconduct in a public office
Verdicts: Guilty of phone hacking, jury failed to reach verdicts on misconduct charges
Stuart Kuttner held a number of senior roles at the News of the World before retiring in 2009. He was the newspaper's managing editor for 22 years and had been its deputy editor prior to that.
Alongside Rebekah Brooks, Mr Kuttner was closely involved with the campaign for Sarah's Law, which saw the paper push for parental access to the sex offenders register following the murder of seven-year-old Sarah Payne.
Charge: Phone hacking
Verdict: Not guilty
Clive Goodman was the News of the World’s royal editor until 2007. Mr Goodman had begun his career on the Daily Mail before joining the News of the World. He stayed at the tabloid for almost two decades. Among his many royal exclusives was the breakdown of the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
Charges: Misconduct in a public office
Verdicts: Jury discharged after failing to reach verdicts
Mark Hanna was head of security at News International for more than four years and has had almost two decades of experience in the security industry, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He joined the Murdoch company in 2009 from the Japanese investment bank Nomura International, where he was vice-president (security).
He has a military background and has been on the editorial board of Professional Security magazine, according to SecurityNewsDesk - a website covering security industry news.
Charge: Perverting the course of justice
Verdict: Not guilty
Cheryl Carter, an executive assistant, had worked for Mrs Brooks for almost two decades.
She had been Mrs Brooks's PA when she was editor of the News of the World and the Sun. She continued in the role when Mrs Brooks was promoted to the News International chief executive's role in 2009.
Ms Carter had also worked for ex-News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and former deputy editor Neil Wallis. She was also beauty editor at the Sun, another News International title.
Charge: Perverting the course of justice
Verdict: Not guilty
Charlie Brooks, along with his wife Rebekah, are regarded as key members of the “Chipping Norton set” - a network of powerful figures in media, politics and entertainment living close to each other in the Oxfordshire countryside. Among them is David Cameron, whom Mr Brooks knows from his schooldays at Eton. The Top Gear presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, first introduced the Brookses to each other at a party.
Mr Brooks married Rebekah Wade, as she then was, in June 2009. In January 2012, Mr and Mrs Brooks became parents by a surrogate mother.
Mr Brooks has been involved in horse racing for most of his life, first as a stable hand and amateur jockey and then as a racehorse trainer. He has also written a novel and a racing column for the Daily Telegraph.
Charge: Perverting the course of justice
Verdict: Not guilty
