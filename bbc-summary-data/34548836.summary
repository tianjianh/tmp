[SN]TITLE[SN]
Number of pub and bar licences in Cardiff defended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claims there are "too many" pubs and bars in central Cardiff have been defended by the city's council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Sophie Howe said Cardiff has reached "saturation point".
She said licences had been granted that the force "haven't necessarily agreed with".
On Friday, the council said it only granted licences in a "saturation zone" when applicants show there will be no negative impact.
After a summit into recent alleged sex attacks in the city, Ms Howe pointed out there are 299  licensed premises in Cardiff's central square mile.
"It is the highest concentration of licensed premises anywhere in the UK," she said.
The council said police and other responsible authorities were notified of every licence application.
Any objections must relate to the authority's licensing objectives.
These include the prevention of crime and disorder, the prevention of public nuisance, public safety and the protection of children from harm.
"If relevant representations are received, the licensing sub-committee must consider the application and the relevant representations made," the council said.
"The policy of the authority in general is that we will not permit any further premises to be licensed for the sale of alcohol in areas designated in a saturation zone unless the applicant is able to demonstrate that there will be no negative impact on one or more of the licensing objectives."
Thursday's summit was attended by figures from the police, the council, the city's universities and businesses.
It followed three sexual assaults alleged to have taken place near Cardiff University Students' Union during freshers' fortnight.
