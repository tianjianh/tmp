Sushma Swaraj tweeted that the number of Indians who had died now stood at 101. Thirty two others are missing.
The Saudi authorities put the total death toll at 769 but foreign media reports and officials put the figure at well over 1,000.
It is the deadliest incident to occur during the pilgrimage in 25 years.
Ms Swaraj had earlier tweeted that Indian authorities were "doing everything to locate our people".
At least 76 Pakistani have also died in the stampede, reports say.
The crush happened as two large groups of pilgrims converged as they were taking part in one of the Hajj's major rites.
The Saudis have been criticised over their handling of security and the slow publication of casualty figures.
The nationality with the highest toll, with at least 464 dead, is Iran, and Iranian officials allege that the overall number of deaths is now more than 1,000.
Pakistan, India, and Indonesia have also suggested that the death toll may be higher than the 769 reported by Saudi Arabia.
BBC Monitoring puts the death toll at 1,216, based on official statements and media reports from 34 countries who lost citizens in the stampede.
