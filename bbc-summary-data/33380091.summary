Eve Watson's close range header nine minutes before half time sealed the win in front of 1500 people at Springfield.
The hosts withstood sustained pressure from their opponents in the second half to prevail in their debut final.
Aland had won gold in each of the last three Island Games they had played in, having not been beaten since losing to the Faroe Islands in 2005.
"We're so happy we could win gold on our home turf in front of our home fans," said Jersey midfielder Libby Barnett.
"We've been so positive the whole time, we've always said we wanted a medal, and it's even sweeter that it's gold.
"After getting into the final the only thing we set our sights on was gold and we're over the moon," she added.
Jersey needed a last-minute winner to beat Greenland 3-2 in their opening match, before beating Hitra 2-1 to top their group.
Their 3-1 win over Gotland on Thursday in the semi-final ensured a first-ever appearance in an Island Games final.
"The crowd deserve a big gold medal," added captain Jodie Botterill.
"We've had tough times in this tournament and the crowd has really lifted us," she added.
