Brexit: Raymond McCord can take case to Supreme Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A victims campaigner is to be allowed to take his legal challenge to the way the government plans to quit the European Union to the Supreme Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raymond McCord had challenged the government's plans for triggering Article 50.
He argued that the UK could not leave the EU without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.
Although the UK voted overall to leave the EU, a 56% majority in Northern Ireland wanted to remain.
NI Attorney General John Larkin has already referred a judicial review of the Brexit process, brought by some Stormont politicians, to the UK's Supreme Court.
In a separate development, the Scottish and Welsh governments are also to be permitted to intervene in the Supreme Court battle over how Brexit should be triggered.
On Friday, senior judges in Belfast agreed to refer Mr McCord's case to the Supreme Court.
A hearing is due to get under way on 5 December, lasting four days.
"This is a major step forward for our people and for victims," Mr McCord said outside court.
"The three judges believe I have a right to an opinion, unlike political people who have criticised me."
His solicitor added: "Essentially the question posed is whether or not there can be any Brexit for Northern Ireland, based on the fact we have our own constitution consisting of the Northern Ireland Act and the Good Friday Agreement."
