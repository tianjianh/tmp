The incident happened near Swatragh on Wednesday.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) has said it is investigating the death and has issued a reminder to farmers to think about safety.
A spokesperson for the HSENI said: "Our deepest sympathy is with the bereaved family at this sad time.
"Given the recent tragic deaths on Northern Ireland farms, HSENI is strongly appealing to the farming community to always prioritise safety and think safe before starting any job on the farm."
East Londonderry DUP MLA, Adrian McQuillan, also expressed his sympathies to the family.
He said: "This news is very shocking to the entire close-knit community of Garvagh and the surrounding areas.
"The family were well-known in the farming community and I understand the woman in her 70's was killed by cattle on the family farm.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the family during this deeply distressing time."
SDLP councillor, Roisin Loftus, said people in Garvagh are "in shock" at what has happened.
"To lose a friend and well known member of the community in these circumstances is an absolute tragedy,"
She added: "The victim was a hard working farmer all her life. It just demonstrates again the dangers that farm workers face, particularly at this time of year.
"I would encourage all farm workers to exercise extra caution, the last thing this community needs is another tragedy."
