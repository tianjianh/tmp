Mexican computer hackers have taken over at least ten government and other websites in a political protest marking the country's independence day.

The hackers - calling themselves Mexican Cyber Protest - targeted websites of political parties, media organisations and government agencies.
Hacked pages were replaced with a message denouncing the recent presidential election as fraudulent.
They also complained about corruption, drug-related violence and the economy.
Among the sites targeted were those of the conservative PAN party in Yucatan state and the regional newspaper Los Informantes.
"This is a peaceful cyber protest," the statement posted by the hackers reads.
"We are not criminals, we are students, workers and productive Mexicans who are fed up and looking for a way to express our disagreement," it adds.
The message calls President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto an "imposed president",  saying Mexico's democracy was "stolen" in July's election.
It also attacks outgoing President Felipe Calderon, accusing him of mismanaging the economy and unleashing a wave of violence by confronting drug cartels.
The criticism of the presidential election result echoes complaints made by the left-wing runner-up, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who accused Enrique Pena Nieto of buying votes and media coverage.
But last month Mexico's highest electoral court rejected those allegations, saying there was not enough evidence to support them.
Enrique Pena Nieto is due to be sworn in as president on 1 December.
His inauguration will mark a return to power for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico for 71 years until 2000.
