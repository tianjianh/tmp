While in Rome, Mr Obama will meet Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and Prime Minister Enrico Letta.
He will visit the Netherlands for a nuclear security summit, and will meet Nato and Belgian officials in Belgium.
Among those Mr Obama is scheduled to meet is Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the White House said.
