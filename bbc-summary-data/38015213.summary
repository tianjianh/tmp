The Gills, who are 17th in League One, were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Brackley Town on Wednesday.
"I woke up shocked, embarrassed, humiliated, disappointed and very angry," Scally told BBC Radio Kent.
"We both recognise there are some serious problems with the team. The manager has to address those issues."
Edinburgh led the Gills to ninth place last season but the club has only recorded five wins from 17 league games this season, and are three points above the relegation zone.
After a meeting with Scally on Monday afternoon, National League North side Brackley put extra pressure on the 46-year-old former Tottenham defender after winning their first-round replay 4-3 after extra time.
Scally said there were "no excuses" for the side's performance.
"Some of the individual performances wouldn't warrant a place in a Sunday pub side," he added.
"We have got a team with no confidence and not able to defend and that was abundantly clear. He [Edinburgh] does have my backing.
"We have got a long season ahead of us and have a team who have talented players, but they are not playing well at the moment."
Scally has confirmed he is in a three-month recovery period after revealing he had a seven-hour heart operation 18 days ago which left him unconscious for 28 hours.
However, he says Gillingham's current form is not aiding his recuperation.
"I'm not supposed to be at work," he said.
"I've been out of hospital 12 days and frankly this whole matter is probably the last thing I needed.
"Watching the [Brackley] game, I would have been better off going to bed before the kick-off and not having the stress and strain that resulted of watching us go out of the FA Cup.
"The last thing my heart consultant said was don't get stressed."
