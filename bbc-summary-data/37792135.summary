The building, Yr Egin, will be located at the University of Wales Trinity St David campus in Carmarthen.
It is due to open in 2018 and should house about 25 companies who it is hoped will contribute Â£11m a year to the local economy.
Seventy five jobs will be relocated, including 55 S4C jobs from Cardiff.
The area where the new building will be located has been earmarked for mixed use development, including 1,100 new homes and a primary school.
A road to the development was also given planning permission.
Council leader Emlyn Dole said: "This is a much-needed development for Carmarthen providing a significant economic boost to the area with major benefits to the local community."
The Welsh-language broadcaster announced plans to move from Cardiff to Carmarthen in March 2014.
