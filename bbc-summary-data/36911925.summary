Rail services from Glasgow Central Station are still facing disruption after an early morning electrical fault in overhead wiring.

ScotRail said five platforms at the station had been affected by the problem, which was reported at 07:00.
Many local services, as well as those bound for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Inverness, were disrupted.
Some services had returned by midday but passengers have been warned to expect ongoing delays.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said: "There are overhead wire problems which are affecting access to five platforms. Engineers are on site to diagnose and repair. It's not possible to say how long disruption to services will last."
She added: "Customers should retain their tickets as the nature of this disruption means they may be entitled to compensation through our Delay Repay scheme."
The electrical issue affected platforms 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 at Glasgow Central and caused cancellations on the Cathcart Circle, Newton, Neilston and Kilmarnock lines.
At the height of the disruption, high-level trains to dozens of stations in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Ayrshire were affected.
ScotRail arranged for train tickets to be used on local FirstBus services to these stations and replacement buses were brought in from Perth and Stirling.
By midday, ScotRail said that engineers were still working to repair damage to overhead electric wires at Glasgow Central Station.
Services on the Cathcart Circle, to Glasgow's south side, remained suspended.
Trains between Glasgow and Lanark, via Motherwell, were running as were services to Neilston, Barrhead and Kilmarnock.
The Glasgow to Edinburgh via Shotts service was also running with delays and alterations expected.
ScotRail said other routes were also operating but warned that "short notice alterations/delays" were possible.
Passengers are urged to check their journey details on the ScotRail website.
