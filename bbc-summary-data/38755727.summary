[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher is urging parents to write to their MP about a possible reduction in funding that could lead to larger class sizes in his school.

Tim Gilson, of Malmesbury School in Wiltshire, said parents should "understand the implications" of the government's schools funding changes.
He said they could also mean fewer textbooks and a smaller range of subjects being taught to pupils.
The Department for Education wants to see a fairer redistribution of funding.
Mr Gilson said he wrote the letter to help parents "understand the implications" of how the change in funding would change how the school is run.
He said: "A number of schools are taking the opportunity at the moment to make their case for additional government funding, and I felt it was important that our voice was heard and parents knew where we sat within that.
"I'm confident we can maintain our standards but we will have to do less, and we have all got used to being able to do something that we're just going to have to stop."
Malmesbury School has been recognised as "outstanding" by the education standards watchdog Ofsted.
The Department for Education said its new national schools funding formula would end the postcode lottery in school funding.
The system is designed to support deprived areas by reallocating existing funding.
Education Secretary Justine Greening said schools were currently receiving record levels of cash.
However, Valentine Mulholland from the National Association of Head Teachers said school funding was "at breaking point".
She said the government's new funding plan could lead to a reduced curriculum in some schools, which is "regrettable if we want an education that is very well-rounded".
