[SN]TITLE[SN]
IPCC probe over man's burn injuries in Plymouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Contact police had with a man before he sustained serious burns is being investigated by the police watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers attended a property in Plymouth after reports of a man with a can of flammable liquid were made by a member of the public.
The man later sustained serious burns and police records indicated a Taser was deployed, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said.
It was referred voluntarily by Devon and Cornwall Police to the IPCC.
The watchdog said the 32-year-old man was taken to the city's Derriford Hospital and has since been transferred to the burns unit at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.
His condition is described as life-changing, but is not considered to be life-threatening.
The IPCC said it believed two police officers attended the address in Honicknowle shortly after 21:00 BST on Thursday.
It added that the investigation would be looking at what extent, if any, police actions caused or contributed to the man's injuries, and whether officers acted in accordance with procedures.
