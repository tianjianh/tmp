Sturridge, 26, scored twice after coming on as 64th-minute substitute as the Reds beat Burton Albion 5-0 in the EFL Cup second round on Tuesday.
Afterwards, Sturridge said he has to "do a job for the team" on the wing but prefers playing as a centre-forward.
"It wasn't a fixed position. Daniel is a very smart player," said Klopp.
"He's good at getting himself into positions where it's not easy to defend.
"There is absolutely no problem."
Divock Origi started Tuesday's game up front for Liverpool, with Sturridge - who also played on the right in Saturday's 2-0 defeat by Burnley - replacing Roberto Firmino.
"Of course it is more difficult for me to play wide," said Sturridge. "I'm a centre-forward.
"I have to do a job for the team. That's not saying I am happy to do it.
"That's saying I have got to do a job for the team. It's a team game. If I am put in that position, I have to play there."
