Promotion-chasing Walsall suffered late heartbreak as League One strugglers Blackpool snatched a dramatic leveller.

The Seasiders went close in the first half through Jack Redshaw, who forced a fine save from Neil Etheridge.
Walsall took a 66th-minute lead when Anthony Taylor's cross-shot found Jason Demetriou at the far post for a tap-in.
But Uche Ikpeazu's free-kick deflected into the path of Danny Philliskirk, who poked into an empty net to level the scores in injury time.
Third-placed Walsall, who have a rearranged league game at Fleetwood in midweek ahead of next Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at Reading, finished the game without three of their key players.
Top scorer Tom Bradshaw, highly-rated teenage left back Rico Henry and Romaine Sawyers, who was feeling his hamstring, were all substituted.
Walsall head coach Sean O'Driscoll told BBC WM 95.6:

"The players adapted really well to a difficult game. Blackpool were coming off an excellent 5-0 win against Scunthorpe.
"They came full of confidence and you can see from the first half that they were dangerous.
"We evolved as the game went on and controlled the second half. They didn't create a chance apart from the goal."
