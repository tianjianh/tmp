[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-2 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom club Bolton Wanderers converted a 97th-minute penalty to salvage a late draw which stopped Ipswich moving into the Championship play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ipswich led at half-time after Kevin Bru lifted the ball over Bolton keeper Paul Rachubka and in off the crossbar.
Christophe Berra doubled the advantage when he beat Rachubka to head in Ainsley Maitland-Niles' free-kick.
Lawrie Wilson's half-volley gave Bolton hope within 80 seconds, before Stephen Dobbie rolled in the leveller.
Wanderers' hopes of avoiding relegation to League One still look slim, with a 10-point deficit to overturn in their final 10 matches.
Eighth-placed Ipswich are a point from the top six, but have a game in hand over sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday.
The draw provided some cheer for long-suffering Bolton fans, who hope to see their club's off-the-pitch turmoil come to an end next week.
A protracted takeover fronted by former striker Dean Holdsworth is expected to be completed in the coming days.
A winding-up petition against the club has again been adjourned at the High Court to give the consortium time to finalise a takeover.
Bolton manager Neil Lennon: "I'm fed up, frustrated - we've played so well and we missed some gilt-edged chances. The least we deserved was a point.
"We were the better team by a long, long way. Football's about being ruthless and taking your chances, putting teams away when you're in the ascendancy and we didn't do it again tonight.
"I can't be critical of the character of the team and some of the quality of the football was exceptionally good."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "We've all done it; we've all made mistakes. I've made them when I've been a lot older and a lot wiser than Ainsley (Maitland-Niles, who gave conceded the penalty).
"He's a kid, give him a bit of loving. That's what we need to do."
