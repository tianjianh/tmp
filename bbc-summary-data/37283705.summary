[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-year-old boy has been injured in what police are describing as a racially-motivated assault in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy was near Station Avenue South in Fishponds, at 17:30 BST on Monday, when it is believed he was taken by two boys to a building site and assaulted.
He was later helped off the scaffolding by two members of the public before being treated in hospital for face and body injuries.
Police said two boys, aged 12 and 11, were due to be formally interviewed.
The boy was spotted by two women and driven home by them.
Det Insp Steve Cartlidge said: "We're treating this as a racially motivated crime due to words used by the offenders during the assault.
"Any form of hate crime will be thoroughly investigated and we will be supporting the victim's family and keeping them fully informed of our progress."
