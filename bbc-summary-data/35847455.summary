Recruitment of medical staff in Jersey is being hampered by the high cost of living on the island, a report has said.

The health and social services scrutiny panel said working conditions and staff contracts at Jersey General Hospital should improve.
Chairman, Deputy Richard Renouf, said higher salaries would help attract more doctors and nurses to the island.
Health Minister, Senator Andrew Green, said he would consider the report.
Mr Renouf said recruiting staff in Jersey was more difficult due to higher cost of living and uncertainty about accommodation.
He said:  "During the review we found several factors which may deter hospital staff considering relocating to Jersey. One of these factors was the high cost of living.
"If we are to resolve recruitment issues, the issue of pay levels that are appropriate to higher costs of living in Jersey must be addressed."
He said the relative isolation of a small island meant certain specialisms were needed despite low volumes of patients.
