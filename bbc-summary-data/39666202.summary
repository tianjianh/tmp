Brace could become the first Welsh female boxer to win a title if she overcomes Alexandra Vlajk for the WBC International belt on Saturday.
The 26-year-old has won all five of her professional fights to date but says she still has a long way to go.
"There are some fantastic boxers in my category," Brace said.
"'I wouldn't fight her (Nicola Adams) yet. I have a long way to go and so does she. When we fight, it will be a big fight."
Brace, who trains at St Joseph's gym in Newport, faces Vlajk on Saturday in her hometown of Ebbw Vale.
