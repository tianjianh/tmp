[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wood's Dave Stephens saw his ninth-minute header rattle the crossbar, but it was the visitors who struck first as Fiacre Kelleher reacted quickest to a long throw into the penalty area to bundle the ball into the net.
It took just over a minute for the equaliser to arrive as on-loan Wood defender Jamie Turley drew his side level with a close range finish following a goal-mouth scramble inside the Solihull box.
The home side then took the lead in the 38th minute as Bruno Adrade fired in, before veteran striker Paul Benson doubled the host's half-time lead with a stunning overhead kick.
Angelo Balanta added his side's fourth in the second half as he curled an effort beyond Connal Trueman from the edge of the area.
