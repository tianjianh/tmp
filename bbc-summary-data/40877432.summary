Hampshire v Lancashire: No play on final two days at the Ageas Bowl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire and Lancashire's hopes of winning the County Championship title were dealt a blow after the final day at the Ageas Bowl was rained off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lancashire, in second, and third-placed Hampshire are now level on points following the drawn match, but 41 points behind leaders Essex.
The weather, which washed out Tuesday's play, denied Lancashire's Haseeb Hameed (77 not out) the chance of a century.
Lancashire were in a good position at 314-5, 239 ahead, before the rain.
