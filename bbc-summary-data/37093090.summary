[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a four-year-old boy who drowned in a holiday park swimming pool was a "tragic accident", a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luca Hurle died after getting into difficulties in the pool at Old Park Wood, Cumbria, on 8 August.
Senior coroner Andre Rebello concluded Luca, from Newport, Wales, died from an hypoxic brain injury and drowning.
He was pronounced dead the next day "in spite of a valiant effort" to save him, Mr Rebello said.
Although Luca had worn a flotation vest while swimming with his family, the coroner said, he had lost it before being recovered from the pool.
He was taken to hospital in Barrow-in-Furness and was flown to the paediatric intensive care unit at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool.
South Lakeland Council said its investigation into the incident was likely to take "some time".
