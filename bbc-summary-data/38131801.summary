The firm said it has acquired a 25% interest in two Statoil-operated licenses east of Shetland, which include the Jock Scott prospect.
To the west of Shetland, BP has acquired a 40% interest in a Nexen-operated licence, which includes the Craster prospect.
Exploration wells are expected to be drilled in both Jock Scott and Craster in mid-2017.
Mark Thomas, BP North Sea regional president said: "Working together with companies such as Statoil and Nexen to access the North Sea's remaining resource is an important part of our strategy to remain a material North Sea producer, investor and employer for decades to come.
"We look forward to working with both Statoil and Nexen on these exciting prospects."
Over the next 18 months, BP plans to participate in up to five exploration wells in addition to drilling about 50 development wells over the next 3-4 years.
The company is also expecting important new oil production from its major projects Quad204 and Clair Ridge in early 2017 and 2018.
