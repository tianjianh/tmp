Van Praag, 68, has headed the Dutch FA since 2008, and is also vice-president of European football's governing body.
The Dutchman is up against Slovenian FA president Aleksander Ceferin, with the vote taking place on 14 September.
"Mr Van Praag would provide the strong leadership European football requires," said FA vice-chairman David Gill.
"In all, he has a proven track record across domestic and international matters that can only help Uefa go forward."
The announcement comes after Spanish football boss Angel Maria Villar Llona pulled out of the presidency race.
Uefa is seeking a new president after former France midfielder Michel Platini quit on 9 May, after failing to overturn his ban from all football activities.
Platini was found guilty of ethics breaches over a 2m Swiss Franc (Â£1.3m) payment he received from world football's governing body Fifa.
