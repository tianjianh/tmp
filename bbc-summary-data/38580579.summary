What President Obama said in his goodbye speech

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After eight years Barack Obama has given his last speech as President of the United States of America.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a passionate speech that touched on a number of different issues and the hopes that Mr Obama had for the American people.
Here are three of the main issues that President Obama mentioned in his speech:
According to Barack Obama, America is a better place than it was when he first started his Presidency in 2008.
He said that more jobs have been created, America has built better relationships with other countries and gay people have been given the right to get married.
This section of his speech was controversial, as not everyone in America agrees that the things Mr Obama has done as President have made America better. Many people think he's made the country worse.
The people of the United States are very divided and President Obama said several times that he wants all citizens to be treated equally.
He said the American people should stick together.
"For all our outward differences, we are all in this together.... we rise or fall as one."
However he admitted that more needs to be done to help make relationships between different groups of people in America stronger - as the country still suffers from racial prejudice.
That's where people are treated differently because of the colour of their skin or the community they come from.
"Going forward, we must uphold laws against discrimination - in hiring, in housing, in education and the criminal justice system. "
Mr Obama left America with one clear message - to pull together and believe in themselves.
"I am asking you to believe.  Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours."
He asked Americans to take a more active role in how the country is run.
"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life. If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing... Show up. Dive in. Persevere."
President Obama ended his speech the same way he started his campaign more than eight years ago:
"Yes We Can. Yes We Did."
