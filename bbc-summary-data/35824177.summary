New £1.4m fund halt some West Berkshire library closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven libraries and a mobile unit will be saved from closure as part of £1.4m "transitional funding" for public services in West Berkshire.

Councillors announced the plans after threats to cut eight library services in the district in February.
Libraries will receive £475,000 funding over two years, but will transition to a self-service system to save money.
Other services to receive money include bus routes, children's centres and the Newbury Corn Exchange.
West Berkshire Council said nearly half the comments received about the funding were about keeping libraries open.
Council leader Roger Croft said he was "pleased" the district could offer a "lifeline" to public services, but funding will only be provided for two years.
He added: "We need to be clear however that this money is a lifeline which will enable these services to move to a more sustainable funding model. In particular, it will allow us to work with partners, community groups and parishes to secure these services in the long term."
Hungerford-based author Robert Harris said he was "delighted" by the announcement but added libraries may need to become "more community run" to ensure they remain open.
He added: "Ours can't be the generation to let libraries go, and I would be ashamed to be part of that generation."
The plans for funding will be confirmed at a council meeting on 24 March.
