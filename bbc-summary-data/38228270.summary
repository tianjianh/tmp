Paul Dummett & Jonjo Shelvey: Newcastle pair have bans overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle pair Paul Dummett and Jonjo Shelvey have had suspensions withdrawn after winning appeals against their red cards in Friday's 2-1 Championship defeat at Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shelvey was sent off for violent conduct following a first-half clash with Forest's Henri Lansbury.
Dummett was later deemed to have denied a clear goalscoring opportunity.
The incidents resulted in penalties for Forest, both of which were saved by Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow.
However, the league leaders went on to lose the match 2-1.
England midfielder Shelvey and Wales full-back Dummett will now be available for Saturday's home game against Birmingham City.
