[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bordeaux 0-4 Monaco

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radamel Falcao continued his recent revival with his first hat-trick in four years as Monaco thumped Bordeaux to move top of Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monaco, who go above Nice on goal difference, led through Djibril Sidibe's second-minute opener.
Former Manchester United and Chelsea striker Falcao doubled the lead seconds later, and added another five minutes after the break.
The Monaco captain sealed a comfortable win by drilling in a penalty to take his tally to nine goals in seven league games.
Falcao, 30, is beginning to replicate the form which made him one of the most feared strikers in Europe before he sustained a serious knee injury before the 2014 World Cup.
After recovering from tearing his anterior cruciate ligament, he left Monaco to spend the 2014-15 season on loan at Manchester United, and then joined Chelsea last term.
Neither spell was a success though, Falcao scoring four goals in 29 appearances for United and just one in 12 games for the Blues.
But the Colombia international is spearheading a free-scoring Monaco attack that has scored 53 times in 17 matches, giving the team a goal difference of +37.
Nice can regain top spot when they go to defending champions Paris St-Germain on Sunday (19:45 GMT).
