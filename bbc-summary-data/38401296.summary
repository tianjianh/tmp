Halcyon Theuri death: Chef hit by taxi after falling in road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who died after being hit by a taxi while lying in the road had fallen or tripped after a night out, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Halcyon Theuri's head was "struck by a glancing blow" from a vehicle in the early hours of 31 August 2015 in Alfreton, Derbyshire.
Coroner Louise Pinder said the driver did not see 21-year-old Mr Theuri but "an observant driver" should have.
Two men were arrested over his death but the investigation was later closed.
Mr Theuri, from Oakerthorpe and who worked as a chef, was not a big drinker but had been getting drunk that night in nearby Ripley, the court heard.
Recording a narrative verdict, Ms Pinder said the taxi driver's defective demister, low visibility in the area and a lack of any signal from Mr Theuri contributed to his death from serious head injuries.
Two men were arrested in September 2015 on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the incident in Wingfield Road.
They were released after Derbyshire Police concluded there was "insufficient evidence" to charge anyone.
Speaking after the inquest, Mr Theuri's mother Faith Marriott said he was "a wonderful person who'll be missed very, very much".
She added: "There are lessons to be learned concerning the circumstances of his death, surrounding the care and upkeep of taxi vehicles and the duty of care they should have to passengers in vulnerable states.
"We can't leave people in vulnerable states - we can't leave their fate to chance."
