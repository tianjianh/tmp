Detectives revealed new details about the mother-of-three's death at her home in west Belfast at the weekend, as they appealed for help to catch her killer.
They have released a photograph of a knife, similar to one that they believe was used to attack her.
The 30-year-old's body was found following the fire at her home at Hazel View, Lagmore, on Sunday, 2 August.
The following evening, police announced they were treating her death as murder, saying they believed that she may have been killed before the fire.
In a fresh appeal on Thursday, the officer leading the investigation, Det Supt Kevin Geddes, said: "I can confirm that Jennifer was stabbed during the attack early on Sunday morning.
"We are appealing to anyone who has come across a knife like this since Sunday to contact us."
The knife is almost 14 inches long and has distinctive orange and white markings.
A 39-year-old man, who was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of withholding information about the murder, remains in custody.
Mr Geddes said detectives were "following a definite line of inquiry".
He added: "We are particularly interested in the movements and whereabouts of a man seen leaving Jennifer's home at 4.20am on Sunday.
"We believe he walked from Hazel View, through Lagmore to Poleglass. We believe he was wearing a grey T-shirt or sweat top and a light-coloured bomber jacket.
"At some stage, we believe he got rid of the grey top and light-coloured jacket and obtained a red and gold sports jersey.
"We are appealing to anyone who lives on the route between Hazel View and Poleglass and who has knowledge of any of these items of clothing or the knife to contact us."
Mr Geddes also thanked the local community for their support and "the enormous amount of assistance" they have provided to police investigating the murder.
