Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus has been omitted from Germany's Euro 2016 squad but Manchester United's Bastian Schweinsteiger has been included.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reus, 27, missed the 2014 World Cup and has had recent injury concerns.
Fellow midfielder Schweinsteiger, 31, has not played since picking up a knee injury in March while away with Germany but has been selected by Joachim Low.
Bayer Leverkusen's Julian Brandt, Karim Bellarabi and Hoffenheim's Sebastian Rudy have all been left out.
"The medical staff could not give a clear prognosis for Marco," Low said of Reus's omission, which comes on his birthday.
"He has massive injury problems and the medical staff was very sceptical about his ability to last through the coming weeks and such a gruelling tournament.
"It is a bitter decision and bitter for Marco."
Liverpool midfielder Emre Can, Arsenal's Mesut Ozil and former Gunners attacking midfielder Lukas Podolski, now at Turkish side Galatasaray, have all been included as the world champions search for their first European title since 1996.
