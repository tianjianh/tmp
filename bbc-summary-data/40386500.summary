Clarke, 33, was a free agent after leaving Coventry City at the end of last season.
The former Huddersfield man is linking up with Mariners boss Russell Slade for a third time, after playing for him at Leyton Orient and the Sky Blues.
"I've obviously worked with Russell before and we get on really well, so him being at the club was a big thing for me," Clarke told the club website.
