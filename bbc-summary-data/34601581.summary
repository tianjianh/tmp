[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales Under-20 centre Adam Hughes has returned to Newport Gwent Dragons on a three-month loan from Exeter Chiefs.

Hughes, 25, made his Dragons debut in 2010 and appeared 80 times for the region before leaving in February 2014 to join Bristol.
He moved to Exeter Chiefs on a two-year deal in June 2014 and made 10 appearances for the English Premiership side.
"It's great to be back at Rodney Parade and at the Newport Gwent Dragons," Hughes said.
"I noticed that the Dragons were suffering with injuries in the centre and I felt that with the return of the internationals at the Chiefs my opportunity to start was slightly shunted.
"So I made the decision to come here on loan and play some rugby."
