Four months on from a disastrous World Cup campaign on home soil, England established an early lead through George Kruis' converted try, but were then pegged back by the boot of Greig Laidlaw to make it 7-6 at half-time.
But after the hosts failed to capitalise on several promising openings, English strength from the bench helped establish a grip on what had been a messy affair.
Jack Nowell finished off a well-worked try and Owen Farrell landed his second penalty, and with their forwards increasingly in control, England closed the game out in comfort.
Scotland - who have not won the Calcutta Cup since 2008 - were left disappointed once again and their overall record remains just eight wins from nine Six Nations campaigns.
But a third successive win in Edinburgh for the men in white means Jones - who has had just seven training sessions with his new charges and had picked a team for a rumble rather than a revolution - has time to stamp his own mark on England.
England dominated the early territory and had their first try of the Jones era when Kruis rumbled through weak Scottish tackling to crash over from four metres out.
Laidlaw landed a fine penalty and as both sides attacked from deep and wide, the match quickly became frantic and error-ridden.
England were shipping penalties at a rate - eight in the first period alone - and with George Ford struggling at fly-half, Scotland gained a foothold in the game.
Laidlaw missed from out wide but made it 7-6 from 20m out after England were burgled at the breakdown, and had Russell not rushed a straightforward drop-goal attempt the home side would have led at the break.
Scotland came again, setting up a series of drives deep in English territory only for errors to leave them without reward.
Jones threw on Courtney Lawes for Joe Launchbury and Mako Vunipola for Joe Marler, and as England's ball-carriers made dents, quick ball came and the points with it.
George Ford went right, prop Vunipola hit Farrell with a cute inside pass and Nowell scampered into the corner for 12-6.
Farrell kicked a penalty to the corner and England drove the line-out, hammering away at the line until Russell intercepted and almost sent Stuart Hogg away.
Farrell then stroked over a penalty from distance, only for Scotland to haul themselves to within a converted try through Laidlaw's third penalty.
But England's power from the bench snuffed out any sparks, and they will head to Rome next week with some confidence restored.
England's go-to man so often, Billy Vunipola consistently made the sort of hard yards that gave the visitors critical momentum.
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: "The players are very disappointed. That game was there to be won and that's the hard, cold fact."
England head coach Eddie Jones: "I always thought we were going to win the game unless we did something silly."
Former England international Jeremy Guscott: "The old coaching regime identified that Billy Vunipola could be world class. He enjoys the game more than working on his conditioning. Keep him playing and keep him motivated by picking him."
Former Scotland international Andy Nicol: "I would give Scotland a rocket, but I would give them another opportunity. That was Scotland's best team out there today, and we need to stick with them."
