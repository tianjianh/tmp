The former Rangers striker tapped in from close-range in the 47th minute after Chris Lavery drove powerfully across the face of goal.
Near the end Curtis Allen saw a penalty saved by keeper Brian Neeson after a hand ball by Paddy McNally.
Last week the Glens won 4-2 away to Ballymena United.
Glentoran move up to seventh in the table, a point ahead of Dungannon Swifts who play Portadown on Saturday.
Carrick remain one from bottom - 14 ahead of Portadown and eight behind 10th-placed Ballinamallard United.
Glentoran manager Gary Haveron: "Carrick came and pressed all over the park but I felt we deserved to win and created the better chances.
"We want to be challenging for European football but four home wins in the league is not good enough.
"We have not given our fans enough to shout about."
Carrick Rangers manager Aaron Callaghan: "Our first half performance was brilliant - we took the game to Glentoran.
"But for one minute of madness at the start of the second half, we were the much better side.
"I have to question some of the refereeing decisions - what is going on with refereeing in this country?
"He gives a hand ball when our man is just a couple of yards away and I'd question the offside decision on their goal.
"Let's start giving decisions which are fair."
