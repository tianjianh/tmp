Appeal over Colin Smith Speke killing four years on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are making a fresh appeal for information four years after a 40-year-old Merseyside man was shot dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Smith was shot on Alderwood Road in Speke at about 20:00 GMT on 13 November 2007.
The father-of-five had been at Nels Gym and was on his way back to his black Ford Galaxy car when when he was targeted near The Millhouse pub.
Officers are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time who may have seen anything to come forward.
Det Ch Supt Steve Naylor said: "There is no doubt in my mind there are people out there who know who shot Colin Smith and over time allegiances may have changed and I would appeal to anyone who has information which could help us find those responsible to come forward.
"This was a particularly callous and cold-blooded crime, which deprived five children - aged between six and 16-years at the time of the murder - of their father.
"We believe that Colin Smith had visited Nels Gym and was on his way back to his car when he was shot.
"He was well known locally and Speke is a very close-knit community - there may be someone in the area who could have information which could help us with our inquiries."
Mr Smith's widow, Caroline, said: "It's been four years since Colin was murdered and I can't rest until the people who carried out this cowardly attack on my husband are caught and put before the courts.
"I am convinced there are people out there who know who killed Colin and I can't understand how they can stand by and say nothing, they are as cowardly as the person who pulled the trigger."
Anyone with information is urged to contact police.
