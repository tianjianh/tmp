You may have heard of a snail trail but what about a slug tracker?

Well tiny transmitters have been put under the skin of the slippery slugs to see where they go.
It's part of an experiment in Shropshire to help farmers stop the slugs eating their plants.
Hundreds of slugs have been tagged and their movements tracked to give the famers a better understanding of what they get up to at night.
See how it works.
