Callum Paterson put Hearts in front with a splendid volley before he was forced off with a knee injury.
Arnaud Djoum prodded home Liam Smith's cross from close range to double the home side's advantage before half-time.
Jamie Walker's double after the break made the game safe, with Dario Zanatta's late penalty miss inconsequential for Cathro's men.
Cathro insisted there would no radical changes when he succeeded Robbie Neilson, but the team is now beginning to look more like a reflection of his coaching style.
The onus is on trying to control the game - an outcome that remains beyond the side's reach while individual defenders continue to suffer moments of rashness at critical moments - and there has also been a change of shape.
With Krystian Nowak playing as a holding midfielder, and dropping back into defence when needed, the Hearts full-backs can push forward to provide attacking width.
The security provided by Nowak, and the hard-working Perry Kitchen, also allows Djoum to drift between midfield and a supporting role around the lone striker, Bjorn Johnsen, and Walker to flit around looking for pockets of space.
There is still no overstating the importance of Paterson, though. Not only did he open the scoring with a volley, the team looked badly affected when he had to be replaced because of injury midway through the first half.
Djoum's goal, just before half-time, allowed the home side to be more self-assured and he finished well inside the area from Smith's cross. On a rare foray forward, Nowak also hit a post late in the game with a curling effort.
Walker came to prominence after the interval with a display of poise and quick-wittedness. He had already skewed one shot wide and had another effort blocked by Will Boyle before he scored his first goal.
That came through good instincts, since he was well-placed to pounce on the rebound when Kilmarnock goalkeeper Jamie Macdonald pushed away a long-range Prince Buaben shot.
The attacking midfielder scored his second goal when Boyle was short with a pass-back and Walker coolly slipped the ball past Macdonald. He received a standing ovation when he was replaced before the end.
The visitors were well beaten in the end although never eased up on their competitive nature. Individuals suffered difficult nights, though, with Kris Boyd's every touch booed by the home support after his recent public criticisms of Cathro.
Boyd was unruffled by being targeted, although he was infuriated at times by his team-mates' failure to back up his pressing of the Hearts centre-backs.
Boyle suffered an even more uncomfortable night. He was booked in the first half after fouling Johnsen and was fortunate not to be sent off just before the interval for a crude challenge on Buaben.
Even when Kilmarnock did threaten, their most prolific player, Souleymane Coulibaly, could not find his range and he swept a Steven Smith cross over the bar.
It was a night to forget for the visitors and Gary Dicker was judged to have fouled Zanatta in the closing stages, but Macdonald managed to save the Canadian's spot kick.
