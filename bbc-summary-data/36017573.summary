[SN]TITLE[SN]
Number of endangered Welsh pigs doubles in 10 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Numbers of a pedigree pig which were classified as endangered have more than doubled in 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2005, there were about 350 Welsh pigs, but numbers have grown to roughly 850 in 2015.
This has contrasted with the numbers of other British breeds like Berkshire or Gloucestershire Old Spots, which have stayed fairly constant or declined.
Swansea pig farmer Ken Austin said people were realising Welsh pigs were "commercially viable".
Mr Austin, of The Burry Herd in Gowerton, told Newyddion 9 numbers were "growing quite rapidly" due to the quality of the meat, which has helped boost demand.
"People ask me whether we keep pigs but no, the pigs keep us because we are only a pig farm," he said.
"We don't have any grants and I think that proves in its own right that they are commercially viable."
