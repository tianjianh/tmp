[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 0-0 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend extended their unbeaten run to eight League One games with a goalless draw at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walsall hit the woodwork seven minutes in as Erhun Oztumer's near-post cross was met by Andreas Makris' flick but came back off the upright.
Southend twice came close as Nile Ranger left the Saddlers' defence in his wake on a 50-yard solo run but was denied by goalkeeper Neil Etheridge, who then foiled Anthony Wordsworth's 25-yard free-kick.
The Saddlers then struck the woodwork for a second time as Scott Laird's deflected cross clipped the top of the bar.
But Southend ended the first half the stronger as Wordsworth flashed one effort wide from 15 yards and saw a 25-yard rocket tipped over by a flying Etheridge.
The second half was much quieter but Etheridge made a sprawling save to foil the clean-through Stephen McLaughlin after a mix-up between Walsall defenders Matt Preston and Jason McCarthy.
Walsall almost snatched the points eight minutes from time but Shrimpers keeper Mark Oxley beat away Kieron Morris' 20-yarder.
