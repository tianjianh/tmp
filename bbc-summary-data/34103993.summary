[SN]TITLE[SN]
Egypt parliament elections to be held in October and November

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Egypt's election commission has announced that a long-awaited parliamentary election will be held in two stages in October and November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The poll had been scheduled for March and April but was delayed by a Supreme Court ruling that part of an electoral law was unconstitutional.
The ruling struck down part of the law that defined electoral districts.
Egypt's main assembly was dissolved in 2012. The election is due to be the final transition from military rule.
The head of the election commission, Ayman Abbas, was quoted as saying the first phase will be held on 18 and 19 October in 14 governorates.
The second phase will be held on 22 and 23 November in 13 governorates, including Cairo.
Egyptians living abroad will be able to cast ballots on the 17 and 18 October and then on 21 and 22 November.
Former army chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi took power after the overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.
Mr Sisi was later elected president in May 2014. His supporters are expected to dominate the new chamber.
Since the overthrow of Mr Morsi the military has launched a crackdown on the Islamist movement that has left more than 1,500 people dead and more than 16,000 in detention. Scores have been sentenced to death, including Morsi.
Mr Sisi governed as a military ruler before stepping down from the military and winning an overwhelming election victory in May last year.
