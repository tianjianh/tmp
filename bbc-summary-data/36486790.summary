English Heritage has hidden 1,066 arrows at castles, forts, stone circles and stately homes.
Finders win one of 1,066 prizes - one is a sleepover at Dover Castle.
The search started with an arrow placed on the battlefield in Sussex on "the very site where William beat Harold", chief executive Kate Mavor said.
The hunt continues until all the arrows, which also have red feathers and a unique code, have been found.
Ms Mavor said: "1066 is the most famous date in English history and the Battle of Hastings was arguably the most important battle in our history, the results of which had consequences for every corner of England."
Other prizes include a private tour of Stonehenge and tickets to English Heritage's re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings in October.
The battle, which happened on 14 October 1066, is being marked with a series of events including recreating the march of King Harold's army from Yorkshire down to Battle, near Hastings, and his clash with the Normans.
The conflict saw the deaths of the country's last Anglo Saxon king, Harold Godwinson, and much of England's nobility and enabled William, Duke of Normandy, to claim the English throne.
This year, English Heritage will also open up the roof of the Great Gatehouse at the abbey founded at Battle by William of Normandy, who went on to be known as William the Conqueror.
