Two men have been killed in an early morning crash on the M6 in the West Midlands.

The pair were travelling in a van which was in collision with a lorry at about 05:30 GMT between junction two, for Coventry, and junction one, for Rugby.
The lorry driver was uninjured but "understandably shaken up", West Midlands Ambulance Service said.
Two lanes of the southbound carriageway were shut, with traffic queuing from the M6 toll, but have now reopened.
