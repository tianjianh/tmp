NI legal aid payments: High Court judge makes ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New rules for legal aid fees in Northern Ireland do not provide fair pay to defence solicitors in some criminal cases, a High Court judge has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He also identified a breach in the impact assessment carried out around Justice Minister David Ford's reforms.
The judge declared the decision-making process unlawful in two areas.
However, he refused to quash the rules.
Instead, he said it was up to the Department of Justice to now rectify the situation "speedily".
His verdict followed a joint challenge to the legal aid fee cuts mounted by solicitors and barristers.
Mr Ford introduced the reforms to payments for criminal work in May, insisting they are necessary and just.
With the minister facing a reduced departmental budget, he has maintained that Northern Ireland cannot continue to fund the UK's highest level of legal aid pay.
Lawyers have taken industrial action in response to the cuts, withdrawing professional services in criminal cases as part of the protest.
Judicial review proceedings were launched by the Bar Council and the Law Society.
They argued that the two professional bodies are being denied fair or reasonable payment, and that the cuts could result in innocent defendants being convicted.
An allegedly flawed impact assessment, consultation process and statistical comparative analysis renders the rules unlawful, according to their case.
The judge held that no ministerial irrationality had been established.
He also rejected claims that consultation was carried out with a preordained outcome.
However, he decided that the rules failed to provide fair pay for work done by defence solicitors in the period between their client being arraigned and going on trial in cases where the accused pleads guilty within that timeframe.
The omission by the rule-making authority breaches key principles and purposes, as well as being "repugnant" to the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, the judge said.
A further flaw was identified in the impact assessment around the new rules.
The judge confirmed the applicant's legitimate expectation that the department's proposals would be subject to properly carried out impact assessments of economic impact, rural impact and regulatory impact assessment was breached.
However, he said that striking down the 2015 rules would be a disproportionate reaction.
The Law Society of Northern Ireland said it would carefully consider the judgement before responding in full.
