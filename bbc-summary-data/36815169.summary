A small number of Mark 1 tanks from Lincoln were used for the first time on 15 September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.
The name of the event is taken from the unofficial tank regiment motto "Through Mud and Blood to the Green Fields Beyond".
Celebrations began on Friday night with a preview of tonight's performance at Lincoln Castle attended by 1,500 people.
Elsewhere, crowds were being entertained with music, storytelling, poetry and historical talks.
