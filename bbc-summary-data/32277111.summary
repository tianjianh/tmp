Coastguards said the engine could not be controlled and was leading the vessel several miles out to sea.
The alarm was raised at 10:00 BST by a device which gave their position, and both the main and inshore lifeboats from Llandudno went to the rescue.
The pair were taken off the 32ft (10m) yacht unharmed and the vessel was towed to Conwy marina.
