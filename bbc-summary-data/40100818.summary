Wales led in the fifth minute thanks to Cameron Lewis' try, but Henry Hutchison touched down in the corner to give Australia a 10-7 half-time lead.
Dane Blacker's breakaway put Wales back in front, only for Harry Johnson-Holmes to plunge over for Australia.
Arwel Robson's 77th-minute drop-goal drew Wales level, but then Perese sped clear to score the clinching try.
Despite producing an encouraging performance in parts, Wales will feel this was an opportunity missed.
After Lewis' early try, Jason Strange's side could have strengthened their hold on the game when Australia wing Simon Kennewell was sent to the sin bin for a tip-tackle on James Botham.
However, it was the Wallabies who reduced their deficit thanks to a Harrison Goddard penalty, before Hutchison put them ahead with a score wide on the right flank.
He almost claimed a second minutes later in the same corner, but an excellent tackle from Will Talbot-Davies forced him to spill the ball.
Wales regained the lead in fine fashion in the second half, as James Botham broke from the base of a scrum and freed Blacker to canter clear.
But just two minutes later, Australia were back in front as replacement prop Johnson-Holmes burrowed his way over the line.
Wales enjoyed long spells of possession in Australia's 22 and appeared to have secured at least a draw with Robson's sweetly-struck drop-goal.
But less than a minute later, Perese scythed through the Welsh defence to snatch a dramatic late win for the Wallabies.
