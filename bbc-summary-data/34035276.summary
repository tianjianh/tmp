Bradley Dredge was left to reflect on a poor final tee-shot after finishing joint sixth at the Danish Open.

Welshman Dredge, 42, bogeyed the 18th and finished on 10 under par, three behind winner David Horsey of England.
It came after birdies on the 16th and 17th had put him back in contention.
"I was trying to give myself a chance of a three on the last and try and put some pressure on the guys coming behind me, but the tee-shot just went in the rough," he said.
"I knew the shot from the rough was going to fly and I ended up in the down slope in the bunker - not a nice place to be, so there we go."
Dredge picked up more 40,000 Euros and valuable European Tour ranking points ahead of next Thursday's Czech Masters.
The Welshman finished second in the Danish and Czech events in 2014.
Dredge is hoping to repeat that form after admitting he was disappointed with his driving at Himmerland on Sunday.
"For quite a spell I was driving the ball terrible today, but to score one-under [par] the way I played was a decent score," he added.
"I was hoping to do something a bit better, but it's points on the board and another good week next week would be great.
"The course is one I've done well on before in the Czech Republic."
Englishman Horsey led the event from start to finish, while other Welsh golfers Stuart Manley (joint-35th) and Oliver Farr (joint-44th) finished down the field.
