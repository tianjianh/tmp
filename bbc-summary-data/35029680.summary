[SN]TITLE[SN]
MSPs to pass stop and search legislation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs are to approve new legislation that aims to introduce a statutory code governing the use of police stop and search powers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The measures are contained in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which will be voted on by Holyrood later.
The bill also sets out police powers to arrest, hold in custody and question suspects.
But a controversial proposal to end the need for corroboration was dropped earlier this year.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson confirmed in September that Police Scotland was to stop the controversial practice of non-statutory stop and searches of adults and children.
It came after the Scottish government asked John Scott QC to examine the issue. His report found that ending the searches would not prevent officers carrying out their duties effectively.
In a statement to MSPs at Holyrood at the time, Mr Matheson said a new statutory code of practice, as recommended by Mr Scott, would be introduced to underpin how stop and search is used in Scotland.
The Scottish government later introduced a series of amendments to the bill based on the advisory group's recommendations.
Consultations will also be carried out on the terms of the proposed stop and search code of practice, and whether the police should have a specific statutory power to search children under the age of 18 for alcohol.
As well as stop and search, the bill also deals with the length of time police can hold a suspect for questioning without charging them.
It will allow a police officer of the rank of inspector or above to authorise a 12-hour extension to the initial 12-hour time limit - effectively allowing the police to hold a suspect in custody for up to 24 hours without charge.
The additional 12-hour extension period would be subject to a formal requirement on the police to review continued custody beyond the first six hours.
Other measures in the bill include:
The bill had initially included proposals to end the requirement for corroboration - the need for two different and independent sources of evidence - in Scottish criminal cases.
But the plans were dropped from the bill by the Scottish government in April after being heavily criticised by the legal profession, which was concerned it would lead to an increased risk of miscarriages of justice.
Ministers had said they believed more rape, sexual offence and domestic abuse cases would be heard in court if the need for corroboration was removed.
But Mr Matheson said the Scottish government needed more time to consider the findings of a review by Lord Bonomy, who concluded corroboration should still apply to evidence obtained by hearsay and confession.
Possible changes to corroboration laws will now be considered as part of a wider review after the 2016 Holyrood election.
