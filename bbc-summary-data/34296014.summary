A "dangerous offender" who stabbed a man to death at a house in County Down has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Stephen Bustard, 42, admitted the manslaughter of Stephen Liam Davidson in the early hours of 10 February 2013.
Mr Davidson died of two stab wounds to the chest that penetrated his heart, and his mother found his body in his living room in Bangor later that day.
As well as the prison sentence, the judge said Bustard will spend four years on licence after his release.
Bustard, originally from Bangor but whose address was given as Bush Park in Antrim, and his girlfriend Meabh Farrell were arrested in a pub in Bangor the day after the stabbing, Downpatrick Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, had previously heard.
He told police he had acted in self-defence after Mr Davidson had attacked him.
During interviews with police Bustard said he had been with the victim for 36 hours in the lead-up to the stabbing.
He claimed he was punched and struck on the head with a dumbbell by Mr Davidson when they were in the victim's house.
He said he then "jabbed" Mr Davidson once in the ribs with a knife, but that claim was "in direct contrast to the results of the post mortem," prosecutors said.
A defence barrister said he had been "specifically instructed" by Mr Bustard to make a "complete and unqualified apology" Mr Davidson's family and friends.
But he added that the fatal stabbing "occurred in the throes of an attack" on Bustard, and that he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the stabbing.
The judge said Mr Davidson's death had a "horrendous" impact on the victim's mother and that her life "has been turned upside down".
Bustard's mother Olwyn Bustard and his friend James Owen Gawn were also implicated in the incident and were given suspended sentences for their roles.
Ms Bustard, 63, of Rugby Avenue in Bangor was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after she admitted assisting an offender.
Gwan, 51, of High Street in Bangor, pleaded guilty to failing to provide information to police as he offered to let Bustard stay in his flat.
