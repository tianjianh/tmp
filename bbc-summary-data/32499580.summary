The plane was shot down over Calais during World War Two and buried under its sandy beach for decades.
The wreckage was later bought by an American collector and painstakingly restored over five years at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.
It could fetch up to Â£2.5m when auctioned in July.
