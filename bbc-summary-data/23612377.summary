West Yorkshire charity ride for injured cyclist left in a coma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of cyclists took part in a charity ride in Huddersfield to support a cyclist who was left in a coma following a collision with a car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Radford is in a critical condition after being airlifted to hospital following the incident last week.
The 69-year-old is the chairman of Huddersfield and District Cyclists and was promoting a campaign calling for better investigation of road accidents.
Two men have been arrested and bailed in connection with the collision.
The route passed the scene of Mr Radford's accident on the Huddersfield Road in New Mill.
The ride was organised by Mr Radford's two daughters.
His daughter Helen Gorman said the last week had been "horrendous" and that she hoped the ride would raise awareness of cycle safety.
Ms Gorman said: "If this and the campaigning can stop any other family going through what we've been through this week, and what we are going to have to go through over the next few months if dad pulls through, if it helps anyone else then it will be worth it."
The ride raised money for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.
West Yorkshire Police said a 21-year-old man and a 43-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of causing injury by dangerous driving.
The pair have been released on bail.
