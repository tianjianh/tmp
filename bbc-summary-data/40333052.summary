However, the winless Scots can still reach the quarter-finals if they beat Canada in their final group match.
Wei Adams shot Scotland in front after good work from Lee Morton.
Muhammad Irfan Jnr levelled after the interval, with Muhummad Arslan Qadir and Aleem Muhammed Bilal also on target for Pakistan's first victory of the tournament in London.
Scotland, who earlier lost to India and the Netherlands, have a better goal difference than Pakistan, who have now completed their pool games.
Therefore, any win over Canada, who have one success from three outings, would lift the Blue Sticks into fourth place.
