Daniel Rogers, 22, ran off after he was arrested on suspicion of theft when officers were called to a disturbance at Howard Close, Waltham Abbey.
The force said he would not be able to take off the handcuffs by himself.
Det Supt Mick Orr said: "Anybody offering this man help to remove the handcuffs could be leaving themselves open to prosecution."
The police helicopter helped officers on the ground scour the area after the suspect made off at about 11:00 BST on Saturday.
Police said Mr Rogers, who has links to Chigwell as well as Waltham Abbey, was wearing handcuffs and grey shorts, a polo top, purple socks, white trainers and has short brown hair.
He was arrested over a theft in the town's Victoria Road on 11 May. A lost bank card was used in shops to pay for Â£180 worth of goods.
