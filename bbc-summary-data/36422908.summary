Dublin's National Maternity Hospital confirmed the death on Tuesday.
Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰ reports that Malak Kuzbary Thawley, who was 34, was pregnant for the first time when she died at the hospital on 8 May.
It is understood she died during emergency surgery to deal with an ectopic pregnancy on 8 May at the Holles Street hospital.
An ectopic pregnancy is when an embryo implants in the fallopian tube.
It can be treated with drugs if identified early, but surgery is needed when it is more developed.
A spokesman for the hospital said: "Every maternal death is a deeply tragic event and, as always, our thoughts are with the loved ones of the deceased.
"As with all maternal deaths, this case is subject to the coronial process and the hospital is unable to make any comment."
Ms Thawley, who worked as a teacher, was originally from Syria and her husband Alan is from the United States.
Both had been living and working in Ireland for the past three years.
