The new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has left Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth to continue sea trials.
The warship arrived at the Highlands port for a pre-planned stopover more than two weeks ago.
While at Invergordon, precautionary checks were made of the vessel after debris had earlier become caught around one of its propeller shafts.
The item of debris cleared by itself and the propeller shaft was examined by divers.
While in Invergordon, the crew added some personal touches to the multi-billion pound vessel.
These included a piece of kit being given a tongue-in-cheek paint job and being turned into a Minion, a character from the Despicable Me movies.
HMS Queen Elizabeth is being put through sea trials after leaving Rosyth dockyard in Fife where it was built.
After leaving the Cromarty Firth and entering the nearby Moray Firth, the ship was visited by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.
He was flown to HMS Queen Elizabeth from RAF Lossiemouth on a military Merlin helicopter.
