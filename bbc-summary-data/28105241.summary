Wimbledon's famous Murray Mound has been changed back to Henman Hill on Google Maps.

The slope, which was unofficially named by fans, was altered as defending champion Andy Murray continued his bid to reach a third Wimbledon final.
It is understood the change was made by a member of the public on Google's Map Maker tool some time over the weekend.
The hill, where fans watch matches on a big screen, was renamed after Murray won his first Wimbledon title in 2013.
The location was originally labelled Henman Hill on Google Maps - after former British number one Tim Henman.
But it was changed to Murray Mound on 7 July 2013 - the same day the tennis star won Wimbledon.
It was added using Map Maker - a tool that lets people add features to Google Maps, such as local landmarks.
The tool also enables members of the public to alert Google Maps to how particular places should be labelled.
Murray beat South African Kevin Anderson on Monday and will next face Grigor Dimitrov in the last eight of the tournament.
The 27-year-old remains on course to defend his Wimbledon title - a feat achieved by only one other Briton, Fred Perry, in 1936.
The grassy slope, used by fans to get a good view of centre court at the All England Club where Wimbledon takes place, is officially named Aorangi Terrace.
The area north of the main tennis court was known as Aorangi Park after the club purchased the land in the 1960s, when it was leased to a New Zealand sports club.
The word Aorangi means "cloud in the sky".
