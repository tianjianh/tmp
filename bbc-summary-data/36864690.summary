Manninger, who won the last of his 33 caps for Austria in 2009, was released by German side FC Augsburg last month.
He has been training with Liverpool and now becomes their third-choice keeper, behind Loris Karius and Simon Mignolet.
"I've still got something left, for sure," said Manninger, who spent five years at Arsenal but has not played in the Premier League since May 2001.
Asked about his return to English football after such a long absence, he told the Liverpool website: "After these years, in Italy and the last four years in Germany, I hadn't given up, I still waited for the phone call.
"Obviously it's probably not the time for me to push for the next three or four years to get a place in the goal.
"Time says it's not possible to play 50 games a year. But if I'm called up, I'm definitely there for games, I will play."
Liverpool have signed five other players this summer so far - Mainz goalkeeper Karius, Schalke centre-back Joel Matip, Red Star Belgrade midfielder Marko Grujic, Southampton forward Sadio Mane and FC Augsburg defender Ragnar Klavan.
They have also agreed a deal to sign Newcastle midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.
