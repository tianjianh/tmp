The fly-half, who kicked the Ospreys to the Pro12 title last weekend, left the field carrying his right shoulder midway through the second-half.
The 22-year-old was a contender for the Wales squad to fly out to Australia for the three-Test series against the Wallabies.
He was expected to be Rhys Priestland's deputy for the Wales No10 jersey.
Rob Howley, the Wales caretaker coach, confirmed Biggar had suffered a shoulder injury and that his condition would be assessed over the next 24 hours.
"He has taken a knock to his shoulder," said Howley.
"We will assess the injury over the next 24 hours and see what the medical report tells us."
