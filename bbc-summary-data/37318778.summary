[SN]TITLE[SN]
RB Leipzig 1-0 Borussia Dortmund

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's Oliver Burke marked his RB Leipzig debut by setting up a late goal for Naby Keita to secure a 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burke became the most expensive Scottish player ever when moving to Germany from Nottingham Forest for £13m last month.
The 19-year-old winger came on for his Leipzig debut with 21 minutes left.
He set up a great chance that Timo Werner missed moments before crossing for fellow substitute Keita to score.
Leipzig are fifth and Dortmund eighth in the early Bundesliga table, with most teams having played twice.
