[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea City v Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea's top scorer Fernando Llorente has overcome a stomach bug, but a hamstring injury looks likely to have curtailed Jefferson Montero's season.

Angel Rangel will return to training next week and could yet play again this season after missing two months with a broken foot.
Everton's Morgan Schneiderlin will miss a second match with a thigh injury but is expected to return to face Watford.
James McCarthy is nearing fitness after a hamstring problem but remains out.
Steve Wilson: "Swansea City have never won a home league game against Everton - and there's never been a better time to start.
"Paul Clement has done an extremely good job to give a dispirited squad some hope after the - in football terms - catastrophic spell under Bob Bradley.
"However, you still feel that they might need to squeeze every last point from their remaining games against Everton, Sunderland and West Brom.
"It might just be a good time to play Everton, whose primary target of qualifying for Europe has been achieved and for whom a top-four place is no longer realistically attainable.
"Their season has been one of great promise, and with more money in the bank and a new stadium on the architects' drawing board, it's no wonder Ronald Koeman wants to stick around."

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "We know that if we manage to survive this year it will be a remarkable achievement. It has not been done often.
"Anything worthwhile you have to work hard for. You have to go through an ordeal with all the pressure, and we certainly will have done that."
Everton manager Ronald Koeman on speculation linking him to Barcelona: "There's no chance that I will leave Everton before the end of my contract.
"I don't see me being the next manager (of Barcelona).
"I mentioned several times it's human ambition - for players, for managers. That doesn't change my position or contract with Everton.
"I'm really happy, I'm looking forward to next season."
Chelsea's 3-0 win at Goodison Park flattered them a little bit, but Everton still looked a bit flat to me.
Swansea, in contrast, are fighting for their lives.
