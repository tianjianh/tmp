From the UK, about 150 workers are expected to meet 5,000 counterparts from 15 European countries in Brussels to call for the EU to act to save the beleaguered industry.
Port Talbot was dealt a huge blow last month when Tata Steel said 750 jobs would go as part of 1,050 cuts UK-wide.
Roy Rickhuss, from the Community union, said those in power "desperately need to start defending our industry".
Port Talbot, which employs 4,000 workers, is the biggest steel plant in Britain in terms of workforce and output, but is understood to be losing Â£1m a day.
When the announcement was made, Business Minister Anna Soubry said the steel industry was having to "take tough decisions in the face of extremely challenging conditions".
First Minister Carwyn Jones set up a task force and said it was as "devastating blow to the community and the wider economy".
The European Commission announced on Friday it was opening three investigations into steel products made in China as cheap imports added to the woes of the UK industry.
It said it would not allow "unfair competition" to threaten Europe.
Trade unions and industry officials have previously called for more action against Chinese steel imports, which they claimed were being sold at artificially low prices.
Mr Rickhuss, Community's general secretary, said: "Steelworkers across Europe are feeling the effects of unfairly traded imports and a lack of government action. Unions and businesses are joining together and with one voice demanding our governments back our steel industry."
