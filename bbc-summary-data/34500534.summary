Geraldine Winner, who is in her 70s, was attacked on Friday night when burglars broke into her home in Knightsbridge, central London.
Police said she was assaulted by a man and a woman who forced their way in, assaulted her and left with her possessions after about three hours.
She is believed to be in a stable condition in a hospital in west London.
No-one has been arrested.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were called to the flat at about 02:00 BST on Saturday following a report of an aggravated burglary at the former dancer's home four hours earlier.
Her husband made more than 30 films in his lifetime, including the blockbuster Death Wish series, and latterly reinvented himself as a restaurant critic, writing a column for the Sunday Times called Winner's Dinners.
The couple met in the late 1950s but married in 2011, and she nursed him through a long battle with liver disease. Michael died aged 77 at his home in Kensington in January 2013.
Paying tribute to him at the time Geraldine said: "Michael was a wonderful man, brilliant, funny and generous. A light has gone out in my life."
