A new female osprey at a Scottish nature reserve has laid its second egg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The female - nicknamed Lassie - has taken over the nest at the Loch of the Lowes reserve inhabited for 24 years by "Lady", who reared 50 chicks there.
A round the clock watch is being kept on the nest near Dunkeld in Perth and Kinross by the Scottish Wildlife Trust as part of a stringent protection programme to safeguard the birds.
Ospreys can lay up to four eggs in one season.
