Novo arrived at Glentoran last summer but struggled to make an impression.
The Spaniard's closing period at the Oval saw him handed a six-match ban for an attempted head-butt which was later halved to three games.
"We thank Nacho for his commitment and wish him well for the future," said a Glentoran statement.
Novo's suspension came after he clashed with Crusaders midfielder Declan Caddell in a game on 14 January.
The protracted saga only came to an conclusion in late March when the ban was halved.
A few weeks after his arrival at Glentoran, Novo was warned by police that he was under a death threat from dissident republicans.
Novo remained at the Oval and he was a popular figure in East Belfast, with his charitable efforts coming in for much praise.
