[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joel Monaghan scored a hat-trick in his final Warrington home game to help Wolves ease to victory over Catalans.

Monaghan scored twice either side of a Ryan Atkins try, while Jack Johnson and Ben Currie also touched down to put the hosts 26-0 ahead at half-time.
Atkins crossed after the break, and Monaghan collected Stefan Ratchford's kick to complete his hat-trick.
Tries from Johnson and Richie Myler extended the lead, before Stan Robin's late consolation try for Dragons.
Both sides had been eliminated from play-off contention prior to the game, with the result keeping Warrington sixth in Super League, one place ahead of Catalans.
Monaghan's hat-trick was his first treble in Super League since scoring three in a victory over Widnes in September 2014, and came just three days after the club announced the 33-year-old would be released at the end of the season.
Warrington head coach Tony Smith:
"Joel Monaghan has been a champion for us and will go down in our history books for what he has achieved.
"You could not have written a better script for the three boys who took the field for their last home match.
"Joel, Roy [Asotasi] and Richie [Myler] all played some of their best rugby of the year today."
