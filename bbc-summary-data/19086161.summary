Plans for a third railway station in Worcester have moved a step closer after receiving government backing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Worcestershire Parkway station would be built close to junction seven of the M5.
The Department of Transport said the business case for the plans show "there might be a positive financial and economic business case".
MP for Worcester Robin Walker said: "It's a big step forward as this has been in the planning for some years."
The station would be built at the intersection of the Cotswold railway line and Birmingham to Bristol main railway line, the council said.
The plans are part of the Worcester Transport Strategy, which requires Â£200m of investment.
Mr Walker added: "Speaking to people in Worcester, it's clear that they would like this third station as it could be very good for business too."
A spokesman from the Department of Transport said: "Bidders hoping to operate the new Great Western Main Line rail franchise will now need to engage with the council on this scheme and propose how the station could be served, should the council be able to secure funding."
