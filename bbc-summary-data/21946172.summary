The Red Devils have achieved successive promotions since Carter and the late Bruce Winfield took over in 2010 and are currently 14th in League One.
"We're under no pressure to sell so we can make absolutely sure only the right people come in," she told BBC Sussex.
"Otherwise, if we didn't do our due diligence all our work will have been for nothing. There is no timescale."
After taking over the then Blue Square Bet Premier side in 2010, Carter and Winfield set the aim of playing League football within three years.
With the right recipe the demand is there for Championship football in Crawley. Look at Brighton - they didn't have 25,000 queuing up outside the Withdean
That target was reached at the end of their first season, alongside a run to the last 16 of the FA Cup, which ended in a 1-0 defeat away at Manchester United.
"I guess we've been a victim of our own success to an extent because we've achieved what we set out to so quickly," Carter continued.
"Now we need to be honest with ourselves and ask if we are the right people to take the club to the next level, because the last thing we want is to do it a disservice."
If the Sussex club were to achieve promotion to the Championship they would then have three years to make the necessary improvements to Broadfield Stadium.
Crawley usually attract crowds of between 2,000 and 4,000 spectators, with their highest league attendance of 5,058 this season coming against Portsmouth.
Broadfield currently has a capacity of 5,500 - 3,295 of which is seated.
"We have looked at options of expanding the stadium or moving to a new site and held tentative talks with Crawley Borough Council," Carter added.
"The club is a really good prospect for someone. We're financially sound, have a good team, an excellent manager, some valuable players that are assets and a great landlord.
"With the right recipe the demand is there for Championship football. Fans want a nice stadium and nice football - Brighton didn't have 25,000 queuing up outside the Withdean and look at them now."
