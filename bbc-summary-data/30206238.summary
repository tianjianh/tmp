Daniel Hodgin, 20, failed to return home after a night out with friends at the town's Buttermarket nightclub on Saturday night.
West Mercia Police said they believed Mr Hodgin, from Madeley, left the club at about 03:30 GMT on Sunday.
His mother Lorraine said she phoned him in the early hours of Sunday.
She said: "He said he would walk home although he was unsure where he was, so we drove to Shrewsbury anyway but could not find him.
"We are devastated, as any parent would be who did not know where their son was.
"As a family we have been in and around Shrewsbury searching day and night. We have given out leaflets asking for anyone to come forward with any information as to his whereabouts or the location of any of his possessions."
Ch Insp Tom Harding said concerns were "growing by the hour".
He said searches were focusing on an area within one mile of the Buttermarket and the force helicopter, dogs and boat crews were all involved.
Daniel, described as about 5' 9" (1.75m) with short spiked brown hair and stubble, was wearing a grey Police polo shirt with dark blue jeans and black boots.
