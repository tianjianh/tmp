[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pro12: Leinster 31-30 Glasgow Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Floodlight failure late in the contest held up Leinster's Pro12 game against Glasgow for 20 minutes before the leaders edged a 31-30 win at the RDS.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lights went out with under two minutes left which led to a long delay.
Leinster led 23-6 at half-time after tries from Dominic Ryan, Rory O'Loughlin and Peter Dooley
However despite a further Zane Kirchner Leinster score, tries from Adam Ashe, Lee Jones and Finn Russell put Glasgow ahead before a Joey Carbery penalty.
Carbery's penalty restored Leinster's lead in the 74th minute shortly before the floodlight failure.
Leinster were already certain of a home semi-final heading into Friday night's game while Glasgow's slim mathematical hopes of clinching a place in the play-offs were finally ended by their defeat.
