Bala plan to give footballer Gareth Bale freedom of the town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After naming itself after Gareth Bale during the Euro 2016 tournament, Bala in Gwynedd could go a step further and give the footballer honorary freedom of the town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillor Dilwyn Morgan said Bale would be the first person to be granted the honour and plans to pitch the idea to the council.
Four signs to the town were altered to coincide with the game against England.
The signs will be up for the duration of Wales' time in the competition.
"We look forward to maybe one day welcoming Gareth Bale and the rest of the Welsh squad to Bale," Mr Morgan said.
