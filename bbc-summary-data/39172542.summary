They said domestic burglaries - including car key thefts - had risen by 36% across Avon and Somerset in 12 months, with high-value cars on driveways being the main target.
Det Chief Insp Dom Graham said "With the increase in security devices, it's impossible to steal a car unless you've got the keys or the digital key fob."
In 2016, 5,685 domestic burglaries were reported, compared to 4,174 in 2014.
