[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 1-4 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reece Styche scored twice as Gateshead ended a three-match losing streak on the road with an emphatic victory at Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker netted his first goal of the season in the 23rd minute, latching on to a Patrick McLaughlin flick-on and coolly slotting home, before converting Mitch Brundle's cross seven minutes after the interval.
Braintree, having had two big shouts for a penalty in the first half, pulled a goal back five minutes later as Michael Cheek tapped in after Jake Goodman's effort hit the post.
But Gateshead put the game beyond doubt with goals in the 70th and 82nd minutes, McLaughlin finding the net following a smart turn before Wes York buried Danny Johnson's cutback.
