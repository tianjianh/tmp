The Hamas-run health ministry said Ibrahim Mansour, 26, was shot dead while he was collecting gravel to sell.
The Israeli military said its troops fired at several Palestinians who had been "tampering" with the fence.
After "exhausting all other means" to disperse the men, "they fired towards the main instigator", it added.
The Israeli military has in the past fired at Palestinians who enter a "buffer zone" it maintains inside Gaza to prevent attacks by militants.
Since the beginning of the year, three explosive devices which targeted personnel patrolling the fence had been detonated, it added.
According to the UN, the Israeli military allows Palestinian civilian access on foot to areas of up to 100m (328ft) from the border fence for agricultural purposes only, and vehicular access to a distance of 300m.
