Steve Morison scored the only goal of the game as the Lions beat Bradford City 1-0 in the League One play-off final at Wembley.
Harris' side lost 3-1 to Barnsley in last season's play-off final.
"There was a gut feeling amongst us that it was our time, it was our moment," Harris told BBC Sport.
"In the 86th minute [of the final game of the season] at Bristol Rovers we were out of the play-offs.
"We were 0-0 after the first leg [of the semi-final] and people wrote us off. We're 1-0 down in the 44th minute in the second leg away at Scunthorpe and people wrote us off.
"Bradford were better than us in the first half and it looked a long way for us to get in front and to keep the lead. My players find a way all the time."
Millwall also reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup earlier this season, before suffering a 6-0 defeat by Tottenham at White Hart Lane.
Asked how his side could top their achievements next season, Harris replied: "Staying in the Championship.
"It's a difficult league, we have to be better and we will be.
"We've been busy in the last couple of months identifying players and now it's up to us to bring in the right personnel."
