Lib Dems call for cross-group Cornwall Council administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liberal Democrats on Cornwall Council say they are contacting all other groups on the authority in a bid to form a cross-group administration following last week's local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lib Dems are the largest group with 36 out of 123 seats, after having previously been in opposition.
They said they wanted to build a "partnership for Cornwall".
Of the larger groups now on the unitary authority, there are 35 independent councillors and 31 Conservatives.
The previous administration had been Conservative-Independent led.
The re-elected leader of the Tory group, Fiona Ferguson, said that, although they were still open to discussions, she felt any so-called "rainbow coalition" was unlikely to be practical.
Others on the council include six Labour members, six from UKIP, four from Mebyon Kernow, two Labour and Co-operative Party members, two councillors declared as "unspecified", and one Green.
