Fears that Scots water park tour could be a 'scam'

Fears have been raised that plans for a series of temporary water parks in Scotland could be a scam.

Thousands signed up to a Facebook page which promised to bring "thrill rides", including flumes and a mini-beach, to four Scots cities.
But Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh councils told BBC Scotland they had received no notification of the events.
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said it appeared "extremely unlikely" the tour would take place.
The Safari Water Park Adventure Tour was viral hit on social media earlier this week when more than 5,000 people expressed an interest in the event.
The Facebook page revealed plans to tour 30 towns and cities across the UK in July and August.
However there are fears that the tour will never happen and the promotion is a "data mining" scam.
It comes after similar concerns were raised about a promotion for a non-existent tour based on the BBC's popular Total Wipeout series proved to be fake.
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: "We're not aware of any contact with the council regarding this event - and it seems extremely unlikely that it would even be possible to transport, build and dismantle the kind of attractions pictured in a different town every couple of days.
"Unfortunately, similar Facebook events have previously been used to try and obtain personal information from anyone signing up."
Details of the so-called "tour" are sketchy. There is no official website, contact details or ticket information.
The photograph used to illustrate the page appears to be of a water park in Beijing.
They have failed to respond to a request for more information from BBC Scotland.
In a statement on the Facebook page, the organisers said: "Please note we do NOT request any data information, once we have licensing permission from the councils in every city, locations and exact dates will be disclosed."
Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Citizens Advice Scotland, said it was unclear whether the water park tour promotion is a scam.
But he warned that data mining scams can look benign.
"They may ask you to register your support for particular events or causes, and even if they never explicitly ask at any point for personal information, the people behind the scheme can then comb through the profiles of those who have signed up and pull personal data from their profiles without their knowledge.
"They can then do with this data what they like, including selling these details on to online spammers or scammers.
"Consumers must therefore remain vigilant online and ensure any entity seeking your support or your personal information is legitimate and can be trusted.
"Ultimately, the more information we have on data mining scams, the better we can target our efforts to stamp them out. "
