Referee Andy Haines made the decision to call the match off after holding a 07:30 GMT pitch inspection following Friday's heavy snowfall.
"The pitch is unplayable due to the amount of icy snow that is covering the whole playing surface," Haines told Oldham's club website.
No new date has yet been set for the fixture to be played.
