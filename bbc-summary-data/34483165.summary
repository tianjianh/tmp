Manager Michael O'Neill was hoisted in the air by his overjoyed team after their 3-1 victory over Greece, securing their place at the Euro 2016 finals.
Leading politicians and sporting stars from Northern Ireland tweeted messages of congratulations on the achievement.
The Republic of Ireland team is also celebrating after beating Germany 1-0.
Martin O'Neill's team is now guaranteed at least a play-off place in the Euro 2016 finals, but will qualify automatically if they defeat Poland on Sunday.
Hundreds of fans gathered outside pubs near Belfast's Shaftsbury Square to celebrate Northern Ireland's victory.
Peter Robinson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it was a "tremendous result and achievement".
"Huge congratulations to Michael O'Neill and team. Great night for Northern Ireland."
Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness tweeted it was an "incredible night for Irish football".
The Sinn FÃ©in MLA congratulated the managers of both the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland teams on their victories.
Golfer Rory McIlroy attended the Windsor Park match with Belfast's world champion boxer Carl Frampton.
McIlroy tweeted: "Great night for the island of Ireland, north and south. Hopefully see both teams in France next year."
It is the first time Northern Ireland has qualified for the finals of a major football tournament since the 1986 World Cup.
Their manager said it was an "amazing feeling".
"I'm very proud of what we've achieved and it's the highest point of my career for certain, either as a player or a manager," Michael O'Neill added.
