It was the Italian's first win since May 2016 but Ducati's Dovizioso, winner of the previous two races, was fifth to open up a four-point overall lead.
Previous leader Maverick Vinales, who began 11th on the grid, crashed his Yamaha with 14 laps remaining.
Britain's Cal Crutchlow was fourth for Honda.
Rookie Johann Zarco, in pole position for the first time, finished 14th on his Yamaha.
Rossi's 10th win at Assen - eight of which have been in MotoGP - lifted him to third in the standings, only seven points behind Dovizioso.
The 38-year-old's 115th grand prix win - and his 89th in the top class - put him in contention for a first world title since 2009.
He passed Zarco to take the lead with 15 laps left and was unscathed when the Frenchman, winner of the Moto2 Championship for the past two years, clipped his rear wheel with an immediate attempt to regain the lead.
"This place is always special. The track is fantastic. I'm so happy for me and my team," said Rossi.
In Moto3, 17-year-old Aron Canet followed up his breakthrough victory in Spain last month with another triumph, hitting the front on the last lap to beat Italy Romano Fenati and Briton John McPhee.
Canet is second in the series with 110 points, only 30 behind leader and fellow Spaniard Joan Mir, with McPhee fifth on 83.
Franco Morbidelli of Italy edged out Thomas Lueth to win in Moto2 - his fifth victory in eight races - and he leads the Swiss rider by 12 points at the top of the overall standings.
Alex Marquez, younger brother of MotoGP champion Marc, is 35 points adrift in third place.
