The broadcaster and artist received multiple standing ovations from the audience at the Rolf Harris Live show in Bristol on Saturday.
The 83-year-old entertainer thanked fans for their support.
"You've no idea what this means - for you all to turn up with such support and such enthusiasm," he told the audience.
Harris was first interviewed under caution in November 2012 over historical allegations of sexual offences. He was then arrested and bailed in March 2013. He has not been charged with any offence.
He also told the crowd about a letter of support he had received.
"A couple called Helen and Matthew sent me a card of support which said: 'It's not about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain'."
It was billed as a "rare stage appearance" and "an opportunity to hear his classic songs including Stairway to Heaven, Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport, Sun Arise and Two Little Boys."
Harris, known for his passion for art as well as his broadcasting, also painted a picture on stage.
The audience gave him a standing ovation when he walked onto the stage, followed by three more during the show.
A review by Martin Booth from the Bristol Post said "despite the current allegations surrounding him, he proved why he has been a consummate entertainer for the last five decades.
"Harris deserved every single one of his standing ovations," it added.
