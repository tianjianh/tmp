Bradford Bulls bring in Hull FC's Jay Pitts and Joe Arundel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford Bulls have signed Hull FC's Jay Pitts and Joe Arundel on loan until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forward Pitts, 24, joined the KC Stadium side from Leeds Rhinos in 2012 and could make his debut in Sunday's Challenge Cup tie against Catalans.
Centre Arundel, 22, is cup-tied so will have to wait until next week's game against Warrington to make his bow.
Coach Francis Cummins said: "They're young, hungry and hugely talented players who we are excited to have."
