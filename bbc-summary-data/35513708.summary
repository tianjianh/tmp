McIntyre: Ross County must put cup ambitions to one side

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre insists making it to a second cup final this season is the last thing on his mind.

A 4-2 win against plucky junior side Linlithgow Rose moved County into the quarter final of the Scottish Cup.
The Staggies also face Hibs at Hampden Park in next month's League Cup Final.
"There are a lot of hard league games to play before those matches, starting with Hearts on Wednesday night. That is the priority for us," McIntyre said.
The aim will be to emulate near neighbours Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who won the Scottish Cup last season.
However, McIntyre is determined his team don't get distracted from the task of a top six finish in the league.
They face third placed Hearts at the Global Energy Stadium in midweek and McIntyre has made it clear where his priority lies.
He said: "We are not thinking about another cup final at this stage as we are only in the quarter final at the moment.
"We will see what the draw brings and we will take it from there.
"Of course we are delighted to be in the last eight and we have the League Cup Final to look forward to."
McIntyre made six changes from the team that beat Celtic in the League Cup semi final last weekend.
He admits that move backfired in terms of the performance and that the East Superleague leaders deserve all the plaudits.
"We got off to a great start with the early goal but I felt we were really sloppy in our possession of the ball and didn't move it quickly enough.
"Great credit goes to Linlithgow. Sometimes when you make six changes as we did things go ok but not today.
"It disrupted us but I don't want to take anything away from them because they played well and were well set up.
"They scored a good second goal as well so they deserve real credit.
"When they got it back to 3-2 you think "here we go" but luckily for us Brian Graham got a quick quality goal so we could see it out."
Linlithgow Rose manager David McGlynn was delighted with the character and determination his players showed despite their Scottish Cup exit at Dingwall.
"I was very proud of the players and we scored a great second goal so credit to the players and the fans for the way they backed us," McGlynn said.
"We did well against a very good Premiership side who showed their quality at set plays especially.
"This was a fairytale end to the Scottish Cup to get the chance to play top flight opposition that are already in one cup final themselves.
"But we are all about winning trophies and in the junior game we are ranked up there with the best of them so we need to make sure we show that in those competitions."
