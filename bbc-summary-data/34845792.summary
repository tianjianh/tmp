European Champions Cup: Scarlets v Racing 92 (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets boss Wayne Pivac expects Racing 92 to be highly motivated on an "emotional" occasion on Saturday for their Champions Cup game in Llanelli.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The French club will be playing their first game since the terrorist attacks in their home city of Paris last weekend.
Racing's opener against Glasgow was among sporting postponements.
"What happened in Paris last weekend has touched everybody, really," said Pivac.
"And certainly, personally, having lived in France and got friends over there it was very, very concerning to see that happen.
"We expect the Racing boys to come over and be very motivated and probably be quite an emotional occasion.
"So we'll be talking about that as a group and making sure we prepare well and put on a good display for what will be a big occasion."
Pivac's side earned a losing bonus point away to Northampton at Franklin's Gardens in round one.
Wales front-row pair Samson Lee and Ken Owens will return for Scarlets after being omitted last weekend because of fitness concerns.
Lee, 22, played five times at the World Cup after recovering from a long-term Achilles tendon injury but has made just one regional appearance since.
But Pivac said the tight-head prop and hooker Owens will face Racing.
"Samson has had a good three weeks off... we are happy to involve him this week so it has been a worthwhile exercise," Pivac said.
"As for Ken, he has a foot injury and he hasn't quite been himself since returning from the World Cup.
"We have scanned that so we know what the issue is and as a result he was left out last weekend.
"He is back this week, but he will get another rest in the near future."
The Scarlets will be without loose-head prop Rob Evans, who suffered a head injury at Franklin's Gardens.
Welsh pair Luke Charteris and Mike Phillips are included in Racing's 27-man squad, while Argentina wing Juan Imhoff makes his first appearance of the season for the Parisians following the World Cup.
