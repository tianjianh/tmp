[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York have now gone 14 games without a win after Dagenham enjoyed a comfortable 2-0 victory at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oliver Hawkins wreaked havoc for the visitors, scoring one, making another and creating plenty of other chances in between.
The 24-year-old striker broke the deadlock with a simple header from Jordan Maguire-Drew's pinpoint cross after 29 minutes, before his flick-on slipped Luke Guttridge through to make it 2-0 just before half-time.
With York struggling to contain the visitors they finished the game with 10 men after Adriano Moke saw red and their long winless run continues.
