Rangers: Danny Wilson says winning semi-final will not save 'poor' season

Rangers defender Danny Wilson admits that beating Celtic on Sunday will not make up for his side's disappointing showing in the league this season.

The Glasgow rivals meet in the Scottish Cup semi-final with Rangers looking to end Celtic's treble dream.
Perdo Caixinha's team go into the tie in third place in the Premiership, 33 points behind champions Celtic.
"We've not been consistent enough so you can't say it would be a success by getting to one cup final," Wilson said.
"Over the course of the season we've been poor. We would have preferred to do a lot better in the league.
"But as it it is, a win on Sunday would give us something to look forward to."
Celtic remain unbeaten in domestic competition this season but Rangers can take some confidence from the 1-1 Premiership draw they earned away to the champions on 12 March.
Graeme Murty was in interim charge of the team for that draw but new boss Caixinha will be in the dugout on Sunday at Hampden.
The Portuguese coach has racked up three wins and two draws from his first five games since moving to Glasgow but Wilson insists no-one at Ibrox is getting ahead of themselves.
"We've let ourselves down over the course of the season so to talk about confidence I don't think is really right," said Wilson, whose side are nine points adrift of second-placed Aberdeen in the league.
"We're on a good run right now and we want to keep it going to make sure we've got a final to play for.
"Is our motivation about stopping Celtic's run? No, it's just all about getting to the final.
"If you asked a lot of the boys that's why we came to Rangers, to play in cup finals and we've got the opportunity to go and do that, so that's our full focus for Sunday.
"We're under no doubts it's going to be a tough game for us, but we went to Celtic Park and got a draw in the league and hopefully we can go one better this time."
The teams met at the same stage of the competition last year, with Championship outfit Rangers, under then boss Mark Warburton, seeing off Ronny Deila's Celtic on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.
"It's a completely different game, different managers, there are lot of differences in the games," said former Hearts and Scotland centre-back Wilson.
"But we can look back and remember the feeling we had at the end of it. We all want a bit more of that."
