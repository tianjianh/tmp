[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shashank Manohar, the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC), has stepped down after eight months in the role.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 59-year-old was elected as the body's first independent chairman on a two-year term in May last year.
Manohar, a two-time president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said the decision was because of personal reasons.
"I hope the ICC achieves greater heights in future," the Indian added.
The ICC confirmed it had received Manohar's resignation on Wednesday, adding that it would "assess the situation" before making any further announcements.
Manohar had previously sought to reduce the power of England, Australia and India - the so-called Big Three - on the ICC's decision-making executive committee.
Speaking in February 2016, he stated: "No member of the ICC is bigger than the other."
A final decision on a new governance structure was due to be taken at a meeting in April.
