Many people choose to go to university to learn about subjects they enjoy. They also hope it will help them find better jobs when they leave.
We already know that many more girls than boys go to university when they leave school.
This new research suggests that, already by the age of 13, more girls than boys want to go to university.
A study by the Sutton Trust charity looked at the views of more than 3,000 pupils in England.
At age 13-14, almost 65% of girls said they thought it was very important to go to university, compared with 58% of boys.
Why is there a gender difference? Children have been telling Newsround their opinions.
