[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Obsessed' Anglesey man 'shone light' at RAF Valley jets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "obsessed" man repeatedly shone a powerful light at RAF jets flying over his house, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Arthur Jones, 66, of Bodffordd, Anglesey, caused dangerous distractions to pilots on night training flights in Hawk jets, Mold Crown Court heard.
He denies 13 charges of endangering aircraft between November 2013 and September 2014.
The court heard Mr Jones had a grievance against the RAF and had, at one stage, considered legal action.
Prosecutor John Philpotts when Mr Jones was interviewed, he alleged pilots were deliberately harassing him by flying over his property from RAF Valley.
He said he only went outside to inspect his property with a torch and may have, on one occasion, instinctively shone it upwards as a jet passed by, but it was not deliberate.
Mr Philpotts said an under cover police officer watched a man shine a torch at aircraft on one occasion and that was Mr Jones.
Mr Jones lives close to a relief landing strip at RAF Mona, which has been used for more than 100 years.
"It is the prosecution case that he became obsessed with the activity of the aircraft flying out," Mr Philpotts said.
"He became displeased by the aviation activity in the skies near his land."
On occasions, jets had to abandon landings, the jury was told.
The light was said to have come from an area close to a reservoir, next to the defendant's property.
Mr Philpotts said the lights were "dangerously distracting" and appeared to be tracking the jets.
The trial continues.
