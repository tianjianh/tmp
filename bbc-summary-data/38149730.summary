Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard, took £1.3m on its opening weekend to debut in second place.
But it was not enough to dethrone Fantastic Beasts, which took a further £8.9m on its second week of release.
The film, which is a spin-off from the Harry Potter series, stars Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston.
The animated children's film Trolls continued to perform well in its sixth week - taking a further £834,000 to land at number three.
Bad Santa 2 debuted at number four with £799,000 - 13 years after its predecessor was released.
Arrival, which stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, held on to its top five position for a third week after taking a further £778,000.
