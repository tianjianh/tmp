The singer is known for picking out some of her admirers for special attention and presents, having last gone on a giving spree at Christmas.
This time she singled out Rebekah Bortnicker and gave her the cash to help pay back her student loans.
Rebekah shared the moment that she opened her "SwiftEx" parcel on Tumblr.
The 25-year-old cried as she opened the package, which also contained a necklace, a picture Taylor painted and a hand-written note.
The musician also included a photograph of her painting the picture, as proof she had done the work herself.
"I'm still trying to find the words for how I'm feeling," tweeted Rebekah.
"I just love Taylor so much and I can't thank her enough for this."
Taylor shared the video on her own Tumblr account, captioning the post, "I love you so much".
