Video footage has emerged of a refuse collector dumping recycling into a wheelie bin full of waste for landfill.

The incident was captured on a CCTV camera outside Jonathan Gwyer's home in Whitstable on Monday afternoon.
The man can be seen picking up the food waste bin, checking it, then dumping the contents into the bin next to it.
Waste company Serco has apologised for the "completely unacceptable" behaviour of one of its agency workers.
Mr Gwyer was shocked and disappointed that his efforts to recycle at his home on Colombia Avenue appeared to be in vain.
He told the BBC: "It puts people off making the effort. You just think: what's the point? Life would be easier if we just put everything in one bin!"
However, he was adamant he held Serco responsible, not the worker. He said: "I don't really want to single out any of the lads. It's a horrible job."
But he added:  "They just seem to be rushing everywhere and the last few weeks have been a lot more chaotic."
Serco said in a statement: "We very much value the efforts residents make to separate their waste and we work hard to provide them with a high standard of service.
"This behaviour by one of our agency workers is completely unacceptable and I would like to apologise and reassure residents that we are taking the matter very seriously.
"We have already taken disciplinary action against the individual and I will be speaking to our crews to remind them of their responsibilities."
Canterbury City Council said the video clip was "bitterly disappointing" and apologised to residents for the "poor behaviour".
It added: "We know and appreciate that residents across the district put a great deal of effort into ensuring their recycling goes into the right containers and how demoralising it is when situations like this occur.
"Such action cannot and will not be tolerated and we are pleased that Serco has taken swift action to deal with the matter and the individual concerned."
