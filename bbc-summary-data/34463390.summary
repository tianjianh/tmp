[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of people have attended the premiere of a film about Nottingham Forest's European Cup triumphs at the club's City Ground.

I Believe in Miracles tells the story of the club's rise under Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, from no-hopers to European champions in 1979 and 1980.
Most of the team, who star in the film, watched with fans on a 60ft (18m) screen in Nottingham.
Director Jonny Owen said supporters treated the former players like "gods".
The side, which included Peter Shilton, John Robertson, Tony Woodcock, Viv Anderson and Trevor Francis, conquered Europe at their first attempt, including a first-round victory over the champions of 1977 and 1978, Liverpool.
Mr Shilton, who watched the film premier with former team players and fans, said: "Really pleased with it, it was a great film.
"It showed everything, really, fantastic. It brought a lot of memories back."
Mr Owen, a Cardiff City fan, said: "There's something about that Nottingham Forest team, they stay in the popular consciousness of football fans across the world.
"Everybody you speak to across the country go 'what a side they were' and 'what a story that was'."
Brian Clough took over as manager of Nottingham Forest in January 1975.
At that time they were in the bottom half of the old second division, but already had some of the players who would go on to become European champions.
Mr Owen said it took a while to locate and get together the 16 players for the making of his film.
He said: "They were all funny, all engaging, all intelligent and they had a spirit you can't engineer."

2 League Cups
1 European Super Cup
1 Division One title
1 Anglo-Scottish Cup
Along with old archive, some of which Mr Owen said he found in metal tins in Lincoln, the film's soundtrack has been chosen to reflect the era.
He said 1970s disco, soul and funk music suited the "mood" and the film's title comes from the Jackson Sisters' song of the same name.
"I can't begin to tell you how good it looks when you see Tony Woodcock bombing down the wing and Gloria Gaynor is singing," he said.
I Believe in Miracles will be released in cinemas nationwide on Tuesday and on DVD and Blu-ray from 16 November.
