[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lock Luke Charteris is likely to be back in contention for Wales against England at Twickenham on Saturday.

Charteris has resumed training after a knee injury ruled him out of the 19-10 win against France.
Another lock, Jake Ball, is still being assessed after picking up a leg injury in the Scarlets' victory over Treviso.
Wales' most capped player, prop Gethin Jenkins, is due to resume training on Tuesday shortly before the team to face England is named.
Jenkins made his 122nd appearance for Wales against France, but suffered a slight calf muscle strain.
"Luke (Charteris) didn't play at the weekend, his injury is progressing well and he's due to train, while Gethin is due to be integrated into training on Tuesday,"  said assistant coach Rob Howley.

"Once again it's just keeping a watchful eye on both of them.
"At the moment Jake Ball is being assessed by our medical team and a decision will be made in the next 24 hours."
Alun Wyn Jones was partnered by Bradley Davies in the second row against France, while James King and Dominic Day are Wales' other options if Charteris and Ball are both unavailable.
Paul James would be front row cover if Jenkins was unfit.
However, Scarlets loose-head Rob Evans has started all three of Wales' Six Nations matches so far this season, with Jenkins appearing off the bench.
Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb has been added to Wales' squad after six months away from international rugby with injury.
