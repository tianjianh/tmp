London Irish apply for groundshare with Brentford FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship rugby club London Irish have submitted an application to play at Brentford's FC's proposed new stadium at Lionel Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles began discussions with Hounslow Borough Council last month.
Brentford have planning permission to build a new 20,000-capacity ground and hope to move in ahead of the start of the 2019-20 season.
Irish say they will "keep supporters and stakeholders updated with any further developments".
London Irish, relegated from the Premiership last season, currently play at Reading FC's Madejski Stadium, which has been their home since 2000.
The Exiles are contracted to groundshare in Reading until 2025-26, but a get-out clause can allow the deal to break early so they can move to west London.
Brentford had included the provision for rugby in their initial plans for the Brentford Community Stadium.
The Bees were given the go-ahead for the scheme, which includes up to 910 residential units, by Hounslow Council in December 2013.
Construction has been held up while the club secured compulsory purchase orders for some sections of land on the Lionel Road site, but work is expected to commence in 2017.
Brentford, who are seventh in the Championship, have played their home games at the 12,763-capacity Griffin Park since 1904.
