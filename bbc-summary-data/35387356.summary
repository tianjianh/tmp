Amartey can also play in midfield and is believed to have cost the Foxes in the region of £6m.
The 21-year-old, who has won six international caps, played 63 games for Copenhagen after joining them in 2014.
"Daniel has been a role model and a key player for us," said Copenhagen manager Stale Solbakken.
"It is a dream come true for him to play in the Premier League for a club who have targeted him for a long period."
Amartey is Leicester's second signing in the January transfer window, after winger Demarai Gray moved from Birmingham City in a transfer worth £3.7m.
The Foxes' record signing Andrej Kramaric has joined Bundesliga side Hoffenheim on loan until the end of the season.
