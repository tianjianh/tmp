The former Liverpool player, 29, has won two La Liga titles and the Champions League since moving to the Nou Camp in July 2014 in a Â£75m deal.
"It's done, just a few small details need to be sorted and we'll announce it in the next few days or weeks," said Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu.
"We want Luis Suarez to stay at the club for many more years. For us, he is an important character."
Uruguay international Suarez won last season's European Golden Shoe - awarded to Europe's top scorer in domestic football - after netting 40 league goals.
He and fellow forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar scored a combined 131 goals in all competitions as Barca won La Liga and the Copa del Rey.
Bartomeu, speaking to Uruguayan radio station Cadena Celeste, added: "It will be a great Christmas present, not necessarily for Luis as he already knows he's going to continue here, but for football fans.
"He forms part of this spectacular trident we have, which helps the entire team function."
