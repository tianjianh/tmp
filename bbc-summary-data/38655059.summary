A company director who admitted selling "dangerous" so-called legal highs has been given a suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Manley stocked products with names such as King B, Cherry Bomb, Blow and Charly Sheen at his shop Red Eye on Oxford's Cowley Road.
They were described as research chemicals and herbal incenses.
He has now been handed a six-month suspended jail sentence by a judge at Oxford Crown Court, who also ordered £120,000 in fines and costs to be paid.
Oxfordshire County Council's trading standards team said the way the products were sold without health risk warnings was illegal.
The council started investigating the business in 2014 after doctors raised concerns about the products' effects upon people using them as drugs.
Jody Kerman, a trading standards manager, said the way the supposedly legal highs were sold meant they were not legal.
He said: "The products were labelled incorrectly and contained dangerous substances with no appropriate warnings or instructions for their safe use.
Manley, 36, of Curlew Place, Portishead, and his firm RAD Trading Limited each admitted eight counts of breaching the General Product Safety Regulations 2005.
Both were fined £20,000 and told to pay £40,000 in prosecution costs. Manley also had to forfeit all the illegal products and pay an £80 victims' surcharge.
