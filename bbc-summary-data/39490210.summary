County Championship: Dearden and Pettini give Leics upper hand over Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A career-best innings of 87 from Harry Dearden was the highlight for Leicestershire as they reached 275 for five on a gloomy day at Grace Road.

The 19 year-old added 85 for the first wicket with Paul Horton (41) before Glamorgan claimed three quick wickets, two to teenager Lukas Carey.
Dearden then dominated a stand of 90 with Mark Pettini (63 not out) before being bowled by spinner Andrew Salter.
Pettini steered the Foxes to a second batting point underneath the lights.
Dearden, who was dropped on one, survived a couple of run-out chances in his lengthy vigil of 211 balls.
But it was a gritty performance from the home team after being put in to bat, in a battle of two teams who had lost their opening two fixtures by large margins.
Salter claimed a second wicket, bowling Cameron Delport for 20, before Pettini and Lewis Hill accelerated against the new ball in a stand of 73.
Leicestershire batsman Harry Dearden told BBC Radio Leicester:
"I was very proud to get a career-best, I would have loved to have got to three figures but still very proud, it's been a really good day for us.
"It was doing a bit early on, nipping around and swinging, you've just got to take as many balls as you can to get in and it was a good battle up top.
"I just tried to knuckle down and be as disciplined as I could. It's good batting with Horts (Paul Horton), he's an experienced head and calms you down, and it's really good batting with Mark (Pettini), he keeps you level."
Glamorgan spinner Andrew Salter told BBC Wales Sport:
"I am happy to take those two wickets, though it won't come as a surprise that they didn't turn that much- one through the gate and one a bit fuller that hit a bit of rough.
"It was more about trying to control the run-rate and I felt that if I built enough pressure there'd be some reward at the end of it, so hopefully I won't be needed too much more in the first innings.
"For the majority of the day we bowled really well as a group, Lukas (Carey) bowled amazingly up top, the run-rate was 2.6 for most of the day and it wasn't until the end that they got away from us."
