David Cameron has unveiled plans for competitive team sport to be compulsory in primary schools in England.

At Hyde Park, tens of thousands are gathered in the sun to enjoy the Olympic finale weekend.
They are watching enormous screens with Olympic action on show together with highlights of the golden moments from the past two weeks.
What is noticeable is the range of accents. People from across the UK have travelled here to enjoy the Games atmosphere.
Several told me the Olympics have won them over, their scepticism broken down by the parade of medals.
The biggest cheer so far has been the appearance on stage of the taekwondo gold medallist Jade Jones.
But it is the prospect of more gold ahead that is bringing people in, with the crowd thickening ahead of the men's 5,000 metre race.
Ben Ainslie, the most successful sailor in Olympic history with four golds from four Games, will carry the flag for Team GB at the closing ceremony, the British Olympic Association have said.
The closing ceremony, which begins at 21:00 BST on Sunday, will see 3,500 performers in the stadium.
Called the Symphony of British Music, the event will showcase "British creativity in the arts" and take people on a musical journey from Elgar to Waterloo Sunset in 30 tracks, Mr Gavin said.
He explained that while the flags would process in, the athletes would come in as "friends" to form a "mosh pit" for the show.
More seats
Between 200 and 1,000 seats are to be put up for online sale on Sunday after the set has been moved into place.
George Michael has already confirmed his participation and the Spice Girls and Tinie Tempah are among acts reported to be performing.
Locog said the total cost of the four Olympic and Paralympic opening and closing ceremonies stands at Â£81m, with the opening ceremony costing Â£27m.
In other developments:
In the final weekend of the Olympics, Team GB are seeking to boost their best medal haul for 104 years - Britain has so far won 62 medals, including 28 gold.
The team has already eclipsed its Beijing Olympics total of 19 golds and registered the best medal haul since the 1908 London Olympics.

The Olympic Park is busy now, not the pandemonium seen on days when all venues were up and running with sessions through the day, but enough to conjure a last atmospheric weekend of Olympic spirit.
People are spread out across the parklands watching mountain biking on big screens in the sunshine.
Some have been to see Tom Daley dive in the Aquatics Centre.
Others are here for this evening's athletics, the last sporting hurrah in the stadium before what artistic director Kim Gavin has billed the 'best after-show party', the closing ceremony which follows the conclusion of the sport on Sunday.
Decked in Team GB deeley boppers, inflatable hand, union flag, and 'silly hat', Rebecca Robinson from Carmarthen has sneaked an extra day at the Games to soak up the feeling.
'It's been so welcoming for everybody,' she said. 'If I was from another country I would think 'it's really so friendly' and the people are so nice. I'd have kicked myself if I hadn't been part of it.'
Ed McKeever won Britain's 26th gold medal in the canoe sprint men's kayak single on Saturday.
Sunday, the final day of the Games, will see athletes compete for 15 gold medals in events including mountain biking, boxing and basketball.
Lord Coe chairman of Games organiser Locog was thanked by spectators as he toured the Olympic Park, with crowds shouting "brilliant Games" and telling him that he had done a "cracking job".
Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has said a draft new curriculum this autumn would require participation in sports such as football, hockey and netball.
But shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: "If David Cameron supports primary school sport, why did he abolish Schools Sports Partnerships which allowed primary schools access to coaches, staff and facilities to do competitive sport?"
Youth Sport Trust chairwoman Baroness Sue Campbell said it was "critical" teachers were given training and support.
On Monday, Heathrow is expected to see one of its busiest-ever days when thousands of athletes and officials leave the UK after the end of the Games.
