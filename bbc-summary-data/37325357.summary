[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-2 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hallam Hope stroked in his first double since 2014 to help Bury leap into third place in League One with a victory at Swindon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Everton striker clipped into an empty net in the 13th minute before slotting in a second on the stroke of half-time as the Shakers made it four wins in a row.
Bury deserved their early lead when Hope, returning to the starting XI after two games on the bench, pounced on teenage Will Henry's parry from Jacob Mellis' header.
Swindon were then left furious when linesman Mark Griffiths ruled out Jon Obika's 'equaliser' for offside, over a minute after referee Charles Breakspear had signalled for a goal.
On the stroke of half-time, Hope took his season tally to three when he seized on Sean Murray's horror pass to knock past Raphael Rossi Branco and slide into the bottom corner.
Obika got his goal, his first of the campaign, in the 64th minute with a sweeping strike on the turn after James Brophy's cross but Bury moved to a fifth game without defeat.
