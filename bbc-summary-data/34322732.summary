[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rifleman Dave Curnow, from Redruth, was found with head injuries in the town's Chapel Street area at 02:45 BST on Sunday and died in hospital on Monday.
Connor Hammond, 21, of Johns Park, and Liam Laing, 21, of Brookside, Chacewater, appeared before magistrates earlier, charged with murder.
They are due to appear at Bristol Crown Court on Wednesday.
Mr Curnow, who served in 4 Rifles Battalion in the British Army, also played for West Cornwall Football Club, which described him as a "promising young talent" and "an amazing human being".
"There aren't enough words to express how we are all feeling but the amazing messages on social media are a testament to the number of lives that Dave touched," it said.
Flowers have been placed at the scene where Mr Curnow was found.
Joe Crowther, a fellow serving soldier at 4 Rifles Battalion base in Aldershot said: "He did everything right! Never did wrong! He was known by many and loved by all!"
Mr Hammond and Mr Laing spoke only to confirm their details at Truro Magistrates' Court before the case was adjourned for a bail hearing in Bristol on Wednesday morning.
Det Ch Insp Mike West, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said they would like to speak with anyone who witnessed a disturbance outside The Zone night club or was in the area between 02:30 and 3:30 on Sunday.
