Leeds United have signed Peterborough United striker Nicky Ajose on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

Ajose, 22, started his career with Manchester United before joining the Posh in July 2011.
He struggled to hold down a regular first-team spot at London Road and had loan spells with Scunthorpe, Chesterfield, Crawley, Bury and Swindon before being transfer-listed in May.
He could make his debut for Leeds at Millwall on Saturday.
Head coach David Hockaday told the club website: "Nicky was involved with a very good group of players in the Manchester United Academy and he was one of the high flyers in that group.
"He can play up front in a number roles and he is very talented. He is a super professional and is an ideal addition to our squad."
