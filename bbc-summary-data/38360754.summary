[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale moved up to fourth in League One with a convincing Boxing Day victory over Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Henderson returned to top form with a brace either side of a Calvin Andrew finish for Keith Hill's men.
Steven Davies saw his ninth-minute penalty saved by Lloyd Allinson as the home side made the early running.
Gboly Ariyibi should have done better when clean through on goal but was denied by Conrad Logan before Dale made the breakthrough in the 45th minute.
Keith Keane and Oliver Rathbone combined to tee up Henderson, who curled a screamer wide of Allinson in the Spireites goal.
And Dale doubled their lead in the 59th minute when Davies and Henderson linked up in the area for Andrew to crash home a decisive finish.
Ched Evans threatened with a couple of half chances for the visitors but Henderson completed the scoring in the 84th minute, slamming Davies' pass into the roof of the net from close range.
