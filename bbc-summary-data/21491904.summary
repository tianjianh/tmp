The final episodes of series two of the political drama, which has attracted a cult following worldwide, were aired on BBC Four earlier this month.
"Strong characters coupled with delicately woven personal and political storylines have kept our audiences hooked on a Saturday night.
"The final season will be equally as engrossing," said Richard Klein, controller of BBC Four.
The third series, which takes place some two-and-a-half years on from the season two finale, is currently being shown in Denmark - and a British character is understood to be in the cast .
Speaking to the Sunday Politics Show earlier in February, actress Sidse Babett Knudsen - who plays prime minister Birgitte Nyborg in the show - confirmed it would be the final series, despite the programme's "unexpected" success.
"It's a bit sad, but it's great to end on a high," she told the BBC's Andrew Kerr.
"It's like finding a treasure," she said, explaining the success of the show, which has followed in the footsteps of other Scandinavian TV hits The Killing and The Bridge.
"Everything that's not from America is exotic, TV-wise. I think you become very loyal if you feel that you are part of discovering something."
The opening two episodes of the current series drew more than a million viewers to BBC Four when it was broadcast in January.
"We are so thrilled that BBC Four is on board for season three," said Camilla Hammerich, creative producer of Borgen.
"And amazed at how the UK viewers have taken the series into their hearts."
The third series will be shown in the UK next year.
