Emergency services were called to the Edinburgh palace earlier amid concerns over the package.
Fire crews, paramedics and police officers responded to the alert just after 12:00 and the road outside the palace was cordoned off by firefighters.
The palace is the Queen's official residence in Scotland.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "We can confirm that the suspicious letter that was delivered to the Palace of Holyroodhouse on Wednesday 7 June has been analysed and found not to pose any risk to the public.
"An investigation is now underway to identify the sender and establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident."
The Queen was not in Edinburgh when the letter was delivered. A spokesman said she is currently in residence at Buckingham Palace.
A spokeswoman for the Palace of Holyroodhouse said it remained open while the incident unfolded.
