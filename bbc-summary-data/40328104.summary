[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire captain George Bailey hit a fine century to help his side recover to 351-8 on a stifling first day against Lancashire at Old Trafford.

The Australian made 127, having come in at 38-3, before he was bowled late in the day by England's James Anderson.
It was Anderson's only wicket on his return after a month out injured.
Kyle Jarvis and Luke Procter took two each, but Hampshire's Kyle Abbott made a quickfire 76 not out with 12 fours, adding 82 with Bailey.
After winning the toss and electing to bat in favourable conditions, the visitors were struggling when their top three of Michael Carberry, Jimmy Adams and Rilee Rossouw were dismissed inside 15 overs by Jarvis and Ryan McLaren.
But Bailey put on 69 for the fourth wicket with James Vince to rebuild before the Englishman fell for 22 lbw to Proctor.
Bailey then shared half-century stands with Lewis McManus, Gareth Berg and Abbott, but it was the latter who was the aggressor in the final session.
Bailey eventually fell with 10 overs remaining, his 187-ball knock ended when he played on to a wide delivery from Anderson.
Lancashire fast bowler Kyle Jarvis told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"There was a momentum swing towards Hampshire in that last session when Abbott played really well with George Bailey.
"After having them 177-6, we'd have liked to have done a little bit better and we let it go a bit before the new ball. They've got a few too many runs. We could have wrapped them up for mid-200s.
"There was a bit of movement through the air and the ball was easy to shine. As soon as we changed the ball you could see it moving in the air but the ball we had was out of shape.
"When Jimmy Anderson can't swing the ball, you know there's a problem with the ball. After lunch it moved the most for around 25-30 overs but it didn't do as much in the evening session."
Hampshire captain George Bailey told BBC Radio Solent:
"We knew there was going to be a little bit there early on in the day, but it's important to get a good score on the board in the first innings.
"It's a pretty dry wicket now and a few cracks are starting to appear, and hopefully some footmarks, for some spin late in the game.
"I think it was a pretty even day. It feels good in our changing room at the moment because at five for 120, it could have gone pear-shaped really quickly.
"To be able to fight back and still be batting at the end of the day is really pleasing. I felt better at the crease than I had in the first couple of games."
