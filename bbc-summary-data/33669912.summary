Belfast-based Repknight is a security company offering a data monitoring platform across social media channels.
The prime minister is to touch down in Jakarta on Monday on the start of a four-day visit to South East Asia.
"Companies like RepKnight are flying the flag and unlocking the economic potential of the fast growing economies of South East Asia for NI," he said.
"I am delighted that they have joined me on my first trade mission of this government and I hope that we can work together to create jobs and growth for the UK."
The visit forms part of the government's efforts to increase UK exports to Â£1 trillion a year and to get 100,000 more UK companies exporting by 2020.
Mr Cameron is taking the first trade mission of the new parliament to a region forecast to grow at 5% this year and with potential to unlock huge opportunities for jobs and growth in the UK.
