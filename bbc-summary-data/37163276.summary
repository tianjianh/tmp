James Thorpe, 28, broke his neck after falling while in the sea in Magaluf in June, ahead of his wedding to fiancÃ©e Michaela Watson.
He was left paralysed from the chest down and is currently receiving specialist treatment in Sheffield.
The couple, from Boston, Lincolnshire, now plan to marry on 14 July.
Ms Watson said the couple wanted to keep everything the same.
"Myself and James didn't want to change anything - we wanted it to be the exact same day, same venue and same photographer."

The firefighter, who is expected to come home from hospital in the next few weeks, said he is making good progress, and the new wedding date has given him a target to aim at.
"I've got a lot of rehab to do when I get out of hospital, and hopefully that will do the trick," he said.
"If I'm not walking, I would like to be at least standing at the altar.
"We will eventually get the wedding we've been hoping for."
He said his friends, family and Michaela had been amazing in helping him to come to terms with what happened.
"I think back to it and I'm so lucky - I was very close to not being here," he added.
"I had a good group of friends with me who managed to get me out of the water safely without doing anymore damage.
"My aim is to make a full recovery, but I know in the back of my mind it might not be possible, but you've got to set your targets high."
