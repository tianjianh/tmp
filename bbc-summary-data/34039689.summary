Offshore contractor pay offer was 'fair' says OCA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) has said an offer of up to £7,000 extra per year for workers was "fair".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite union plans to ballot offshore contractors on industrial action as part of an ongoing dispute over changes to working conditions.
OCA chief executive Bill Murray said: "We believe our offer was fair given the present economic challenges."
"Strike action could cause significant, irreparable damage to the North Sea industry,"
Mr Murray explained: "We proposed a pay freeze at a time when UK inflation sits at 0% and we offered a better deal on sick pay and holiday pay; a package worth up to £7,000 per annum extra per individual when taking into account rota changes.
"While we support the move by some operators to equal time rotas as an important way of increasing efficiency, our offer also guaranteed that no offshore trip would be more than three weeks in duration and committed our members to carrying out meaningful consultation and comprehensive risk assessment before changing any rota patterns in future.
"We encourage all Unite members who are eligible to vote to do so. With no turnout restrictions in industrial ballots it is important that all voices are heard."
The Scottish government said it hoped strike action could be avoided.
Members of the GMB union have already accepted a deal.
