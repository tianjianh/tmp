[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man who attacked a French policeman outside Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris on Tuesday has been identified as a 40-year-old Algerian journalist and PhD student.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, named by French media as Farid Ikken, was shot by another policeman and is being treated in hospital.
The officer was attacked with a hammer and suffered minor injuries.
Hundreds of people were locked inside the cathedral for a time during the incident.
The BBC's Hugh Schofield, in Paris, says the profile of Farid Ikken is intriguing investigators, because it bears little relation to that of other recent lone attackers in France.
The Algerian journalist had spent some time working in Sweden and arrived in France in 2014.
He had been working for a doctorate in communications in eastern France, but lived in the Paris suburb of Cergy.
His former supervisor at the University of Lorraine in Metz told French media he was astounded to learn that Farid Ikken was involved, as he had been a strong defender of Western values. "I fell off my chair," he told French TV.
The attacker shouted "this is for Syria" as he carried out the attack.
Police have found a video pledging allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) at his flat.
Investigators are waiting to question Mr Ikken.
