Further £150k for Caerphilly pay rise dispute costs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caerphilly council will pay another £150,000 to fund the long-running dispute over senior officers salaries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chief executive Anthony O'Sullivan, deputy Nigel Barnett and head of legal services Daniel Perkins have been suspended since 2013 after the Wales Audit Office declared their pay rises unlawful.
Misconduct charges were dropped last year after a judge dismissed the case.
It is not yet known how much money has already been spent on the dispute.
During a meeting on Tuesday night, councillors were given an update on the situation and were asked to approve a further £150,000 for legal costs, which was agreed.
A council spokesman said on Wednesday: "Internal investigations into three senior officers are ongoing and these must be conducted fairly and thoroughly in accordance with an agreed statutory process."
It is known that disciplinary proceedings are under way using an independent investigator.
Caerphilly county borough council has been asked how much the dispute has cost so far.
