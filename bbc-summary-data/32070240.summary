A University of Dundee team who worked on the original reconstruction of the face of Richard III have revealed a new portrait of him.

Facial reconstruction experts at the university developed images of the king's head from the skeletal remains found buried under a car park in 2012.
The remains of the 15th century monarch were re-buried at Leicester Cathedral this week.
The new painting is based on both the reconstruction and old portraits.
Richard III died in 1485 at Bosworth Field during the Wars of the Roses, and his remains were found buried under a car park in Leicester more than 520 years later.
Facial reconstruction experts at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification at Dundee University developed an image of the king's head from photographs and scans of the skeleton.
Janice Aitken, an artist based at the university's Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, worked with the CAHID team while painting an up to date portrait of the last Plantagenet king.
She also referenced a portrait painted by an unknown artist between 1504 and 1520, which hangs in Windsor Castle.
Ms Aitken said: "There are many copies of paintings of Richard III but I understand that there are no paintings of him directly from life in existence.
"I thought that it would be interesting to add to the visual record by combining the recent reconstruction with a work that was probably painted by a contemporary of the king."
She said being involved with the project, which led to the skeletal remains being reburied at Leicester Cathedral, had been "incredible".
"I was completely unprepared for the impact that the reconstruction would have. The story of the discovery of the remains of Richard III seems to have resonated across the world."
