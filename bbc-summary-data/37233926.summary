[SN]TITLE[SN]
Edinburgh University McEwan Hall entranceway to be sold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh University's wrought iron gate entranceway to McEwan Hall is to be sold at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The entranceway was a gathering place for students on graduation day until it was removed for restoration work.
Now the 19th Century carved sandstone and iron railings will be sold in Summer Place Auctions on 21 September.
It is estimated the entranceway, which is over 53ft (16m( wide and nearly 10ft (3m) high, could sell for up to Â£120,000.
The university's McEwan hall and Bristo Square are being redeveloped in a Â£33m project which means the entranceway had to be removed.
McEwan hall was built and presented to the University in 1897.
