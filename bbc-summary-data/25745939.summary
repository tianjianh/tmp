Approval recommended for new hotel in Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a new hotel in Inverness have been recommended for approval by Highland Council planning officers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carlton Rock Ltd proposes constructing the seven storey property on the site at Glebe Street, overlooking the River Ness.
The hotel would have 165 bedrooms, a restaurant and lounge bar, gymnasium and conference rooms.
The site of a demolished public swimming pool has been vacant for several years.
Planning officers said a number of 17th Century gravestones nearby would need to be preserved and protected from the construction work.
Highland Council's south planning applications committee will consider the hotel plans at a meeting on 21 January.
