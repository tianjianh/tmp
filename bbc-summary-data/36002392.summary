The gardens were closed because of the subsidence and cracks have appeared in the disused hotel next door.
The BBC has been told the hole, which is 10ft (3m) in diameter,  could be 20ft (6m) deep.
It is close to the spot on Earlham Road where a double decker bus sank into a hole in the road in 1988.
The Earlham Road area is built over a number of chalk quarries and tunnels.
