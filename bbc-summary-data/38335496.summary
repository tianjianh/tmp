Welsh Netball chief executive Sarah Jones says their home Test series against New Zealand in 2017 could be a "historic moment" for the sport.

Wales will face the Silver Ferns in two games on 7 and 8 February at Sport Wales National Centre in Cardiff.
The Welsh have played New Zealand 14 times but have not hosted the world number two side for almost 20 years.
"To bring these legends across to Wales and to host in Cardiff is a dream come true for us," Jones said.
"It's got to be seen as a platform to expose our players to playing one of the world's best teams and using it as a real learning curve for 2018 Commonwealth Games preparation.
"It's a huge platform. It's a historic event."
New Zealand have won the World Cup four times and were runners-up to Australia in last year's tournament.
Having the Silver Ferns visit Cardiff for the series could provide a huge boost to wider women's sport and not just netball according to Jones.
"The profile for women's sport across the sector is increasing rapidly and netball is integral to that. You have to look at what's happening globally around the excitement of netball," she continued.
"When you go across to the Southern Hemisphere the Silver Ferns and the Australian Diamonds are treated in the same way as the All Blacks are treated in terms of rugby.
"This is a real scoop for us to bring them across and capitalise on their elite performance."
