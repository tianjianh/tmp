Scottish Cup: Forfar Athletic 0-1 Linlithgow Rose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Linlithgow Rose became the first junior team to reach the last 16 of the Scottish Cup after Kevin Kelbie struck in extra-time against Forfar Athletic.

After a goalless 90 minutes, visiting substitute Michael Jones set up Kelbie to score five minutes from time to knock out the League One side.
Teams from the semi-professional junior leagues were first allowed entry to the competition in 2007.
Now Rose from the East Superleague will face Premiership outfit Ross County.
The West Lothian side will travel to Dingwall on 6 February for a fifth-round match that will rival their four Scottish Junior Cup final victories in terms of significance.
Clubs from outside the Scottish football league system had not been permitted to take part in the Scottish Cup, but from 2007 the Junior Cup winners received invites along with the winners of the regional superleagues.
Rose suffered a blow ahead of kick off against Forfar, with captain Mark Tyrell missing from their defence as he was unable to swap a shift at the sausage factory where he works.
It was the third meeting between the two sides after last week's fourth-round replay, required after a 3-3 draw, was abandoned because of a floodlight failure.
Forfar went into the game without a victory in six outings and having only won once in 17 to sit second bottom of Scotland's third tier.
That run led to the sacking of manager Dick Campbell and the appointment of Gary Bollan - and the new manager suffered a frustrating evening.
Michael Dunlop hit the post for the Loons in the second minute, while Scott Martin's 89th-minute strike cracked against bar.
Strikers Colin Strickland and Kelbie also hit the woodwork for Linlithgow.
Forfar seemed to be on top during the additional 30 minutes as Martin, Iain Campbell and Omar Kader were all denied, while Martin had a penalty appeal waved away.
However, with penalties looming, Kelbie struck low and firm to beat goalkeeper Darren Hill.
The striker who started his career as youth with Celtic and Rangers before a sports scholarship in the United States at last made Scottish Cup history at the age of 30.
