A memorial to three Scottish soldiers murdered by the IRA in north Belfast has been attacked for the 14th time, the Royal British Legion has said.

Paint was thrown over the front and back of the memorial at White Brae on the Ligoniel Road.
The vandalism comes less than four weeks since the stone was last damaged.
The organisation said it was with "nauseating regularity" the stone was "desecrated once again".
The memorial was erected in 2009, as a tribute to teenage brothers John and Joseph McCaig, and their 23-year-old colleague Dougald McCaughey.
The three off-duty soldiers were lured to the area and shot dead by the IRA on 10 March 1971.
John MacVicar from the Oldpark-Cavehill branch of the British Legion Association said it is a stone and it does no-one any harm.
"The reality is as determined as those people are to do this, the Oldpark-Cavehill branch and its members are doubly determined to ensure the memorial stays there."
Members of the Royal British Legion took part in fundraising to pay for the memorial, which was installed in 2009 at the site where the soldiers' bodies were discovered.
In previous attacks, corner posts of the monument were broken, wreaths were destroyed and sectarian graffiti daubed on the memorial stone.
