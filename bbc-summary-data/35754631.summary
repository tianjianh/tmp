Sacha Parkin phoned the NSPCC and gave them his details before describing violent acts he said he wanted to commit.
Parkin later told police he was "struggling to control" his thoughts and wanted support.
The 45-year-old was also banned from contacting children under 17.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court that the operator called police, who attended Parkin's home in Auchterarder, Perthshire, the following day.
Miss Robertson said: "The operator was alarmed during the call due to the sexualised and graphic descriptions given by the accused.
"He said he lived beside a nine-year-old boy and that he found him attractive.
"He added that he watched violent porn including rape.
"When police went to his house he explained he dreams of raping and killing children.
"He said he was struggling to control his urges and that it was 'only a matter of time'."
Parkin, a prisoner at HMP Perth, admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner on 4 and 5 November last year.
James Baxter, defending, said: "I'm at pains to point out that this should be considered a cry for help.
"He was aware that these were not healthy thoughts and he wanted support.
"He said he knew they were wrong and wanted these thoughts to go away."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael imposed a community payback order with three years supervision and psychological treatment.
He also ordered Parkin to undertake a sex offender's group work programme and imposed conduct requirements banning him from public parks and swimming pools and not to approach or contact children aged under 17.
