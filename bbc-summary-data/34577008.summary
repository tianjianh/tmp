[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino says he will appeal against his ban from running the Championship club.

The Italian, 59, was banned on Monday, the same day he sacked manager Uwe Rosler and appointed Steve Evans.
The ban relates to Cellino's conviction under Italian tax law in June for failing to pay VAT on an imported Land Rover car.
It is the second time in 10 months that the Football League has banned him from running Leeds.
The Football League has yet to confirm the length of the latest ban, but it is understood it will end in June 2016, 12 months after his conviction.
Cellino has been disqualified from running a club under the Football League's owners' and directors' test.
He served his previous ban from December 2014 until May 2015, having been found guilty in the same Italian court of not paying VAT on a yacht.
Leeds United Supporters Trust issued a statement on Monday saying fans had "suffered enough over the years". It called for Cellino to consider the need for a "stable club".
"If - and the case grows daily - it is in the best interests of Leeds United supporters he and GFH should sell, we call on them both to do so with efficiency," LUST said.
