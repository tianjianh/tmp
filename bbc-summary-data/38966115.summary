Women who survived breast cancer took over the catwalk at New York Fashion Week in an alternative lingerie show to raise funds for charity.

The AnaOno Intimates show was devised by US designer, and breast cancer survivor, Dana Donofree, and introduced by Oscar-winning actress Mira Sorvino.
Models with different shapes and stories proudly bared signs of surgery.
Nearly half of the models had metastatic, or advanced, breast cancer, according to Ms Donofree.
All proceeds went to Cancerland, an outreach and advocacy charity in the US.

"I felt sexy, I felt beautiful, and I was proud," Paige Moore, 24, said after taking part in the show.
Five weeks ago, she had preventative double mastectomy after genetic testing.
"I was like these scars are sexy and awesome, and I am here, I am alive and I feel good. That is all that matters," she said.
In the US and the UK, cancer researchers say one in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.
"It is a very important moment for them [the models] to get out there and experience something like this because breast cancer has taken over their bodies," Ms Donofree told Reuters.
Ms Donofree also had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the disease, aged 27.
She started designing underwear for others who have undergone breast surgery after realising that traditional garments no longer fitted.
Ms Donofree wrote about her story and the inspiration for the show on her website.
"As I slowly rebuilt my own self-esteem and confidence, first by getting a mastectomy tattoo, then by talking to other women about life after acute treatment, and finally trying on my first bra prototype, I wondered why none of this was part of some greater 'What to Expect When You're Expecting a Mastectomy' pamphlet they handed out at your surgeon's office."
"Whether I have nipples or breasts or not, I am a woman," said model Chiaro D'Agostino, a New Jersey teacher and blogger.
