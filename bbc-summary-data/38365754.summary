Gairloch Heritage Museum project secures key funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gairloch Heritage Museum has secured funding to help it relocate to a blast-proof former Cold War building in the Wester Ross village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The museum sought new premises due to a lack of space and because its lease was running out after 2018.
It has been awarded Â£725,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards converting an Anti-Aircraft Operations Room (AAOR).
The building, built in the 1950s, is known as the Old Radar Station.
In more recent years it was used as a roads maintenance depot.
Highland Council has approved the museum's plans and its managers hope the lottery funding will be a "catalyst" for further funding awards.
