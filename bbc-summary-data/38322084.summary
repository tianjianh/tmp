You may have read We're Going on a Bear Hunt, or maybe someone read it to you when you were younger...

The book about a family who leave their house in search of a bear has been popular with children for more than 20 years!
Now it's getting made into an animation for a whole new generation to enjoy this Christmas.
Martin went along to check it out with a few of you guys to find out what you thought.
So will it be as enjoyable as the book, or will Michael Rosen have to "bear" some criticism from our reviewers?!
