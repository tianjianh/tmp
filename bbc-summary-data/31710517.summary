Children as young as six 'uploading sexually explicit content of themselves'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children, some as young as six, are performing sexual acts online, new research suggests.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) says they use chat rooms and gaming websites where they create indecent content.
It's thought much of the material is then being "harvested" - or stolen - and shared by strangers.
The research also suggests some children are then being blackmailed into performing more indecent acts.
The IWF searches for explicit images and videos of children and young people and works to remove them from the internet.
It also acts on tip-offs from the public.
In research seen by Newsbeat, the IWF found 3,808 images of children and young people online.
Of those, 82% were of young people thought to be aged between 16 and 20 years old.
However, 17% featured children aged 15 and under - something not found in the IWF's previous report, in 2012.
The research also suggests the time between young children logging on and performing indecent acts is often very short - in some cases less than a minute.
The IWF says it is also concerned at the level of information younger children are giving out online.
In one case, a 10-year-old girl gave out a range of personal details.
The report said: "The content is labelled with her username for the service originally used to transmit the content, and this is also her real name.
"Using just that information via a search engine, further sexually explicit self-generated content of this child was located, together with current profiles on a number of social networking sites, which revealed her age, school, current location and details of her family including siblings' names and ages."
The IWF report says that, in some cases, the children depicted were aware of what they were doing and intended the content they were creating to appear on public sites.
Emma Hardy from the IWF says the figures should be "a wake-up call" for parents and those working with children.
"When we did this study previously, all of the children were 14, 15, 16, plus.
"However, we are now seeing with this study children aged 13, 12, 11, 10. So it is actually some very young children taking part in this."
She says it is never too late to tell someone you trust if you feel you are being coerced into doing something you don't want to online.
"We can see that younger children are taking part in this kind of activity.
"So we need to be thinking about what we're telling those children, what their parents understand, what their teachers understand. I mean, it's a lesson for everybody."
Newsbeat's spoken to one 16-year-old, who we're not naming, who has first hand experience of this issue.
"When I was nine, that was the first time I went online. The site I used, it was kind of just one where you couldn't see anyone's faces.
"It was any name you wanted it to be.
"So I went on and I would lie about my age and say I was 14, and straight away there would be men of any age, like from 40 to 20.
"They would come up to me and it didn't matter that I said I was 14.
"They'd still all be in there asking to see, obviously, parts of my body."
Claire Lilley, head of child online safety at the NSPCC, said: "The truly worrying problem is the number of very young children who are being coerced into providing material which is almost certainly finishing up in the hands of sex offenders.
"Many of them are primary school age and are being forced to commit acts which are at the most serious end of sexual abuse.
"It's apparent some are being directed to do things they find extremely distressing by strangers sitting at the other end of a webcam who will then no doubt pass on the material.
"Some older children may be willingly taking part in making sexually explicit videos because it might seem edgy or exciting.
"But they should be aware they are also likely to have no control over the final destination of such images.
"They could be shared countless times and remain in existence for many years to come, with consequences they will live to deeply regret."
