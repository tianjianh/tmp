Revamp of shut Nova Centre starts in Prestatyn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-million pound refurbishment of a Denbighshire leisure centre which was closed because of council cutbacks is due to start.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Nova Centre in Prestatyn will be given a new gym, cafe and pool-side changing rooms as part of the Â£4.2m revamp.
Three promenade-side retail units and a soft play facility will also be built.
The centre shut last February after the trust running it had its funding pulled by Denbighshire council.
The work, starting on Monday, is expected to be finished by July.
