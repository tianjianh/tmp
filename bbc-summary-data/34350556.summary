Kevin Pietersen says Ashes omission was 'right decision'

Kevin Pietersen says England winning the Ashes proved director of cricket Andrew Strauss made the "right decision" not to recall him.

The batsman said in May he was "angry and hurt" after Strauss told him he was excluded because "trust had eroded".
But, speaking on Thursday, the 35-year-old said: "He made his decision and it's turned out absolutely fine."
Meanwhile, Pietersen has agreed to play in the inaugural T20 Pakistan Super League to be held in Qatar in February.
He and Sussex all-rounder Luke Wright are two of the 135 overseas players who will be among those included in the tournament draft in December.
Pietersen, England's leading run-scorer across all formats, was told his international career was over in February 2014, after a 5-0 defeat in the 2013-14 Ashes in Australia.
Six months later his autobiography was published, including criticism of the England and Wales Cricket Board and former England team-mates.
England won the Ashes with a 3-2 home victory this summer.
Speaking at a Sport Industry Group breakfast in London, Pietersen said the decision not to recall him "seems to be the right decision".
He said: "At the time I would have said it was ridiculous and nonsense, but England won the Ashes. I don't draw back to a meeting in May and think 'goodness how things could been different'."
Pietersen added Strauss had done some "brilliant" things - including inviting former players such as Sir Ian Botham and Alec Stewart to address his squad.
Pietersen is now focusing on Twenty20 cricket and will play for the Durban-based Dolphins in South Africa next month before competing in the Pakistan Super League.
