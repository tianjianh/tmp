[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 30 firefighters and eight appliances were called to tackle the blaze on Soroba Road at about 01:30.
The operation, which is ongoing, has been complicated by the presence of highly-flammable acetylene cylinders.
A council spokesman said there were no reports of injuries. He said the damage to the yard, which services bin lorries and gritters, is, as yet, unknown.
Two fire engines from Oban initially attended but this was increased to eight, with crews from as far afield as Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire called in due to the scale of the blaze.
The incident commander, Station Manager Elliot, said: "Our crews are currently dealing with a significant fire. Thirty firefighters are currently tackling the blaze with two water jets and a water tower.
"Due to the fire damage and presence of acetylene cylinders an Argyll and Bute Council officer has attended to offer support."
Police and an officer from Argyll and Bute Council were also in attendance.
A council spokesman said it was unclear at this stage how much damage had been caused to the yard and any vehicles within.
He said the council was assisting the fire service and police and an investigation would be held into the cause of the fire.
