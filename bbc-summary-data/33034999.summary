The world number one resumed leading by two sets to one and with the match 3-3 in the fourth after a storm had halted play on Friday evening.
Murray took the fourth set on Saturday's resumption but Djokovic came through 6-3 6-3 5-7 5-7 6-1.
The 28-year-old Serb will face Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in the final on Sunday.
Djokovic has now won 28 matches in a row, and another victory would make him only the eighth man to complete the set of all four Grand Slam titles.
His hopes were threatened for the first time on Friday evening as Murray launched a stirring comeback, and the top seed looked in real danger when the Briton grabbed the fourth set on Saturday.
"I'm very glad that I managed to finish this match as a winner," said Djokovic.
"I was hoping I can do it before, but I don't think I have done too much wrong, even today in the fourth. He just came up with some great shots, great points."
Murray said: "Last night before we came off the crowd were really into it and it was a good atmosphere. I was obviously motivated to come out today and try to turn the match around.
"I played a loose game on my serve the first game of the [final] set with the new balls. I missed I think three balls long in that game.
"Then I think Novak relaxed a little bit after that and he hit the ball extremely accurate."
Both men had appeared nerveless as just one point went against serve in Saturday's opening four games, but it was Djokovic who faltered first at 5-5 amid some brilliant, punishing baseline rallies.
Murray's defensive skills began to draw errors and the Scot raised his fist in triumph after sealing the vital break, before closing the set out on serve.
The crowd, enjoying an unexpected bonus ahead of the women's final, rose to acclaim his effort against a player who had seemed invincible for much of the tournament.
Djokovic has been ruthless when it has counted during his unbeaten run, however, finishing off nine-time champion Rafael Nadal 6-1 in the quarter-finals, and with two love sets against Murray to his name this season.
Once again, the world number one powered away in the final stages.
A half-chance passed Murray by when he netted a regulation backhand at deuce in the opening game of the decider, and a poor service game of four errors then cost him dear.
Djokovic resumed the clinical display that had seen him through the first two sets on Friday, powering one rocket of a forehand down the line before breaking again to all but secure victory.
Murray had been on a 15-match winning run on clay coming into the match but in the closing stages could do nothing to avoid an eighth successive defeat by his rival since childhood.
