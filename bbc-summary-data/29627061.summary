[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Apprentice house has already lost one member and the original 20 candidates are down to 19.

Now, we've had our first glimpse of where they all lived while the series was being filmed.
This year's mansion is in the posh north London suburb of Highgate.
When people living nearby noticed the new neighbours they of course got onto Twitter to share the gossip.
@Theodoreshand wrote: "cant believe we live down the road from the apprentice house!!! #highgate."
@ShafLdn said: "So the apprentice candidates are staying in Highgate. Love a bit of local area on TV! #BBCApprentice."
And @maisiemoola_  tweeted: "Why are they playing the Sims music on The Apprentice. And also, Hello Highgate! #hometown."
Contestants arrived at the house after being split into two teams while Sarah Dales (above) bagsied a bed straight away.
The all-female Team Decadence came up with their name in the garden, although Lord Sugar has since asked them to change it.
Company director Chiles Cartwright was the first candidate to be fired from this year's series after Lord Sugar blamed him for the failure of the all-male Team Summit.
While the Apprentice candidates lived in Highgate, this year's X Factor contestants are based a half an hour's drive away in Hertfordshire's Hadley Wood.
The contestants, who've gone down from 31 to 29 after Blonde Electra were voted off the show, have access to an outdoor swimming pool and landscaped gardens.
It has eight bedrooms (cosy), six bathrooms, a gym, a sauna and walk-in dressing rooms. It's on the market for £2.5 million.
Last year the X Factor contestants were housed in London's Winchmore Hill in a house which is now worth around £7 million.
In 2012 the finalists broke with tradition and stayed at a hotel in central London.
Previous houses were in locations including Hertford Heath (2011), Borehamwood (2010) and Golders Green (2009).
The 2013 Apprentice mansion was situated on Lincoln's Inn Field in Holborn, London.
It's worth between £11-12 million or £58,000 a month in rent.
Property website Zoopla says it was a newly refurbished Grade II listed building last year with five or six bedrooms, a new kitchen, double height floor to ceiling windows with an internal courtyard and superb views over the square.
2012's Apprentice house was in London's Bayswater area.
The house has eight beds, six baths, three receptions and is valued at around £11 million. Or you could rent it for £36,000 a month. Whichever's easiest really.
2011's Apprentice house was billed as being located in Richmond but was in fact in nearby East Sheen.
At the moment it's worth around £7 million.
According to reports it was the home of a well-known Welsh singer at the time.
Houses before that were located in Chiswick (2005), Hampstead (2006), Notting Hill (2007), Battersea (2008), Ladbroke Grove (2009) and Bloomsbury (2010).
