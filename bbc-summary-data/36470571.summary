Hong Kong-born Hain, 20, made 105 not out in only his third List A domestic match and put on 169 for the first wicket with William Porterfield (75).
Earlier, Kevin O'Brien made 77 but Leicestershire slipped from 129-2 to 134-6 as Jeetan Patel took 3-46.
Rob Taylor's 66-ball 62 helped push the visitors to 237 all out.
The victory stretched Warwickshire's unbeaten run over Leicestershire to eight matches.
Hain, who represented Australia at under-19 level, reached three figures with a six to win the game off the last ball off the 41st over - and his 124-ball innings also contained 12 fours.
Laurie Evans (45 not out) shared an unbroken second-wicket partnership of 74 to help Warwickshire bounce back from Sunday's 42-run defeat by Lancashire.
