[SN]TITLE[SN]
Students awarded £400,000 compensation after complaints

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Universities in England and Wales paid £400,000 in compensation to students last year, following complaints.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2014, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) ruled on 2,175 cases, with 500 going in favour of the students.
Disputes over academic issues such as degree classification or marks for work formed 61% of complaints.
Universities UK said that two million students were covered by the system and the percentage of complaints was small.
The £400,000 in compensation was paid to 200 students following recommendations made to individual universities by the OIA.
Of the 2,175 complaints dealt with 59% were found unjustified, 14% were found ineligible for OIA intervention and 5% were withdrawn.
Less than a quarter, 23% (figures do not add up to 100% owing to rounding) went in favour of the student.
OIA chief executive Rob Behrens said: "Depending on the case, this may lead to the student being given a second chance to submit work or appeal against a decision, cancellation of a penalty imposed by a university, or financial compensation, which in 2014 reached almost £400,000.
"As importantly, the report shows that, overall, universities are doing a thorough job in dealing with the majority of complaints fairly."
The number of complaints dealt with by the OIA has remained pretty steady, at about 2,000 during the past three years.
Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "The shift in England from public funding to increased fees means that students are understandably, and rightly, demanding more from their university courses.
"Universities are responding to this and are also improving the amount of information to students about courses to ensure that their experience matches their expectations.
"It is important to remember that the total number of complaints found to be justified or partly justified [500] represents a small percentage of the two million students covered by the scheme in England and Wales."
The OIA report also said it had dealt with complaints from students involved in protests, who had been unhappy with the way their university had handled the situation.
And each year it received a small number of complaints from students who may be victims or alleged perpetrators in cases of sexual harassment and assault on campus.
It said: "It should be of concern to everyone working and studying in higher education that cases occur of unwanted physical contact, unwanted advances, initiation ceremonies, sexual innuendo and threats.
"We have made, and providers have implemented, recommendations about improving support and strengthening processes to help students, and also staff, involved in such cases.
"The OIA's role is not to judge the behaviour but to look at how the providers dealt with complaints or disciplinary cases."
