Sussex Police inspector suspended in sex inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police inspector has been arrested over allegations he had sex with vulnerable women he met through work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Insp Tony Lumb, based in Brighton, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and has been suspended.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was investigating the nature of any contact between Mr Lumb and the women.
The IPCC is appealing for any women who may have been involved with Mr Lumb to come forward.
A spokesman said: "These are clearly serious allegations that require an independent investigation.
"Allegations that an officer may have been using his role to form relationships with women will be of concern to the community and it was necessary to take the investigative step of arresting him and conducting searches."
He said: "IPCC investigators made a search of the man's workplace and home and have also attempted to contact some of the women concerned.
"The IPCC has also launched a witness appeal."
Assistant chief constable of Sussex Police, Steve Barry Police, said: "Vulnerable victims must be able to trust those they turn to for help.
"We take any report of inappropriate behaviour extremely seriously,"
Mr Lumb has been released on bail.
