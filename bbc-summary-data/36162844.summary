The A499 has been closed in both directions after the incident between the B4354, at Y Ffor, and the B4417, at Llanaelhaearn, at about 15:00 BST.
The driver of a patient care service ambulance died at the scene.
Three other people, including one elderly person, were in an ambulance on a 999 call and have been taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor with what are believed to be serious injuries.
The driver's next of kin have been informed.
Richard Lee, the Welsh Ambulance Service's director of operations, said: "Our thoughts this evening are with everyone affected by this incident, but particularly with the family of the colleague we have lost.
"As an ambulance service we deal with road traffic accidents on a daily basis. These are always difficult for our staff to deal with, but even more so when they involve our colleagues.
"We have plans in place to support our staff in Pwllheli and the wider Gwynedd area over the coming days."
Wales Air Ambulances, North Wales Police and North Wales Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene.
The A499 is expected to remain closed for the next few hours, affecting motorists between Pwllheli and Caernarfon, and diversions have been put in place.
