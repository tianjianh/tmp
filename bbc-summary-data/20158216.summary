Bermuda profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bermuda, a densely-populated British overseas territory in the western Atlantic Ocean, has one of the world's most prosperous economies, largely because of its offshore finance industry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beaches, golf courses, colonial buildings and the subtropical climate also attract some half a million tourists a year but the self-governing territory has not escaped the global economic recession.
The 16th century Spanish sea captain, Juan de Bermudez, is believed to have discovered the archipelago of seven main islands and more than 170 islets. England took control of Bermuda in the late 17th century and slaves, mostly brought from Africa, came to outnumber the colonists. Today, three-fifths of the population are of African descent with the remainder of mostly-European extraction.
The 1968 constitution guaranteed internal self-government but tension in the 1970s saw the assassination of the colony's governor and rioting. British troops went in to restore order and recent polls show a large majority opposed to independence.
In May 2013, Bermuda along with several other territories in the Caribbean, signed agreements on sharing tax information with Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by a governor
Premier: Michael Dunkley
Formerly deputy premier, Michael Dunkley became premier in May 2014 after his predecessor, Craig Cannonier, resigned over the so-called Jetgate controversy involving political donations from an American businessman.
Mr Dunkley took over as leader of the One Bermuda Alliance and brought Mr Cannonier back into the cabinet in 2015. Mr Dunkley was previously a minister of public safety for his party after it won the 2012 general election.
The territory is believed to have one of the oldest parliaments in the world; a representative assembly was established in 1620.
The islands' broadcasting scene is dominated by two commercial players, the Bermuda Broadcasting Company and VSB.
