[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Survivors of the Manchester air disaster have called for an apology ahead of the 30th anniversary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fifty-three passengers and two crew members were killed when a blaze broke out in the engine of a British Airtours jet bound for Corfu, on 22 August 1985.
The pilot abandoned take-off, but passengers were left trapped as flames engulfed the rear of the plane.
Neither the airport nor the airline has apologised, but both expressed their sympathies.
John Beardmore from Congleton, Cheshire, survived the fire, along with his wife and two sons.
He said: "That plane wasn't fit for purpose. The engine had a history of problems. [The airline] shouldn't have crammed so many people into their [Boeing] 737 charter jets.
"Manchester Airport should've organised themselves so much better.
"We just had to sit in a coach on the runway for half an hour, while they were looking for other survivors. On the day it was a shambles.
"Neither company has ever apologised to us in that time. We think the time is right, where they could say sorry to us."
June Somekh, from Gatley in Stockport, lost her sister Vera, her brother-in-law Raymond and her niece Susan.
She said: "There were so many things that went wrong. I know that an apology isn't going to bring anyone back - but it will at least recognise that there was some wrongdoing.
"There was a lot of carelessness. It's bad and I still feel angry."
An investigation found the disaster was caused by a series of failures.
Most of the victims died from the effects of smoke inhalation, as the desperate passengers tried to escape the aircraft.
Many were impeded by the layout of the seats, and the narrow width of the exits.
Survivors and the relatives of those who died eventually successfully sued US aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.
The disaster led to a host of changes in air safety procedures.
Ken O'Toole, managing director at Manchester Airport, said: "Our thoughts, sympathy and sorrow are still very much with those who lost their lives, were injured, their relatives, and the many brave individuals involved in the rescue operation.
"The stories of heroism and stoicism that have emerged from the horror of that day humble us all, and are never far from the airport's thoughts."
British Airtours was the charter division of British Airways at the time of the disaster.
A spokesman for BA said: "At the time of the accident the aircraft held a valid certificate of airworthiness and had been maintained in accordance with both regulatory and manufacturer requirements.
"The seating configuration met all of the certification requirements at the time."
He added the company's thoughts were with the families and friends of those who died.
He said: "We understand their continuing sense of loss, and also the difficulties faced by those who survived the incident and have had to live with the memories."
