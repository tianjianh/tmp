Coppinger and Butler, respectively team and club captains, will now stay at the Keepmoat Stadium until 2018.
The former, 36, has scored eight goals this season and holds the record for appearances for the club.
"I never thought I'd be here 13 years on, but I feel in really good condition - I feel better than when I was younger," he told the club website.
Winger Coppinger and defender Butler have both featured regularly this season for Doncaster, helping them go seven points clear at the top of League Two.
