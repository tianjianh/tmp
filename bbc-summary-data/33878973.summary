A bomb that exploded in a bin in Londonderry was an "indiscriminate attack" with the potential to kill, police have said.

Police were first alerted by reports of a loud bang in the Skeoge Road area at 23:45 BST on Tuesday.
On Wednesday evening, officers confirmed it was a "viable explosive device" that had detonated.
A police officer said it had "all the hallmarks" of a dissident republican attack.
"Those who left this device showed no regard for the safety of anyone in the area," said Supt Mark McEwan.
"The device was left in a waste bin, and shrapnel from it could have killed or seriously injured anyone close by."
Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Raymond McCartney said: "This was a bomb in a very open space, used by vehicles and pedestrians, and my disgust is shared by many, many people in the area."
The Skeoge Road was closed between the Glengalliagh roundabout and the Buncrana Road for most of Wednesday while Army bomb experts carried out tests and the area was searched.
