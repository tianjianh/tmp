Sam Allardyce has revealed he planned to leave West Ham United even if the club had offered to renew his contract.

Allardyce's departure was announced within minutes of West Ham's 2-0 loss at Newcastle United that saw the Magpies stay in the Premier League.
The 60-year-old has spent four years at West Ham, but the Hammers have decided not to renew his deal this summer.
Allardyce said: "I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either."
West Ham will now begin the search for a successor, although they look likely to miss out on top target Rafael Benitez, as the Napoli boss is linked with Real Madrid.
"I thought it was the right time to leave - and probably the right time for me and the club," added ex-Bolton and Newcastle boss Allardyce, who now plans to take an extended break from the game.
Allardyce learned of his fate on Friday, but the news was made public on Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the 2014-15 Premier League season.
In a statement, joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: "We would like to start by thanking Sam Allardyce for his valuable work since arriving at the Boleyn Ground four years ago.
"He leaves the club in a considerably better state than when he arrived and, for that, the board are truly grateful."
Allardyce added: "I knew it was coming and I have no problems with it. We had the discussion and I wasn't going to sign a new contract so it was probably time to move on.
"It's done and dusted and we both move on. West Ham have a big job appointing a new manager moving forward and I have the job of seeing my family for a change. This job is 24/7 and it's time for me to give the family a bit more time."
Sullivan and Gold want a new manager to oversee the club's final season at their current home before a move to the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 campaign.
The statement was released just minutes after West Ham lost their final Premier League game of the season 2-0 at Newcastle - a result which ensured their opponents avoided relegation and meant the Hammers finished 12th.
Allardyce says he has no intention of making a quick return to football, adding: "For me four years is a long time and I don't want to overstay my welcome. You have to commit your whole life to being a Premier League manager.
"It's time to have that break. I'm looking to have a break, recharge the batteries and when the batteries are recharged you are better prepared to carry on doing the job at this level.
"It's not just a job I'm after, it's the right job. You can never say never but I can't see myself being in charge of another football club at the start of next season."
West Ham United's supporters made it clear what they felt of the unloved Allardyce as abuse rained down from the stands at St James' Park as they lost to Newcastle United.
And while it is true the 60-year-old is a managerial taste that will never be acquired by some, Allardyce can rightly be pleased with his four years at Upton Park.
The brief from owners David Sullivan and David Gold was to get the Hammers into the Premier League and keep them there - two missions he accomplished comfortably.
Allardyce, in other words, has done a solid job at West Ham and it will take a lot to move them even further forward.
He may not have been a popular figure among the fanbase - not that he seemed to care - but this is a manager who did what he was asked to do. For that he deserves respect and credit.
