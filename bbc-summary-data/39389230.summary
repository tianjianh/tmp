[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 3-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Southend dug deep to secure a dramatic win over Oldham at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sixth-placed Shrimpers had influential midfielder Ryan Leonard sent off 20 minutes from time when the game was still goalless.
But strikes from Nile Ranger and Theo Robinson and a stoppage-time penalty by Anthony Wordsworth saw Phil Brown's side secure a fourth successive victory.
Oldham slightly shaded an uneventful first half but failed to seriously test the Shrimpers debutant goalkeeper Christian Walton.
Latics would have fancied their chances when Leonard was dismissed for a late challenge on Ousmane Fane but the dismissal seemed to fire up Southend.
Ranger broke the deadlock in the 75th minute when he netted for the fourth game in succession, tapping home an accurate cross from Robinson.
Three minutes later, Robinson headed home a right-wing free-kick from Wordsworth before Wordsworth completed the scoring from the penalty spot in stoppage time.
The penalty was awarded after Peter Clarke brought down Jermaine McGlashan and Wordsworth made no mistake with a firm effort from 12 yards.
