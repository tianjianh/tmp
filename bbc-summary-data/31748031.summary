Despite picking up the best actor Oscar last month, Eddie Redmayne got one nomination for his performance as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything for best on-screen transformation.
British star of the Martin Luther King Jr-inspired film Selma, David Oyelowo, is nominated for best breakthrough performance despite being snubbed at both the Oscars and Baftas.
Model Kate Upton is the only female in the best shirtless performance.
She'll be going up against the likes of Zac Efron, Chris Pratt, Channing Tatum and Ansel Elgort.
The ceremony, which is due to be held on 12 April at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, will be hosted by comedian Amy Schumer.
