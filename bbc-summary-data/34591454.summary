[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A search has begun for the locations of the Cairngorms' "lost" bobbin mills.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Woodland Trust has sought old records and photographs of the mills that made bobbins for Scotland's textiles industry in the 19th Century.
Sites that are known include one at South Kinrara, now called Inshriach, near Aviemore. The mill there was in operation until 1892, the trust said.
There was also a mill at Kincraig and possibly others in Glen Tromie and Glentruim.
Brothers William and Andrew Taylor, from Stonehaven, established the mills at South Kinara and Kincraig.
The Woodland Trust believe other mill sites have been forgotten. It said newspaper article from 1881 reported that "bobbin mills could be seen in half-a-dozen places" in the Badenoch area of the Cairngorms.
This research is part of the charity's Ancient Woodland Restoration project, which is working to restore ancient woodland in the Cairngorms and nine other areas throughout Scotland.
Researcher Joanna Gilliatt said: "Bobbin making was once a considerable rural industry in parts of Scotland; it consumed large quantities of birch wood, and produced millions of bobbins, essential for the textile industries.
"Yet most of us have never even heard of bobbin mills, and there is often no physical trace left of them."
"It would be great to hear from anybody who knows what the bobbins produced in Badenoch looked like and where they were used."
She added: "I'd also really like to know why the bobbin mill at South Kinrara was closed down. I've looked for William Taylor's grave at Rothiemurchus, but haven't found it, so it would also be great to hear from anybody who knows where it is."
