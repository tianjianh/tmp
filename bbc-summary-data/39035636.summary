[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Minstermen took a 14th minute lead when Asa Hall spread the ball to the right for Simon Heslop to deliver a low cross, which Jon Parkin steered into the bottom right-hand corner from 10 yards.
Two minutes later, Adrian Moke tested home goalkeeper Paul Farman with a curling effort from 15 yards.
Josh Ginnelly had Lincoln's best chance of the first half a minute before the break with a shot from 15 yards which York keeper Kyle Letheren did well to save to his right.
The Imps' pressure finally told 14 minutes from time as Ginnelly's cross was nodded down by Matt Rhead for Power to fire home and earn a draw which stretched Lincoln's lead at the top to four points.
The sides will meet again in the two-legged FA Trophy semi-finals in the middle of March.
