[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 1-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One promotion-chasers Scunthorpe had to settle for a point after Peterborough grabbed a late equaliser at Glanford Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A trademark free-kick from top scorer Josh Morris in first-half stoppage time had given the Iron the lead in a game which did not come to life until the closing stages.
Posh's persistence was rewarded six minutes from full-time when a deep cross from full-back Michael Smith struck Scunthorpe defender Charlie Goode and nestled inside the far post.
Neither team had carved out much in the way of chances before Morris curled Scunthorpe in front, ending a run of nine games without a goal with his 16th of the campaign.
Peterborough boss Grant McCann made a double substitution at the break and his side played with much more purpose in the second half.
Again openings were few and far between, although the visitors just about deserved their leveller.
The goal seemed to wake Scunthorpe up and they piled on the pressure in search of a winner.
Jordan Clarke was denied by goalkeeper Luke McGee and Paddy Madden and Kevin van Veen both had efforts cleared off the line as Posh held firm for a point.
