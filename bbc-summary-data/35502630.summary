Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe believes it would be hard to find a better goalkeeper than in-form Artur Boruc.

Poland international Boruc, 35, has kept three clean sheets in his past seven appearances for the Cherries.
A run of just two defeats in 14 games has lifted them seven points clear of the Premier League's bottom three.
"I think your goalkeeper is pivotal to the success you have, whether it's the top end or the bottom of the table," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
Boruc missed more than a month of action earlier in the season through injury, but has conceded just five goals in Bournemouth's past seven games.
"When he's on top form, I think you'd struggle to find a better goalkeeper," Howe added.
"You need one who is making saves and winning you points and I think Artur has done that in recent weeks."
Bournemouth host Arsenal on Sunday and Boruc hopes to continue his impressive run of form.
"I feel glad that we keep collecting points at the moment, that's the most important thing," he said. "Your own performance is quite important, but not as much as the team's."
