Amazon says it is creating 1,000 permanent new jobs across the UK, on top of 2,500 new posts it announced earlier this year.

The new jobs will mainly be spread across London, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester and Leicestershire.
The firm also said it was not changing any plans as a result of Brexit.
"Our sales are in line with expectations. It's business as usual as far as we are concerned," said Doug Gurr, head of Amazon UK.
"We don't know what the impact will be. As far as we're concerned right now, we're keeping our heads down and continuing to do what we do. We'll deal with whatever situation arises," he added.
The newly created jobs will bring the total number of full time permanent UK employees at Amazon to more than 15,500 by the end of this year.
Mr Gurr said: "We are creating thousands of new jobs to continue to deliver the experience our customers know and love during the festive season and beyond.
"We are hiring for all types of roles from software engineers, computer programmers and corporate managers in our R&D centres and head office, to operations managers, engineers, service technicians, HR roles and order fulfilment roles in our fulfilment centres."
Amazon also released new research on shopping habits and the tens of thousands of independent small businesses selling their goods through Amazon Marketplace, a platform for third party sellers.
Nearly half of Amazon's global sales now come via Amazon Marketplace.
It found that 74,000 UK jobs are now being supported by third party sellers on Amazon, and that the number of sellers with turnover of more than a million pounds increased by 20% in the past year.
