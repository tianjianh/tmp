[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 72-year-old woman was pulled to the ground in what police described as a "despicable" robbery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened in the car park at Morrisons in King Street in Aberdeen at about 13:10 on Sunday.
The woman was loading her shopping into a car when the man grabbed her purse.
Det Insp Allen Shaw said: "This is an absolutely despicable robbery. Thankfully she has sustained fairly minor injuries but is understandably extremely upset."
The suspect is described as being in his 20s, about 5ft 7in tall, and was wearing light-coloured trousers and a hooded jacket with a light upper half and darker lower half.
