Hurling League Division Two A final: Antrim face Carlow in promotion contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim hurlers aim to end an awful two years for the caman game in the county by earning promotion back to Division One B of the League on Saturday.

The Saffrons face Carlow in the Division Two A final at Newry in what will be a high-pressure occasion.
The sides already met in the round-robin section of Division Two A when the game ended in a 2-15 to 0-21 draw.
Antrim's confidence for Sunday's final is unlikely to have been boosted by last weekend's defeat by Westmeath.
Granted, Westmeath were probably the strongest team in the division, with their couple of early defeats not a true reflection of their ability, as they were already out of promotion contention heading into the Cushendall contest.
Free-taker Ciaran Clarke and Deaglan Murphy have been Antrim's main scoring threats in their recent games and the Saffrons are likely to need big games from both forwards on Sunday.
Carlow are managed by former Tipperary star Colm Bonner and their key players include captain Marty Kavanagh.
Antrim have been in Division Two A since suffering a disastrous defeat against Kerry in the Division One B/Division Two A promotion-relegation play-off in April 2015.
A couple of months after losing their Division One status, Antrim then suffered demotion to the second-tier Christy Ring Cup championship grade following Leinster Championship defeats by Westmeath and Carlow.
Following that dreadful 2015 campaign, then manager Kevin Ryan resigned but his successor PJ O'Mullan only lasted five months in charge before resigning exactly a year ago after further Division Two A defeats by Westmeath and Carlow.
Since then a management team of former bosses Terence McNaughton and Dominic McKinley plus Neal Peden and Gary O'Kane, have been in charge.
The Saffrons have found Carlow tough opposition over the last couple of years and Saturday's game looks a difficult one to call.
