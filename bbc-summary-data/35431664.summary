[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher who showed porn site in classroom is struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who accessed a pornographic website during a lesson then accidentally projected it on the walls of his classroom has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Lawrie, 56, admitted accessing the site during a computing class with S2 pupils at Coatbridge High School in North Lanarkshire on 27 April 2015.
Pupils as young as 13 saw the site when Lawrie accidentally projected in onto the classroom smart board.
He was struck off at his own request by Scotland's General Teaching Council.
Following a procedural hearing, the council's fitness to teach panel ruled: "In light of the respondent's consent to removal from the register...the panel decided to direct that the respondent be so removed.
"Once the respondent has been removed from the register, the respondent remains so removed unless and until an application for re-registration is made by him and a fitness to teach panel directs that the application be granted.
"Again in light of the consent that the respondent provided, the panel directed that he should be prohibited from making an application for re-registration for a period of two years from the date of removal."
