French Guiana profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dense equatorial forests, colonial towns and a major space centre are among the faces of French Guiana, a region of France on the north-east coast of South America.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lack of infrastructure has hindered tourism as much of the sparsely-inhabited interior is accessible only by river.
The ethnically-diverse population enjoys one of the higher standards of living in the continent, propped up by the French social security system and subsidies.
Street violence in the 1990s, fuelled partly by high youth unemployment, was seen as manifestations of tension with Paris. However, voters rejected the option of increased autonomy in a 2010 referendum.
France occupied the territory in the 17th century. The Dutch and Spanish also settled the area. Until the 1930s, France dispatched convicts to penal colonies there, including the notorious Devil's Island. Another former penal settlement, Kourou, is home to a European Space Agency rocket launch site, accounting for a significant slice of GDP and lending strategic value.
