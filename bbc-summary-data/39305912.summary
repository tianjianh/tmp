Swansea City manager Paul Clement has said his side must reflect on the "bigger picture" after their 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in the Premier League.

Clement's side dropped to 17th place after the loss and are three points clear of the relegation zone.
The Swans, who have let in nine goals in their past four games, also have the league's worst defensive record.
"Bournemouth have just shown when you put two good home results, it gives them breathing space," Clement said.
"We have to reflect on the bigger picture as well, we started January rock-bottom. We play two home games and we have to respond quickly."
Swansea were bottom of the Premier League when Clement took over in January but have won four of their nine league matches since.
However, they have conceded 63 goals this season - the highest in the league - and have managed just one clean sheet in their last 14 games.
"The fact is, we're 17th, out of the bottom three with two home games coming up. There's lots of football," added Clement.
"We've come a long way in the last two and a half months. We're confident we can still go on and do well this year."
Swansea resume after the international break with a home game against fellow strugglers Middlesbrough, before hosting Tottenham just three days later.
