The 30-year-old scored 23 goals in 42 matches for Chester this season but turned down a deal to remain with the Blues.
Barrow, who ended the season in 11th, have made the former Bradford front man their third summer signing.
It follows the additions of striker Richard Bennett, 25, and defender Moussa Diarra, 26, on Sunday.
