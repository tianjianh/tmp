The escaped animal was spotted at 05:00 BST on the M5 northbound between junctions 28 and 27 near Cullompton in Devon, Highways England said.
The motorway was closed while the beast was cleared from the road.
Highways England later tweeted: "The errant bullock has been escorted to his home off the motorway. Thank you for your patience."
