The 29-year-old Briton has not played since his surprise second-round defeat at the BNP Paribas Open in early March because of an elbow injury.
Swiss Australian Open champion Federer, 35, won 6-3 7-6 (7-5) on Monday.
Murray is set for a competitive return at next week's Monte Carlo Masters.
"I'm hoping, if I keep progressing as I have with the elbow, to play Monte Carlo," said the Scot.
"If not, then I just need to stay patient and I'll try the following week. I'm getting there, I just have to go slowly."
