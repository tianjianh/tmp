Huddersfield Giants full-back Scott Grix will be out for up to five months with a shoulder injury, according to head coach Paul Anderson.

Grix, 31, was one of three Huddersfield players to suffer injuries during Friday's defeat at St Helens.
He played 24 games for the Giants last season after a previous shoulder injury limited his appearances in 2014.
"Everything you can imagine that's gone wrong with his shoulder has done," Anderson told BBC Radio Leeds.
"He has had previous history with surgery on that shoulder and it will be a longer rehabilitation programme. We're looking at five months."
Anderson also said club captain Danny Brough, who suffered a dead leg that led to him being substituted, and Eorl Crabtree (groin) will be out for a few weeks.
"It's the first time in my history I've seen Danny in genuine pain," Anderson added. "He's a tough human being and he hates rehab, so he's giving them a tough time."
