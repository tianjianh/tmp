Fans of The Walking Dead are still picking their jaws up off the floor after Sunday evening's season finale.

But there's no time for viewers to recover - as showrunner Scott Gimple is already teasing the next season.
"The first four episodes will melt people's minds and break their televisions," he told fan show Talking Dead.
The eighth season begins in October, with the series premiere also marking the show's 100th episode.
"It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna be more intense. I always mean that, but this year it's the same thing - more intense," Gimple said.
Unfortunately, there's one character who won't be progressing to season eight.
US viewers watching the season seven finale on Sunday evening will have seen Sasha fail to make it out of the episode alive.
Her death had been predicted by some fans after it was announced in December that actress Sonequa Martin-Green would be joining Star Trek: Discovery.
There was speculation she wouldn't be able to juggle major roles in both shows, but her character's fate was only confirmed on Sunday.
Sasha joined the show in the third season as Tyreese's sister, but her character was never in the comic book series.
UK viewers will be able to watch the season seven finale on Monday evening, when it airs on Fox UK.
