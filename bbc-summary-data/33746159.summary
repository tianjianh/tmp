Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa ceremony takes place in Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish president, prime minister and government ministers have taken part in the state centenary commemoration of the death of republican Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although he died in exile the Fenian leader, who fought for Irish independence,  was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.
The commemoration is the first in the Republic's 1916 centenary events.
Fifteen hundred members of the public who applied for tickets attended.
Members of the diplomatic corps, including from the UK, are in attendance as well as members of the extended O'Donovan Rossa family whose ancestor spent long periods in British jails for his activities.
Large screens showed the event outside the cemetery where there was a public viewing area, with spaces for up to 5,000 people.
At the original funeral, the Easter 1916 leader Padraig Pearse delivered the oration in which he famously said: "The fools, the fools, the fools! They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace."
The oration was read out again on Saturday.
The original funeral is seen as a pivotal moment in Irish history, as several of those who attended went on to take part in the Rising.
In the 1850s, O'Donovan Rossa  was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) known colloquially as the Fenians, a reference to Na Fianna, a band of warriors who defended Ireland from invaders in Irish mythology.
The IRB was a small, secret, revolutionary body committed to the use of force to establish an independent Irish republic.
O'Donovan Rossa  was imprisoned in various jails in England for his activities and later moved to New York following his release, continuing his efforts to oppose British rule in Ireland.
After his death, his remains were brought to Ireland by the American liner St Paul from New York to Liverpool.
They were then transferred to the steamer Carlow, which carried them to Dublin.
Separately, Sinn FÃ©in organised a full-scale re-enactment of the funeral, which was one of the largest in Ireland's history.
A number of road closures have been in place while the events took place.
