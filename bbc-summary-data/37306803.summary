An opponent for the Belfast fighter has yet to be confirmed.
Conlan, 29, won the title in April after stopping holder Anthony Nelson in the eighth round in London
"The Commonwealth belt seems to propel fighters onto bigger things - it's another step on the road to a world title," said Conlan.
He added: "Everything is moving steadily in the right direction. Each fight is another step up the ladder and a box ticked on my journey towards a world title.
"I'm thrilled to be boxing back in Belfast. I grew up watching a local guy from my area called Eamonn Magee become Commonwealth champion and it's always been a title that has stood out for me.
"To be defending the Commonwealth title front of my home crowd will be a great experience and I know I'll have big numbers there watching me successfully defend it."
Conlan's younger brother Michael was controversially beaten in the Olympic Games bantamweight quarter-finals last month.
