The incident was filmed by a camera on the car's dashboard at about 10:30 BST on 19 June on Morning Lane, while it was parked in supermarket car park.
In the film, a man manoeuvres a pram before appearing to take keys from his pocket and scrape them down the passenger side of the vehicle.
Damage caused to the Aston Martin V8 Vantage was estimated at £9,000.
The man has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and taken to a north London police station for questioning, the Met said.
