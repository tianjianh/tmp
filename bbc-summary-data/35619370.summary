The visitors had the best chance to break the deadlock in the first half when Jon Stead's shot was cleared off the line by Peter Hartley early on.
Argyle goalkeeper Luke McCormick kept it goalless when he tipped Elliott Hewitt's free-kick onto the crossbar.
But Carey sealed victory for Plymouth when he worked his way on to Gregg Wylde's left-wing cross.
The result means Plymouth bridge the gap with top-of-the-table Northampton from 12 points to 10 as they remain in second place in League Two, while Notts County stay 16th.
