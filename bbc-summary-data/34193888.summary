Captain Eoin Morgan praised "outstanding" spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid after England kept the one-day series against Australia alive with a 93-run win at Old Trafford.

Worcestershire off-spinner Moeen took 3-32 and Yorkshire leg-spinner Rashid 2-41 as Australia were bowled out for 207 under the floodlights.
"Handing the ball to our spin twins was quite easy," said Morgan.
"They didn't bowl any bad balls and they took advantage of the conditions."
Australia lead the five-match series 2-1 with two matches to play - at Headingley on Friday and Old Trafford again on Sunday.
Only Australia pace bowler Pat Cummins, with eight wickets, has taken more than Rashid's seven in the series, while Moeen's figures were the best of his 25-match ODI career.
England face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates this winter, on pitches expected to favour slower bowlers.
"Moeen and Rashid did outstandingly," said man-of-the-match James Taylor, whose 101 off 114 balls - his maiden ODI century - anchored England's 300-8.
"It put a lot of pressure on Australia knowing it was spinning and to bowl like that, and front up, was outstanding."
Morgan, who made 62 off 56 balls in a third-wicket stand of 119 with Taylor, added: "I'm very impressed. We improved in the areas I asked from the first two games.
"James Taylor has come in as a replacement for Joe Root, which isn't easy. But he has done a fine job of it. He has played extremely well."
