[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster ran in five tries as they moved above Munster back to the top of the Pro12 table with a bonus-point win over Zebre in Italy on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Adam Byrne, 22, scored a hat-trick of tries, with competition debutant Tom Daly and Jack Conan also crossing the line for the visitors.
Dries van Schalkwyk had put Zebre ahead with a 16th-minute touchdown, but the hosts trailed 12-10 by the interval.
Leinster have now won all nine meetings between the sides in the Pro12.
The Irish province have taken seven victories from their eight league outings to date, while struggling Zebre boast a solitary triumph over Edinburgh.
Mike McCarthy was yellow carded in the 13th minute as Leinster were penalised for persistent fouling and Van Schalkwyk powered over for the game's first try three minutes later.
Leinster responded quickly as Daly scored following strong carries from Sean O'Brien and Conan, before Carlo Canna regained Zebre the lead with a penalty.
As the first half progressed, Leinster became more comfortable in possession and it was not long before they moved ahead for the first time courtesy of Byrne after a strong Barry Daly run.
Cullen made three changes in the pack after the break and the extra power immediately proved crucial after some ferocious work by the forwards created space outside, and Byrne scored his second try from Jamison Gibson-Park's pass.
Isa Nacewa converted the score from wide on the right, giving Leinster a nine-point lead they looked unlikely to lose after Canna missed a penalty minutes later.
Shortly after, Conan added the all-important fourth try to confirm a bonus point after Byrne, Noel Reid, Daly and Gibson-Park combined to release the forward.
And Byrne wrapped up his hat-trick in style as fly-half Ross Byrne found the winger to dot down after he climbed over full-back Edoardo Padovani to score.
Zebre pushed hard in the final 10 minutes to get some points back, but some resolute Leinster defending kept the hosts at bay.
