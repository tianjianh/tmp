Nottingham Forest midfielder Chris Cohen is eager to sign a new contract when his deal runs out in the summer.

Forest's longest-serving player has been plagued by injuries in recent seasons and has been out since November with a muscular problem.
Cohen, who joined in 2007, has played 292 games for the Reds but has only made 12 appearances this season.
"I'd love to stay but the club have to do what's right for them," the 29-year-old told BBC Nottingham Sport.
"If I take the emotion out of it then I haven't played enough games over the past few years. I know I can, but I can't just keep saying I know I can stay fit and then not actually do it.
"The club have a decision to make but whatever their decision I will respect it and I have had a fantastic time here. I have loved every minute and am hopeful that I can carry on, but if not we move on."
