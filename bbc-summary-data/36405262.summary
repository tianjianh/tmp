100 jobs at risk as Silcox Coaches looks for a buyer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 100 jobs could be at risk at a Pembrokeshire coach company which intends to file for administration, BBC Wales understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Silcox Coaches is a private coach hire and tour operator with bases in Pembroke Dock and Tenby, and has a contract with Pembrokeshire council to provide school transport.
Letters have been sent home to staff this week explaining the situation and that a buyer is being sought.
Silcox has been asked for a comment.
It is understood customers enquiring about trips they have booked have been told the company has taken this action in order to protect the business as it seeks a new owner.
The company was founded in 1882 and has run bus services around Pembrokeshire since 1932.  It is also one of the main suppliers for local sport teams.
Pembrokeshire council said it was waiting to hear how a potential sale of Silcox would affect school transport.
A council spokesman said: "We are aware of the possible restructuring of the company and we will work with all interested parties.
"We anticipate a clearer picture of the situation emerging next week."
He added: "At this time, Silcox continues to operate and the council will continue to pay the company for the work it is carrying out in accordance with our contractual obligations."
