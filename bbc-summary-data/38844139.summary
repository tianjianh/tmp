[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Delaney, of Twin Oaks Caravan Park, near Braintree in Essex, admitted religiously aggravated harassment of four Orthodox Jews - including a 13-year-old boy - on 6 January 2016.
Wood Green Crown Court heard Delaney, 19, was intoxicated on nitrous oxide following a relationship break-up.
He was jailed for six months for the attack in Tottenham Hale retail park.
One victim told the court she was forced to take shelter in a nearby supermarket with her teenage son as Delaney, who was with two other men in a van, repeatedly yelled "Hitler" at her.
Nobody was injured by the thrown gas canisters.
Passing sentence, Judge John Dodd QC told the defendant his actions were unacceptable in "any civilised society".
His sentencing comes as new figures showed anti-Semitic hate incidents reached record levels in the UK.
