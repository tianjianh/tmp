Terrance Watson, 55, of Napier Avenue, Jaywick, Essex, died a week after being hit in Broadway in the village on 8 July 2013.
Alan Baker, 73, of Brooklands, Jaywick, denied the charge but was found guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court.
He has been given a 36-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and a two-year driving ban.
Mr Watson was crossing the road outside The Stores when he was struck by Baker's Ford Focus.
Det Sgt Catherine Offord, of Essex Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said Baker was driving between 32 and 34mph when the crash happened.
"Coupled with the speed, Mr Baker was faced with a number of hazards as he approached the scene such as a school minibus, pedestrians, junctions and cars to be overtaken.
"He should have reduced his speed to deal with them. Had he done so the collision would not have occurred," she said.
