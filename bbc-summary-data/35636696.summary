Tiger Woods injury setback reports absolutely false, says agent

Tiger Woods' agent has dismissed reports the 14-time major winner has suffered a setback on his comeback from injury as "absolutely false".

Mark Steinberg was responding to social media comments claiming Woods' condition had worsened on his return from a third back operation.
In December, Woods, 40, said he had "nothing to look forward to" in his recovery and admitted spending his time playing video games.
He has not played golf since September.
Steinberg added: "It's reprehensible that every few months someone makes something up and it's treated like a real story.
"Tiger continues to work on his rehabilitation and we will have an accurate update at the appropriate time."
Former world number one Woods' last major victory was at the US Open in 2008. His most recent PGA Tour victory was the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational in 2013.
He has not competed competitively since August 2015, when he tied for 10th at the Wyndham Championship.
