Star Wars to introduce lesbian in Lords of the Sith

For those familiar with a galaxy far, far away the idea of LGBT characters isn't necessarily a new thing.

But that doesn't mean the introduction of a lesbian character in upcoming Star Wars novel Lords of the Sith hasn't got fans talking.
Next month's release sees writer Paul S Kemp introducing the first official lesbian character.
According to fan sites, including Big Shiny Robots, the character is called Moff Mors.
She's described as "an Imperial who has made some very serious mistakes," but is still considered to be "an incredibly capable leader and spends much of the book working hard to prevent absolute failure."
Although this is the first lesbian character in Star Wars novels, LGBT characters already feature elsewhere in the franchise.
Bioware recently added same gender relationships in Star Wars: The Old Republic online role-playing game after some fans suggested they should have been included at launch.
Same-sex relationships were also subtly included in the Legacy of the Force books when two male Mandalorians were in a committed marriage.
Some fans weren't keen on the introduction of a lesbian character in Lords of the Sith, something Kemp was quick to address, tweeting that he doesn't write to "appease this group or that".
Speaking on the Full of Sith podcast, Lords of the Sith editor Shelly Shapiro talked about a need for diversity in Star Wars.
"This is certainly the first [LGBT] character in canon," she said.
"It's not something I really think about, it just makes sense. There's a lot of diversity and there should be diversity in Star Wars.
"You have all these different species and it would be silly to not also recognize that there's a lot of diversity in humans.
"If there's any message at all, it's simply that Star Wars is as diverse as humanity is in real life and we don't want to pretend it's not. It just felt perfectly natural."
