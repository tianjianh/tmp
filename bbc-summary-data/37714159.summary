The University of Nottingham students made their fancy dress outfits for a bar crawl then posed for photos for student news site The Tab.
Victim Joe Pugh tweeted a link to the article and his girlfriend Leah Washington, who had her leg amputated, also tweeted in reference to it.
The students have since apologised.
The University of Nottingham Students' Union claimed the costume was "in no way intended to reference the tragedy" at Alton Towers.
However, the reporter who wrote the article said some of the students were wearing fake amputated legs.
The university itself said it "expects to receive a full report" from the students' union.
The Tab reporter Joseph Archer, who wrote the article with colleague Claire Anderson, said the students were happy to pose for photos.
"They wanted their pictures taken; they wanted to be in The Tab," he said.
"They got into the formation of The Smiler ride and on the back row they had limbs hanging off."
Joe Pugh, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, tweeted a link to the story and said: "How awful and disrespectful can people get? Disgusting."
Mr Archer and his colleague were taking photos of several groups of students on a bar crawl called the "7 Legged" on Monday night.
The students called themselves the "7 Legless".
Mr Archer said they had stuffed some old jeans to make fake amputated legs.
In a statement, the University of Nottingham Students' Union, said: "The costume was in no way intended to reference the tragedy that occurred on the Smiler roller coaster at Alton Towers.
"Its design was based on a traditional concept that has existed for several years and no reference was made to the Smiler by the students involved.
"The students involved further wish to apologise unreservedly to those affected by the Smiler incident for any offence or distress they may have unwittingly caused."
The University of Nottingham said it had "liaised closely" with the students' union since it became aware of the conduct of those attending the event.
"The university is aware of the SU's initial investigations regarding this matter and its media statement issued today," it said.
"The university expects to receive a full report from the SU on the conduct of the event on 17 October and the future of the event itself."
Sixteen people were injured in the crash in June 2015, including Ms Washington and Vicky Balch, who both needed leg amputations.
Alton Towers operator Merlin was fined Â£5m after admitting breaching the Health and Safety Act.
Mr Archer has spoken to the students since the photos were published, but said they did not want to comment.
