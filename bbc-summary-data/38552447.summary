Newspaper headlines: Saving Stormont and missing terror accused

While the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal has dominated the headlines in recent months, only the Belfast Telegraph has devoted its front page to the saga on Monday.

The newspaper says the clock is ticking as pressure mounts on the DUP and Sinn Féin to resolve the stand-off over the controversial scheme, which could cost the Northern Ireland taxpayer £490m.
It goes with the bold headline "Seven days to save Stormont" and says First Minister Arlene Foster has told the paper she could accept a full public inquiry - but will not step aside. It adds that unless she does, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness will leave the executive, prompting an election.
On a related note, DUP MP Sammy Wilson claims in the News Letter that Sinn Féin plans to use the RHI debacle to extract political concessions from Mrs Foster.
He also believes his party would be justified in using a petition of concern to block Sinn Féin's motion of no-confidence in assembly speaker Robin Newton, expected to be lodged on Monday.
The Belfast Telegraph features quotes from Kyle Black, the son of murdered prison officer David Black.
He says his family feels betrayed by the justice system after it emerged that a man facing trial on charges linked to the murder, Damien Joseph McLaughlin, 40, of Kilmascally Road near Ardboe, has not been seen since November.
It is the main story in the News Letter, which says it asked a series of questions to police on Sunday about Mr McLaughlin's disappearance, but was told by a spokesperson that it "cannot comment on named individuals".
The Irish News focuses on the new Casement Park stadium in west Belfast and says police warned of an "unacceptable risk" in emergency evacuation plans for the development.
The paper says it has uncovered an email from a police officer which said the risk of injury would be "greatly increased" by proposals to use the Stockman's Lane area as the "main egress route for evacuation".
According to the paper, the correspondence was sent in November, weeks after the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) unveiled its new stadium design plans. Ulster GAA has said it is "confident of resolving all aspects pertaining to safety".
More than 1,300 complaints have been reported in the past five years involving Translink buses carrying school pupils, according to the Irish News.
Translink has said it carries about 55,000 pupils a day on its services. It adds that "any complaints are fully investigated and the vast majority are resolved promptly, with only a very small number relating to serious allegations of antisocial behaviour".
The Daily Mirror is urging us to wrap up warm as it predicts the "big freeze" is set to hit Northern Ireland on Wednesday night, with sub-zero temperatures and snow expected.
A weather expert told the newspaper Thursday will be a "bitterly cold day" with temperatures only rising to between 3C and 6C.
The paper also features a story about police in Northern Ireland posting a warning to parents about texting 'codes' that some teenagers use to disguise their phone or online messages.
The Facebook post by the PSNI in Newry and Mourne references a list published by a US technology show.
Some of the abbreviations are relatively bland, such as HAK, meaning hugs and kisses, or WYCM for Will you call me?
Others refer to sexual acts, drugs and suicide.
