Top-flight sides Birmingham City and Manchester City will meet at the national stadium on Saturday, 13 May.
The attendance is now set to surpass the 32,912 that saw Arsenal Ladies beat Chelsea 1-0 in the 2016 final.
Wembley staged the event for the first time in 2015 and is set to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.
Birmingham - who won the trophy at Ashton Gate in 2012, in front of fewer than 9,000 people - are in their second final, while Women's Champions League semi-finalists Manchester City are yet to win the competition.
The 2016 Women's Super League One champions beat Liverpool in this year's semi-finals, while Birmingham knocked out 2015 winners Chelsea on penalties.
