"Terrible loss of Amjad Sabri. His voice touched so many hearts & souls across the globe. Let's not be numbed by these murderous terrorists," journalist Najam Sethi tweets.
Also on Twitter, politician Imran Khan wrote: "Shocked at the murder of famous qawwal Amjad Sabri.... A complete failure of law & order & writ of the govt."
Singer Ali Zafar described his death as: "Extremely sad, disturbing and unacceptable specially since he had submitted an application for his protection!"
Pakistani TV channels have been broadcasting Mr Sabri's programmes, while the papers consider both his legacy and the return of "lawlessness" to the city of Karachi.
"The last Sabri silenced," says a headline in Daily Times. "Terrorists silence a Sufi", Pakistan Today reports while Dawn carries an obituary entitled "Powerful voice fades out".
"He enthralled music aficionados with his brand of spirituality, mysticism and ecstasy for years," the paper says in a separate article.
The Nation notes that a crackdown on militants had led to a "substantial drop in overall levels of violence", but adds that "occasional acts of terrorism continue to challenge the performance of law enforcers."
A Taliban splinter group has said it carried out the killing.
Hours after Sabri's death, Shia singer Farhan Ali Waris reported that an attempt had been made on his own life.
The Express Tribune says the incidents pushed people "back into a state of despair".
And in an editorial entitled "Karachi continues to bleed", The Nation holds the authorities responsible for their continued failure to end violence in the city.
Pakistan Today editor Arif Nizami on his talk show DNA on Channel 24 agrees. Describing Mr Sabri as a "sitting duck" as he had not been provided with adequate security, he blames "the police, Rangers and the provincial government... for this negligence".
