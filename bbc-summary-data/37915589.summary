Sailor Sir Robin Knox-Johnston banned for drink driving

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celebrated sailor Sir Robin Knox-Johnston has been banned from driving for 18 months after being caught at more than twice the drink-drive limit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Knox-Johnston, the first man to sail single-handed non-stop around the world, admitted drink-driving.
A taxi driver in Portsmouth alerted police to his standard of driving in a Suzuki Vitara on 28 October.
He gave a breathalyser reading of 77 micrograms (mcg) in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35mcg.
At Portsmouth Magistrates' Court, the 77-year-old was fined Â£440 and ordered to pay a Â£44 victim surcharge and Â£85 court costs.
Knox-Johnston, of Tower Street, Old Portsmouth, set his circumnavigation record when he competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race on 22 April, 1969.
He sailed into Falmouth aboard his 32ft (9.8m) boat Suhaili, 312 days after he left the Cornish port.
He also became the oldest yachtsman to complete a round-the-world solo voyage in the Velux 5 Oceans Race finishing in 2007 at the age of 68 and in 2014, at the age of 75, he finished the solo Transatlantic race the Route du Rhum in third place in the Rhum class.
The grandfather-of-five, who was born in Putney, London, is the chairman and founder of Clipper Ventures which runs the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, the biennial event which sees amateur sailors from around the world completing a 40,000-mile (64,000km) global circumnavigation.
