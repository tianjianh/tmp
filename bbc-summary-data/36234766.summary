Scottish Premiership: Kilmarnock 2-4 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Simon Murray helped Dundee United sign off from the Premiership with victory at Kilmarnock.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home defence allowed Mark Durnan a free header to give United the lead.
A defensive mistake from United then allowed in Kallum Higginbotham to equalise, before Tope Obadeyi galloped free to put Kilmarnock 2-1 in front.
But two fine second-half strikes from Murray and a goal from Harry Souttar ensured United bid farewell to the top flight with the three points.
With the Premiership play-off final double header against Falkirk coming up, Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark made seven changes to his side, with Kris Boyd and Josh Magennis both rested.
United gave winger Justin Johnson the chance to impress, as John Rankin captained the side in his last game for the club.
Dundee United opened the scoring from a corner. The Kilmarnock defending was far from perfect, and Durnan was able to pick his spot with a close-range header to put the visitors in front.
Soon after United almost made it 2-0. The pace of Johnson saw him get in behind the Kilmarnock defence and the winger tried to finish from a tight angle, but failed to find a way past Jamie MacDonald.
There was more poor defending in evidence as Kilmarnock equalised. Craig Slater fired in a fantastic effort from range which Luis Zwick could only parry. The ball bounced in the box and Rankin tried to head the ball back to his keeper but failed to get enough on the ball, allowing Higginbotham to nip in to make it 1-1.

The home side then took the lead. Rankin was dispossessed in midfield and the ball was played into the path of Obadeyi, playing in the lone striker role. He found himself one-on-one with Zwick and produced the perfect finish to lift the ball delicately over the keeper.
United would equalise through Murray, who used his pace and strength to hold off the Killie defenders after taking in a pass at the edge of the box. Murray kept his composure and unleashed an inch-perfect shot to beat MacDonald with an effort which nestled into the far corner of the net.
The effervescent Murray was the difference between the sides. The United forward cut inside to fire home past MacDonald - who perhaps should have done better - to make it 3-2.
Giant defender Souttar rose from the bench to weigh in with a goal to make it 4-2 to give the plucky band of travelling United defenders something to cheer.
