[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 1-1 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mid-table National League sides Barrow and Bromley played out a solid if not spectacular draw at Holker Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half produced few clear chances with neither side able to take the initiative.
Bromley's Adam Cunnington broke the deadlock before the hour with a well-driven shot from the edge of the box.
The home side won a late penalty after Jack Holland fouled Jason Walker, and although Walker had his effort saved, he headed home the rebound.
