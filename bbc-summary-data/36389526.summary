Ben Jacobs: Wasps' Australian centre to retire from rugby at 34

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wasps centre Ben Jacobs is to retire at the age of 34, after 14 years in professional rugby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian first arrived in England with Saracens in 2008 following a six-year spell with NSW Waratahs.
After a season under Eddie Jones at Saracens, he moved on to Wasps in 2009, spending two years at Adams Park before joining Japanese side Kyuden Voltex.
He returned to Australia with Western Force before rejoining Wasps at the start of the 2014-15 season.
Jacobs said: "I'd like to thank Bob Dwyer, who signed me to my first pro contract, Ewen McKenzie for giving me my first cap as a Waratah, Eddie Jones for bringing me over to Europe, Tony Hanks and Shaun Edwards for convincing me to sign with Wasps, and Dai Young in bringing me back to Wasps."
Jacobs, who has recently become a father for the first time, plans to stay in England in a coaching capacity.
Sydney-born Jacobs played 57 times for Wasps in his first two seasons with the club, scoring 10 tries, but he has been more of a squad player over the past three years, making just 31 further appearances.
He has not played since suffering a knee injury in the 15-11 Champions Cup defeat by Toulon in January.
Eddie Jones, the man who brought Jacobs to England, was full of praise for his fellow Australian.
"Ben's a lovely guy," said the England coach.
"He played a lot of good Super Rugby in Australia, particularly for the Waratahs. And, when I took over at Saracens, he was one of the guys I brought over.
"Unfortunately, Ben had a few injuries for Saracens, but since then he's done really well for Wasps and has played superbly for them.
"Guys like Elliot Daly have benefited enormously from playing with him. I'm sure, for the rest of his life, Ben will look back at his rugby with affection and enjoy those memories."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young added: "Ben has been a key figure within Wasps' squad during his two stints with the club.
"He has been a great influence within this group on and off the field and has made a big contribution over the past few seasons as we've worked our way up the table."
