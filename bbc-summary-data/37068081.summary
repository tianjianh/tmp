[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sons took the lead thanks to an own goal from goalkeeper Derek Gaston, whose attempted punch from a cross spun into his own net.
Substitute Kudus Oyenuga had not been field for two minutes when the striker finished from Michael Tidser's cross just after the hour.
Oyenuga should have had a second but he fired wide from inside the box.
With momentum having swung Morton's way, Grant Gallagher headed Ricki Lamie's cross against his own post.
Joe Thomson had a late effort ruled out for the visitors and Oyenuga headed wide in the closing moments as the Ton came closest to a winner.
