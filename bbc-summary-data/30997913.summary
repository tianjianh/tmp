Both borrowing and saving by customers of the UK's main banks picked up during 2014, according to figures from the British Bankers' Association (BBA).

New deposits into Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) run by banks were up 57% on 2013, due to the new higher ??15,000 annual limit.
Meanwhile unsecured borrowing by customers rose by 3.8% during the year - the fastest growth rate since 2008.
Spending on all credit cards rose by 4% during 2014, the BBA said.
Richard Woolhouse, the BBA's chief economist, said: "Robust employment data is making many of us feel more secure in our jobs and optimistic about our futures.
"That's now feeding through to personal lending and credit card data, suggesting people are happy to finally replace the car or spend on household improvements.
"The mortgage market has been softening since the spring, but for customers taking out home loans right now there are some great deals and we expect the market to begin to grow again this year," he added.
Mortgage lending by the major banks fell back towards the end of the year, in line with a general cooling down of the property market.
But even so, total mortgage lending by the big banks rose by 18% in the year to ??130bn, and the number of new mortgages approved by the banks rose by 9% during 2014.
