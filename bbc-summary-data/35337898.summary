With the home side chasing 296, Maxwell hit eight fours and three sixes but fell with one required, looking for the boundary that would give him a century.
India had posted 295-6 thanks to Virat Kohli's run-a-ball 117, while Aussie pace bowler John Hastings took 4-58.
Australia have taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.
The series concludes with games in Canberra (20 January) and Sydney (23 February) before the sides meet in three Twenty20 internationals.
