[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts v Somerset: Jake Ball and Michael Lumb lead hosts to final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Superb individual displays from Jake Ball and Michael Lumb guided Notts into the YB40 final with an eight-wicket semi-final victory over Somerset.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ball took 4-25 as the visitors were skittled for just 119 in 25.4 overs in a match reduced to 35 overs because of rain earlier in the afternoon.
Opener Lumb then hit 46 from 38 balls to put the hosts totally in command.
Samit Patel (43no) and James Taylor (20no) took Notts home with an unbroken third-wicket stand of 60 in 122-2.
Things started badly for Somerset when Marcus Trescothick lost the toss and his side were forced to bat first.
And the former England opener's misery was compounded when he was out fourth ball for a duck, caught behind by Chris Read off Harry Gurney.
Craig Kieswetter and Peter Trego then got the visitors up and running with a quickfire partnership of 37 but, a ball after lofting Ajmal Shahzad for the second six of his innings, the England one-day wicketkeeper became another Read victim when on 22.

Nick Compton fell to a great catch by David Hussey for 14 to give Steven Mullaney the first of his three wickets and James Hildreth was bowled by Ball for five to spoil his 29th birthday.
A lot then rested on Trego, who had been holding the innings together, but after he was caught and bowled by Mullaney for 40, the rest of the team quickly folded.
Craig Meschede was left on 20 not out and Lewis Gregory hit 12 but the last five wickets fell for 28 in less than seven overs.

Ball was even close to a hat-trick after dismissing Alfonso Thomas and Jamie Overton, but Steve Kirby survived.
Notts' innings was briefly interrupted by a rain delay after nine balls and two balls after the resumption, Alex Hales was lbw to Kirby for five.
But Lumb took over with his 41-minute innings and when he was out to leave the score 62-2, the match already seemed won.
And so it proved as Patel hit his entertaining unbeaten 43 from 26 balls as he and Taylor secured victory.
Notts will now play Glamorgan in the final at Lord's on 21 September.
