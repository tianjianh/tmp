Organiser London Marathon Events says Swim Serpentine has grown out of popular demand for an open water event held in the lake that staged the successful London 2012 swimming competitions.
Up to 6,000 people are expected to complete the mile-long (1.6km) competition, which starts at 10:00 BST on Saturday. The 5km (3.1mile) elite invitational British Open Water Swimming Championships will be held on Sunday.
