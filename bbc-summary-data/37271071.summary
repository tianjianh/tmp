[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The M20 has fully reopened earlier than expected after demolition work to remove the remains of a collapsed bridge.

The footbridge came down near Maidstone in Kent after it was hit by a lorry carrying a digger last weekend.
A large part of the motorway was due to be shut in both directions until Monday morning for the removal to take place.
But Highways England had reopened both north and southbound carriageways by 16:30 BST on Sunday.
About 100 people were working "around the clock" to remove the remaining section of the bridge, Highways England said on Saturday.
Drivers had been warned the road would be closed between junctions 1 and 4 coast-bound and junctions 4 and 2 London-bound from Friday evening until 06:00 BST on Monday.
The collapsed section of the pedestrian bridge, near the village of Addington, was removed from the scene last weekend, and the road was reopened a day later.
The M20 is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover.
