Election 2015: Stephen Crabb awaits prime minister's call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb is waiting to hear if he will keep his post in David Cameron's new Conservative government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Crabb first got the job in July 2014, after being a junior Wales Office minister and a government whip.
The prime minister, who leads the first Tory majority government in 18 years, has spent the weekend assembling his new team of ministers.
Mr Crabb was first elected as MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire in 2005.
Last week, he said he was "excited" by the prospect of providing further Welsh devolution, and committed to ensuring "fair funding" for Wales.
Mr Crabb was named 2014 Welsh Politician of the Year, when the chair of judges said he had "revitalised" political debate.
Raised by a single parent in a council house, he grew up in Haverfordwest and attended the town's Tasker Milward School.
