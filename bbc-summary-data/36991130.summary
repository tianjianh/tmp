The 26-year-old Australian moved to the Vikings this season from NRL side Canterbury Bulldogs and has scored 21 tries in his 26 appearances.
Thompson, who can also play at full-back, had a deal that ran until the end of 2017 when he joined.
"I think Widnes have shown that we can produce something exciting in the years ahead," he said.
