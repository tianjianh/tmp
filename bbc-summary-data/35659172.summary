[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of India Chipchase, 20, was found at a man's house in Northampton the next day on 31 January.
Book-keeper Edward Tenniswood, 51, from Stanley Road, in the town, is due to go on trial in July for her murder.
Northamptonshire senior coroner Anne Pember told the brief hearing in Kettering Ms Chipchase's body was identified by her uncle.
Her body was identified at Leicester Infirmary by Tony Risdale, the inquest heard.
Ms Chipchase's body was released to her relatives earlier this week.
Her family did not attend the hearing, which was also told a post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
The inquest has been adjourned until 17 August.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street in the early hours of Saturday 30 January and was reported missing after failing to turn up for work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Mr Tenniswood's trial is expected to start on 18 July.
Earlier this month, Northamptonshire Police referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over its "responses before and during" the search.
