Christian Doidge put the Daggers ahead inside the first minute, volleying home from Oliver Muldoon's lofted ball.
Joe Worrall met a deep Ashley Hemmings corner to nod in a second soon after.
Ayina's deflected effort gave the hosts late hope before Wilkinson pounced with a tap-in finish after goalkeeper Mark Cousins parried Alex Rodman's shot.
Wilkinson and Ayina were among three strikers signed by Newport on Thursday.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "Yes, you want three points in every game but it was a fantastic comeback and that was the thing that pleased me.
I'm disappointed with the goals we conceded and we got off to the worst possible start.
"But I believed in the players. Their fitness levels have improved and I thought by the end there was only going to one team to win it. "
Dagenham & Redbridge assistant manager Ian Culverhouse told BBC Radio London:

"We asked for a fast start and they delivered. To be two goals up in the first 10 to 15 minutes was tremendous for them.
"We had a couple of opportunities in the second half as well where we broke really quickly, but the final product was just not there.
"The way we defended and the attitude of the players was superb.
"The equaliser has killed us but we will analyse it and come again stronger. We are adding building blocks all the time.
