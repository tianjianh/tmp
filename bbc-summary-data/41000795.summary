Louise Galvin replaces Eimear Considine at wing with Cliodhna Moloney and Ciara Cooney taking over from Leah Lyons and Sophie Spence in the pack.
Moloney scored the late try in the 21-5 defeat by the French which ended Irish hopes of reaching the semi-finals.
Hosts Ireland beat Australia 19-17 in the opening pool match in Dublin.
Hooker Lyons and second row Spence drop to the bench while Considine is not named in the match day squad.
Ulster prop Ilse van Staden is included in the Ireland replacements after being called into the squad on Sunday as a replacement for injured Ruth O'Reilly.

Since the huge disappointment of Thursday's defeat by the French, Ireland coach Tom Tierney has faced the task of attempting to restore morale for the play-off matches.
The hosts went into the tournament hoping to at least emulate their performance in France three years ago when, helped by a stunning win over New Zealand, they reached the semi-finals.
However, they produced laboured performances in edging out Australia and Japan in their opening Pool C games and were then put to the sword in the first half of Thursday's game.
Tierney insists that Ireland's training has been "very positive" since the squad arrived in Belfast on Friday.
"There is huge pride in this team and we're looking to finish this tournament with two performances," said the Ireland coach.
"We've reviewed our own games and looked at areas where we can improve in both attack and defence.
"We know what the Australians will bring to the game tomorrow, and we will have to be ready to match their physicality from the start."
Ireland: Tyrrell; Galvin, Murphy, Naoupu, Miller; Stapleton, Cronin; Peat, Moloney, Egan; Cooney, O'Reilly; Griffin, Molloy (capt), Fitzpatrick.
Replacements: Lyons, Van Staden, O'Connor, Spence, Caplice, Muldoon, Fitzhenry, McLaughlin.
