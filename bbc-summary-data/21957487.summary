War crimes court jails Bosnian Serbs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two former top Bosnian Serb officials have been convicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague over atrocities committed during the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both Mico Stanisic and Stojan Zupljanin were sentenced to 22 years in jail.
Stanisic was interior minister of the Bosnian Serb republic and Zupljanin a senior security official.
The court said both took part in a campaign to remove Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs from the region.
They were convicted of crimes against humanity including acts of murder, torture, unlawful detention, deportation and plunder in various parts of Bosnia in 1992.
In its ruling, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) said the two had taken part in a "joint criminal enterprise with the objective to permanently remove non-Serbs from the territory of a planned Serbian state".
Stanisic, 58, gave himself up in 2005.  Zupljanin, a former police chief in the north-western Bosanska Krajina region was arrested in 2008 after more than nine years on the run.
Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic are still on trial at the ICTY over atrocities committed during the conflict, including the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.
About 100,000 people were killed during the Bosnian conflict.
