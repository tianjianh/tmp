Police said she was making her way home from the Drumchapel area of the city, when she was forced into the driveway of a disused premises near to Killermont Polo Club and attacked.
The incident happened at about 02:30.
The suspect was described as black, 6ft tall, with a heavy build. He was wearing a dark jumper with a hood.
He is also reported to be in his thirties, with two missing front teeth.
He left the area following the assault, while the woman took a taxi home and contacted police.
Detectives said they were doing all they could to find the person responsible, including checking CCTV footage and conducting door-to-door enquiries in the area.
They have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
Det Insp Craig Willison said: "This was a horrendous ordeal for a young woman to have to experience and it is critical that we trace this man as soon as possible.
"Incidents like this are extremely rare particularly in this part of the city. However we need help from members of the public who may have vital information to assist with the investigation.
"I would also urge anyone who was in the surrounding area around that time who may have seen anything suspicious to contact police."
Officers want to speak, as a matter of urgency, to the taxi driver who drove the victim home.
They urged any driver who remembered picking up a "distressed" young woman, who had to stop at a bank cash machine for money to pay the fare, to come forward.
