The winner of the award will be announced during this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year, which will come live from the Genting Arena, Birmingham, on Sunday, 18 December.
Nominations will form a shortlist, with a panel including well-known sports stars deciding the winner.
Gymnast Ellie Downie took the award in 2015 after she became the first British female to win an individual all-around medal for Great Britain at the European Championships, claiming bronze at the age of 15.
Other past winners include diver Tom Daley, tennis player Andy Murray, footballer Wayne Rooney and Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds.
You can nominate by downloading and filling in this form and emailing it to sports.personality@bbc.co.uk or posting it to YOUNG SPOTY 2016, 3rd Floor, Quay House, MediaCityUK, Salford Quays, M50 2QH.
Nominees must have been 17 or under on the 1 January 2016 and nominations close on Friday, 11 November 2016. Nominations are made to the BBC and by sports governing bodies via the Youth Sport Trust.
This year, BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year has once again joined forces with Blue Peter to offer one young viewer the chance to join the panel to decide this year's shortlist.
The lucky viewer will be selected from those who have applied for a Blue Peter Sport Badge.
Youth Sport Trust's assistant director of development Will Roberts said: "Every year we are overwhelmed at the achievements of our hugely talented young sportsmen and women.
"This year we have witnessed some outstanding sporting performances, so trying to shortlist them to 10 and choosing the ultimate winner will be no easy feat.
"I hope our nominees will inspire other young people to get involved in sport and create even more stars of the future."
For more details of the nomination process, and for further information on how to join the judging panel, please see the terms and conditions.
