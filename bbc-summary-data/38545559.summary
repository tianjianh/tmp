Swansea City's Jack Cork says new head coach Paul Clement has boosted the Premier League strugglers' confidence.

Cork and fellow midfielder Ki Sung-yueng believe there was an improvement despite their 2-0 FA Cup exit at Hull.
Cork said: "He [Clement] has given us a bit of confidence. You could see we played some good stuff at times and it's looks like we're trying to go in the right direction."
"I think the players have the confidence back," Ki added.
Cork contends that even in Clement's first game in charge after succeeding American Bob Bradley and replacing caretaker Alan Curtis, Swansea looked a better team.
Abel Hernandez opened Hull's scoring and Josh Tymon struck late on to send Hull into the fourth round.
"We were comfortable really and just unfortunate that we conceded a late goal that finished the game off for us," said Cork.
"We're trying to impress the new manager, we're really trying to impress the fans, trying to make up for the first half of the season.
"Everything felt a lot more organised. Everyone knew their position to be in. We'd been working on it all week."
Ki highlighted Clement's background, where he has worked alongside Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, before taking over at Liberty Stadium.
"He knows football very, very well and has experience in a big club so he knows how to improve ourselves as a team and as individuals," said Ki.
"As we go through the season I think we'll get much better than you saw at Hull.
"And then hopefully we will go back to the philosophy we used to play, the passing and moving and maybe there is more to come."
