[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of Simon the giant rabbit - travelling on a plane to meet its new owner - was circulated widely on social media. We asked for your experiences of taking your pets on flights.

Brenda Lee-Lovell, who frequently transports her dog, Toby, between Canada and France, has some handy hints for people preparing to take their animals on board a flight.
"I check in my bag, get the paperwork done for the dog transport and then sit with him right until the last minute before he must be taken to a holding area for usually 90 minutes.
"I ensure the dog has been safely loaded, by walking up to the front of the plane to speak to the flight director, who confirms there's a dog on board. Even better is to stand there and have someone check with the pilot.
"Do not assume your pet will be given the same attention as a cabin passenger."
Paul and Hilary Ralston, who live in France, took their two cats on a flight from Los Angeles to Paris.
"Airline staff were totally unhelpful in Paris about where to find the poor things," said Paul.
"After multiple false leads, we ended up in a hire car well away from the passenger terminal in some huge freight warehouse where the two cages were standing next to a wide open truck door on a cold and windy evening."
Sadly, Kathleen Considine, from the US, knows only too well what it is like to lose a pet in transit. Her dog, Jacob, had been cleared to fly by a vet prior to departure.
"I recently lived a horror story flying my perfectly healthy seven-year-old golden retriever from Detroit to Portland. The airline didn't check to see if his crate would fit on his connecting flight, resulting in his 10-hour travel time extending to 32 hours.
"His stomach flipped due to the stress and suffocated his organs. My best friend didn't make it."

Jet set pets: The animals that fly (on planes)
Dr Polsner, from Suffolk, transported his dogs from Mexico to the UK without any problems, he says:
"The staff spoke to us several times before they were shipped and they arrived in tip-top condition. They were flown via Newark where they were taken off the plane and treated extremely well in a 'pet hotel'.
"I only have praise for the staff who arranged the flights and the transport."
Natalie Falcon moved from the UK to the US six years ago.
"I transported my two cats on a British airline. It was a very good experience. They were professional, caring and organised."
When Mark Jamieson returned to Manchester from the US with his three cats, he described the process as "awful".
"After driving them for 12 hours to the airport, I was told to hand them over at the cargo centre where forklift trucks and cargo staff were going about their business. There were no facilities to clean out the cats' carriers. No-one seemed to be expecting me.
"I waited hours for my payment to be processed and an inspection to take place. A bloke looked into each carrier and confirmed they were cats. That was it! I only just managed to check in on time myself.
"I had no idea if my cats were on the plane or not. But when I arrived in the UK's airport cargo centre, the staff were very professional. I was relieved to see my cats again."
Frank Trevino has flown his Japanese Spitz Danbi twice overseas between Seoul and Houston.
"My wife and I are happy with the efforts of the airline to ensure our family pet is safe."
Sandra Siegel, a vet in Germany, says people should be educated about transporting pets.
"As a rabbit owner, [the story of Simon the rabbit] is heartbreaking and hits home to me. There needs to be recognition that these pets are like family members to their owners.
"Perhaps the airlines should consider professional advice and recommendation from veterinarians. They are service providers after all."
