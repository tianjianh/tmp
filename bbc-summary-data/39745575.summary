[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All-rounder Shiv Thakor scored his first limited-overs century to lead Derbyshire to a six-wicket home win over Northants in the One-Day Cup.

The 23-year-old had earlier taken 3-39 as the visitors piled up 307-7, with Richard Levi hitting 109 off 107 balls,
Derbyshire's run-chase was boosted by a 168-run stand between Thakor and Billy Godleman, who was caught behind for 95.
Thakor was run out for 130 with 23 runs still needed, but Derbyshire reached 309-4 with eight balls to spare.
Gary Wilson struck the match-ending boundary off Azharullah in the penultimate over, but it was Thakor, who collected two sixes and 14 fours, who had laid the foundation for the victory.
It was Derbyshire's first win of this year's competition, after their opening game against Durham was abandoned because of rain, while Northants have now lost two out of two.
Thakor and Godleman's stand was a second-wicket List A record for Derbyshire against Northants, beating the 160 by current director of cricket Kim Barnett and Chris Adams on the same ground in 1995.
