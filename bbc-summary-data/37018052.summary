[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 5-1 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough ended Millwall's unbeaten start to the season in emphatic style with a thumping 5-1 victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marcus Maddison and Paul Taylor both struck early blows as the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead inside seven minutes.
Gwion Edwards added another goal before the break and then hit Posh's fourth seven minutes after the restart. Tom Nichols made it five in the 67th minute before Steve Morison pulled one back.
Neil Harris' Millwall side - who were losing finalists in the League One play-offs last season - looked completely out-of-sorts from start to finish.
Maddison's sixth-minute opener had an element of fortune as his cross from the right touchline evaded the Lions defenders and sailed into the net.
Yet Taylor's finish, just 90 seconds later, was more emphatic as he drilled a low shot past Jordan Archer after good work from strike partner Nichols.
Millwall midfielder Jimmy Abdou fired over the hosts' bar after Aiden O'Brien had teased Ben Alnwick out of his goal.
Yet Nichols' deft chip allowed Edwards to head past Archer on 20 minutes.
The same pair combined to put the game to bed on 52 minutes, as Edwards tucked away Nichols' cross from close range.
Former-Exeter striker Nichols got his reward for three assists when he slotted in the rebound after Archer failed to hold Jermaine Anderson's shot.
Morison grabbed a late goal for the visitors, yet it was hardly any consolation.
