Canadian singing group The Tenors has apologised after one of its members altered the country's anthem to include the phrase, "all lives matter".

The group was performing at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in San Diego when the singer went off-script.
Member Remigio Pereira held up a sign that read "all lives matter" while singing O Canada and also changed a lyric of the song to the same phrase.
The group said they were unaware of his plans to change the anthem.
The vocal quartet, based in British Columbia, issued an apology on Twitter, saying they were "deeply sorry for the disrespectful and misguided lack of judgment by one member of the group acting as a 'lone wolf' today".
The group added Mr Pereira would not be performing with them until further notice.
The incident inspired a hashtag on Twitter - #lonewolftenor,  under which hundreds of Canadians cracked jokes about the mini-scandal.
Mr Pereira changed the line from, "With glowing hearts we see thee rise, the True North strong and free" to "We're all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great".
He then held up a sign with the phrase and "United we stand" written on the back.
The phrase "all lives matter" has stirred controversy as critics argue it undermines the Black Lives Matter movement.
The singer's political statement comes amid a heated debate over racial divide in the US following the recent fatal shootings of two black men by police as well as a deadly attack in Dallas that left five police officers dead.
Mr Pereira took to Twitter to defend his actions.
"I've been so moved lately by the tragic loss of life and I hoped for a positive statement that would bring us ALL together. ONE LOVE," he wrote on Twitter.
"That was my singular motivation when I said all lives matter," he added.
