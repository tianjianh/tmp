Trapp was hurt in the 13th minute of the champions' 2-0 Ligue 1 win when he collided with team-mate Layvin Kurzawa.
The German, 25, was replaced at half-time by Italy international Salvatore Sirigu.
Lucas Moura scored twice for PSG, who drew their first leg against City 2-2 last Wednesday.
Manager Laurent Blanc rested most of his key players, including top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in readiness for the trip to Manchester.
PSG, who fielded their youngest starting line-up in more than 20 years, went ahead from the penalty spot early in the second half.
Lucas sent goalkeeper Jonas Lossl the wrong way after Jeremy Sorbon had fouled Christopher Nkunku.
The Brazilian winger secured victory when he controlled Kurzawa's cut-back before beating Lossl.
PSG, who secured their fourth successive title on 13 March, are 28 points clear of the two teams closest to them, Lyon and Monaco.
