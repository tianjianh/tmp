The pair from Haverhill have won the UK's second biggest ever lottery prize after being the only winners in Friday's lottery draw.
Camelot said the pair would reveal their plans for the future on Tuesday at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hertfordshire.
The lottery organisers said the total prize money won by the couple was £148,656,000.
Camelot said the lucky ticket holders would be revealed at the hotel in Hatfield Heath, near Bishop's Stortford, at 11:30 BST.
A National Lottery spokeswoman said: "We are looking forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into our millionaires club, joining the 2,900 millionaires created by the National Lottery to date".
The ticket is the second biggest National Lottery win behind Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire, who scooped £161m in July 2011.
It is also the second winning ticket by a couple from East Anglia in less than a year after Dave and Angela Dawes, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, won £101m in October.
The winning numbers were 11, 17, 21, 48 and 50. The lucky stars were 9 and 10.
It is the seventh Euromillions jackpot to be won in the UK so far in 2012.
In Friday's draw another UK millionaire was created in the Millionaire Raffle Selection game, with the winning code JDW 016965.
Camelot said to date Euromillions players have raised £28bn for National Lottery Good Causes.
