They were Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon, Philip Logan, 52, and Robert Huxley, 63, both from New Addington.
Those already named were Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz.
The tram driver, Alfred Dorris, 42, from Beckenham, south-east London, was arrested after the derailment on suspicion of manslaughter.
He was released on police bail.
A spokesman for FirstGroup, which operates the south London tram network for TfL said: "We can confirm that Alfred Dorris has worked for us since March 2008.
"Given the ongoing investigation we don't have anything further to add at this point."
The tram carriages were removed by accident investigators and taken away on the back of two lorries on Saturday morning.
Transport for London (TfL) said its engineers were making "good progress" with repairs to the tram track at the scene of the accident, but that services between East Croydon and Harrington Road, Addington Village and Elmers End would remain suspended on Monday.
TfL said it was not yet in a position to say when tram services would resume.
Seven people were killed and more than 50 were taken to hospital after the early morning crash at a sharp, left-hand curve near Sandilands tram stop.
The family of Mr Logan described him as "a true family man and generous friend to all, with a magnificently dry sense of humour".
"Phil was a man with more love, compassion and zest for life than words can express. He will be immensely missed by all that knew him", they said.
The family and friends of Mr Collett said he was a "well loved, funny and generous man, who could light up a room with his smile".
Family and friends of some of the seven victims marched together to the site of the accident to pay tribute to their loved ones on Saturday afternoon.
A group of up to 100 people walked down the road carrying banners, flags and flowers to the spot where members of the public have already being laying bouquets
Addressing mourners, one man said: "I've got a huge hole in my life which I've got to fill in and it's going to take to the day I die."
On Saturday morning the BTP said the 100ft-long articulated tram had been split into sections which were craned on to flatbed lorries.
All sections have now been taken away from the scene as the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) continues its inquiry.
On Friday, an extra minute's silence was added to the Armistice Day ceremony at Croydon Cenotaph to remember the victims.
A crowdfunding website set up by Croydon Council in the wake of the derailment has so far raised more than Â£8,000 to help the families of the victims.
The family of Phil Seary, 57, from New Addington, said he was a "much loved wonderful son, faithful husband and a loving and doting father".
Mr Seary's daughter, Karina Mimms, said he was "a gentle giant... He had an absolute heart of gold and would do anything for anybody".
Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, from New Addington, was the only woman to die in the crash.
Simon Smith, chief executive of SSP UK where she worked, said the company "offered our heartfelt condolences to her family and we are doing all we can to support them at this difficult time."
Nineteen-year-old Dane Chinnery, from New Addington, was described as "a beautiful lad".
Barbara Dumbleton, a family friend, said the teenager "always had a smile on his face... he was absolutely lovely."
The RAIB is calling for passengers to come forward if they think they have information relevant to its inquiry.
St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, said three patients remained in a serious condition following surgery.
Croydon Council said some had suffered "life-changing" injuries.
