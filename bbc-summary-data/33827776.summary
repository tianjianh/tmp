A 21-year-old woman was attacked at the junction of Craiglockhart Road and Craiglockhart Quadrant at about 22:30 on Wednesday.
Detectives said the suspect was white, in his 20s, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in tall, of an average to lean build.
He had dark, messy, medium-length hair and was wearing a dark grey hooded zip-up top and dark denim jeans.
The woman was walking home when the man approached her from behind and indecently assaulted her.
Following the attack, the suspect ran back along Craiglockhart Road, past the junction with Craiglockhart Park.
He is believed to have either turned right towards Elliot Road or left along Craiglockhart Road towards Colinton Road.
Det Ch Insp Alwyn Bell said: "As a result of our ongoing inquiry we have obtained a more detailed description of the suspect and the potential routes he has taken after this attack.
"I would ask that anyone who can help us trace this male contacts police immediately.
"In addition, we are also keen to speak to the drivers of two cars that were within Elliot Place around the time of the incident and would ask these motorists to also get in touch to assist with our investigation."
