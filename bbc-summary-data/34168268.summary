It follows a leak in an engineering plant room on the fifth floor of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth on Friday night.
The leak caused water damage in the operating theatres on the fourth floor.
The affected theatres have been closed while contractors carry out repairs "as quickly as possible", hospital managers said.
Chief operating officer Kevin Baber said: "The water damage to the theatres means we have no choice but to close them and make good the repairs.
"Our clinical staff are going through all the lists of planned operations due for patients this week to work out which can now go ahead, based on the theatres affected and prioritising those patients with the greatest clinical need.
"At the moment it is too early to say how many patients will be affected but all patients affected by a cancellation will be personally contacted.
"We can only apologise for this unforeseen event and reassure patients and their families that we are doing everything we can to get back to normal as soon as possible.
"I would like to thank our staff for their, as ever, professional response to this event."
