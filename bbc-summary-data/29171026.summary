Police said the child, who is thought to have been shot by her father who was found dead at the scene in Northiam, is seven years old.
Ch Supt Neil Honnor said a firearm had been recovered, but would not confirm the relationship between the girl and the man.
The body of the man was found in a car parked outside a house in the Spring Hill area of the village.
Prayers have been said at the injured girl's school, Beckley Church of England Primary in Beckley near Rye.
The area around the scene has been cordoned off since the shooting, which happened at about 16:00 BST on Thursday.
Ch Supt Honnor said officers had identified "the perpetrator of the offence".
"This does not appear to be an incident that's necessarily related to Northiam other than the fact that it happened there.
"We believe this is a domestic-related incident," he said.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Beckley CE Primary said: "We have received confirmation that the child who was shot is a pupil at our school.
"This is a dreadfully sad and shocking incident and the whole school community are praying for her and her family."
The girl is being treated at King's College Hospital in London.
