Russia vote: Opposition struggles with smears and isolation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It looked at first like no-one would turn up for the election rally.

Music pounded across the yard from a loudspeaker and Russian flags fluttered above a party banner. But the folding chairs stood stubbornly empty with red blankets draped over their backs.
If Ilya Yashin was perturbed by the low turnout when he eventually strode up to shake the hands of five pensioners, he did not show it.
The chief candidate from Russia's beleaguered opposition is running for a local parliament seat in Kostroma this weekend and he knows that every vote counts.
"I've come to discuss the problems that bother us all, and most importantly - how to resolve them," the 32-year-old informed his audience through a loudspeaker.
He talked of corruption, potholes the size of bomb craters and the vast gulf between measly state pensions and the astronomical salaries of senior officials - allies of Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
After more than 130 such encounters in under a month his manner is assured, his banter smooth. It has to be: the opposition has been granted the bare legal minimum of airtime on state media and has no presence at all on city billboards.
"We have no alternative, we have to go to the people and shake a thousand hands," Ilya Yashin explains, between meetings. He hopes the handful of voters who do turn out will spread the word.
A few hours' drive north-east of Moscow along roads lined with warnings of wild moose, Kostroma is the only region where his party, Parnas, managed to register.
The liberal opposition draws what support it has from Russia's urban, educated middle-class - those with access to information other than that provided by the heavily controlled state media.
But attempts to run in more promising regions were blocked. Parnas was only cleared to field a list of candidates in Kostroma on appeal.
"They don't like [us saying] that they don't give us access, because they're afraid of us," is how campaign manager Leonid Volkov interprets the authorities' change of heart.
"Instead the region is chosen so that our chances are minimal. But still, we are working hard," he adds, at Parnas HQ.
Crowded with volunteer activists, the office walls are pasted with flyers and a handwritten countdown to election day.
The big push for this campaign is aimed at reinvigorating support for the opposition ahead of national elections next year.
Allegations of vote rigging last time led to mass street protests against President Putin and his party - the most significant challenge yet to his power. But a wave of arrests soon followed.
Some activists are still in prison or facing criminal charges; others have left the country and just over six months ago the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot and killed beside the Kremlin.
"Because of all these sad stories, people don't believe in politics anymore. They don't believe in change," Mr Volkov explains. "This campaign is about generating optimism again."
But it is not easy.
An activist was physically attacked earlier this week; others have been threatened by youths in balaclavas.
We are asked not to speak English openly around Ilya Yashin, as pro-Kremlin activists and the media accuse the opposition of working to undermine Russia, for the West.
And the attempts to discredit Parnas are increasingly elaborate.
Midway through one rally a young, black man appeared in a suit and hovered for a moment at the back of the crowd. A second man filmed from a distance on a smart phone.
Moments later an opposition activist spotted a car parked nearby with fake, adhesive diplomatic number plates from the US.
"What on earth will they think up next?" Mr Yashin wonders, incredulous.
Ahead of the previous meeting, activists had found bundles of fake newspapers 'outing' him as gay: four pages of photoshopped images and suggestive commentary.
Leonid Volkov calls all this effort for a small, regional vote proof that the authorities are worried.
"Politics is always a pendulum and my guess is that support is swinging back in our favour," the campaign manager argues, suggesting that patriotic euphoria over the annexation of Crimea is giving way to the everyday grind of rising prices and economic hardship.
"They need to do something for us pensioners," one lady who's been listening to Mr Yashin agrees, apparently won over.
"They're young - they can do anything!" she says.
Behind her, the chief candidate is already rushing off to yet another yard, and another meeting.
It is a gruelling campaign, but Ilya Yashin is determined.
"This year, they killed my friend. Another is in prison, the chief of staff of my campaign.
"Boris Nemtsov is dead. We can't stop, we should keep on fighting," he insists.
"It's a question of the future of our country. If we stop, that means they win."
