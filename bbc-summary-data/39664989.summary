Crewshield produces the "safe haven", which they disguise as shipping containers, for crews on ships to hide in the event of a terrorist or pirate attack.
The award is the highest official accolade for businesses within the UK.
It won the International Trade category after first winning in the Innovation title in 2016.

Managing director Mike Samways said the company was "delighted to receive this recognition at the very highest level".
"It is humbling to be recognised again by Her Majesty the Queen," he said. "The last year has been exceptionally challenging and very busy but it is clear that the hard work is beginning to pay off."
The fire resistant containers can withstand small explosions and grenade attacks, as well as gunfire, the company said.
Mr Samways said they also designed the rooms to be used on land and had exported to countries such as Algeria, Libya, Mali and South Sudan.
"The 2013 attack on a gas plant in Algeria by terrorists linked to al-Qaeda, which ended with the deaths of about 40 foreigners including six British citizens, proved to be the catalyst for a substantial rise in demand for a land-based application of the refuge," he said.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the firm was one of a number of businesses that were being recognised for its "outstanding achievements".
The company started in 2011 and employs five staff.
