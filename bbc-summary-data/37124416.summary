Rio 2016: Hannah Mills & Jade Jones win gold medals to bring up Welsh record

Welsh athletes have claimed a record four gold medals at Rio 2016 after wins for sailor Hannah Mills and defending -57kg taekwondo champion Jade Jones.

Their victories follow gold medals for cyclists Elinor Barker and Owain Doull in their team pursuit events.
Their efforts surpass the previous record Olympic gold medal haul of three that Welsh competitors won in 2012.
Jones, 23, is a double Olympic champion and collected the 10th medal that Welsh athletes have won for Team GB in Rio.
The previous best Olympic medal haul by Welsh athletes was seven at London 2012.
Welsh athletes have returned from an Olympics with four gold medals before (Antwerp 1920), but those came in two team events so they count as just two medals as far as the medal table is concerned.
Jones beat Spain's Eva Calvo Gomez 16-7 in the final to win GB's 22nd gold of the 2016 Games and to successfully defend the title she won at London 2012.
Two head kicks in the third round sealed victory for Jones - who has now won both GB's taekwondo gold medals since its introduction as a medal sport in 2000.
"I'm still young so to be double Olympic champion already is crazy to be honest," she told BBC Sport.
"I did it when it mattered so I'm buzzing."
Mills won the 470 sailing event with team-mate Saskia Clark and she says her success in Brazil has eradicated any feelings of regret at winning silver at London 2012.
"I can't believe it. It has actually been the best feeling ever," Mills told BBC One. "It is all we have ever dreamed of and we are so happy."
"We have forgotten all about [the silver medal in] London.
"We are so proud to come back after it and we've worked so hard to get the upgrade to gold. Thank you to everyone back home for the support."
There could yet be more medals for Welsh athletes with former world champions Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins among the favourites to win the women's triathlon title on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Seren Bundy-Davies is a medal contender as part of Team GB's women's 4x400m relay squad on Sunday.
