Roisin Upton and Anna O'Flanagan both scored hat-tricks, with Naomi Carroll, Rebecca Barry, Nicci Daly and Katie Mullan also netting for Ireland.
Ireland had beaten Kazakhstan 12-0, hosts Malaysia 2-1 and Hong Kong 10-0 to win Pool B and reach the last eight.
The Irish will face Wales or Kazakhstan in the semi-finals on Saturday.
Ireland built up a 5-0 half-time lead over Singapore in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday and continued to dominate in the second half.
The tournament is Ireland's first round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup and they want a top-two finish to qualify for World League 3, where they could play in either Belgium (21 June-2 July) or South Africa (8-23 July) depending on rankings.
Ireland are the second highest ranked team in the tournament as they sit 16th, with only Italy, 15th, ranked above them.
