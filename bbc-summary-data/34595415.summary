Calls for 'more flexible' courts to open outside office hours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Courts should sit in local buildings and open outside office hours, a survey in mid and west Wales has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK government's consultation on plans to close 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales closed on 8 October.
More than 800 people responded to the survey commissioned by Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon.
Mr Salmon said the public needs a "more flexible" court system.
He said he would report the findings to Dyfed-Powys Local Criminal Justice Board.
Wales' closure-threatened courts are in Powys, Bridgend, Carmarthenshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Denbighshire and Wrexham.
Mr Salmon's office said 66% of respondents want courts to sit in community council chambers, 25% want to see courts using other community buildings and 9% would like courts to sit in schools.
The survey also found 62% of respondents would like to see courts held on evenings and weekends.
