He was a passenger in a Ford Fiesta carrying five people which hit a tree near Mintlaw on Saturday night.
The 17-year-old male driver, two 17-year-old females and an 18-year-old man were injured.
Mr Sangster's family described him as a "larger than life character" and said he would be "sorely missed."
Police want to speak to people who either witnessed the accident or saw the red Ford Fiesta before the crash.
The vehicle had been travelling along Station Road in Mintlaw.
William Sangster's family, including his mother Tracey Marshall and her husband Paul Marshall, father Philip Sangster and his wife Sarah Sangster and sister Nicole, 17, and brother Lewis, six, released a statement paying tribute to him.
They spoke of his love of farming, saying "it was what he lived for".
"Farming was in his blood," they said. "He was brought up in a farming environment and always adored tractors from a young age.
"He much preferred to be outside working with his hands than being indoors. Latterly he was working at Blackhills Farm at St Fergus but he worked for many of the local farmers."
The family also spoke of the "close" relationship he shared with them, particularly his sister Nicole, 17, saying: "William came from a big extended family and he will be sorely missed by all who knew him.
"He was well-known as a larger than life character and always had a big smile on his face. He was very close to his sister, they did everything together.
"You would just always hear him laughing, he was popular with everyone, had lots of friends and was a devoted partner to his girlfriend."
