[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man's death was the result of a failure in one-to-one care by a carer distracted while using a mobile phone, an inquest jury has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Majid Akhtar, 28, who had epilepsy, drowned at Kings Mill Reservoir, near Mansfield, in September 2012.
Nikki Deaney, a day centre care assistant from Springwood Day Centre, spent 19 minutes on the phone in a 34-minute period while supervising him.
A narrative verdict was recorded at Nottingham Coroner's Court.
The jury statement said: "The death resulted from the failure of one-to-one care when the carer became distracted whilst using her mobile telephone.
"While unsupervised [Majid Akhtar] probably fell unconscious via a seizure which meant he was unable to prevent himself from drowning."
The inquest heard that Ms Deaney also exchanged eight text messages in the time she was supervising Mr Akhtar.
Mr Akhtar, who had a mental age of four, had taken part in water sports with other people at the reservoir earlier in the day.
The court had earlier heard that his care plan stipulated he was "very vulnerable, with no concept of danger and needed one-to-one care at all times".
Mrs Deaney told police in a statement she had lost sight of Mr Akhtar for about three seconds.
His body was found by two people who were walking their dog at the reservoir. He was later pronounced dead at King's Mill Hospital, Sutton-in-Ashfield.
