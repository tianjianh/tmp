Kevin Keen: Colchester United 'not panicking' despite winless run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United manager Kevin Keen says they are not panicking despite having failed to win a League One game since 20 October.

Keen's side are bottom of the table, seven points adrift of safety.
"There is a gap but there is still a considerable amount of games left. If there was only five or six left we can start panicking," he told BBC Essex.
"There's 18 games left and I'm sure the performances will eventually turn into some good results."
Since Keen took up his first managerial role on 21 December, when he replaced Tony Humes, Colchester's only victory came in the FA Cup against Championship side Charlton.
And the 48-year-old former West Ham and Reading coach admitted: "It's obvious, we need to win football matches."
His side face Essex rivals Southend on Saturday - the same opponents for Keen's first match in charge, which Colchester lost 2-0.
"Out of the teams we've played they would be one of the better teams," said Keen.
"Their home form is normally good, they have a vocal support behind them, (Phil Brown's) a good manager, they've got two or three standout players who make things happen and a strong defence.
"I've looked at most of the teams in the League now and maybe apart from the top couple, there's not much between the rest."
