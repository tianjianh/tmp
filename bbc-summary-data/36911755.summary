The men have been named locally as 28-year-old Barney McGinley and Dermot Boyle who was 19.
It is understood their car was travelling the wrong way on a dual carriageway outside Letterkenny when it was in collision with a van.
The driver of the van is in a serious condition in hospital.
His injuries are not believed to be life threatening but have been described as "life changing".
The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) said it was investigating after reports "that there had been some interaction between gardaí and the vehicle in which the two young men were travelling prior to the collision".
The head-on collision happened at about 04:45 local time on Wednesday on the N13 at Trimragh.
Insp Michael Harrison told the BBC on Wednesday that he believed both men were from the Letterkenny area.
"The collision occurred on the inbound lane and it was between a grey Mitsubishi Carisma hatchback and a yellow Renault master van.
"It's a tragic day, to lose two young men in one incident is very sad," he said.
