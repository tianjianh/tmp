[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Gavin Smith, who appeared on Channel 5's Police Interceptors, died from cancer aged 34 on 15 February.
Mr Smith, who lived in Bishop Auckland with his wife Kezi and daughter Tilly, four, joined Durham Police in 2004.
Officers formed a guard of honour to accompany his cortege from Durham Market Square to the cathedral.
Insp Ed Turner of the roads policing unit said: "Gav was one of those characters who just put everybody at ease, no matter who was in his company.
"The station was always a more lively place when he was there. He had one of those infectious personalities.
"He would always put others before himself and right to the end he was focused on ensuring that Kezi and Tilly were OK and they would be provided for.
"In Gav we have not only lost a dedicated police officer, but a true friend."
He died at home surrounded by his family.
At the time, his widow Kezi said: "It has been a real comfort to both me and Tilly that he was so well regarded by so many.
"We will both miss him so very much."
