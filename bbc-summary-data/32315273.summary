Ground-hoppers face 42-hour race

Former Annan Athletic players are joining a challenge to visit all of Scotland's 42 senior football club grounds in just 42 hours.

It is to raise awareness of the JMA Trust - set up in memory of their friend John Maurice Aitken who died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged 32.
Joe Cranston, Gary McMenamin and Mr Aitken's brothers Kevin and Ciaran will leave with organiser Gordon Moffat from Stranraer on Thursday morning.
They will finish in Annan on Friday.
Mr Moffat said he believed the idea was one Mr Aitken would have appreciated.
"I just really wanted to do something that was quite personal and I know that John would have got into himself," he said.
"He was a very, outgoing sociable personal and a massive football fan so that was really how the idea developed.
"We're setting off at Stranraer and we finish off in John's home town of Annan, where his mum still lives."
