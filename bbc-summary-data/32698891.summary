[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 38-year-old, reportedly a wealthy tourist, was found unresponsive in one of the five-star Mayfair hotel's rooms on 1 May.
Police are treating the Kuwaiti national's death as "unexplained" and have informed his next of kin.
Two men arrested in connection with the death have been bailed to a date in June, Scotland Yard said.
A post-mortem examination was carried out but the results were inconclusive.
The coroner has ordered further toxicology tests, which may take up to seven weeks to come back.
