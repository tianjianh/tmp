The flanker has undergone surgery after being injured during a Warriors 'A' match against Edinburgh last month.
Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: "We all feel for Tyrone, who has had some bad luck with injuries during the past two seasons.
"He had started the season in good form and had been working hard in training."
Holmes will now miss an important run of games in Glasgow's season, starting at home to Pro12 rivals Leinster this weekend.
The Warriors then have a Champions Cup double-header against Scarlets, back-to-back meetings with Edinburgh in the Pro12, before their European pool concludes with matches against Racing 92 either side of a trip to Northampton.
"We're disappointed to lose Tyrone for the next few months, however we wish him all the best with his rehab," Townsend added.
