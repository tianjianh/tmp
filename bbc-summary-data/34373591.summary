Coventry roads close for city-wide cycle ride

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roads across Coventry have been closed for a city-wide cycling event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sky Ride saw people flock to the city on bicycles as stretches of the ring road and many city-centre streets were shut between 11:00 and 15:00 BST.
Rachel Lancaster, of Coventry City Council, said it was important to encourage people to cycle more regularly and the free event helped to do that.
At last year's event - the first in the city - about 8,000 cyclists took part.
