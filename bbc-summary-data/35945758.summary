[SN]TITLE[SN]
‘Dirty clothes’ halt Southampton acid attack trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a man accused of throwing acid in the face of a mother of six was halted because the defendant had "no clean clothes to wear to court".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Midmore, 22, is accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to 37-year-old Carla Whitlock.
But proceedings at Southampton Crown Court were halted on Thursday because he refused to leave prison as "his laundry had not been done".
Jail staff had not been available to wash them, a court heard.
The trial was able to resume on Friday.
A spokesman for the court said: "He refused to leave prison because his laundry had not been done."
Miss Whitlock was blinded in one eye and suffered scarring to her face after she was attacked with a drain cleaner containing concentrated sulphuric acid in Southampton city centre on 18 September.
The court has heard she was targeted in revenge after a drug deal went wrong.
Midmore denies causing grievous bodily harm, while his brother, Geoffrey Midmore, 26, has previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.
