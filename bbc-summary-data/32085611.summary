An investigation is under way to find the cause of a fire which broke out at Tilbury docks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thirteen fire crews from Essex were sent to Allied Mills at Tilbury docks in the early hours of Friday.
A spokesman for the fire service said the fire took hold in a grain conveyor belt and was "fanned by high winds".
The height of the fire meant a special system of hoses had to be set up to get water on the flames. The fire was brought under control by 02:40 GMT.
