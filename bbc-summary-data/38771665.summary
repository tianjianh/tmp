SECC station unlikely to change name after centre rebrand

Network Rail has indicated that it will not be changing the name of the Exhibition Centre station in Glasgow following a rebrand of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.

On Thursday the SECC changed its name to the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) to incorporate the Clyde Auditorium (Armadillo) and The SSE Hydro.
A Network Rail spokesman said it rarely changed station names.
He said such a change could involve spending a six-figure sum.
"Those funds can usually be better spent elsewhere on new infrastructure," he said.
He said high costs were incurred in a name change due to a number of factors, including updating nationwide computerised booking, timetabling and signalling systems as well as more localised costs such as new signage, new network maps and rerecording in-station/on-train announcements.
Live entertainment has now become a significant part of the SEC's business.
SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said the rebrand aimed to reflect the changes to the business over the past 30 years and to showcase the company's ability to stage large-scale events.
He added that, historically, the company had found that many people did not realise all of the buildings were part of the SECC.
When it was originally built in 1894, the station was called Stobcross. It closed in 1959 and after a 20-year absence reopened in 1979 as Finnieston. It was renamed the Exhibition Centre in 1986.
