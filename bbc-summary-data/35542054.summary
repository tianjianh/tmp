A man who travelled to Syria to fight with the so-called Islamic State has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Uddin, from Barking in east London, travelled to Syria in November 2014 but was detained for not having any travel documents when he returned to Turkey on 12 December.
The 29-year-old was stopped by counter terrorism officers when he arrived at Gatwick Airport on 22 December 2014.
He pleaded guilty to one charge of preparing acts for terrorism.
Sussex Police said security checks had led officers to suspect Uddin, of Wilmington Gardens, Barking, had been involved in terrorist-related activity.
He was also found to be in possession of extremist material.
Assistant Chief Constable Laura Nicholson, who leads counter-terrorism across the South-East, said "proactive work of Gatwick Airport port officers" had led to the capture of Uddin.
Sue Hemming of the Crown Prosecution Service said it had been "very clear" Uddin had "meticulously planned his trip".
"Online searches had been carried out relating to 'Islamic State fighting', which strongly implied a more sinister purpose to his trip," she said.
Uddin was sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court on Tuesday.
