[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £468m package of measures to deal with Operation Stack is being scrutinised by Kent County Council (KCC).

Operation Stack, when lorries park on the M20 during cross-Channel disruption, causes congestion in Kent.
Stack has been used for 32 days in 2015 following strikes, migrant activity and rail operations, a report said.
The options include lorry parks and an M20 contraflow. The government said work on a long-term solution continued.
Councillor Matthew Balfour, cabinet member for environment and transport, said none of the ideas were new, but it was a question of whether the government wanted to put them into effect.
"It's going to cost an awful lot of money," he said.
Mr Balfour said KCC would not spend any capital funds until the Department for Transport (DfT) guaranteed they would be repaid.
A task force looked at measures including an M20 smart motorway, a contraflow on the London-bound M20, an additional coastbound lane, more signing across the motorway network, improved communication, lorry parks and use of intelligent transport systems, the report said.
A three-month agreement to use the former Manston Airport to park up to 3,500 vehicles would be reviewed, the report added.
The report said the preliminary cost was £468m.
A DfT spokeswoman said: "Highways England are working closely with local partners including Shepway District Council and Kent County Council to deliver a long-term solution that will keep Kent moving. This work is on-going."
