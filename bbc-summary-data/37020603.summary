A £35m bypass which aims to cut congestion in North Yorkshire has opened two months ahead of schedule.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three-mile (5k) road is designed to reduce traffic flow through Bedale, Leeming Bar and Aiskew.
The road is a single carriageway between the A684 north of Bedale and east of Leeming Bar, crossing the A1(M) where there is a new junction.
Work had been due to be completed in the autumn.
