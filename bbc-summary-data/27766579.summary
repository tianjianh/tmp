Storm the Russian Steppe eagle swooped through an open door of Wendy Morrell's Poole home while she was watching the French Open final.
She described the 15in (40cm) tall bird as "stunning to look at, but quite scary".
Wessex Bird of Prey Rescue later collected the bird, which was being trained to scare seagulls away from a landfill site in Corfe Mullen.
He had broken away from the perch where he was tethered after being scared off by a lorry.
