Kilmarnock have extended Burnley full-back Luke Hendrie's loan until the end of the season - but four players have returned to their parent clubs.

Adams, 21, made nine appearances for the Ayrshire club, while Bojaj, 20, featured on five occasions; his last involvement coming in the Hogmanay stalemate with Partick Thistle.
Boyle, 21, played 14 times for the Scottish Premiership outfit, scoring on his debut in the League Cup win over Clyde in July.
Burn, also 21, made 10 appearances, before picking up a thigh injury against Hamilton Academical on 5 November.
