Jeremy Corbyn's first PMQs: Both sides happy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, nowhere to be seen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions. What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs today, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box.
Jeremy Corbyn's team are pleased because it was a serious attempt to change the brutal knockabout and present the Commons, and the public, with something different. That happened, and it was not a disaster.
The prime minister, for today at least, accepted Mr Corbyn's framework without jibes at his expense. He answered the questions as asked without insult, or any full throttle political attacks.
A source close to the new leader told me "it was a good result". They wanted a way of connecting the grassroots campaign that propelled him to his position with what happens at Westminster - bringing new voices into the debate and junking the rough and tumble. So far so good for them. And this kind of approach might be precisely the thing that people who are fed up with political slanging matches appreciate.
So why is the PM's side happy too? A No 10 source tells me they'll be "quite happy if he goes on like that".
Mr Corbyn asked questions on subjects that many members of the public really care about - housing, mental health, public services. But the questions were broad, not that specific, and crucially were lacking the kind of follow-up points PMQs normally involves.
So for David Cameron it was a chance to expound on the government's justification for doing what they are doing. In essence, "thank you for that very interesting question about our changes to the welfare system my right honourable friend. Now let me explain, as I have on many occasions, why I think my approach is terribly sensible".
David Cameron could smoothly field questions like that all day. And without questions that bite, the prime minister is not really held to account
But will it last? Maybe not. I'm told this was a "pre-conference experiment". Corbyn's team recognise this is not an approach they could take every week. But after a chaotic start, perhaps a refreshingly chaotic start to his leadership, he has proved the first big point he wanted to make.
There was though, one notable moment of drama and difficulty perhaps for the new leader when the DUP's Nigel Dodds asked a pointed question to David Cameron about IRA terrorism. Corbyn's team know this is a vulnerability for him that won't easily disappear.
