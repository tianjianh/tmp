Some of the pics have never been published before, some taken on the surface of the Moon during the early days of space exploration.
A portrait of Buzz Aldrin from the  Apollo 11 mission to the Moon shows the photographer, Neil Armstrong, and the Lunar Module reflected in his gold-plated visor.
Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the Moon, in 1969.
This is the first photograph ever taken from space, on 24 October 1946 from a camera on a V2 rocket.
Clyde Holliday, who worked on the project, wrote at the time in National Geographic magazine that it showed for the first time how the Earth would look to alien visitors!
For almost 20 years after the Apollo 11 Moon landings, the only pictures known of Neil Armstrong on the Moon were a few grainy images from the TV camera and the 16mm film footage. That was until this picture was found in their archives in Houston, Texas, USA.
This is a picture of the first spacewalk by an American, back in 1965. It shows astronaut Ed White and is from his personal photo album.
Astronaut Buzz Aldrin took the first space 'selfie' during the Gemini 12 mission in November 1966.
Buzz Aldrin also took this picture of a boot print on the Moon's surface, in July 1969.
The auction, From the Earth to the Moon will be held at Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions' saleroom in London on 26 February 2015.
