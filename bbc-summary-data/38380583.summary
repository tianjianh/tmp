A closure threatened 168-year-old newspaper is to keep printing while steps continue to allow it to be sold to a community company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The final edition of the Eskdale and Liddesdale Advertiser was due to be published this month.
However, the CN Group has confirmed it will keep going into 2017 after talks with a potential new owner.
It is hoped it can now be sold to a Langholm-based community interest company being formed for the purpose.
CN Group said the agreement was "yet to be formalised" and was subject to adequate funding being established for the new venture.
It was announced in November that the loss-making weekly title would close unless a new owner could be found.
A deal has now been reached which could secure its longer-term future.
Three staff at risk of redundancy have been asked to continue to produce the paper and its website.
David Helliwell, editorial director for CN Group, said: "Our hope at the start of this process was that there would be interest in keeping the E&L alive.
"It's been heartening to see the support for the newspaper and its staff and we will do all we can to see this potential sale through to a successful conclusion."
Langholm businessman David Stevenson, who would be a director of the community company, said: "Cumbrian Newspapers have been very supportive of our interest and have agreed to continue publication while we raise the funds for this venture and consult the people of Eskdale and Liddesdale on the future format of their community newspaper."
It is hoped the process of selling the title can be concluded by April.
