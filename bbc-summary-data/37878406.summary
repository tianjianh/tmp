[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoine Maury was last seen in Edinburgh on Monday 24 October.
The 21-year-old was last seen at Edinburgh College's Milton Road East campus at 22:00 when he suddenly left his friends.
Between 22:45 and 23:00, a man matching Mr Maury's description was seen near Duddingston Village. He was topless and heading towards Holyrood Park.
The Maury family said: "We are still appealing to the public for any information which can help find our son, Antoine.
"We want anyone who was in the area of Duddingston, Holyrood Park or Pollock Halls, on Monday 24 October, between 22:30 and 23:30, who saw a male running and walking, to contact the police."
Mr Maury is white and of medium build. He is about 6ft, with short, brown hair, a beard and a fair complexion.
He has a tattoo of a bleeding hand on his forearm.
When last seen he was wearing a brown/green bomber jacket with dark-coloured chinos and a white beanie hat.
He is also believed to have been wearing black and white Vans trainers.
Glasses belonging to Mr Maury, who suffers from poor eyesight, have since been found with some of his clothes on a golf course.
Divers are still searching Duddingston Loch and there are police searches in Holyrood Park.
On Saturday and Sunday about 100 volunteers joined officers in the search around Duddingston Golf Club and Holyrood High School.
Police Scotland has also continued its media appeal for Mr Maury.
This has resulted in more than 464,000 people being contacted through Police Scotland's Facebook page.
Officers have conducted door-to-door inquiries in the Duddingston and Pollock Halls areas and have reviewed CCTV in a bid to establish Mr Maury's last known movements.
Insp Alan Carson, of Police Scotland, said:  "Throughout this inquiry we have sought to provide Mr Maury's family with the answers they are desperately seeking.
"We are continuing to support and work with them and I pay tribute to the dignity and courage they have shown throughout this period.
"This is still a live investigation and we will carry on our search until we have exhausted our search parameters.
"The public response to our appeal has been enormous and we are grateful for the support offered by the people of Edinburgh.
"I would again appeal to anyone who may have information to come forward.  Even the smallest amount of information may be the key to helping us find Antoine."
