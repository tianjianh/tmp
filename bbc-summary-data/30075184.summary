[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bartosz Bortniczak and Arpad Kore, both 18; Blake Cairns, Jordanna Goodwin, and Megan Storey, all 16, died from their injuries after their Toyota collided with a Seat in Conisborough.
Four were students at Danum School, Doncaster, whose head teacher Rebecca Staples said they were devastated.
A 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving was later bailed.
Police said the man was thought to have been driving a third vehicle believed to be involved in the collision which happened at about 21:40 GMT on the A630.
Ms Staples said: "We are and will do everything we can to support those affected.
"We have opened books of remembrance, and will have quiet rooms on both our sites with counsellors available from the morning.
"This is the worst news a community can have, and we will pull together to support all those in need."
Blake was great fun and had a huge network of friends. He was a very sporty boy and represented the school in football teams. He had a real presence; a lovely cheeky boy who had great relationships with staff.
Jordanna Goodwin never missed a single day of school from primary to the end of year 11 and had received a special reward from the local authority. She was a joyful, bubbly girl who had a fantastic rapport with staff. She was our prom queen this year and looked so beautiful on the evening.
Arpad Kore was always willing to help and assist at school. He was a totally reliable member of our community, a true gentleman who looked out for everybody. He had a tremendous sense of humour.
Megan Storey was a really bubbly young woman. She was totally reliable for all her friends and truly loyal. She was a very caring, mature young woman who was a joy to be with. She too looked stunning at our prom.
Bartek Bortniczak had kept close ties with his school friends since leaving. He was a fun-loving young man, with a lovely character and a real sense of fun, a loveable lad. He was a member of our football teams and a down-to-earth soul.
People have begun laying floral tributes at the scene of the smash.
Kayleigh O'Connor said: "They were really lovely people. It's just such a shock to know they have gone, they were just so young."
The driver of the Seat, a 45-year-old man from Mexborough, suffered a broken leg.
Insp Pete Serhatlic, of South Yorkshire Police, who attended the scene said it was "absolutely horrific" and an "extremely sad situation".
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the circumstances of the crash to come forward.
The scene is just 100m from the site of a collision in which three teenagers were killed in 2011.
A 14, 15, and 16-year-old died when their car hit a tree.
