Neil Warnock eyes promotion as he takes charge at Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Warnock wants what he believes would a record eighth promotion as a manager at Cardiff City, but is tight-lipped on how long he will be there.

Warnock became the new Bluebirds' boss after Paul Trollope was sacked after only 12 matches in charge.
The 67-year-old has been out of work since the end of 2015-16 when he helped Rotherham avoid relegation.
"I was hoping I could get a job where I could get my eighth promotion or have a good go at it," he said.
"Whilst I don't think it's impossible at any level to do that it's probably going to be a little more difficult when you're second bottom.
"Before the end of my career it'd be nice to do that, no one else has done that before.
"You've got to have ambitions and you've got to have challenges and that still is the last big challenge that I've got in my career to do and I hope that I can achieve that while I'm here."

With the summer transfer window having closed and the January window scrapped, Warnock hopes to bring in fresh faces from the pool of club-less players seeking work before Cardiff host Bristol City on Friday, 14 October.
He said: "We've talked about the playing side. I've only been here 24-hours, but I haven't been idle.
"I've been looking to improve the squad and try and bring faces in before the Bristol City game and I've had total backing on that."
It remains unclear how long Warnock will be in the Welsh capital.
The club statement announcing his appointment on Wednesday did not mention any details on the duration of his contract.
He added: "I don't think you can say anything is long term, can you really?
"One of the clubs I talked to [in the summer] talked about a long term project and didn't want me because I couldn't commit to three years.
"But you tell me many managers in the Championship who last three years.
"I think it's ridiculous, you should only look to tomorrow.
"You should only look at building a club as far as you can.
"You go on the ride and you hope you can take it where you want to go.
"I think in the Championship, if you start looking long term, I think it's all talk.
"When he [Chairman Mehmet Dalman] told me that I was his number one choice I just said, well, I'll come.
"We hadn't even discussed finance or anything like that and that's how we are.
"What are contracts? When you're a young manager you want a three-year contract because you know you're going to get sacked at some stage and you'll get a good pay off. We'll play it by ear.
"First and foremost, we've got to see how we go, we've got to win games.
"Whilst I'm not committed for three or four years, you just don't know in this game."
Bluebirds chairman Mehmet Dalman said the club had tried to appoint Warnock in the past, and strongly refuted suggestions the club have refused to pay the money needed to attract a "big name" manager to the club.
"He's here," he said.  "It's not true. We have Neil Warnock here so how can that have any credibility?
"He was our number one choice, not once, but twice.
"We missed out on him once before so we were pretty determined not to miss out on him again."
Warnock also dismissed the notion that he would struggle to work under Cardiff's controversial owner Vincent Tan saying that "everyone deserves a chance".
He said "When I went to Crystal Palace, I'd retired then and Simon Jordan asked me to go to Selhurst Park.
"The first question that day was 'how can you characters get together without fighting' and the rest of it.
"Simon Jordan was the best chairman by a mile that I've ever had.
"Knowledgeable, supportive, you name it, so I think you've got to give everyone an opportunity."
