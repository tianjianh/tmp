Plans to create replica trenches alongside original ones where soldiers trained during World War One have been approved by Denbighshire council.

The trenches at Bodelwyddan Castle were used by soldiers based at a former nearby camp during their basic training.
They have filled in over time although their zigzag outlines can still be seen.
Councillors approved the plans at a committee meeting on Wednesday.
A planning report said the development would provide "tourism and history benefits".
During the war, an Army camp housing approximately 20,000 recruits was built at Kinmel Park, near Rhyl, for basic training.
The Army requisitioned large areas of the Bodelwyddan estate and, while the castle was used as a convalescence hospital for wounded officers, a trench warfare training area was built within the grounds.
The trenches have similar structures to those found in Belgium and France.
