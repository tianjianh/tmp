Scotland 2-2 England: Gordon Strachan so close to his 'best ever' result

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gordon Strachan believes it would have been his best result as a manager had Scotland beaten England in Saturday's World Cup qualifier at Hampden.

"That was probably the most emotional game of my managerial career," said head coach Strachan after Harry Kane's stoppage-time volley earned England a 2-2 draw.
"People pushed themselves to another level to get a result for this country.
"It was like watching a heavyweight boxer against a middleweight."
Despite the heroics of Leigh Griffiths, who lashed two free-kicks past Joe Hart in the 87th and 90th minutes, Scotland's World Cup qualification hopes remain slim.
However, Strachan said he was "too tired to think about where we are, I just want to go home".
After six matches, Scotland, on eight points, trail Group F leaders England by six points, second-place Slovakia by four and Slovenia by three.
Lithuania, who on Saturday lost 2-1 at home to Slovakia, will be Scotland's opponents on 1 September, three days before Strachan's side host bottom side Malta.
Scotland then finish the qualification campaign at home to Slovakia and away to Slovenia.

"As a football player you get on with it, but as a manager that was hard work," added the Scotland boss.
"That could have been my best result as a manager, and I've been lucky enough to get some good ones: Manchester United, AC Milan and people like that.
"The power, the strength and the speed of England is phenomenal. They play at a different level to most of us.
"I don't think anybody realises, when they watch the telly, how big and strong and quick these guys are.
"No matter what everyone thinks of us as a group of players, you can't question their personality, character and commitment. That was beyond the call of duty.
"Imagine being a player out there. It's annoying for them to do so much and almost have a result that would have been one of the best ever."
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's 70th-minute goal had looked like it would give Gareth Southgate's men the three points.
But Griffiths's exquisite late set-piece finishes sent the Tartan Army into raptures.
"I've seen Scotland's best-ever free-kick and then Scotland's second best free-kick ever," said Strachan of the Celtic striker's goals.
"I heard a noise after that that I've never heard anything like before.
"To put the work that he put in and then have a free-kick, when you're tired at the end of the game, and be able to execute it is phenomenal. That says a lot. People were going down with cramp.
"It was probably the tallest wall you could put up in European football. He's gone round them, over the top. He's a great character, you know, a wonderful character. Strange, but wonderful."
