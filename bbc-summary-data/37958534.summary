Cardiff City 3-2 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three first-half goals helped Cardiff City to victory over faltering Huddersfield Town, who lost for the fourth time in six Championship games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Morrison headed in a corner and Junior Hoilett turned in a rebound to put Cardiff 2-0 up, before Tommy Smith replied from Kasey Palmer's pass.
Rickie Lambert swept in a headed flick-on to restore Cardiff's two-goal lead.
Philip Billing's superb volley from the edge of the box set up a tense finish but the Welsh side held on for victory.
The Terriers, who began the game third in the Championship table, remain six points behind second-placed Brighton.
Reading's win over Burton saw David Wagner's side drop to fourth as Huddersfield's winless run stretched to three matches, a sequence in which they have conceded nine goals.
Cardiff, meanwhile, have won three of their six matches since Neil Warnock took charge in October.
Despite their fine attacking display, the Welsh side were denied a first clean sheet in the league since drawing 0-0 at Birmingham on the opening day of the season.
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock:
"When we saw their teamsheet, we knew what they were going to do as they were playing three centre halves.
"We wanted to change straight away to give ourselves more of an advantage. I thought that worked a treat - we warned them what we were going to do and we implemented it.
"I thought we really took the game to them to start with and we knew they would have spells because they are such a good side you can't get the ball off them at times."
Huddersfield manager David Wagner:
"The away form isn't worrying. The form is good, we just need to sort out the set-pieces.
"We've scored two goals, but come away with nothing? We just need to keep on working on it and hope it improves."
