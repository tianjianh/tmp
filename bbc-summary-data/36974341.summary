Rory Gallagher 'unconcerned' by Jim McGuinness' commentary on Donegal

Donegal manager Rory Gallagher says he is "unconcerned" by Jim McGuinness' commentary on his team's performances in this year's Championship.

In his Irish Times column last month, McGuinness described Donegal's Ulster Final tactics as "predictable" and said the bench hadn't been fully utilised.
This week, McGuinness appeared to praise Gallagher for his introduction of young players such as Eoin McHugh.
"He's entitled to his opinion," Gallagher told BBC Radio Foyle.
"I haven't seen either of the articles though obviously you've been filled in on bits and pieces.
"At the end of the day, Jim is no longer part of the group.

"And again, we're only concerned about what goes on (in the group)."
Fermanagh native Gallagher was McGuinness' assistant when the Glenties man guided Donegal to the 2012 All-Ireland title.
Gallagher parted company from the management team after the heavy All-Ireland quarter-final defeat by Mayo 11 months later but was appointed boss in October 2014 after McGuinness' departure.
Ahead of Saturday's All-Ireland quarter-final tussle against champions Dublin, Gallagher has also refused to join those who say that Jim Gavin's side have a huge advantage over other counties because of the population in the capital and the financial resources that they have in terms of sponsorship and their extended backroom staff.
"I don't buy into that at all," said the Donegal manager.
"I think Dublin have done an awful lot of quality work and I would respect what Dublin have done from living there.
"I see the work that goes into clubs and the county."
Predictably, Gallagher claims that Donegal's shock 3-14 to 0-17 semi-final win over the Dubs in 2014 will have "no relevance" to Saturday's last-eight clash.
"It's a new season. There are new players in both teams. It's going to be a different challenge altogether."
For the record, the turnover in personnel in the Dubs line-up means Rory O'Carroll, Jack McCaffrey and the retired Alan Brogan will not be involved this weekend while keeper Paul Durcan is among the Donegal absentees with him now working in Dubai.
With Mark Anthony McGinley operating between the posts, Eoin McHugh and Martin O'Reilly have also become established in the Donegal team over the last two years.
