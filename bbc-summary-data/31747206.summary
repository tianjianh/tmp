They spent 10 hours at the scene of the fire at Carnsalloch House after the alarm was raised at 23:05 on Tuesday.
Initial reports suggested the woods at nearby Kirkton were on fire but officers said they found a single storey annexe of the building "well alight".
Two further teams of firefighters were sent to the scene.
Police are treating the fire as suspicious.
Station manager Ian Anderson said: "The fire had penetrated the roof of the annex and our crews were strategically positioned to tackle the flames from points outside the building.
"We had multiple jets in use to knock down the fire before our team undertook dampening down and cutting away operations to ensure it was fully extinguished."
He said one crew remained at the house until shortly after 09:00 on Wednesday to ensure the fire was completely out.
The A-listed property is on the national Buildings at Risk Register, but planners have so far refused permission for a scheme to save it which involves converting the house into flats and building additional houses in the grounds.
The proposals are set to go before Dumfries and Galloway Council's planning review committee next week.
