[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The test involves all twelve alarms in and around Grangemouth petrochemical complex being activated.
The system will broadcast warning tones and verbal instructions to the public at 19:00.
The biannual warning test is operated by the plant's major incident control committee (MICC).
MICC chairman Derek Brown said: "Throughout the year, MICC member companies work together with the emergency services and Falkirk Council to train and exercise to ensure we are match fit to deal with the many different situations that could arise."
An investigation was launched into the cause of a gas leak at the Grangemouth petrochemical site earlier this month.
