Dasha the greyhound disappeared in Derbyshire during the summer of 2014. Owner Jessica Miller claims it was sold without her permission.
The dog was spotted by a farmer almost 100 miles away in Herefordshire and has since returned home.
Ms Miller, who had used social media to find Dasha, said: "I genuinely believed I would never see Dasha again."

Dasha was last seen in Alvaston, near Derby, and on 9 May was spotted wandering down a country lane in Staunton-on-Arrow, in Leominster.
Herefordshire Council enforcement officer Dave Poolton found the dog to be microchipped and managed to trace Ms Miller.
Mr Poolton said: "When I saw that the dog was last registered in Derbyshire several years ago, I naturally assumed that the microchip was out of date. Nevertheless, I called Jessica, and the first thing she did was burst into tears. I have to admit, I welled up a little myself."
Ms Miller was thrilled to be reunited with her dog and said Dasha had "been through the wars" and had a laceration on his front paw, but was now "on the mend".
