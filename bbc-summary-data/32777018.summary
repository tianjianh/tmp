Some bridges over the Thames were temporarily closed to the public as film crew warned pedestrians from getting too close to the action on Sunday night.
Members of the production told bystanders Daniel Craig would be taking part in a scene filmed on a speedboat.
The film, called Spectre, is scheduled for release on 6 November.
It comes after the success of Skyfall in 2012, which grossed Â£700m worldwide.
The 007 production will be based at Pinewood Studios and filmed on location in London, Mexico City, Rome and Tangier and Erfoud, in Morocco.
Daniel Craig returns as Bond, playing him for the fourth time.
Other cast members include Sherlock's Andrew Scott, as a Whitehall-based character called Denbigh, and Guardians of the Galaxy actor Dave Bautista, playing a henchman called Mr Hinx.
Italian actress Monica Bellucci and France's Lea Seydoux have been unveiled as the new 'Bond girls', named Lucia Sciarra and Madeleine Swann respectively.
Spectre - Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion - was the name of an international crime syndicate.
The organisation featured in the Bond films of the 1960s and was part of a legal tussle with a rival film producer that was recently resolved after many years.
According to the film studio, the plot will see "a cryptic message from Bond's past send him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation".
