The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) announced plans to give almost £2.8m to Levengrove Park in Dumbarton.
It will also award nearly £1.5m to Aden Country Park in Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire.
Plans for Levengrove include building a new pavilion with a cafe, upgrading play areas and restoring the Victorian park's historic features, such as the original entrance.
Eight new jobs will be created at the Dumbarton park -  three posts in the pavilion cafe, two apprentice gardeners and three rangers.
West Dunbartonshire councillor Patrick McGlinchey said: "It is fantastic that we have secured this significant grant funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support our restoration of Levengrove Park's historic character and upgrade its amenities.
"Once the work is completed Levengrove will be transformed and with its stunning setting on the banks of the Clyde will offer visitors an experience which it will be hard to rival anywhere else in Scotland."
The grant for Aden Country Park will be used to restore and upgrade facilities at the 230-acre park.
The cash is part of £30.7m the HLF and the Big Lottery Fund is giving to parks across the UK.
Lucy Casot, head of HLF in Scotland, said: "A wonderful legacy from our ancestors, public parks are increasingly under threat which makes this investment of National Lottery players' money even more vital."
