Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has extended his contract at Old Trafford until June 2015, with the option of a further year.

The England midfielder, 32, is currently recovering from an Achilles injury he aggravated in the 1-0 Premier League win over Arsenal on 10 November.
But Carrick has impressed manager David Moyes in his 10 league appearances this season.
"He is an exceptional man and a true professional," Moyes said.
United debut: 23 Aug 2006 at Charlton
Appearances: 334
Goals: 21
Trivia: Since joining Manchester United seven years ago, Carrick has only lost out in a league title race by one point [to Chelsea in 2009-2010] and goal difference [to Manchester City in 2011-2012]
Carrick has helped United win five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one League Cup and one Fifa Club World Cup since Sir Alex Ferguson signed him from Tottenham in July 2006.
"The club has gone through a few changes and working under David Moyes has been fantastic," said the former West Ham United player.
"I have won many trophies in my years playing here and I am looking forward to achieving more in the future."
Carrick was ruled out for six weeks with an Achilles tendon injury earlier this month.
He has made 334 appearances in seven years at United but Carrick has been limited to just 31 England appearances.
Moyes, who took over from Ferguson in May, said: "England have had some top midfielders over the years and Michael fits into that category as well.
"He's been a great player for Manchester United and I think he is recognised by people throughout the country.
"They know what he can offer. I would be surprised if he wasn't part of the England squad that went to the World Cup."
