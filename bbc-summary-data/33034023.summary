[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He died in the early hours of Saturday morning in a care unit in Derry. His family was at the unit with him.
The civil servant was 30 when he was attacked by a mob at a barbecue in the Waterside in Derry, and never regained consciousness.
Daryl Proctor, who was convicted of the attack and given a 12-year jail term, was released in February this year.
Mr McCauley suffered multiple injuries, including a brain haemorrhage and a fractured skull, when he and two friends were beaten by a gang of youths.
He also had two heart attacks on the way to Altnagelvin Hospital.
In 2014 PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton apologised to the McCauley family for not bringing more people to justice for the attack.
