Mr Paisley, son of former first minister Dr Ian Paisley, said Mr McGuinness's "remarkable journey not only saved lives, but made the lives of countless people better".
Mr McGuinness forged a friendship with the late Dr Paisley when they shared power at Stormont, despite previously being sworn enemies.
When Dr Paisley died, Mr McGuinness said he had lost "a friend".
On Thursday, Mr McGuinness confirmed he would not stand in the Northern Ireland Assembly election citing health issues.
