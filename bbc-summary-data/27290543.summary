[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A night service at a minor injuries unit in Somerset is running again after a staff shortage led to its closure.

NHS bosses shut the Minehead Community Hospital unit between 23:00 and 07:00 in March and warned it could take until August to recruit more staff.
However, a solution has been found to redirect an emergency nurse to Minehead to reinstate the overnight shift.
Somerset's NHS Trust is in the process of recruiting four new nurses to help maintain its minor injury units.
It said there remained a shortage of "appropriately qualified" emergency nurse practitioners (ENPs).
But it added that taking on temporary medical cover in Bridgwater had meant a member of staff could be released to help elsewhere in the county.
