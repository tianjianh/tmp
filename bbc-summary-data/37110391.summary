Rovers led 22-6 at the break, with Mantellato, James Greenwood and Ken Sio going over, while Mason Caton-Brown responded for the Red Devils.
Gareth O'Brien went in for Salford's second score before Albert Kelly kicked a Hull KR drop-goal.
Thomas Minns added a fourth try to seal Rovers second Qualifiers victory.
The win moves them to second in the table, while Salford remain sixth with just one win from three games since the Super 8s split.
Salford coach Ian Watson: "It was error after error and with our poor completion rate we had no chance of winning the game.
"We have got to get together as a group and reassess, but it is going to be difficult avoiding the fourth v fifth play-off (Million Pound) match now.
"Going to Leeds next is the be all and end all and we have to win. Super League has been and gone. We did a decent job there but this is a different competition.
"We don't seem to be focused on how serious a competition this is, players' careers are at stake."
Hull KR coach James Webster: "Everyone knew how big a game it was.
"Salford are not dead and buried but we took a small step to what we want to achieve.
"We controlled the tempo of the game but there are still going to be ups and downs and we have a huge match against Leigh next up."
