The 29-year-old striker, who plays in Sweden, is regarded as the best female player of all time after being named Fifa World Player of the Year five times between 2006 and 2010.
"All my life I've tried to play at the highest level, so why not?" Marta said.
"You never know. I'm feeling good in my club right now, so I don't think about other clubs, but I'd never say no."
If she did come to the WSL, she would certainly pose a goal threat, having scored 92 times in 95 games for Brazil.
Marta, who currently plays for Swedish side Rosengard, was speaking after they lost 3-1 against Manchester City in a pre-season friendly.
She did not feature in the match because of a hamstring problem but says she was impressed with the WSL 1 side's performance.
"City surprised me because they have a very strong team," she told BBC Sport. "There was a lot of high pressure and they did very well.
"We didn't play the best game, but it was a very good test for us. What I see is very positive for women's football, we need more clubs like this."
Marta currently holds the record for the most goals at World Cups, having claimed her 15th at last summer's tournament in Canada.
She was also part of the Brazil teams that won silver medals at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, as well as the side that was knocked out at the quarter-final stage in 2012.
She says her focus is now on going one better at this summer's home Games in Rio.
"It's so important because it's our first Olympic Games in Brazil, so we have an opportunity to show we're the best," she said.
"It may be my last Olympic Games, so it's very special. We were so close to winning the gold in 2008, so we'll try to do our best.
"We have so much pressure on every team in Brazil, so it's just one more time."
