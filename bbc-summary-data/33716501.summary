David Cameron criticised over migrant 'swarm' language

David Cameron has been criticised for his description of migrants trying to reach Britain as a "swarm".

Speaking on the Calais crisis, he spoke of "a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain".
Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham said his choice of language was "disgraceful", and UKIP leader Nigel Farage distanced himself from the term.
It comes as hundreds more migrants stormed the Channel Tunnel overnight.
Several hundred people were escorted away from the terminal by French police on Wednesday night - a third night of large-scale attempts to storm the Channel Tunnel.
Thousands of migrants have been trying to reach the UK from Calais this week, and nine people have been killed attempting to cross the Channel in the past month.
Mr Cameron, who is on a tour of South East Asia, warned that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK, saying Britain will not become a "safe haven" for migrants in Calais.
Speaking to ITV News, he said the situation was "very testing".
"I accept that, because you have got a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain has got jobs, it's got a growing economy, it's an incredible place to live," he added.
His language drew criticism from Mr Burnham, who tweeted: "Cameron calling Calais migrants a "swarm" is nothing short of disgraceful. Confirms there's no dog-whistle these Bullingdon Boys won't blow."
And the Refugee Council, which works with refugees in the UK, said his comments were "irresponsible" and "dehumanising".
"This sort of rhetoric is extremely inflammatory and comes at a time when the Government should be focused on working with its European counterparts to respond calmly and compassionately to this dreadful humanitarian crisis," it added.
Mr Farage, meanwhile, suggested it was part of an effort by Mr Cameron to sound "tough" on immigration.
"I'm not seeking to use language like that," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "The prime minister is trying to sound tough, whether he actually means it or not is a separate question."
But speaking about his personal experience of the chaos at Calais earlier that morning Mr Farage told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "A couple of times I've been stuck on the motorway and surrounded by swarms of potential migrants to Britain and once, even, they tried the back door of the car to see whether they could get in."
The UN Special Representative for International Migration accused British politicians of adopting a "xenophobic response" to the migrants crisis and said their the language had been "grossly excessive".
