The incident happened at Baltimore Harbour on Tuesday evening.
The bodies of Barry Ryan, 51, from Baltimore and 20-year-old Niamh O'Connor from Glanmire in Cork city, were found later that night.
However, Mr Ryan's son, also called Barry, remains missing.
Barry Ryan Sr was the son of Penneys founder Arthur Ryan and was a senior executive with the retail clothing company.
It is understood the victims were part of a group walking close to the harbour when one of them fell into the sea.
Two others then went into the water to try to rescue the first person, but all three got into difficulties.
The alarm was raised at 18:40 local time by a member of their group who remained on the shore.
On Wednesday, divers and a Coast Guard helicopter concentrated their search for Mr Ryan just outside the entrance to Baltimore Harbour where the accident took place.
Speaking on Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰'s Six One News on Wednesday evening, John Kearney of the West Cork Underwater Search and Rescue Team said that eyewitnesses reported seeing the casualties in an area not previously checked.
He said it was quite a treacherous area, particularly where the terrain is rocky.
