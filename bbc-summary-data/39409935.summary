Inverurie Pictish stone conservation under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A project to conserve four Pictish stones in Aberdeenshire has got under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A team of experts from Edinburgh's Spectrum Heritage is 3D scanning the structures, which sit in the Old Inverurie Churchyard.
Exposure to the elements has left the stones in a poor condition, and some of the Pictish carvings have been eroded.
The stones will be temporarily removed to allow conservation work to take place.
Clara Molina Sanchez, director of Spectrum Heritage, said: "The 3D recording is going to help the conservation process.
"We'll be removing the biological growth that's growing on the surface of the stones and consolidating all the areas that are a little bit fragile."
