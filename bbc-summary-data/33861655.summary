Cash boost for Manston Airport compulsory purchase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company that hopes to re-open Manston Airport has offered £2m to help win a compulsory purchase order (CPO).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The airport closed in May 2014 and was sold to a private consortium that plans to build homes on the site.
However, Thanet District Council has said it may apply for a CPO.
The Supporters of Manston Airport pressure group has said a US firm, RiverOak, has offered the cash to help the council cover legal costs should it decide to pursue the purchase.
In a statement the group said: "We can now confirm that RiverOak have deposited $2m into their solicitors client's account.
"This will be topped up to £2m and moved into an escrow account as soon as the indemnity agreement is signed."
The current owners have previously said they will fight any CPO attempt.
