Alloa are still searching for their first home win, but kept Buddies keeper Jamie Langfield busy early on.
Matchwinner Watson cleared Iain Flannigan's effort off the line following a scramble.
And the defender netted the clincher to leave Alloa 13 points adrift at the foot of the table.
St Mirren manager Alex Rae watched the game from the stand after accepting a one-match touchline ban, having been sent from the dugout area during Tuesday's defeat by Raith Rovers.
