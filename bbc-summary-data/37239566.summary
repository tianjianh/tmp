But Swiss wide man Saidy Janko did move to Barnsley on a season-long loan.
The 22-year-old Simunovic passed a medical with Torino, but Celtic and the Italian club could not agree a fee.
Celtic had accepted a bid of around Â£300,000 for Ambrose from Belgian top-flight club Standard Liege, but the 27-year-old Nigerian international has decided to remain with Celtic.
Ambrose, who joined Celtic from Israeli club Ashdod in 2012, has only played twice this season under Brendan Rodgers.
Simunovic, who moved to Celtic from Dinamo Zagreb, has not featured this season after playing 18 times in an injury troubled first season at Celtic Park.
Switzerland Under-21 cap Janko, the 20-year-old who joined from Manchester United last year, had made seven appearances this season.
Meanwhile, Stuart Armstrong also remained with Celtic despite interest from two English Championship clubs in the midfielder.
