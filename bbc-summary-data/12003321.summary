Oxford dog owners face harsher dog mess fines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tougher dog control measures could soon be implemented in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city council has proposed that owners face harsher fines for dog fouling and is asking the public to take part in a consultation.
Dogs could be banned from play areas in parks and owners set limits on the number of dogs they take for walks in public.
Authorised officers would also have the power to request dogs be put on a lead.
Councillor John Tanner, board member for the Cleaner Greener Oxford campaign, said: "There is nothing more annoying than getting dog mess on your shoe or in the wheels of the pushchair.
"Oxford City Council wants to get tough with irresponsible dog owners."
The consultation runs until 31 January and a report is presented to the city's executive board in March.
If approved, the new dog control orders would come into effect on 1 April.
