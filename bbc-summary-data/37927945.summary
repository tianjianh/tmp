Andrew Johnson, 64, from Bawtry, South Yorkshire, targeted women and girls, some as young as 12 years old.
The 30-month increase to his sentence brings his total jail term to more than 14 years.
He pleaded guilty on Monday to 12 counts of indecent assault against eight patients between 1978 and 1997 at GP surgeries in Doncaster.
Two of Johnson's victims were under 16 at the time of the abuse, and his youngest was 12.
In July 2014, Johnson was sentenced to 11 years and eight months for numerous sexual assaults against his patients.
Following that trial at Sheffield Crown Court, further victims came forward to report sexual offences.
Det Chf Insp Steve Whittaker said: "Johnson completely and utterly abused his position.
"On his own admission, he was unable to remember precisely how many victims he had abused."
Johnson was struck off by the General Medical Council prior to the start of the police investigation in 2010.
