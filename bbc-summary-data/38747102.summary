The RSPCA was called when the six-month-old cat was found with his head entirely encased within the tub after raiding a bin in Oxford on Saturday.
Frost covered the fur of the black and white stray which could not move, the charity said.
Inspectors used scissors to cut the jar away from the kitten's head who was unhurt by the ordeal.

"Once I managed to lever the cat out, I had a good check over his head and neck to check for injuries. Thankfully the cat was unhurt," RSPCA inspector Jaime Godfrey said.
"As soon as the cat was free, he ran away very fast. He was obviously shaken up by his experience.
"The cat is a known stray on nearby farmland and was probably scavenging for food when he got his head stuck."
