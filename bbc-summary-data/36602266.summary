Euro 2016: Wales v Northern Ireland, England v Iceland & Republic of Ireland v France in last 16

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales will play Northern Ireland in the last 16 of Euro 2016, while England take on Iceland and the Republic of Ireland face France.

The Republic were minutes from going out but finished third in Group E with a late 1-0 win over Italy and progress.
Wales, who topped Group B, play Michael O'Neill's Northern Ireland in Paris on Saturday (17:00 BST).
England, who were runners-up behind Wales, play surprise Group F runners-up Iceland in Nice on Monday (20:00 BST).
Martin O'Neill's Republic of Ireland side, who like Northern Ireland qualified as one of four best third-placed teams, take on hosts France in Lyon on Sunday at 14:00 BST.
Neither Northern Ireland nor Wales had ever qualified for the European Championship before this year's edition, the first to feature 24 teams, while it is the first time the Republic have made the knockout stages of a Euros.
The last time the Republic of Ireland played France was in 2009, when Thierry Henry handled the ball in the build-up to the deciding goal in a World Cup qualification play-off.
With a population of just 330,000, England's opponents Iceland are the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament.

The Republic of Ireland were heading out before a late Robbie Brady header gave them a 1-0 win over Italy and sent them through as another one of the best third-placed teams.
Winger James McClean said the sight of "grown men crying and complete love for our country" was "quite remarkable", adding: "We knew it would be win or bust, we left nothing on the field, the best night of my life, hands down."
Goalscorer Brady said he was "absolutely flabbergasted" by the result.
That dramatic climax echoed scenes earlier on Wednesday as Iceland sealed second place in Group F by scoring a last-minute goal to beat Austria 2-1.

That twist left Portugal in third - after their star forward Cristiano Ronaldo criticised Iceland's "small mentality" earlier in the group stages.
Had the match finished 1-1, England would have faced Portugal in the last 16 instead.
The Portuguese, who now play Group D winners Croatia, knocked England out of the European Championship in 2004 and the World Cup in 2006, both times after a penalty shootout.
BBC commentator John Motson said: "The third-place argument has been laid to rest. Who would have thought when we started this adventure that England, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland would all be in the last 16?"

Former Republic of Ireland international Kevin Kilbane on BBC Radio 5 live: "It does not get any better than this. We wanted this, we were desperate for this - I fancied our chances.
"It is amazing. I am so happy for Martin O'Neill, the staff and the supporters. They have done us all proud. This is incredible."
Albania's players were rewarded with diplomatic passports after a 1-0 win over Romania gave them hope of progressing as one of the best third-placed teams, but missed out on goal difference.
Romania, denied a point against France in the tournament's opening match by a late Dimitri Payet strike, finished bottom of Group A.
Russia's players were widely criticised in the nation's media after finishing bottom of Group B with just one point, despite holding England to a draw with a late goal of their own. Manager Leonid Slutsky has offered his resignation.
Ukraine were the only side to fail to score and exit without a point, the 2-0 defeat by Northern Ireland ultimately proving enough for O'Neill's side to progress.
Sweden finished bottom of Group E after defeat by Belgium on Wednesday, prompting striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic's retirement.
Turkey's 2-0 victory over the Czech Republic gave them hope of making the knockout stage as one of the best third-placed teams, but they were denied by the Republic of Ireland's winner against Italy.
The Czechs finished bottom in Group D, while Austria scored just one goal in their three games to finish bottom of Group F.
