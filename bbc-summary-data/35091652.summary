Backing for Ellon to Dyce rail link to re-open from SAPT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The re-opening of a railway link between Ellon and Dyce is being recommended by the Scottish Association for Public Transport.

SAPT believes the 14-mile line would "revolutionise" transport in the area.
SAPT chairman Dr John McCormick said the train service would appeal to commuters and help reduce journey times, congestion and pollution.
It comes as a consultation about transport in the north east of Scotland draws to a close on Tuesday.
Transport partnership Nestrans has been asking for feedback on several options aimed at improving links to the north of Aberdeen.
Dr McCormick explained: "Aberdeenshire suffered most from the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, losing all its suburban and rural railway lines.
"Train services to Fraserburgh and Peterhead were withdrawn in 1965 and these are now the furthest isolated towns from the Scottish rail network.
"The very successful re-opening of the Borders rail link to Galashiels shows that a fast rail service is very attractive to commuters and other travellers.
"In Aberdeenshire, the re-opened Dyce and Laurencekirk stations confirm that good train services are popular with travellers.
"A fast train service from a railhead at Ellon via Dyce to Aberdeen would attract car commuters and help to regenerate the economy and reduce road congestion and pollution in Aberdeen city centre."
He added: "Co-ordinated bus links from Fraserburgh and Peterhead to an Ellon railhead could be the first steps towards fully re-opening the railway to these towns."
Campaigners have been arguing the Aberdeen City Regional Deal offers the chance to making the Ellon link a reality.
