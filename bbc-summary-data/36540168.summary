The disruption occurred as Ruth Langsford was speaking to Coleen Nolan about her struggles with weight loss.
During the item, fathers' rights protesters were heard shouting: "No kids, no cash!"
The show cut to a standby screen with the Loose Women logo for around 20 seconds, as the shouting faded away.
Once back on air, Nolan joked: "Can we get back to me?"
Langsford said: "Those gentlemen have left us, so where were we?"
A message was immediately posted on the Loose Women Twitter account, reading: "Apologies for that small interruption."
An ITV spokesperson said: "The show was briefly interrupted today by three members of the audience who were making a peaceful protest."
The production team were widely praised on social media for dealing with the disruption quickly.
Singer and actress Michelle Heaton tweeted: "Wow Loose Women, love that you came back on air within seconds... well done!"
One viewer, Ian Wright, wrote: "Wanted to congratulate all on the panel & the background staff for the way they dealt with it."
