[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, went missing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds on 23 September.
He was last spotted on CCTV walking alone in Brentgovel Street at 03:25 BST the next day.
Suffolk Police closed one lane of the eastbound A14 between the Moreton Hall and Rougham junctions.
It remained coned-off from 10:00 until just after lunchtime.
Their search was due to cover a mile-and-a-half stretch of the road.
Over the past few weeks officers have been carrying out extensive work to locate Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline in Fife.
Detectives believe he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.
Police said dozens of people have been spoken to and hundreds of lines of inquiry followed up but are still urging anyone with information to come forward.
A trace on his mobile phone, which has not been found, showed it was in Bury St Edmunds early on 24 September but then moved to the Barton Mills area.
Facebook and Twitter pages have been set up appealing for information to help the police inquiry.
A police spokeswoman said today's lane closure was a follow-up to a "potential line of inquiry", but it had provided no new information to the missing person inquiry.
