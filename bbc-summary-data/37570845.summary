Shares in Japanese electronics company Fujitsu jumped more than 7% on media reports it will sell its computer business to Chinese firm Lenovo.

Neither of the companies confirmed the deal but Fujitsu said it was considering it as one of its options.
The firm said that since splitting off its PC business in February it was "considering various options, including what is being reported".
According to the Nikkei newspaper, the deal is to be reached this month.
Some 2,000 Fujitsu workers were likely to move to the world's biggest PC maker Lenovo, the newspaper said.
Fujitsu had initially been in talks with Toshiba and Sony spin-off Vaio for a merger of all three companies' computer businesses but the negotiations failed to reach an agreement.
The rising popularity of smartphones and tablets has for years been squeezing the demand for personal computers, making it harder for smaller manufacturers to survive.
Worldwide computer shipments in the second quarter this year shrank 4.5% from a year earlier to 62.4 million units.
Fujitsu accounted for just over 6% of those while global leader Lenovo made up 21.2%, followed by HP with 20.8% and Dell with 16% according to research company IDC.
