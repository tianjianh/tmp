Update due for national resilience centre in Dumfries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are to be given a progress report on plans to develop a national resilience centre in Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The facility, based on the town's Crichton estate, is due to open in the next 12 months.
The centre will be used primarily to research ways to improve responses to weather-related emergencies such as flooding.
A report to the council's policy and resources committee will give a full update on progress to date.
Initially the facility will have up to six staff.
Last month, the Scottish government gave assurances that plans to develop the centre remained on track.
It followed concerns from Dumfriesshire Labour MSP Elaine Murray about the pace of progress on the project, since it was first announced in August last year.
A report to the council says it is essential the renewed impetus is maintained.
To that end working groups are being set up, and council and government officials are exploring the best location and office arrangements for the centre.
