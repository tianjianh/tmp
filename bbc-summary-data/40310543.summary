The 19-year-old joins the National League club after signing his first professional contract with Palace last June.
He failed to feature in any first-team games for the Eagles last year but can play both centre-back or right back.
"I'm a local boy," Wynter said on joining Bromley. "The club is definitely going in the right direction and I can't wait to get started."
