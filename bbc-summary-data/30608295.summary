Officers are questioning a man aged 22 on suspicion of aggravated burglary.
Police are holding a woman aged 27 on suspicion of assisting an offender.
A Humberside Police spokesman said: "The elderly couple injured in the aggravated burglary remain in hospital and are both described as being stable."
Police were alerted after members of the public reported seeing a man running from the pensioners' home.
A man was seen driving away in a white van following the attack, which happened at about 17:20 GMT.
Det Insp Jon Cross said on Tuesday evening: "This was a vicious attack on two elderly and vulnerable members of the community in their own home."
A 36-year-old man arrested in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, on Christmas Eve has been released on bail pending further enquiries.
