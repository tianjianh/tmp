The internal investigation into Clarkson's suspension, following a "fracas" with a producer, will be considered by Tony Hall next week.
Director of BBC Scotland, Ken MacQuarrie, who is leading the investigation, "is now considering the evidence", a BBC spokesperson said.
"Once this has been considered, we will set out any further steps."
"The BBC will not be offering further commentary until then," the spokesperson concluded.
Clarkson was suspended from Top Gear on 10 March, following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon.
Mr Tymon did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported the incident himself.
A lawyer for Mr Tymon said his client "intends to await the outcome of the BBC investigation and will make no comment until that investigation is complete".
All remaining shows in the current series were pulled following the incident.
Online petition
Top Gear is one of the BBC's most popular and profitable TV shows, with an estimated global audience of 350 million.
Its success is largely attributed to the contentious host, who has appeared on the show since 1988.
An online petition calling for the star's reinstatement - set up by political blogger Guido Fawkes - has accrued more than 975,000 signatures since the presenter's suspension.
Clarkson has expressed regret over the incident, which his co-presenter James May labelled "a bit of a dust-up".
The host was given what he called his "final warning" by bosses at the corporation last May after claims he used a racist word during filming.
He and his co-presenters May and Richard Hammond, are due to renegotiate their contracts with the BBC next month.
