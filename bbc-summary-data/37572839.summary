On Tuesday, an official overseeing the salvage operation said opportunities to move it from a bay on the Isle of Lewis before winter were "diminishing".
Poor weather conditions have hampered the effort to float the 17,000-tonne rig to the Hawk, which would transport it first to Malta then Turkey.
The semi-submersible ship is due to leave on 10 October for another job.
Work began earlier to submerge the massive deck of the Hawk and begin moving Transocean Winner towards the ship.
Once in Malta, parts of the rig such as its generators would be stripped off for recycling before the structure was moved to a yard in Turkey to be broken up.
The Transocean Winner was being towed to Malta when it broke free from its towing lines during stormy weather in August.
It washed ashore at Dalmore beach, near Carloway, on Lewis.
Later that same month it was refloated and towed to Broad Bay, which provided a more sheltered anchorage.
