Kilmona group: Planners recommend Belfast developments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two major Belfast office projects from the developer Paddy Kearney have been recommended for planning approval.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kearney's Kilmona group wants to build a four-block scheme on a site next to Central Station and extend an existing building on Chichester Street.
Residents in the adjacent Markets area have objected to the Central Station scheme and elements of the original plan have been changed as a result.
Councillors on the planning committee are to make final decisions next week.
The Central Station scheme consists of a 14-storey block, a 10-storey block and two three-storey blocks which will have total floor space of about 323,000 sq ft (30,000 sq m).
The Chichester Street scheme will involve extending and upgrading Centre House.
The plan includes the demolition of an existing three-storey office building on Gloucester Street and the addition of a 'glass box' extension to the upper levels of Centre House.
Belfast has seen little development of Grade A office space since the property crash.
