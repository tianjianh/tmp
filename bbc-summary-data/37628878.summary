Martyn Tucker: Ex-scoutmaster jailed for sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former scoutmaster jailed in 2014 for abusing boys in the 1960s and 70s has been given a fresh 11-year sentence for sex crimes against more children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martyn Tucker, 70, admitted 28 further offences of indecent assault or gross indecency between 1967 and 1985.
Mold Crown Court heard his "campaign of abuse offences of the vilest kind" targeted eight victims as young as 12.
He is already serving a 12-year sentence, and was told his licence on release would be extended by one year.
Judge Rhys Rowlands said he was guilty of "deviant and wholly reprehensible behaviour" and the parole board would decide when he was safe to be released.
The court heard some of his latest victims came forward after media publicity of his earlier crimes.
One man told how he purchased a newspaper, saw Tucker had been jailed and broke down and cried as what happened to him came flooding back.
The court heard he knew his day of judgement would come, particularly when the Jimmy Savile scandal came out.
Tucker, originally from Chester, worked for the former Alyn and Deeside and Delyn councils before working as a legal executive dealing in social welfare issues for various Chester solicitors.
Co-defendant Malcolm Gould, 69, a former deputy headmaster who had been living in retirement in Bulgaria but returned to the UK when an European arrest warrant was issued, admitted indecent assault on one of Tucker's victims and was jailed for three years.
In 1981, Gould was jailed for three years at Chester Crown Court for sexual offences against boys when he ran a football team.
