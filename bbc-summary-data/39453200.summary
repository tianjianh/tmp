Llandaff bishop election process complaints rebuffed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Church in Wales has dismissed three complaints following allegations of homophobia after a gay clergyman was rejected for a role as the new Bishop of Llandaff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Very Reverend Jeffrey John, Dean of St Albans, is understood to have received over half the votes, but not the two-thirds required for the role.
One complaint was from church electoral college members, who elect new bishops.
The church said the complaints were "without merit".
It has "strongly" denied accusations of homophobia.
Dr John accused the Church in Wales of homophobia after he was not appointed during the selection process in February.
A second complaint was from members of Llandaff diocesan's standing committee, which helps to shape diocesan policy.
The third complaint was made by the five area deans in the Llandaff diocese.
The Church in Wales (CiW) said its legal subcommittee had advised the complaints were without merit and the bishops should proceed to fill the vacancy.
CiW provincial secretary Simon Lloyd said: "This means the bench of bishops can continue its task of appointing the new bishop without further delay."
Dr Barry Morgan retired from the role at the end of January.
Dr John, who is originally from Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, was nominated as Bishop of Reading in 2003, but was asked to withdraw from the role by the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams.
Meanwhile, Right Reverend David Wilbourne has announced he is stepping down as assistant bishop of Llandaff next month to allow the new bishop to "run free".
