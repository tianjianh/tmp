The aircraft, which had one person on board disappeared from radar three miles out at sea.
It had been due to land at Blackpool Airport at 09:15 GMT after its journey from the Isle of Man. The debris was found off the Lancashire coast.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said further searches had been suspended due to failing light.
Matthew Mace, duty controller at the UK Coastguard, said: "We have used all the means and assets available to search an extensive area off the Blackpool coast.
He said crews would "review overnight what searches will be conducted tomorrow".
Lifeboat and helicopter teams had been searching a 45 sq nautical mile (154 sq km) area.
The Coastguard said there was a "strong likelihood that this aircraft may have ditched into the sea".
