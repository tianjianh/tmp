[SN]TITLE[SN]
Conference sector 'worth £1bn to Glasgow since 2005'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conference-related business tourism has been worth £1bn to Glasgow's economy since 2005, it has been claimed.

Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, which was set up eight years ago to promote the city, said the milestone had been reached after 27% growth last year.
It said conventions business worth £153m had been secured in 2012/13.
About 2,200 conferences have been staged in Glasgow since 2005. Visiting delegates now account for one in five hotel beds sold in the city.
Over the past eight years, more than 800,000 conference delegates have spent some 3.3 million nights in the city's hotels.
The marketing bureau said its success had been achieved in partnership with the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.
Bureau chairman and Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "To have secured £1bn of conference business and more than three million hotel room bookings, during a period when global competition in the market has been incredibly fierce, is nothing short of remarkable.
"This milestone achievement is testimony to the fantastic partnership working that exists between the different players across our conventions sector, from our venues, especially the SECC and our five universities, to our hotels, restaurants, transport providers, local ambassadors and all the other conference service providers."
