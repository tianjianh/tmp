The motorist was stopped on the MI8 on his way to work at about 13.30 BST, tweeted Humberside Police. The tweet said: "He wasn't late but he is now..."
In a later tweet the force said the driver had not got an immediate ban but had been reported to the courts.
The motorway runs from the M1 near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, to the M62 near Goole, East Yorkshire.
Tougher punishments for the most serious speeding offences came into force in England and Wales in April.
Under new guidelines, fines for drivers caught doing 51mph in a 30mph zone or 101mph on a motorway will start from 150% of weekly income, rather than the previous level of 100%.
In 2015 244 people were killed in crashes that occurred when a driver was breaking the speed limit on Britain's roads.
