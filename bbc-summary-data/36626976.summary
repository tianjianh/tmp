Malcolm Brown died after being found alight by a care home worker outside Sherwood Forest Care Home in February.
The BBC understands the 60-year-old had gone outside the Derby care home to a smoke.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) says the home "requires improvement" after an inspection in March.
The health watchdog's report into the home raised concerns over staffing levels, highlighted some residents at risk of developing sore skin and found a person was at risk of choking due to "inadequately thickened drinks".
A CQC spokeswoman said the home can expect "further unannounced inspections... and will continue to monitor the home".
A spokeswoman for Embrace Group Ltd, which runs the care home, said: "We take the CQC's feedback very seriously, and following the inspection in March we put in place an action plan to address the points raised in the report.
"We look forward to showing full compliance at our next inspection."
Derbyshire Police confirmed no criminal investigation is taking place into Mr Brown's death, and a spokeswoman said a report is being compiled for the coroner.
A fire investigation found the fire was probably caused by "discarded smoking materials".
