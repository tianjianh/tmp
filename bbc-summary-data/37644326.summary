The Awel Aman Tawe co-operative wind farm started construction at the Mynydd y Gwrhyd site, 20 miles north of Swansea, in March.
The project has been funded by £1.34m community investment and a £3.55m Welsh Government loan.
Volunteers said they had to "pinch ourselves to believe it is happening."
Dan McCallum, Awel Co-op's project manager, said "It was fantastic to see the tower sections go through very quickly without a hitch.
"There were lots of people on the street watching the spectacle."
The site has been constructed using materials from the Port Talbot steelworks.
Mr McCallum added: "We've been working on the project for 18 years as local volunteers, and we had to pinch ourselves to actually believe it is happening."
The group is holding a series of events to "encourage people to invest", with the aim to secure another £1m worth of funding.
Members are offered a 5% return on their investment.
It is thought wind power could contribute £2.3bn to the Welsh economy.
The Welsh Government loan £3.55m has helped the project secure a higher level of income from Feed in Tariffs, a payment made to households or businesses that generate their own electricity from renewable resources.
