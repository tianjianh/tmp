The 26-year-old has scored six tries in 19 appearances since joining the club in February 2015.
"Ahsee has been a good player for us over the past year and we're delighted that he's agreed to stay with us," said director of rugby Jim Mallinder.
Saints have also agreed contracts for next season with prop Matt Beesley and hooker Charlie Clare, both 24.
Clare will join from Championship club Bedford, while former Yorkshire Carnegie academy player Beesley has been training with the Saints for a number of weeks.
"Matt has impressed while he's been training with us, with his technical abilities and willingness to learn," forwards coach Dorian West told the club website.
"Charlie has a solid grounding from his time with Leicester and Bedford. He has been one of their standout players in an impressive season."
