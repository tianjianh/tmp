[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brokenshire to discuss Brexit and Stormont with Irish minister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland secretary is due to visit Dublin on Tuesday to discuss Brexit and the political stalemate at Stormont.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Brokenshire will hold talks with the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney.
It is understood he will also meet representatives from the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.
Mr Brokenshire is expected to discuss the UK government's Brexit position proposals.
The series of papers, which were published last week, looked at a range of issues including the "unique circumstances" of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
They emphasised the need to avoid a hard border and said there should be no physical infrastructure, or check points which could impact cross-border trade.
Beyond Brexit, Mr Brokenshire will also discuss the restoration of the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont.
Northern Ireland has been without a functioning power-sharing executive since it collapsed in January, with the last round of talks suspended in July.
On Sunday, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill wrote to the UK and Irish governments proposing that talks should recommence next week.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) described the proposal as a "stunt".
