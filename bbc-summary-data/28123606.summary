The singer was given a commemorative scroll by Lord Mayor Majid Khan at the town hall on Tuesday.
Williams's parents, Jan and Peter, his wife Ayda and 22-month-old daughter Teddy also attended the event.
The singer, who hails from the city, said he was "proud and extremely honoured" to be recognised for his career in showbusiness.
Earlier this year a series of events were staged in Stoke to mark the star's 40th birthday.
He said being given the Freedom of the City was "poignant" and described the event as a "special day".
"Stoke-on-Trent made me. My humour, my 'cheeky chappie' bit, that's all from here," he said.
"Cut me and it's through me like a stick of rock."
