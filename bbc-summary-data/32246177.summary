It was already known that he'd been cast in the movie, but now director Bryan Singer has confirmed which character he'll take on.
Singer also shared a photo on social media of the 24-year-old in costume.
"Ben Hardy is Angel - I shall confirm it for you!" said Singer. "But he's not a very nice Angel! And that's all I'll say..."
His character is one of the original X-Men and has wings, which, from the picture, appear to have metal blades.
Other stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender and Rose Byrne, have already been confirmed for the film.
Due out in 2016, it will also feature other British stars including James McAvoy, Sophie Turner and Nicholas Hoult.
Hardy left EastEnders in February, not long after the climax of the plot surrounding the identity of Lucy Beale's murderer, which was revealed in a special live show.
