Mansfield Town 1-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reuben Reid's penalty deep into stoppage time capped off a dramatic turnaround as Exeter claimed an unlikely win at play-off rivals Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Harley started the comeback in the 84th minute with a neat finish from Reid's knock-down, before Rhys Bennett brought down Reid inside the area in the 97th minute.
Reid stepped up confidently to dispatch the winning goal to move the Grecians into sixth place in the League Two table.
Mansfield had been good value for their interval lead and had put the ball in the net after just 80 seconds before the referee spotted Shaq Coulthirst had controlled with his hand before netting off the post.
Danny Rose headed a corner against the bar on the half-hour before the breakthrough came on 38 minutes as left back Mal Benning cut past Pierce Sweeney and slotted inside the far post.
However, the visitors raised it a gear in the second half and on 70 minutes Jack Stacey forced Jake Kean into his first real save, before the late double sealed a dramatic win.
