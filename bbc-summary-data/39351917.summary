Four Ness stores - in York, Keswick, and at the Lawnmarket and the Royal Mile in Edinburgh - have been purchased by property and retail group Kiltane.
The Edinburgh-based firm has also acquired the wholesale and e-commerce divisions of Ness.
Administrators from accountancy and business services firm BDO said the move would safeguard more than 35 jobs.
Ness brought in administrators in December, following financial difficulties at the firm.
At the time it operated 10 stores in Scotland, five in England, as well as four concessions, and it employed 105 staff.
Mark Keane, Kiltane's managing director, said the move was an "exciting development" for the firm.
"The addition of Ness to our existing stores builds considerably on our business infrastructure and capabilities, both in retail outlets in prime locations and online," he added.
"It also safeguards the jobs and skillsets of a very experienced and talented retail team while consolidating our position for future growth.
"We're very confident that the deal will deliver major value to the group in the years ahead because the Ness brand offers a strong fit for us and complements the existing brands and concessions that we work with."
