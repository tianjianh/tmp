Notts took a 10-run first-innings lead as they were all out for 383, with Brett Hutton making 59.
Warwickshire were 149-2, led by Varun Chopra (82) and Jonathan Trott (59), but Jackson Bird's direct hit to get rid of Laurie Evans sparked a collapse.
Luke Fletcher took 4-25 as the visitors were dismissed for 236 before Notts, chasing 227 to win, slumped to 21-3.
Warwickshire got an immediate breakthrough in Nottinghamshire's run-chase as Steven Mullaney edged to Rikki Clarke low at second slip off Keith Barker (2-11) for a five-ball duck, while first-innings centurion Michael Lumb and nightwatchman Fletcher soon followed.
An intriguing final day could be in store at Trent Bridge, although rain is forecast for the Nottingham area.
After Notts resumed on 316-7 in their first innings, Hutton reached his first half-century of the summer, but was then caught in the gully.
A boundary from Bird gave Notts a first-innings lead before he mistimed a pull and was caught by Jeetan Patel at midwicket, while Fletcher (29) played around a slower delivery from Clarke (4-72) to be last man out.
Warwickshire reached 26-1 at lunch with Ian Westwood falling to a rising Fletcher delivery to be caught at gully by Samit Patel.
Chopra and Trott put on 77 for the second wicket and were scoring at more than four an over but Trott, who at one stage hit seven boundaries in 12 balls, was trapped leg before by a low delivery from Patel (4-71)
Bird ran out Evans superbly to lead to a Warwickshire collapse either side of tea. Fletcher then had Chopra caught behind by Chris Read in the first ball after the interval to spark a loss of five wickets for the addition of only 23 runs. But last-wicket pair Chris Woakes (20 not out) and Chris Wright (20) added 34 to frustrate Notts.
Nottinghamshire all-rounder Samit Patel:
"It's ebbed and flowed and shows how well both teams have played. These are two good teams that hopefully will be fighting it out at the top later in the year.
"To get somewhere where we wanted to be with the bat this morning was brilliant and to get a lead was even better, so fair play to the lads.
"Then the way we've bowled later has been outstanding. Hopefully we can go on and finish it off with a win."
Warwickshire stand-in skipper Chris Woakes:
"It's a great game of cricket. It's a pitch that's obviously going to produce a result, which is what you want.
"It looks like it's going to be a good final day. We obviously think we are in a good position.
"But then Notts will probably also feel that they can knock it off, so I'll sit on the fence and say the game is still in the balance."
Warwickshire have been cleared over the state of the pitch - rated poor by umpires - that was prepared for their draw with Somerset at Edgbaston last week.
The Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) considered reports against the regulatory requirement that "each county shall actively seek to prepare the best quality cricket pitch that it can for the match that it is staging".
The CDC concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that Warwickshire CCC had breached this requirement - and no further action will be taken.
