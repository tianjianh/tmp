Manchester United's Luke Shaw says he feared he would never play again after suffering a horrific leg break.

The defender, 21, returned to action at the weekend after his injury in a Champions League game last September.
"When I had my first game on Saturday, I felt so emotional," said Shaw. "It's the best feeling ever.
"There was a fear of how long it was going to take or whether I would play again. Now I am looking forward to pre-season and getting fully fit."
Shaw, who broke his leg against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, played the first 45 minutes of Saturday's 2-0 victory over Wigan.
An England international, he became Britain's most expensive teenage footballer when, at the age of 19, he joined United from Premier League rivals Southampton for around Â£30m in June 2014.
He was a regular in United's team last season and played in both of England's Euro 2016 qualifiers shortly before he was injured.
