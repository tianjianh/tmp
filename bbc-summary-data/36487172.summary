The 58-year-old tumbled from Striding Edge towards Nethermost Cove, on Helvellyn, at 13:30 BST on Wednesday.
Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team was taken to the summit by The Great North Air Ambulance to help the casualty, who was then flown to hospital.
The "difficult" five-hour rescue involved 18 rescue team members.
With a 950m (3,117ft) summit, Helvellyn is England's third highest peak.
