Tube strike set to go ahead in night service row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fresh 24-hour Tube strike is due to start from 18:30 BST following the failure of talks to resolve a dispute between unions and London Underground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All stations are expected to close, with the four main Tube workers' unions supporting action.
Drivers are unhappy at pay and conditions offered for working on the new night service.
London Underground (LU) said it has offered a deal aimed at improving work-life balance.
Tube stations across the capital will close for the second time in the space of a month, following a 24-hour walkout on 8-9 July.
Services will stop running from 18:30 BST and there will be no Tubes on Thursday.
LU said the new offer included an extra Â£200 per night shift for drivers and a Â£500 bonus for station staff by next February, as well as a further guarantees for a 32-hour, four-day week.
Aslef, the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) have all turned down the offer.
Unite previously said its action "would go ahead".

The sticking point comes down to guarantees over weekend working and time off.
I'll give you an example. The unions say that a new night shift will mean a driver finishing at 8am on Sunday and then possibly starting work again on Monday morning. So the Sunday will count as their day off. They say that's not enough rest time after a night shift.
To try to reassure staff, London Underground has just sent out draft copies of what new shift-patterns might look like. It says staff will either work the same number of weekends a year, or fewer. And in the end, anyone who doesn't want to work nights won't have to.
But these talks clearly haven't been going well.
I understand the unions pulled out in the last couple of days (not permanently though). The relatively new team at London Underground is experienced in business but not in the railways, and I get the impression that there has been a bit of a culture clash over the way both sides are used to doing deals.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash claimed the night Tube plan was "rushed and botched from the off" and said his members would "not accept that their work-life balance should be wrecked to plug the gaping holes in staffing capacity that should have been dealt with from day one".
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, said his organisation had put forward "an extremely fair revised offer".
He added: "We continue to urge them to put the new offer to their members and not subject Londoners to further unnecessary disruption."
Questions have been raised over whether the dispute will be resolved in time for the night service to begin as planned on 12 September.
