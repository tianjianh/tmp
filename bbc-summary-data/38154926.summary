North Wales Police said it was working with Operation Hydrant "to ensure our response is coordinated and efficient".
More than 20 former footballers have recently come forward with allegations of historical sexual abuse in other parts of the UK.
A UK-wide hotline has dealt with more than 250 reports in just one week since it launched.
Operation Hydrant was set up in 2014 to help coordinate non-recent child abuse investigations relating to a number of settings.
Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams, of North Wales Police, said: "I can confirm that we are in receipt of a number of reports of non-recent sexual abuse within a football setting.
"The people who have courageously reported what happened to them are central in our considerations in this regard."
He urged "anyone who has been the victim of child sexual abuse" or those with information to report it to the police.
"They will be listened to, taken seriously and a thorough investigation will take place," he added.
