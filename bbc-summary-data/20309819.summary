A total of 972 drivers across Wales were caught, including 454 in the Dyfed-Powys Police area.
South Wales Police fined 242 drivers, North Wales Police 148 and Gwent Police caught 128 drivers.
Susan Storch, chairperson of Road Safety Wales, said it was "saddening" to see so many drivers using their phones while driving.
"We all need to take account of how we drive on our roads and driving a vehicle requires us to multi-task so anything above and beyond that needs to wait until we are safely parked up or until our journey has finished," she added.
"While it's saddening to see that so many motorists got caught using a mobile phone whilst driving it has also demonstrated the resolve of all the Road Safety Wales partners in tackling this issue and we will continue to work together to drive home the message that you need to switch off before you drive off."
The 2012 All-Wales Anti-Mobile Phone While Driving campaign was held last month.
Inspector Lee Ford of Gwent Police said: "This campaign is just one part of our ongoing effort to target and reduce the number of drivers who risk becoming involved in a serious or fatal collision due to using a mobile phone while driving."
