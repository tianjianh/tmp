Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray has called on his side not to be relegated from the Championship "with a whimper".

Saturday's 2-0 defeat by Barnsley was Rovers' third in succession and left them 22nd, four points from safety, with five league matches remaining.
Mowbray, who took over as manager on 22 February, has not seen his side win since 4 March - a run of seven games.
"We know we have to get results in the next two games against teams that are struggling a little bit," he said.
Blackburn face crucial games against 19th-placed Nottingham Forest and Bristol City, who are 21st, before finishing the season with games against Wolves, Aston Villa and Brentford.
Mowbray, who experienced relegation from the Premier League with West Bromwich Albion earlier in his managerial career, says Rovers need to win most of their remaining matches to survive.
"It won't be through the lack of trying," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"Somewhere along the line, let's hope there's a day where everybody gets beaten and we get a victory and things spin on their head.
"We need to make the last couple of games very nervous for a couple of teams, rather than going out with a whimper."
