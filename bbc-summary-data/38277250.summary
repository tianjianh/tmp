New Zealand's Joseph Parker won the WBO heavyweight title vacated by Tyson Fury with a narrow points win over Mexico's Andy Ruiz in Auckland.

Two judges called the fight 115-113 in favour of 24-year-old Parker, and the third had it 114-114.
"What a dream come true," said Parker, who has been touted as a possible opponent for Britain's Anthony Joshua.
But Ruiz was unhappy, saying: "I think I got the win or at least a draw, I think I set the pace with my jab."
The previously unbeaten Ruiz seemed to be on top in the early rounds but Parker found his rhythm to extend his unbeaten record to 22 fights, with 18 knockouts.
