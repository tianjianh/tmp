Mark Lafferty and Adeline Clark allegedly attacked Mark McCowan, 45, and Dennis McCowan, 71, on 2 December.
Mr Lafferty, 53, and Ms Clark, 40, are accused of repeatedly stabbing them at a house in Baillieston.
Both are also accused of presenting a knife at Christine McCowan, 68, demanding money, forcing her upstairs and robbing her of Â£35.
The pair, both from Glasgow's east end, appeared in private from custody at Glasgow Sheriff Court.

Ms Clark was granted bail and is expected to return to court at a later date.
