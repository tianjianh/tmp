Elite League Grand Final: Wolves boss says 'job not done yet' after big first-leg win

Wolves are in prime position to win the Elite League for the first time in seven years after opening up an 18-point lead at the halfway mark over Belle Vue in the two-leg Grand Final.

But boss Peter Adams insists the final is not yet all over after Monday's 54-36 first-leg win at Monmore Green.
Ahead of Wednesday's second leg in Manchester (19:30 BST), Adams told BBC Sport: "The job's not done yet.
"We still have to go there and give a professional account of ourselves."
Wolves themselves turned round a record Elite League deficit in their semi-final, when they came from 12 points down after the first leg to end Poole Pirates' three-year reign as champions.
To come from even further back would be an astounding achievement against a Wolves side who have now won eight of their last nine meetings, but Adams warned: "We know how strong they can be around their own circuit.
"That said, we'd still like to go there and win on the night. The team deserve a lot of credit to got there with such a lead.
"After last week against Poole I was a little bit fearful that we may have peaked too soon, but the team proved me wrong."
Against a Belle Vue side who finished top of the regular Elite League table, Wolves' star was reserve Kyle Howarth, who dropped just two points to a Belle Vue rider.
Jacob Thorssell's two wins at the end of the first leg took both him and world individual champion Tai Woffinden past double figures again, while Sweden's Freddie Lindgren contributed nine points.
Wolverhampton: Kyle Howarth 12+1, Jacob Thorssell 9+2, Freddie Lindgren 9, Tai Woffinden 8+2, Sam Masters 8, Peter Karlsson 4+3, Max Clegg 4+1.
Belle Vue: Craig Cook 10, Steve Worrall 8, Scott Nicholls 6, Richie Worrall 6, Matej Zagar 5+1, Max Fricke 1, Joe Jacobs 0.
