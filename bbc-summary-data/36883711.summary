Munster have signed South African lock Jean Kleyn on a three-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move will see Stormers player Kleyn link up with his former defence coach at the province, Jacques Nienaber, who has joined Munster's backroom team.
Munster's new director of rugby, South African Rassie Erasmus, said Kleyn, 22, is a "hugely exciting prospect".
"I've seen his development first hand and with Jacques' extensive knowledge of him we are all up to speed on how Jean can contribute," said Erasmus.
"A naturally athletic player we believe he will add further value to the pack and we look forward to welcoming him to Munster."
Kleyn, who is 6ft 8in, made his debut for Western Province in 2012 before beginning his Stormers career two years ago.
The lock has made 17 appearances for the Stormers in addition to playing 22 times for Western Province.
