Crewe Alexandra 3-0 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient's unbroken 112-year stay in the English Football League ended after a 3-0 defeat by Crewe confirmed their relegation from League Two.

Crewe dominated from the start, with Callum Ainley steering in from close range to put the hosts in front.
Ryan Wintle's header and George Cooper's smart strike completed the scoring before half-time.
Orient, who have had five different managers this season, will finish bottom after Newport beat Accrington.
Crewe, meanwhile, confirmed their League Two survival with a first victory in five matches.
Just under three years ago, Leyton Orient were on the brink of promotion to the Championship, before falling to a 4-3 defeat on penalties in the League One play-off final.
Relegation followed one season later, but this campaign represents a new low for one of the English Football League's oldest clubs.
As well as the ongoing managerial uncertainty, Orient are in "mortal danger" of going out of business, according to the legal adviser to their fans' trust.
Owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club.
Staff have still not been paid their March wages, and club employees have said they are "hugely concerned" by a lack of communication from the Orient hierarchy.
Results on the pitch have been poor throughout the season, with the club having both the worst attacking and worst defensive record in the division.
Relegation was staved off for one more week with victory over Hartlepool on Easter Monday, but their 28th defeat of the season leaves them facing a dubious future in the National League.
