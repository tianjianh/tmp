Zimbabwe match-fixing bans lifted for Rushwaya and others

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) has lifted all of the remaining match-fixing bans from the so-called "Asiagate" scandal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
85 players and officials were banned for activities around national team games played mostly in Asia between 2007 and 2009, but the sanctions were never endorsed by Fifa.
Recently-elected Zifa president Phillip Chiyangwa announced on Friday that outstanding bans were lifted following a resolution at a Zifa executive committee meeting.
The biggest beneficiary is former Zifa chief executive Henrietta Rushwaya, who had a life ban from all football activities, although she always maintained that she was innocent.
Rushwaya was accused of being the key link between the Zimbabwe national team and Raj Perumal - a Singaporean who was jailed for match-fixing.
Players based outside of the country such as South Africa-based former captain Method Mwanjali were free to continue with their careers, as the rulings only came under the jurisdiction of Zifa.
The decision is too late for some home-based players such as defender Guthrie Zhokinyi, who captained Zimbabwe at the Cecafa Cup in Kenya 2009 and was given a life ban.
Zhokinyi's career ground to a halt after four years on sidelines.
The Zifa investigation claimed that players were paid between $500 and $1500 to ensure the national team lost matches and conceded goals at certain times during games.
