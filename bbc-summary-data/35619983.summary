Kieffer Moore opened the scoring with his first goal of the season before Keanu Marsh-Brown doubled Rovers' lead.
Danny Livesey brought Barrow back into the game when he volleyed in a deep Jordan Williams corner.
Williams brilliantly levelled late on as he raced towards goal before unleashing a 25-yard strike past Rovers keeper Steve Arnold.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"I'm disappointed to concede a two-goal lead. It all started from our chance when we hit the post and then they come down here and they had a free header in the six-yard box.
"We didn't defend that one properly, Charlie Clough decided not to mark his man properly and Livesey had a free header.
"But what a fantastic month we've had - we've had four away games, one home game, it's been a great month and I'm well chuffed."
