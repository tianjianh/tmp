Chemistry teacher Susan McKay, 58, and her husband Owen, 73, grew the drug in the seven-bed Tall Trees, Llandyrnog.
They were given suspended jail terms along with their son Michael after they admitted conspiring to supply cannabis.
At Mold Crown Court on Friday, Ms McKay was told to repay £33,500, Mr McKay £22,000 and their son £2,000 within three months or face a jail term.
Ms McKay, who has since been struck off as a senior teacher at a Wrexham high school, decided to grow the drug to help solve family money problems and her son agreed to help.
Three "growing zones" were set up in their guest house with the yield said to be worth up to £96,000.
Michael McKay, an Olympic boxing hopeful, had been stopped by police near Ruthin for driving without lights on his way to his parents' house.
Police detected the smell of cannabis and found 162g of cannabis worth about £1,620 after searching his car.
Inside the house, police found three bedrooms which were devoted to growing cannabis and one bathroom which was being used as a drying room.
Owen McKay pleaded guilty on the basis he turned a blind eye.
Mrs McKay and Michael McKay, 27, from Huntington, Cheshire, were both given a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, while Owen McKay was given a five-month term, suspended for 12 months.
