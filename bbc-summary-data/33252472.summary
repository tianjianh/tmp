It is seeking to employ people with technical and marketing experience as well as new graduates.
Announcing the investment, Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister, Jonathan Bell, said: "I welcome the decision by Metaverse to choose Northern Ireland as the location for its new European operations centre.
"This is a good news story for Derry as the 100 new jobs will offer employment to a wide range of people, from those with technical and marketing experience to new graduates.
"Invest Northern Ireland has offered the company support of Â£250,000, to help with initial business priorities, including creating new jobs.
"This support, along with the quality pool of talent available here, helped Northern Ireland secure these new jobs against competition from the Republic of Ireland."

"While we have been successfully operating in Europe with our distributed network of Mods since 2008, our clients and prospects want us to have an even larger and more involved presence.

"With a talented and skilled workforce, a vibrant tech community and a supportive business environment, Derry is the right choice for Metaverse."
