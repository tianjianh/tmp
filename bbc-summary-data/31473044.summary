Labour leader Ed Miliband pledges more powers for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales will be offered more powers over policing, energy and ports if Labour wins the general election, Ed Miliband has told the party's Welsh conference.

Powers would include an all-Wales policing plan to be drawn up with the home secretary.
Mr Miliband said control over assembly elections - including the voting age - would also be handed to Cardiff Bay.
He also promised "fair funding" for Wales, accusing the Tories of cutting the Welsh budget by Â£1.5bn.
"Standing up for devolution, standing up for people to have the power to shape their lives and communities does not mean standing still," he told the conference on Saturday.
"It means extending the power the people of Wales have over their own lives," referring to what he called "the Welsh Parliament".
Praising the Labour Welsh government's policies on job creation and vocational training for young people, Mr Miliband said "we see already the difference that our values make here in Wales".
The Labour leader also launched an attack on tax avoidance for damaging the "fabric of society", pledging a "root and branch" review of how the UK's tax authorities treat rich people.
