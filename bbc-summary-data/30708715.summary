Caroline Jones's mother Mary Benson had volunteered in the Cancer Research UK shop in Harpenden, Hertfordshire for 13 years. She died in October, aged 72.
Ms Jones, 46, said "other than her pants" she will get her look from the store's "treasure trove".
She hopes her Knickers Model's Own campaign will encourage others to visit charity shops.
Ms Jones, who also volunteers as a window dresser at the shop, started wearing charity clothes on 1 January and posts a daily picture on social media.
"It's not a weird world I am entering, I've always mixed up my wardrobe with new and pre-loved pieces - but this year I am not buying any new clothes," she said.
"I will buy some new knickers occasionally though, I think I'm allowed that."
The mother of three said she wanted to celebrate her mother's life "through the fashion lens, in a way I know she would have thoroughly enjoyed".
"Fashion was one of the many things that tied us together," she said.
"Together, we went shopping, we noted seasonal trends, we fell about laughing in mirrored changing rooms often dealing with a zip issue.
"She was always very stylish. The cancer had given her a whole new look - it made her look at her wardrobe differently, she found a new style.
"She would love [this campaign], she would be very proud."
As well as raising money through buying the clothes and donations from those who like her daily picture, Ms Jones hopes her quest will "persuade people to spend more time in charity shops," she said.
A Cancer Research UK spokesman said: "Caroline knows more than most the bargains that can be picked up from Cancer Research UK shops and she is encouraging others to visit."
Ms Jones added: "[The clothes] are there to be re-cleaned, re-worn, re-loved, re-shared, re-enjoyed and reinvented... trust me," she said.
"The shop has told me it is already getting new customers who have seen my page.
"People say getting my picture is inspiring them."
