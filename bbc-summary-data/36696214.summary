[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Rocard, a socialist, served as prime minister from 1988 to 1991 under President Francois Mitterrand.
He was regarded as a staunch advocate of the European Union who fought for a left-wing agenda that also embraced a market economy.
The office of President Francois Hollande said France had lost "a great figure of the Republic and the left".
Mr Rocard died in a Paris hospital on Saturday, his son Francis told AFP news agency.
Michel Rocard caused controversy in 1998 when he labelled Mr Mitterrand, who had died three years earlier, dishonest.
In a magazine article, Mr Rocard spoke of a government "clique" under Mr Mitterrand, saying he took the office of prime minister to protect France.
