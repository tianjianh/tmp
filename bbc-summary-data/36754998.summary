The 26-year-old, who plays predominantly at centre-back, was a regular in the Rennes match-day squad last season, playing 24 games and scoring five goals.
He joined from German club SC Freiburg in 2014 having made 65 appearances for the Breisgau-Brasilianer during a two-season spell.
Werder Bremen sporting director Frank Baumann believes the club has made a great addition with the signing of the Teranga Lion.
"Fallou is a very well trained player, who has recently taken the next step in his development," Baumann told the club website.
"At 26 years old, he's already a seasoned central defender, who has gained experience both internationally in France as well as in the Bundesliga with SC Freiburg.
"Fallou is strong in the tackle and is also very versatile.
Diagne moved to France from Senegalese side AS Génération Foot in 2007 and made the step up into the French top flight from the renowned FC Metz academy in 2008.
He made his international debut as a substitute in the 2-0 friendly win against Rwanda in May.
Another Senegal international on the move is midfielder Alfred N'Diaye who has joined Spanish side Villarreal from rivals Real Betis in a five-year deal.
Ndiaye, who has also played in France and Turkey, moves to El Madrigal only two years after joining Betis from English club Sunderland.
The 26-year-old helped Betis win promotion to the top flight in the 2014-15 season and to a tenth place finish last season.
Ndiaye scored thrice in 85 appearances for the club.
Meanwhile, Morocco international Hachim Mastour is set to return to Italian giants AC Milan a year early after Spanish side Malaga decided to terminate his loan agreement prematurely.
Mastour joined the La Liga outfit on a two year loan last summer but only managed a single appearance all season, coming on as a late substitute against Real Betis back in November.
He represented Italy, his country of birth, at youth level before switching allegiance to the country of his parents, Morocco, in May 2015.
Three days before his 17th birthday, Mastour became the youngest debutant ever, at 16, for the Atlas Lions when he replaced Nordin Amrabat in their 1-0 Nations Cup qualifier win against Libya on 12 June in Agadir.
