The 30-year-old midfielder will join the club in the north east of the country on 1 July.
Robertson had spent two seasons with Hibs after leaving Blackpool but left after they failed to win promotion from the Scottish Championship.
He played 41 times for the Easter Road club last season and scored six goals under manager Alan Stubbs.
Robertson, who won two Scotland caps, began his career with Dundee and moved to city rivals Dundee United.
He will be part of a squad of predominantly home-grown players under head coach Leontin Grozavu in Romania.
Robertson joins Dutch winger Quenten Martinus and Rashid Browne, defender Michael Ngadeu from Cameroon, Albanian forward Mergin Neziri, right-back Radoslav Dimitrov and goalkeeper and fellow Bulgarian Plamen Iliev among the foreign contingent.
Botosani, who play at the 12,000 capacity Stadionul Municipal, finished eighth in Liga 1 last season.
