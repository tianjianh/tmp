Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to Bakers Quay at 18:47 BST and had now brought the blaze under control.
Two 19-year-old men from Gloucester have been arrested on suspicion of arson and are in police custody.
The shell of the 19th Century building is said to be structurally unsafe and a section has collapsed.
A fire service spokesman said rugby supporters had been at a nearby fan zone in the docks area watching the England v Australia match, but there was no risk to them or a need to evacuate the site.
The service later tweeted: "Bakers Quay fire out. Crew will stay on site. Engineers will advise re building safety. Thanks all for hard work & patience".
