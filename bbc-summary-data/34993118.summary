[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burglary rapist Martin Tom's jail sentence increased after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who raped a woman during a burglary while high on crack cocaine has had his jail sentence increased.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Tom, of Beccles, was sentenced to five years and four months in September after he admitted attacking a woman in her bed in May.
The 26-year-old's jail term was increased to seven-and-a-half-years at a Court of Appeal hearing in London.
Police said the initial sentence had not "fully recognised" that the offence happened during a burglary.
During the initial hearing, Ipswich Crown Court heard that Tom entered the victim's home in Beccles and initially intended to steal her mobile phone, but then forced himself on her.
When he was detained by police nearby, he tried to bite police officers, the court heard.
Tom admitted rape and resisting a police officer in the execution of their duty.
Det Con Darren Winchester, who began the process of appealing the sentence, said: "We are very pleased that his sentence has been increased today, as the justices acknowledged that the nature of this incident, commissioned during the act of burglary, had not been fully recognised in the initial sentencing.
"This is the correct and proper result."
