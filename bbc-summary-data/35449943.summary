Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the shortlist of historical figures who could appear on a new £10 note.

Images of engineer Thomas Telford, science writer Mary Somerville and physicist James Clerk Maxwell were nominated to be on the polymer notes.
They are set to be issued in Scotland in the second half of 2017.
The final decision will be made after a public vote ends, running from Monday until Sunday 7 February on the bank's Facebook page.
More than 400 people got in touch to nominate a Scottish figure who they felt had made a significant contribution in the field of science and innovation.
Maxwell was a 19th Century pioneer of electromagnetism whose discovery of the unified theory of electricity and magnetism directly led to the application of electromagnetic radiation.
Somerville lived from 1780 until 1872 at a time when women's participation in science was strongly discouraged. She was jointly nominated to be the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1835.
Civil engineer Telford, known as the Colossus of Roads, lived from 1757 until 1843, and built more than 1,000 miles of roads in his lifetime.
He designed numerous infrastructure projects such as the Caledonian Canal and the Telford churches, as well as harbours and tunnels.
RBS chief marketing officer David Wheldon said: "I am delighted that we have been able to engage the public in this process. We received many high-quality nominations.
"The strength of our shortlist is indicative of the significant contribution that Scotland has made to the field of science and innovation. I would be very proud for any of these nominees to appear on our new £10 note.
"Anyone who wants to have their say should visit our Facebook page and cast a vote. I look forward to finding out which of these great figures is chosen."
