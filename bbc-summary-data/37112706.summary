The Algeria international, 25, had been strongly linked with a move to Arsenal this summer.
He scored 17 goals and added 11 assists last season and was voted the Professional Footballers' Association Players' Player of the Year.
Mahrez joins team-mates Wes Morgan, Jamie Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel and Andy King in signing new contracts.
Manager Claudio Ranieri has also signed a new four-year deal and, after losing midfielder N'Golo Kante to Chelsea, has repeatedly reiterated his desire to keep hold of the club's top players.
Mahrez joined the Foxes from French second-tier side Le Havre in January 2014.
