Chelsea captain John Terry could stay at the club after his contract expires in the summer, says boss Guus Hiddink.

Terry, 35, said on Sunday that he had not been offered a new deal at Stamford Bridge and he was ready to move abroad.
However Hiddink said Chelsea are still keen to discuss a possible contract extension with the centre-back.
"The club want to have dialogue, there are open doors. There was no specific decision, the door is not shut, " said the interim manager.
Terry has ruled out joining another English team and the possibility of playing against the club he joined when he was 14.
Since suggesting that he would be leaving Chelsea, Terry has been linked with moves to Qatar side Al Arabi - managed by Gianfranco Zola - Major League Soccer in the United States. and the Chinese Super League.
Terry told the Daily Mail in December that he was not ready to retire from playing and would consider a move to the United States, but Hiddink says there is no sign of age catching up with him.
"He's very fit. He's not what you would normally see a 35-year-old, 36-year-old player, that you feel that you get a little bit slower, you cannot accept that you're getting into a danger zone for red cards." said Hiddink.
"None of that for John. He's fit and he's performing."
Hiddink added that he found Terry's decision to go public with Chelsea's lack of a contract offer "a bit surprising", but added that it was "completely entitled to do so".
With less than six months remaining on his deal, Terry is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club.
The lack of a permanent manager since Jose Mourinho's sacking in December has not prevented Chelsea conducting transfer and contract business - most notably agreeing a one-year deal with defender Branislav Ivanovic, 32.
"You have to see every issue as an individual case," Hiddink added.
After months of speculation, Manchester City confirmed on Monday that Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola would take over at the Etihad Stadium at the start of next season.
"No one has achieved what he did but this is a bit different there is no favourite team," said Hiddink.
"I know him well, he's very stable - very, very kind - but he knows what to do."
Chelsea's only permanent signing of the January transfer window was defender Matt Miazga from New York Red Bulls.
However the Blues also secured Alexandre Pato - who spent an injury-ravaged five years at AC Milan from 2007 - on loan from Corinthians until the end of the season and the Brazilian could play against Watford on Wednesday.
"He is not fully fit but is formally available. it is another thing if he is physically or mentally ready," said Hiddink.
"He will train on Tuesday afternoon and we will decide later."
