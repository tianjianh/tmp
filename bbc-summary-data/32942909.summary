Elan Jones, great granddaughter of one of the settlers unveiled the 4ft (1.2m) memorial at Princess Dock on Saturday.
It is thought about 50,000 people in Patagonia have Welsh heritage from the 153 settlers who boarded the Mimosa.
The event was organised by the Merseyside Welsh Heritage Society as part of its Mimosa Festival.
