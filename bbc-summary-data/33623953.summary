Norfolk Police were called to the Thickthorn roundabout on the A11 near Norwich on Monday after reports the 30-tonne truck was missing.
Two police cars were written-off and a third damaged in the Â£50,000 wrecking spree that followed.
A 39-year-old man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and dangerous driving has been bailed.
He was also accused of taking a vehicle without consent, failing to stop for police and driving under the influence of drugs.
Six squad cars and a helicopter were involved as the truck was pursued along the A11 and A134 for two hours until officers managed to stop it at Brandon, Suffolk, at 14:30 GMT.
The truck was taken from a site in Spixworth.
Norfolk Police, who appealed for witnesses to get in touch, said no officers were injured in the pursuit.
