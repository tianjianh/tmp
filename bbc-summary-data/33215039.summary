Westbridge Furniture Designs has opened a third factory at Deeside with Â£488,000 in Welsh government funds given to support an estimated 153 new jobs by the end of 2015.
But bosses say that figure has already been surpassed to meet business demand.
It now employs 960 staff at its factories at Deeside and Holywell.
Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the firm's growth was a "great advertisement for manufacturing" in Deeside and Wales given that it was set up in 2004.
Westbridge, a subsidiary of Belfield Furnishing Ltd, said it was now one of the largest manufacturers of upholstered furniture in the UK.
Group chief executive Stephen Hampton said: "The new facility has also enabled us to target and win new business from other retailers across the UK."
Other customers include John Lewis, M&S and Next.
