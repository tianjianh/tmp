[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge will shut between 09:30 and 16:00 BST from Monday 21 September to Friday 25 September,  with a diversion along Bridge Valley Road and the A369.
People will be allowed to walk across and cyclists who dismount will also be able to use the bridge.
The work has included cleaning the masonry and repairs to the roof.
Bridge master David Anderson said the work had been scheduled to avoid peak morning and evening periods to minimise disruption.
