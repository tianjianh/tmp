Gatland, 52, says he will step down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.
Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Jones believes Wales backs coach Rob Howley or Wasps director of rugby Dai Young could step up.
"We've got to develop our own coaches," Jones said.
Ex-Wales scrum-half Howley was caretaker coach in 2012-13 after Gatland suffered two broken heels and as well as concentrating on his role with the British and Irish Lions.
Young left Cardiff Blues to join Wasps in June 2011 and has spoken of his ambition to coach at international level, having coached the Barbarians.
"Rob is someone who would have learnt a lot working with Warren and might be someone who could step into that breach," Jones added.
"David Young at Wasps is doing a good job and I'm sure he'll continue to prosper.
"It could be nice to think that one day a Welshman could coach the Welsh team."
Gatland, the third New Zealander after Sir Graham Henry and Steve Hansen to coach Wales, succeeded Gareth Jenkins in December 2007.
The former Ireland and Wasps boss has led his team to two Grand Slams and become the longest-serving coach in their history.
Former Russia head coach Jones says Gatland will go down as Wales' best coach of the professional era.
"He's been hugely successful in his time here and he'll want to finish on a high point," Jones said.
"I think coaches have a shelf life and he's done remarkably well which has allowed him to stay in the job so long."
