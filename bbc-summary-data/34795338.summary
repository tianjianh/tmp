New Zealand PM John Key has refused to apologise for accusing the opposition of "backing rapists".

The remark came in Tuesday's debate in parliament about unrest at Australia's Christmas Island detention centre.
Opposition MPs had accused him of not doing enough to help the 40 New Zealanders awaiting deportation there.
Mr Key's response sparked a walk-out by opposition MPs, and an online petition entitled "It's not OK Prime Minister" had 4,000 signatures by late Thursday.
"For too many women, and men, in New Zealand rape is very real and very painful," it states. "Tell John 'It's not OK' and call on him to apologise, and show some real support for rape survivors in New Zealand."
Protests broke out on Sunday at the Christmas Island centre - which holds both asylum seekers and people facing deportation from Australia - after a detainee who had escaped was found dead.
The unrest escalated into what the Australian government said was "a major disturbance". Several of those allegedly involved in the unrest were New Zealanders.
On Tuesday, opposition MPs in New Zealand raised concerns about the welfare of its nationals at the centre, criticising Mr Key's government for not doing more to help them.
Mr Key said the detainees could be brought back to New Zealand under certain conditions, but that some were there because they had committed serious crimes in Australia.
"I am not just going to take people back into New Zealand without information and without being able to protect the New Zealand public, and if those members want to protect sex offenders, rapists, and murderers, go ahead."
Leader of the opposition Andrew Little asked Mr Key why he did not call on Australia to "do what is right for the detainees".
Mr Key replied he had several conversations with the Australian government on the issue and added: "You back the rapists."
The heated debate prompted a walk-out by several opposition MPs.
Then on Wednesday, some female opposition MPs spoke about their own experiences of sexual assault in protest, and demanded an apology. But they were thrown out by the speaker of the house.
On Thursday, Mr Key said he did not need to apologise for offending some MPs.
"I am actually the person standing up for victims of crime. I am certainly the person who has been standing up for New Zealanders to make sure that they are protected," he told reporters.
Under new Australian laws, any foreigners sentenced to more than 12 months in jail can be deported on their release.
Australian government figures show there are 184 New Zealanders in its various immigration detention centres.
