Notts County caretaker manager Alan Smith says he expects to be in charge of the club for only one game.

The 36-year-old former Leeds, Manchester United, Newcastle and MK Dons midfielder took over after John Sheridan was sacked on Monday.
Smith told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I couldn't tell you how long this will happen, but I am caretaker manager and I believe it will just be for Saturday.
"I believe someone will come in and they will be an experienced manager."
The Magpies, who face Morecambe on Saturday, are on a nine-game losing streak in League Two and are only one place and one point clear of the relegation zone.
"I will enjoy it (being in charge), although I won't enjoy it if we get beat," continued Smith.
"I'm not going to play, I'm going to watch and try to help the lads as much as possible.
"The main thing is to build confidence and install some belief we can get a result, as there's no reason why we can't.
"It has been tinged with disappointment obviously, losing someone I respect a lot in John.
"The strange thing about it is being in this situation, he's (Sheridan) the one person you'd probably turn to."
