World League Five: Jersey's opener against Oman abandoned after rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jersey and Oman must play their World Cricket League Five group opener again on Monday after rain ruined the chance of an exciting finale at Grainville.

Medium pacer Charles Perchard took 3-17 as the hosts restricted the top-seeds to 132-9, in a match reduced to 23 overs per side.
Captain Peter Gough and teenager Jonty Jenner laid the foundations in the reply with an opening stand of 46.
But rain ended the chase on 48-1 after just nine overs bowled.
Too few overs had been bowled for the Duckworth-Lewis method to apply, so the game will be replayed on Monday, originally scheduled as a tournament rest-day.
"I'm disappointed," Jersey skipper Peter Gough told BBC Radio Jersey.
"It's unlucky that the rain came down when it did and it's obviously frustrating because I felt we'd got ourselves into a good position."
In Saturday's other opening fixtures Guernsey scraped to a five-run win over Vanuatu on the Duckworth-Lewis method, while Nigeria beat Tanzania by six wickets.
The eventual finalists will both win promotion to League Four in Los Angeles later in 2016, while the bottom three face relegation from the World League structure into regional tournaments.
