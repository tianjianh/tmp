[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Warham, of Liverpool, was found in Wayford Close in Meole Brace on 1 August and died two days later.
His family described him as a "much loved, remarkable young boy with a big heart and loving nature".
West Mercia Police are appealing for three young men, seen near the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital at about 23:00 BST - following the "targeted" attack on Michael at 21:45 - to come forward.
In a statement, Michael's family said he would be "greatly missed by everyone who had the honour to know him".
"We wish to thank everyone who attended the scene to help Michael," they said.
"We would also like to thank the medical staff at the hospital and all those who have helped the police at this time.
"We urge anyone who has any information to contact police as soon as they can in order to assist the investigation."
Three people arrested in connection with the inquiry have since been released on police bail.
