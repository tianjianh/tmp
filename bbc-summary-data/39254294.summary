The 36-year-old right-back has made more than 150 appearances for the Seagulls and his new deal keeps him at the Amex Stadium until June 2018.
"Bruno has been really consistent throughout my time here and has been one of our key players," manager Chris Hughton told the club website.
"He has been a model professional and has been a great player to work with."
Hughton added: "He works hard to keep himself in great shape and looks after himself very well."
The Barcelona-born defender is in his fifth season with Brighton, having joined from Valencia in 2012.
