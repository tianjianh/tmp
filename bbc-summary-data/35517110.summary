Ninth place at the Bonn World Cup along with Germany's failure to go beyond the semi-finals means Britain are the highest ranked European nation outside the world's top four and so qualify.
"The journey doesn't end here. In Rio we will put everything into trying to win a medal," British Fencing's performance director Alex Newton said.
Londoner James Davis won Saturday's individual event.
