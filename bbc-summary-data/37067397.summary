[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dwight Gayle scored his fourth goal in three Championship games as Newcastle United won at Bristol City.

The 25-year-old, signed from Crystal Palace for a reported £10m in the summer, clinically fired home after Mohamed Diame's ball over the top.
Newcastle edged the opening period, with Isaac Hayden twice heading wide when well placed.
Gayle struck the post after half-time, as City failed to seriously trouble Magpies goalkeeper Matz Sels.
The Robins, playing in front of the biggest crowd at Ashton Gate for 26 years, saw plenty of the ball but struggled to convert their attacking play into genuine goalscoring opportunities.
Hordur Magnusson came closest to an equaliser, heading Luke Freeman's near-post corner just wide in the final 10 minutes.
Striker Jonathan Kodjia, still without a goal this season, had the home side's clearest sight of goal in injury time but could only volley over from close range.
Newcastle, who have now recorded back-to-back victories after losing their first two matches of the season, held on for their first away win since December 2015.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "There were loads of positives for us. We lost to one quality finish after being caught out by a great ball.
"We have a bit of work to do with our forward play. The strikers need to know when the ball is going into the box so they can time their movement and we took too many touches at times.
"But I can't be too critical because the players gave everything. The way we penned Newcastle in and the energy we showed were really pleasing."
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez: "It's great to have a team who can go forward and score goals but you also need organisation and team spirit to get results.
"For me, it was a step forward in the confidence of the players because we now know we can win games with our forward play or by defending strongly.
"I expected a difficult game because what I knew of Bristol City and their manager is they know what they are doing and can change systems during a match. I expect them to do well this season."
