The scheme, proposed for a site between Darlington Road and Stokesley Road, also includes a new link road and bridge over the Northallerton to Middlesbrough railway line.
A new primary school, playing fields and allotments have also been assigned part of the development.
Hambleton District Council hopes a planning application will be submitted by the end of May.
The council said it had been working with three developers to "see Northallerton expand over the next 15 years".
The proposals are being exhibited to the public at the Golden Lion Hotel between 14:00 and 21:00 BST before a formal planning application is submitted.
