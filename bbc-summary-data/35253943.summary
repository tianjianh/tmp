Google Maps giving live updates on Edinburgh buses and trams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Google Maps is providing real-time information for bus and tram passengers travelling across Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Live updates cover Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams and display arrival times, delays and diversions.
The information is also integrated into the Transport for Edinburgh app and the company websites.
The new service went live on Tuesday - giving Google Maps an overview of every bus and tram. Edinburgh is the first Scottish city to get the service.
Jim McFarlane, the chairman of Lothian Buses, said: "Along with our travel and mobile ticketing apps, and access to free wi-fi across our bus and tram network, this latest innovation underlines our commitment to harness technology that improves our customer service."
Transport data specialists ITO World and the City of Edinburgh Council have also supported the initiative, along with Transport for Edinburgh.
