Jamaal Lascelles headed in from a corner to put Newcastle in front towards the end of an edgy first half.
Ashley Williams and Jefferson Montero missed chances as the Swans dominated after the break, but Moussa Sissoko and Andros Townsend struck late goals.
Newcastle are now three points adrift of safety, while Swansea drop to 15th.
Relegation fight 'going down to the wire'
Relive the action from St James' Park
Newcastle had found themselves in the unfamiliar position of cheering a Sunderland victory earlier in the day.
Their rivals' win at fellow strugglers Norwich kept Newcastle within six points of safety going into this encounter, and Benitez's side seemed buoyed by that result.
They started at a quick tempo and forced Swansea's Lukasz Fabianski into early saves from Vurnon Anita and Andros Townsend.
The first half failed to ignite, however, as the tension of Newcastle's predicament made for an uneasy atmosphere at St James' Park.
That was until Townsend's corner found Lascelles, who shrugged off Gylfi Sigurdsson's tug to head in via a deflection from Fabianski.
There were some anxious moments for the home crowd as Swansea pressed in the second half, but Sissoko's low strike from another Townsend corner settled those nerves.
Townsend himself added a final gloss to the scoreline - and took Newcastle's goal difference to within one of Norwich's - with a calm, low finish as time ticked down.
Having already amassed 40 points and all but secured a sixth successive season in the Premier League, Swansea had little to play for.
Francesco Guidolin's men had won on their last three visits to St James' Park but lacked purpose and intensity on this occasion.
Ecuadorian winger Montero, impressive in the preceding win over Chelsea, was erratic, while other usually influential players such as Sigurdsson struggled to impose themselves on the game.
Lascelles' goal also exposed a vulnerability at set-pieces, which Guidolin had previously highlighted as a concern.
Swansea improved in the second half but squandered their chances to equalise, with Williams powering a half-volley wide and Montero missing from close range.
Newcastle have now narrowed the gap between themselves and Norwich in 17th place to three points.
Benitez's side have a game in hand, albeit against Champions League semi-finalists Manchester City, at home on Tuesday.
Encouragingly for Newcastle, three of their remaining five matches are at St James' Park with the penultimate fixture against already relegated Aston Villa.

Swansea head coach Francesco Guidolin: "I think Newcastle deserved to win. In the second half we had situations and possibilities to score. It's a bad day for us. We have to look ahead to the next match away to Leicester.
"I know my job and I know football. We know that Newcastle play with fight, but we were ready for this game. These things can happen. After many important results this was not a good day."
