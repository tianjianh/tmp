[SN]TITLE[SN]
New use found for former Duns hospital mortuary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former mortuary at a community hospital in the Scottish Borders is to be converted into a paediatric unit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals at the Knoll Hospital in Duns have received planning approval from the local authority.
The old mortuary is currently used for storage and a council officer said the conversion plans were "modest in scale" and appropriate to the building.
Planning permission was granted on condition that external materials should match the existing building.
