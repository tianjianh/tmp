Denny Solomona is "expected to be fit" for England's tour to Argentina, says head coach Eddie Jones.

The 23-year-old Sale Sharks winger had been a doubt for the two-Test series after suffering a foot injury during a recent training camp.
The ex-Samoa rugby league international qualified to play for England on residency in March.
"He's going well, he trained well with no repercussions so he's progressing nicely," said Jones.
"He hasn't had any discomfort from his foot. At first we were quite pessimistic about it but it's nice that it looks like he can go on tour and we can see what he can do."
New Zealand-born Solomona made a controversial cross-code switch from Castleford Tigers to Sale in December.
Harlequins' Marland Yarde remains with the England squad as cover, but Jones is confident Solomona will be on the plane on Saturday.

Jones admits Solomona still has a lot to learn in rugby union, but he has seen enough to be excited at his potential.
"We're only training at this stage," added Jones. "Certainly he's got a nice feel for the game and he can sniff out and score a try.
"He does that at training now - he's scored a couple of cracking tries at training where he just sees the opportunity, takes it and makes the right decision.
"He's got enough gas to turn that opportunity into points and that's the the beauty of him."
Tommy Taylor and Nick Schonert have been ruled through injury, while Tom Wood is suspended.
England are also monitoring the fitness of Chris Robshaw (ankle) and Nathan Hughes (neck) following Saturday's Premiership final.
Sam Underhill is also recovering from the shoulder injury he suffered in England's victory over the Barbarians on Saturday.
England are also missing a number of experienced players who are part of the British and Irish Lions squad touring New Zealand.
Their two-match series against Argentina starts on Saturday, 10 June.
