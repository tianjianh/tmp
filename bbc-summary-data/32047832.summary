Clean-up plan for old Brooks Laundry site in St Werburghs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for more than 100 homes are being drawn-up for the former Brooks Laundry complex in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 3.5-acre site in St Werburghs shut in 2007 when the company went into liquidation.
A property consultant is now preparing an outline plan on behalf of the land owners Folland Ltd.
Nearly 900 people lost their jobs in 2007 when four companies which formed part of the Brooks Service Group closed.
Some 350 of these were from the Bristol operation.
Outline plans include 114 houses and flats, with further space allocated for uses including offices, studios and workshops.
But the St Werburgh's Neighbourhood Association has drawn up its own community plan for the land.
They want to see a mixed-use development, weighted more to residential use with "small-scale employment opportunities".
Campaigners say they want the existing buildings and the chimney should be kept as local landmarks.
A public consultation event is due to take place between 14:30 and 18:30 BST on 1 April at the St Werburghs Community Centre, on Horley Road.
Bristol City Council has received a pre-application enquiry from the developer and the firm hopes to submit a planning application in the summer.
None of the 19th or 20th Century buildings is believed to be listed and it is not a conservation area.
