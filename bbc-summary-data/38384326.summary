Newport will face the Premier League giants if they beat Plymouth Argyle in their second-round replay on Wednesday.
County are using a special pitch cover at Rodney Parade to ensure the games is not a victim of the weather.
"It's a massive game for us. The lads are buzzing, they are ready to go," Jackson said.
"The money would be massive for the club and we as players know we would get to play at Anfield.
"In League Two that's not something you get to do every day. It would be something to tell the grandkids.
"It would be the biggest game of my career so I'm going to be doing everything I can to help my team get there."
County boss, Graham Westley, said he had no fresh injury concerns, but Newport will be without Sean Rigg, who is still suspended after being sent off in the original game at Home Park, which ended 0-0.
