Officers have studied CCTV images to trace the movements of 30-year-old Kirsty Aitchison after she left the Campus bar in Sauchiehall Street.
The footage shows she was last seen at the Broomielaw, by the River Clyde, at 03:16 on Sunday.
She had taken off her high heels and was "walking quickly and with purpose".
Ms Aitchison, a mother-of-four from Robroyston in the north of the city, had left the bar at about 03:00 on Sunday.
Some of her friends have also been carrying out searches near where she lives.
It was earlier reported that Ms Aitchison may have been involved in an argument in the pub and was thought to have been seen getting into a taxi.
Insp Leigh McManus, from Greater Glasgow Division, said there was no longer any suggestion that Ms Aitchison had got into a taxi or any vehicle.
He said: "Officers have been working through the night to piece together Kirsty's movements from when she left Campus in the early hours of Sunday morning."
CCTV footage showed her make her way down from Sauchiehall Street to Argyle Street and on to James Watt Street before walking down to the Broomielaw, where she was last viewed on CCTV.
The footage confirms she was wearing the same clothing as in the photograph released to the media, which was taken on Saturday evening.
Ms Aitchison was described as white, a Deaf/BSL user, about 5ft tall, slim build and long dark-coloured hair.
She was wearing a black top, cream skirt and in the CCTV images she is seen holding her high-heeled black sandals and walking barefoot.
Insp McManus said he was looking for information from anyone who may have seen her at the Broomielaw.
Rachael Griffiths and Catriona Lafferty, friends of Ms Aitchison's who are also deaf and have helped organised searches, told BBC Scotland: "This is so out of character for Kirsty. We just want her to come home.
"We can't sit at home doing nothing. We know that the police are doing their job, but we feel like we want to get up and do something too. We want to help search and do whatever we can."
Police Scotland has also set up a dedicated email address for anyone with information to contact.
