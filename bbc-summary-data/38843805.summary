The 24-year-old, who suffered a similar setback last season in his right knee, injured himself in training and is expected to be out for six months.
"Callum showed incredible character and determination to come back last season," said Cherries boss Eddie Howe.
"We know he has the same strength and will do the same again."
Wilson's injury last season occurred in a game at Stoke on 26 September and he returned just over six months later, on 9 April in a substitute appearance against Aston Villa.
Capped once by England Under-21s against France in 2014, the former Coventry forward has scored six goals in 20 league appearances for Bournemouth this season.
