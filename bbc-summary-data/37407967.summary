For new side Crick Athletic Colts Ladies, however, the beginning of the 2016-17 campaign has proven to be a steep learning curve.
After 21-0 and 25-0 defeats in their opening two matches, Crick hoped to bounce back when they hosted Corby Town Ladies on Sunday in Northamptonshire Women's and Girl's Football League Division One .
What followed was a resounding 34-0 defeat, although the home side praised their opponents' "spirit and determination" on Twitter.
Secretary of Corby Town Ladies, Sheila Lauder, told BBC Radio Northampton: "In the second half the Crick goalkeeper pulled off some absolutely fantastic saves.
"They're a very new team, very inexperienced, and absolutely all credit to them - their spirit was excellent and they were full of praise for us."
The defeat left Crick bottom of the league after three matches, with a goal difference of -80.
"There were a couple of double hat-tricks in there and I think the defenders had a little bit of a day off," Lauder added.
"It was a good, spirited game and I wouldn't say the score reflected the game itself.
"From our point of view, and what we're trying to achieve, we'd rather see a lesser score against a more experienced team."
BBC Radio Northampton has contacted Crick for comment.
