Euro 2016: Kent Police 'spotters' stop fans travelling to France

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six football fans suspected of plotting trouble at Euro 2016 have been prevented from travelling to France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four people stopped at the Port of Dover on Wednesday were issued with court orders under Section 21A of the Football Spectators Act.
Another man was arrested at the port on suspicion of breaching bail conditions.
A sixth man was stopped at the Channel Tunnel on Thursday, but failed to appear at court and was issued with a three-year ban in his absence.
Specialist officers looking for anyone who could potentially disrupt the tournament have been screening passengers leaving Kent for France.
Kent Police said hearings at Folkestone Magistrates' Court for four of the men - a 24-year-old from Southampton; a 22-year-old from Middlesbrough; a 27-year-old from Stockport and a 26-year-old from Shropshire - were adjourned but they were ordered to surrender their passports until after the Euro 2016 final on 10 July.
The man who failed to appear in court is 48, and from Darlington.
The hearing into a 25-year-old man from Shepshed, in Leicestershire, who was on bail was also adjourned until after the conclusion of the tournament.
Ch Supt Alison Roden, of Kent Police, said: "We want Euro 2016 to be remembered for all the right reasons and not for the actions of a minority intent on causing trouble in France."
