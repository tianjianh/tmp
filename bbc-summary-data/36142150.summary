The 2014 Super League champions were twice behind before finally seeing off depleted Castleford at the Jungle.
Second row Joe Greenwood scored two of their tries, while Jonny Lomax followed up his two tries on his comeback against Leeds with Saints' final try.
Kyle Amor and Shannon McDonnnell were also on the scoresheet, while scrum-half Luke Walsh kicked five goals.
After making three changes following last week's heavy defeat by Hull KR. Cas head coach Daryl Powell was rewarded with a much better performance.
Powell gave a debut to 17-year-old prop Conor Fitzsimmons and was forced to reshuffle his line-up just before kick-off after centre Jake Webster aggravated a hip injury in the warm-up and second rower Junior Moors failed a head test, forcing prop Grant Millington to start at stand-off.
Having gone into the game without eight senior players, Castleford were then further hit when they lost long-serving prop Andy Lynch with an ankle injury six minutes from the end.
But they still scored four tries through Joel Monaghan, Denny Solomona, Mike McMeeken and Jy Hitchcox, while Luke Gale kicked two goals.
Saints remain fifth in the Super League table, five points off top spot, while Cas are eight five points further back in eighth after a third straight defeat.
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell:
"Our attitude was great. It's tough but if we continue to work that hard, things are going to flip. There is no way with the squad of players we've got that we will continue to lose games.
"If we continue to show character, we are going to start winning. We made just too many errors and that really hurt us in that key period in the second half but we weren't too far away. We had young kids on the bench but that's no excuse. The boys did us proud, we just weren't quite good enough to win.
"Andy Lynch has got an ankle problem that doesn't look great. Whether it's a crack in there or it's an syndesmosis injury, we're not sure."
St Helens coach Keiron Cunningham:
"We were our own worst enemy at times. After every try we seemed to cough up some soft possession to let Cas back into the game.
"I knew it was going to be a physical encounter regardless of who was or wasn't playing for them.
"It is always tough coming to this place and getting the result whichever way you go about it is the aim, and we've done that. We can be better but we've gone two in a row and it's something to really build on."
