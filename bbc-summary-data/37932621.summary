A spokesman for the LA Department of Children and Family Services said the agency could not confirm it investigated Pitt.
Ms Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage on 19 September.
Hollywood couples with staying power
Mr Pitt and Ms Jolie grew close while shooting the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, in which they played a couple in a stagnant relationship. They got married in 2014.
