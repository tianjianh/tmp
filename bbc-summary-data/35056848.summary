[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Allott, the 36-year-old deputy head at St Benedict's, has been charged with possessing, showing and making category A indecent images of children.
He is also accused of two counts of possession of extreme pornography, the National Crime Agency said.
He appeared before Ealing magistrates earlier and was remanded in custody.
Mr Allott is next due to appear in court on 23 December at a venue to be confirmed.
St Benedict's is a co-educational school for junior and senior school pupils. Last year 1,092 pupils were registered at the school.
In 2010 Lord Carlile conducted a separate and unrelated inquiry into the "terrible legacy" of 21 cases of historical sex abuse at the school since 1970.
The Independent Schools Inspectorate said in 2014 St Benedict's had a proactive approach to safeguarding which had improved since a previous inspection in 2012.
