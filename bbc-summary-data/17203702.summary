Radio 1 reveals schedule shake-up

BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James is to host the station's weekday 16:00-19:00 drivetime show from April, as part of a shake-up of presenters.

James will swap with Scott Mills, who has been presenting the slot since 2004. Mills will now front the lunchtime show from 13:00-16:00.
T4 host Jameela Jamil and 1Xtra's Gemma Cairney will also join the station.
Radio 1 boss Ben Cooper said the changes were aimed at attracting younger listeners.
In recent years the BBC Trust has called for the station to refocus towards a younger audience.
Radio 1's target audience, as set by the trust'sservice licence, is aged between 15 and 29. But the official average age of a Radio 1 listener has risen from 29 to 32 in the past three years.
It is thought James' new role will put the 26-year-old in line to eventually replace Chris Moyles, 38, as the station's flagship breakfast DJ when his contract ends in 2013.
New signing Jamil will host the Radio 1 Request Show which will be now broadcast on Sundays from 19:00-21:00.
Cairney will move from Radio 1's digital sister station 1Xtra, taking over Edith Bowman's weekend breakfast show.
Bowman will move to a midweek slot, fronting Radio 1's Review Show on Tuesdays from 21:00-22:00, resulting in her on-air time being cut from six hours to one.
"These are exciting times at Radio 1 & 1Xtra," Cooper said.
"The latest changes are about attracting even more young listeners by bringing in new and fresh talent to the stations."
The moves come nearly three months after Radio 1 announced changes to its dance music schedule, which will also see long-time presenters Judge Jules and Gilles Peterson leave the station in favour of younger, new talent.
Last year, meanwhile, long-serving presenter Jo Whiley moved to Radio 2, with new music champion Huw Stephens claiming her slot in the weekend schedule.
The new schedule will begin from Monday, 2 April.
