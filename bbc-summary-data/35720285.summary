Lord Turner, who was in charge of the Pensions Commission between 2003 and 2006, was speaking after the government launched a review of the pension age.
He predicted the pension age could be raised to 75 by 2070 or 2080. "We shouldn't be terrified by the idea that it might eventually be 80," he added.
