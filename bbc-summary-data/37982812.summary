[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 1-0 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Hanson was the match winner as Bradford bounced back from Saturday's defeat at Southend with a hard-earned home win over Northampton, on a night when the club paid tribute to their record goalscorer Bobby Campbell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Northern Ireland international, who died last week, was remembered with a minute's applause and a video tribute following a career that saw him score more than 140 goals for the club.
On the pitch, however, the Bantams were looking for a response to the loss at Roots Hall and they started in positive fashion.
Mark McNulty and Nicky Law each had shots deflected for corners and Bradford twice appealed in vain for a penalty, with Hanson and McNulty both going down inside the area to no avail.
The hosts continued to press after the interval as Haris Vuckic and Law went close before the home side's pressure paid off in the 56th minute.
Vuckic's overhit cross from the right was kept in play by Mark Marshall, who clipped the ball into the area where Hanson scored with a header from close range.
However, Northampton came close to equalising when only a brilliant one-handed save by Colin Doyle kept out Alex Revell's header from Paul Anderson's cross, before substitute Marc Richards had the ball in the net in the 84th minute only to be ruled offside.
