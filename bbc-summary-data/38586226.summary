Victor Lownes: Playboy executive dies aged 88

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Victor Lownes, who helped establish Playboy and ran the magazine's clubs and casinos in the UK in the 1960s and '70s, has died at the age of 88.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lownes met Playboy founder Hugh Hefner in 1954 and became the magazine's promotion director.
He suggested that Playboy set up a club and said he came up with the idea for hostesses to be Playboy bunnies.
Moving to London, he came to embody the Playboy lifestyle and set up a string of highly successful clubs and casinos.
He married a former Playmate of the Year, Marilyn Cole, and was known for throwing lavish star-studded parties at his Hertfordshire mansion.
For a time he was reputedly the highest paid executive in Britain, but was sacked by Playboy in 1981 when the gambling operation ran into problems with authorities.
