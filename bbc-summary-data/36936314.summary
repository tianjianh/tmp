IBF world champion Lee Selby is confident his next fight will be against new WBA world featherweight champion Carl Frampton.

Selby was ringside in Brooklyn to see Frampton beat champion Leo Santa Cruz on points to win the title.
Frampton wants to defend the title in his home city of Belfast and did not rule out a rematch, although he also has Selby in his sights.
"He's mentioned me a few times, sounds like he wants the fight," Selby said.
"I want the fight and it shouldn't be too difficult to make."
Selby said any possible meeting could be held in Belfast or Cardiff's Principality Stadium.
Barry-born Selby insisted before the fight there was no chance of him meeting British rival Josh Warrington, who beat Patrick Hyland to retain his WBC International featherweight title.
Selby accused Warrington of 'running scared,' after talks fell through over arranging a summer contest at Leeds' Elland Road.
Frampton inflicted the first defeat of 27-year-old Mexican Santa Cruz's career to become the first Northern Ireland fighter to win a world title in two weight divisions.
It was Frampton's first pro bout at featherweight, having moved up a division after unifying the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight titles by beating England's Scott Quigg in Manchester in February.
Selby said he was not surprised by Frampton's majority verdict over Santa Cruz, who has held world titles at three weights.
"I thought it was a brilliant fight and very competitive from the first bell to the last," Selby added.
"Carl Frampton boxed excellent and he surprised me with his tactics. I thought he would box on the back foot and use his range and jab.
"But at times he held his feet, stood in the middle of the ring and went toe to toe and beat Santa Cruz at his own game."
