[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man accused of poisoning ex-girlfriend refused bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been refused bail after appearing in court accused of trying to poison his ex-girlfriend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Waudby, 20, with an address at Hosford House hostel on the Newtownards Road in Belfast, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Saturday.
He faces a total of seven charges.
It is alleged that he "administered a poison or other noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy" his ex-partner on 19 October.
He is also accused of supplying heroin, assaulting his ex-girlfriend, threatening to kill her, and stealing Â£230 from her on the same date.
He is further accused of supplying class B cannabis and class C diazepam to another on 1 April last year.
Giving evidence to the court, a police constable testified that he believed he could connect Mr Waudby to the offences.
He said that PSNI were objecting to bail on the grounds that they believe there is a danger the accused would reoffend, fail to turn up for a court appearance or would interfere with the witness.
Mr Waudby's solicitor said he completely denied the offences telling the court that Mr Waudby suffers from autism and had problems with drug addiction.
Refusing to release Mr Waudby, the judge said she had to "take the case at its height" and that it was a "serious aggravating factor" that he was already on bail for other charges.
Mr Waudby will appear again in court via videolink on 21 November.
