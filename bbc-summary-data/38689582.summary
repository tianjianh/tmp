Kayleigh Haywood: Man tried to meet girl days before her murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty to attempting to meet schoolgirl Kayleigh Haywood for sex days before her rape and murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bruce Cordwell, 20, of no fixed address, admitted sexually grooming her through social media in November 2015.
Cordwell had nothing to do with the 15-year-old's death at the hands of Stephen Beadman.
In July, Beadman was jailed for 35 years, while his friend Luke Harlow was given a 12-year-sentence for grooming and sexual activity with Kayleigh.
Leicester Crown Court heard how Cordwell contacted her through social media between 10 and 13 November.
He admitted a charge of attempting to arrange to meet a child following sexual grooming.
