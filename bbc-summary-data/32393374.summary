Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival appeals for board members

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal is being made to find new board members for Scotland's "largest rural performing arts festival".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival was established in 1979 and runs over 10 days in May.
This year's event is described as its "most ambitious yet" with 82 performances in 42 venues regionwide.
Ken Gouge, who chairs the festival, said would-be board members needed enthusiasm, commitment and a willingness to help promote the event.
"We are currently working with Dumfries and Galloway Council, D&G Unlimited and Creative Scotland to explore how we can best develop a sustainable infrastructure for the performing arts across the region throughout the year," he said.
"We are seeking to appoint people to the board of trustees with an interest in the performing arts.
"If you are interested in helping shape the future of the performing arts across the region we would love to hear from you."
Anyone wishing to join the board should contact the arts festival by 11 May.
