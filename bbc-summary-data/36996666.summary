The teenager suffered head injuries in the attack in Chapel Street Park in Levenshulme, Manchester, on Friday.
He is in hospital in a "serious, but stable" condition following the attack at 18:00 BST.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it is thought he was hit with a hammer and appealed for witnesses to get in touch.
Det Insp Brian Morley said: "We are currently trying to piece together exactly what happened and the possible motive behind it.
"A 16-year-old boy has been badly injured with what we believe could be a hammer, but we are still following a number of lines of enquiry."
He urged anyone who saw anything to get in touch with police.
