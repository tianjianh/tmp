[SN]TITLE[SN]
Disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson has sentence increased

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A breast surgeon who intentionally wounded his patients has had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Paterson, 59, who appeared at the Court of Appeal via video link, was told his current sentence was "not sufficient" to reflect the seriousness and the totality of his offending.
Paterson was found guilty in May at Nottingham Crown Court of 17 counts of wounding with intent.
Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges.
Explaining the decision to increase his jail term, one of the three Appeal Court judges - Lady Justice Hallett - told Paterson his victims had been, "left feeling violated and vulnerable".
She described his treatment of patients as "brutal and sustained".
"They have lost their trust in others, particularly some in the medical profession," she said.
"Some have experienced long-term psychological effects."
