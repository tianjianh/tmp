Gemili, fourth at the Rio Olympics in 2016, was a distant sixth as Mitchell-Blake's time of 20.18 seconds broke the British championship record.
Danny Talbot finished second in 20.20 and also guaranteed his selection.
Shannon Hylton held off both Bianca Williams and Desiree Henry to win the women's 200m race in 22.94secs.
A top-two finish in the weekend's trials guarantees a place at the World Championships beginning on 4 August, provided athletes have achieved the qualifying standard.
It was the first time that 23-year-old Mitchell-Blake - born in London, raised in Jamaica and based in the USA - had raced in the UK since he was 13.
Wearing a Louisiana State University vest, he proved that his formidable early-season form could survive the trip back to Britain as he powered away off the bend and held on for victory to break John Regis' 30-year-old record.
Third-placed Leon Reid also ran the qualifying time but Zharnel Hughes, who could only manage fourth on Sunday, is now likely to be Gemili's main competition for a place on the British team at the Worlds.
Gemili appeared to be holding his thigh after the race but refused to blame the strain for his below-average performance.
"That's nowhere near my standard - I didn't come in and execute a good race at all," he said.
"I'm not fit and where I need to be at the moment but I had to race here and I gave it my best shot.
"I have to put forward my case based on my history but at the moment I've got a lot of work to do. "
It was an afternoon of upsets in Birmingham as 20-year-old Hylton stormed to a comfortable victory in the women's 200m.
The Kent athlete, whose twin sister Cheriece is also a British sprinter, saw off the challenge of more experienced athletes in Williams and pre-race favourite Henry to equal her lifetime best.
Williams edged out Henry, who won an Olympic bronze medal in the 4x100m relay in 2016, to take the second guaranteed spot on the British team.
"I had so many emotions when I crossed the line," Hylton told BBC Sport. "It was such hard work this year, but I can't believe I'm going to London now."
British record holder Dina Asher-Smith looks likely to be handed the discretionary third 200m slot in place of Henry despite disappointing in Saturday's 100m as she continues her comeback from a serious foot injury.
Henry's best chance of an individual place in London could now be as the third entrant in the 100m.
Elsewhere, Rio Olympic finalist Jazmin Sawyers endured a miserable afternoon in the long jump as she fouled out with three successive no-jumps.
Lorraine Ugen took the title with a jump of 6.59m before later withdrawing from the event, with rival Shara Proctor missing the trials following a minor car accident on Saturday.
In the women's 1500m, contested in the absence of Scotland's Laura Muir who has already qualified via her Diamond League series victory in 2016, Laura Weightman took the title in four minutes 6.50 seconds.
And the talented Jessica Judd, who missed out on selection for both the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, secured her place on the British team with a second-placed finish.
"It's been so hard but everyone has been so supportive," Judd, 22, told BBC Sport.
"When I missed out on London 2012 my Dad said 'our aim is to get to the World Championships' but I just never thought we would do it.
"Thanks to everyone who made sure I didn't give up, it's for all of them."
Mo Farah - who will seek to defend his 5,000m and 10,000m titles in London - and long jumper Greg Rutherford will be part of the British team courtesy of their status as world champions.
Farah will be joined by Andrew Butchart in the 5,000m after the Scot secured a win in Birmingham on Saturday, where 20-year-old Morgan Lake produced a lifetime best mark of 1.96m in the high jump to qualify.
Katarina Johnson-Thompson has already reached the qualifying mark in the heptathlon, and Ashley Bryant has done so in the decathlon.
Steeplechaser Rob Mullett won his third British title ahead of Zak Seddon on Saturday as both men made the team.
European indoor champion Andrew Pozzi - who was exempted from the trials - was instead competing in the 110m hurdles at the Diamond League meeting in Paris on Saturday night and set a new personal best of 13.14 seconds to take second place.
