Louie Howlett, 21, from Lakenheath, was clocked on the A11 at Icklingham in Suffolk in April.
He was driving a Seat Leon Cupra when he was stopped by police. Officers said they believed it to be the highest recorded speed on a Suffolk road.
Appearing at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court, Howlett was also ordered to pay Â£365.
Suffolk police said the sentence was "disappointing".
Inspector David Giles, from the roads policing unit, said: "I don't think it is enough at all. I'm really disappointed frankly.
"It's not a real incentive to stick within the speed limit, in my opinion."

Lakenheath mechanic Howlett, who lives with his disabled mother and has been driving for four years, pleaded guilty to the offence by letter.
He told magistrates he was "sorry" and "had learnt his lesson".
Gary Rae, campaigns and communications director for the road safety charity Brake, said stronger deterrents were needed.
He said: "Drivers who recklessly speed put not only their own lives, but those of other road users, at severe risk.
"Breaking the speed limit by such a shocking amount shows an appalling disregard for the safety of innocent road users.
"We are disappointed to see such a lenient sentence in this case - drivers who selfishly flout the law need to be punished accordingly."
