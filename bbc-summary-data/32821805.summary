Dunkirk flotilla to set sail for WW2 anniversary events

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 50 boats involved in the evacuation of allied troops from the beaches of Dunkirk in World War Two are to set sail from Kent later to mark the 75th anniversary of the rescue.

The craft, escorted by RNLI and Royal Navy vessels, are heading to the French town for official commemorative events.
Operation Dynamo between 26 May and 4 June 1940 saw hundreds of boats all varieties rescue 338,000 troops after they retreated from Nazi forces.
A return takes place every five years.
The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships (ADLS) has organised sailings across the English Channel since 1970 in honour of the fishing boats, pleasure yachts and lifeboats that took part.
In 1940, their crews had heeded the government's request to help British, French and Belgium troops stranded after a German advance. Historians say if the evacuation had not been a success the allied war effort may have been critically damaged.
The flotilla will leave Ramsgate Harbour at about 08:00 BST and a Spitfire and Hurricane from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight will perform a fly-past.
The ships will be escorted by HMS Ranger and HMS Trumpeter, where the ADLS's honorary admiral, Prince Michael of Kent, will be on board for the journey.
Two veterans of the Dunkirk evacuations will be on the Princess Freda, a 63ft Thames passenger vessel that ferried soldiers to a waiting navy destroyer.
They include 97-year-old Michael Bentall, who served with the 4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment,  and has travelled from Canada for the commemorations.
About 10 other veterans are expected to attend events in Dunkirk.
A service at the British Memorial at the Dunkirk Military Cemetery will take place on Friday, followed by a reception and presentation for ADLS skippers at the town hall.
The official service to mark the mission will take place at the Allied Beach Memorial on Saturday, and there will be a parade of military vehicles and bands.
On Sunday, a memorial plaque will be unveiled to mark the MV Crested Eagle, a paddle steamer involved in the evacuation, which was bombed with the loss of 300 lives.
The ADLS will also hold a commemorative service on the quayside in Dunkirk next to its boats, which will return to Ramsgate on Monday. They now all carry a plaque awarded by the ADLS and fly its flag.
Ahead of the sailings, services were held in Ramsgate, at the Sailors' Church and harbour. The Bishop of Dover praised the ordinary people who had manned the "ramshackle fleet" and who answered the call to "serve and save".
