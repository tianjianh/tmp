Marinas, fish farms and navigation buoys could be regularly monitored to help provide early warnings of the spread of invasive marine species.

Scientists examined the best ways of checking for non-native wildlife for a report commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
An estimated 58 invasive species cause at least Â£40m worth of damage a year to UK marine industries, the report said.
The harmful wildlife include algae and Pacific oysters.
The scientists tested several techniques for monitoring non-native species at sites on Scotland's west coast, including Loch Fyne and Firth of Lorn, and the Firth of Forth on the east coast.
Objects checked for alien life included the submerged bottoms of Northern Lighthouse Board navigation buoys.
The report has recommended that a network of sites could be surveyed for the presence of invasive plant and animal life.
