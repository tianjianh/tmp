The family of Tara Lear-Jones said "a massive piece" has been taken from their lives and they are "just left with heartache".
Ms Lear-Jones died in the accident on the A539, near the village of Penley, on Thursday.
"Tara was a much loved daughter, sister, aunty, granddaughter and girlfriend," a tribute read.
"We all love her so much and no words can explain how we are feeling right now.
"Tara thought the world of her nieces and nephew and we will make sure they know how much she loved them when they are older."
North Wales Police have appealed for witnesses who saw a blue Vauxhall Corsa that was involved.
