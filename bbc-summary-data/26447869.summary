The worlds of football and music have come together, again, to record the video for the official England 2014 World Cup song - a cover of Take That hit Greatest Day.

Led by Gary Barlow and former England captain Gary Lineker, the 20-strong group includes pop stars Katy B, former Spice Girl Emma Bunton and Pixie Lott.
Footballers Peter Shilton, Michael Owen and Glenn Hoddle have also taken part.
The video will make its debut on Sport Relief night on 21 March.
Proceeds from the sale of the record will also go to Sport Relief.
England did not have an official song at the last World Cup in 2010 after the then-manager Fabio Capello banned one, saying he wanted to be "fully focused on the football".
However an unofficial release featuring James Corden and Dizzee Rascal - titled Shout - still topped the UK charts.
The promo for Greatest Day was filmed at Sarm Studios in west London, where the 1984 Band Aid single was also recorded.
The single will not be released until nearer the tournament in June.
Other pop stars featured on the track include another former Spice Girl, "Sporty Spice" Mel C, Eliza Doolittle, Conor Maynard and Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh also participate.
Dion Dublin, Sir Geoff Hurst, Martin Keown, Gary Mabbutt, Gary Pallister, Carlton Palmer, Kenny Sansom and David Seaman make up the rest of the football contingent. Between them they have played in eight World Cups.
It is not the first taste of the music business for some of the sportsmen. Hoddle reached number 12 in the charts in 1987 with the track Diamond Lights, which he released with fellow footballer Chris Waddle.
Sir Geoff featured on the 1970 England song Back Home, while Shilton was involved with both that song and the 1990 number one song World In Motion by New Order.
Other England World Cup songs include Embrace's World at Your Feet in 2006 and Ant and Dec's 2002 release We're On The Ball, which both reached number three in the chart.
Yet (How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World, released by Echo and the Bunnymen and the Spice Girls, only made it to number nine in 1998.
Official songs in recent years have been overshadowed by unofficial anthems, among the Three Lions '98 - a version of a song Frank Skinner and David Baddiel recorded with the Lightning Seeds for the European Championship in 1996.
The 1998 tournament also spawned Vindaloo by Fat Les, a raucous pop collective comprising actor Keith Allen, Blur's Alex James and artist Damien Hirst.
