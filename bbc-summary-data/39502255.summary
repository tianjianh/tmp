[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A homeless man grabbed a woman under a motorway bridge and killed her before dumping her body in undergrowth, a court has heard.

Vadims Ruskuls, 25, is accused of murdering Pardeep Kaur as she walked to work in west London, in October 2016.
Ms Kaur's body was found near Harlington Bridge in Hayes, nearly a week after she was reported missing by her husband.
Mr Ruskuls denies murdering the 30-year-old.
Opening the trial at the Old Bailey, Crispin Aylett QC told jurors: "This is a truly terrible case.
"The evidence in this case is distressing and you will have to brace yourself for what is to come."
Mr Ruskuls was thought to be sleeping rough with his mother beneath the bridge crossing the M4.
The court heard the waste ground by the walkway on to the bridge over the M4 was a "bleak spot" used by rough sleepers, drunks and drug addicts.
CCTV cameras recorded Ms Kaur at 06:33 GMT on 17 October as she walked towards the bridge.
Investigators also noticed a man under the bridge at the same time as Mrs Kaur.
Less than half an hour later, someone was picked up on CCTV dragging her body away towards the patch of ground where it was later discovered.
Mr Aylett said: "What happened in the 25 minutes between those two pieces of film?
"The prosecution allege that the defendant must have pounced on Pardeep Kaur at some point on the ramp, that he then sexually assaulted her and he murdered her."
Jurors were told Ms Kaur scratched her attacker but her screams would have been drowned out by early morning traffic.
Following his arrest, Mr Ruskuls' DNA matched samples taken from Ms Kaur's ankle, sock, and bra with a probability of "one in a billion", the jury heard.
The trial continues.
