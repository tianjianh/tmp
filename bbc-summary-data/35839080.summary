[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Harriman's second-half strike earned a win over Mansfield Town which takes Wycombe Wanderers into the final League Two play-off place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had the better of a game lacking quality and full of wayward finishing.
Chris Clements and Matt Blair were off target for the Stags and Ryan Sellers missed a great chance for Wycombe.
But the home side took maximum points when Harriman showed great footwork before curling in a cross-come-shot.
The victory takes Wycombe a point above seventh-placed Leyton Orient, while Mansfield drop to 14th, eight points adrift of the play-offs.
