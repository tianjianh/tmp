A new dementia support group which uses sporting memorabilia like football programmes to help tap into long-term memories has been set up in Derbyshire.

The Sporting Reminiscences Group, thought to be the first of its kind, is a partnership between The Alzheimer's Society and Alfreton Town FC.
It is hoped the project will help those with short-term memory problems.
John Glasby, of Alfreton Town, said he wanted other football clubs to host similar activities.
Mr Glasby, who is the club's community scheme chairman, said: "We're hoping with the help of The Alzheimer's Society we will become the first dementia-friendly football club in the whole country.
"I know the league authority that we play in at the moment are interested in our project because if it's successful they would be interested in rolling it out at other football clubs. Maybe even Premier League clubs will begin to take an interest."
Ronald Wade, of the The Alzheimer's Society, said the sessions could make a difference to patients.
He said: "Because of the age of some of our users, the sporting activities that a lot of them did is very much part of their early memories.
"It's the perfect format for people to engage in conversation, to support each other because they all share similar memories."
Wayne, who is one of the people taking part in the project, was 42 when he was diagnosed with dementia.
Lesley, his wife, said recalling memories of Nottingham Forest and Brian Clough at the group had been helping him.
She said: "Wayne was diagnosed pretty young and quite a few of the groups aren't applicable to him... but he loves football; it just seemed to be the right thing for him. It's fantastic."
