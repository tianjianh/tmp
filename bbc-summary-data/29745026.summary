Ebola crisis: Guinea begins compensation payments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of Guinea's Ebola mission has said the government has started paying compensation to the families of health workers who have died of the virus.

Eight families have already been paid the $10,000 (Â£6,200) lump sum, Dr Saccoba Keita told the BBC.
The families of 42 victims, including doctors, nurses, drivers and porters, had been identified to receive compensation, he said.
The outbreak began in Guinea and so far has killed more than 900 people there.
According to the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO), transmission of the virus in Guinea "remains intense".
In total more than 4,800 people have died of Ebola, mainly in Guinea and the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Meanwhile, an international team of scientists has been set up to determine the effectiveness of using the blood of Ebola survivors as a treatment.
Guinea's President Alpha Conde had promised to pay compensation for those who had died "in active service" helping Ebola patients a month ago.
The BBC's Alhassan Sillah in Guinea says those to be compensated also include the families of the eight-member team attacked and killed in September while trying to spread awareness about Ebola in the southern village of Wome.
The wife of one doctor who died of the virus in April told the BBC that while she was grateful for the money, she would rather have her husband back.
"Yes it a good thing," said the woman, whose husband was working at a hospital in Conakry on the coast of Guinea when he contracted Ebola.
"But personally, if I had a choice, I'd rather be with my husband.
"That's a lot of money, but when I think about why I received it, honestly, it's painful."

The WHO says 443 health workers have contracted Ebola in this outbreak, of whom 244 have died.
Following the third meeting of the WHO's emergency committee to assess the efforts so far to contain and control the outbreak, the world health body said it continued to be a "public health emergency of international concern".
The situation in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone "remains of great concern", it added.
WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda also said he was "reasonably confident" that Ebola had not spread into neighbouring countries despite the porous nature of borders in the region, reports the Reuters news agency.
"It remains a concern... [but] right now I think we are not seeing it," he said.
