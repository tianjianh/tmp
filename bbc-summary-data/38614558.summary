[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man due in court over M20 bridge collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 63-year-old man will appear in court following the collapse of a pedestrian bridge on the M20 during last August's bank holiday weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge fell on to the London-bound carriageway of the motorway just after midday on Saturday 27 August.
The man from Darlington has been issued with a summons to appear before Maidstone magistrates on 17 February.
He will face charges of dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He will also face three counts of criminal damage.
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when the bridge came down.  No one died.
The collapse happened between junctions four and three, near the junction with the M26 which links the M25 London orbital with the M20.
The road, which is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover, had to be closed while two large cranes worked to clear the debris.
The road was closed again the following weekend for the remains of the partially collapsed pedestrian bridge to be removed.
