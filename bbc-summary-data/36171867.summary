Manager Ronny Deila says he expects the lure of securing the Premiership title this weekend will help raise the performance of his Celtic players.

The defending champions have been criticised in recent times for a series of uninspiring displays.
Victory at Hearts on Saturday will seal a fifth straight title, should Aberdeen fail to secure maximum points.
"The players know there is a good game coming up and of course we want to do it tomorrow," said Deila.
"We are in a great position. We know it is going to be a great atmosphere and nothing would please me more than to do it tomorrow."
Celtic enjoy a nine-point lead over Aberdeen with four matches remaining and also have a vastly superior goal difference.
However, Hearts, in third place, have made life difficult for Celtic this season, earning two draws in the league.
"If we win, it's essentially over," added Deila, who will leave at the end of the season.
"Training has shown a lot of energy and now everything is about winning the games that are left.
"It's so important to be together now and see what we can achieve.
"Five-in-a-row is fantastic and it's something to build on. Hopefully, tomorrow we can start and the club can get to 10-in-a-row.
"It's always emotional when you achieve something. The road to it is fun, but getting over the line is emotional for everybody."
When the possibility of him returning to Scandinavia to manage one of their top teams and then meeting Celtic in European competition was put to Deila, he joked: "It could be Real Madrid as well, you never know, we will see.
"If I came back here with another team it would be fun. But that is not in my mind right now."
