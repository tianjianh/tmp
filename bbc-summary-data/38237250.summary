Sacha Parkin admitted he wrote to SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh and also named a young child he said he wanted to abuse.
The 46-year-old, from Perth, was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for three years.
He was also banned from owning more than one computer and mobile phone.
Perth Sheriff Court heard that Parkin had also written in the email: "I'm not being funny. Why are you and your colleagues, including Nicola Sturgeon, being so stupid?"
The police were called in and Parkin was arrested. He told officers he was trying to get help for people who needed it.
Parkin admitted sending an offensive email to Ellen Forson, for the attention of the MP, in which he outlined his sexual attraction to children.
Fiscal depute Lisa Marshall previously told Perth Sheriff Court: "The complainer is the office manager at the SNP office in Alloa and works with Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.
"Miss Forson contacted the police after receiving the email from the accused, which had the subject heading 'How the SNP can help reduce child sexual exploitation.'
Sheriff William Wood prevented further details of the email, which is understood to contain graphic content, being read out in open court.
The court was told that Parkin had recently been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome and was now undergoing mental health treatment for his difficulties.
In March this year, Parkin was given a community payback order after he admitted telling the NSPCC charity helpline he had fantasies about abusing and murdering children.
Parkin later told police he was "struggling to control" his thoughts and wanted support.
