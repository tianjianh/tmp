The body was spotted by an angler at Breakwater beach in Brixham at 07:15 BST, police said.
Thomas Hodgson, 42, from the Walsall area in the West Midlands, went missing while visiting Brixham last weekend.
"Unfortunately it is now believed the male is in fact Mr Thomas Hodgson," said a police spokesman. "His family have been informed."
The area around Breakwater beach has been cordoned off for police investigations.
Mr Hodgson's dinghy, used to reach his yacht, was found empty in the harbour last weekend.
