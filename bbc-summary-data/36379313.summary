EU referendum: How to register to vote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The referendum to decide on the UK's membership of the European Union is on Thursday 23 June 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will put the question "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"
Voters will have to mark an X in either the 'Remain a member of the European Union' box or the 'Leave the European Union' box.
You must be registered to vote to be able to take part in the referendum.
The deadline to register was originally midnight on Tuesday 7 June, but this was extended until midnight on Thursday 9 June, after a computer glitch meant some people were unable to submit their applications in time.
You can vote in this referendum if you are registered to vote in the UK, are 18 or over on the day and are:
If you aren't already on the electoral register and you want to vote, then yes. You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register.
If you voted at last month's UK-wide elections, there is no need to register for the EU referendum unless your name or address have changed since then.
The following are barred from voting in the EU referendum; anyone other than British, Irish, Gibraltarian and qualifying Commonwealth citizens; convicted prisoners; anybody found guilty of electoral fraud within the last five years; people who are subject to any "legal incapacity" which impairs their judgement.
If you live in England, Scotland and Wales, you can register online at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote through the government's gov.uk portal.
If you are eligible to vote and live abroad, register in the same way.
The online service is also available in Welsh.
If you live in Northern Ireland, you will need to register using a different site, found here.
If you are an Irish citizen living overseas who was born in Northern Ireland, you need to go to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website and download the correct form.
Applications to vote must now be submitted by midnight on 9 June, in order to vote in person on 23 June.
Online voter registration has only been around (in England, Scotland and Wales) since 2014, and the deadline for last year's general election - the new system's first major test - passed without any hitches.
Computer glitches are not new to the world of politics however. The deadline to register to vote in Labour's leadership contest was briefly extended in August after technical problems hit the party's website.
You need your National Insurance number and your passport, if you're a British citizen living abroad.
If you don't have a National Insurance number card, (they were axed in 2011) or the letter that replaced them, the number should be on your payslips, or on official letters regarding benefits or tax credits, or on a student loan application.
Once you have registered to vote, there are three ways you can vote in the EU referendum.
You might be registered at two addresses but it is a criminal offence to vote more than once.
If you move between the registration deadline and polling day, the electoral commission recommends you contact your local electoral services office at your local authority for advice. Search for the right one here.
If you're a member of the armed forces, or the spouse or civil partner of someone in the armed forces, you can register to vote as a service voter or as an ordinary voter.
If you're based overseas or expect to be posted abroad it makes sense to register as a service voter. This allows you to be registered at a fixed address in the UK even if you move around.
Service voter registration lasts for five years.
Yes. The Electoral Commission's voting guides come in various formats on their website.
There are also various languages.
People with a disability can get help completing an application, but the person who wants to register to vote has to make the declaration. In England and Wales, a person with the relevant power of attorney can also make this declaration.
The Electoral Commission and Mencap have produced a guide to the EU referendum.
You won't be able to vote.
No, people cannot be forced to vote.
The referendum takes place on Thursday, 23 June 2016, between 07:00 and 22:00 BST.
