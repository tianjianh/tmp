Harvest Moon: Your pictures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Photographers and astronomers around the world have been taking pictures of the Harvest moon, a moon that is bigger and brighter than usual due to its close proximity to earth.

Since this full moon occurs in September it is known as the "harvest moon."  This is because it is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox of 22 September.
It coincided with a minor, penumbral lunar eclipse for many people in Asia and Africa. That won't happen again until 2024.
Here are a selection of pictures from social media users taken in the last 24 hours.
