Andrew Bache, from Portsmouth and known as Pepe, is in a critical condition after Russian fans went on the rampage with iron bars in Marseille.
His brother said his injuries were no longer life-threatening but could be "life-changing".
Friends who launched an appeal to help him have raised more than Â£5,000.
Chief Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Mr Bache had been beaten around the head by Russians armed with iron bars.
He said officials had been unable to stop the Russian troublemakers as they had arrived in the city by train.
UEFA said the behaviour of both England and Russia fans before and after the 1-1 draw was "unacceptable".
A message from Mr Bache's brother, shared on Facebook, read: "He is still in a serious condition and they won't know the extent of his injuries until he is taken out of the induced coma.
"I was told that the chief inspector of the local police has informed them that they have excellent CCTV footage of the attack and have indentified those involved and pictures have been forwarded to French police."
