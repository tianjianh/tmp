Ireland captain Rory Best missed training on Tuesday but is still expected to be fit for Saturday's Six Nations game against Scotland.

Best, 33, was reported to have a tight calf but the Ireland management are confident the hooker will resume training on Thursday.
"The medics feel like he should be fine and ready to go for Thursday," said Ireland's skills coach Richie Murphy.
"He was a little tight in the calf at the end of training yesterday."
Murphy described Best's absence from Tuesday's session as precautionary, although the Ireland captain will need to prove his fitness on Thursday when the team for the Scotland game will be announced.
Simon Zebo looks certain to remain at full-back with Rob Kearney again ruled out by the hamstring injury that forced him to miss the 58-15 win over Italy.
Eoin Reddan and Cian Healy, who also missed the Italy game, will be in contention to feature against the Scots after resuming training this week.
Prop Healy was ruled out against Italy with a hamstring issue while scrum-half Reddan was sidelined with a calf problem.
"Eoin Reddan returned to training on Tuesday. Cian Healy trained Monday and Tuesday as well," added Murphy.
Ireland could well field the same starting XV as against Italy should Best come through his fitness worry, with the return of Leinster duo Healy and Reddan potentially bolstering resources on the bench.
