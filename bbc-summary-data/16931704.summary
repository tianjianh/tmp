[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heseltine, who became known as Minister for Merseyside, lobbied for Merseyside in the wake of the 1981 Toxteth riots.
The 78-year-old said he was "deeply appreciative" of being put forward for the city's highest honour.
Leader of Liverpool City Council Joe Anderson said Lord Heseltine would be a "worthy recipient of the freedom of the city".
Lord Heseltine said: "It has been a rare privilege to have been so closely associated with one of England's great cities for over thirty years.
"To have witnessed the transformation in the city's fortunes over that time is reward enough but I am deeply appreciative of the signal honour that the offer of the Freedom of the City represents."
Mr Anderson said Lord Heseltine had been "a great friend of Liverpool" for many years.
"The renaissance of the city started with the transformation of the Albert Dock and the International Garden Festival which he was largely responsible for bringing about as Minister for Merseyside.
"He has played an important role in the regeneration of Liverpool over the past three decades.
"He has worked with me to push the government hard to win new powers and substantial extra investment for our future regeneration plans which are now set to transform the face of Liverpool."
Labour-run Liverpool City Council will vote on making him a freeman of the city at a meeting to be confirmed in March.
If the council is in agreement, he will officially receive the title at a civic reception in May.
