ScotRail warns of months of disruption to evening trains

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail passengers in Scotland have been warned to expect months of disruption to their journeys as the rail network is upgraded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They have been told that some journey times are likely to be longer on key routes between the central belt, the north and north-east of Scotland.
Some trains operating after the peak evening rush will be cancelled or diverted.
The work is scheduled to begin on 21 May and run until at least September.
But disruption to the line between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh, via Shotts, is likely to continue until work finishes on 7 December.
Queuing systems will also be in operation at key stations, ScotRail added.
The rail firm said the upgrade work was necessary to increase reliability of the rail network.
It will pave the way for "new faster, longer, greener trains" in Scotland, it added.
Jacqueline Taggart, of ScotRail Alliance, said: "No-one likes having their journey changed.
"However, this short-term disruption will lead to a more reliable, better rail network that will rank amongst the very best.
"We are going through a massive period of change on Scotland's railway.
"The work that we are carrying out over the next few months will bring about a revolution in rail - with more and better trains, more services and more seats than ever before.
"However, while we transform the railway, there is inevitably going to be some impact on people's services.
"We are doing everything we can to minimise this, and to keep people moving."
