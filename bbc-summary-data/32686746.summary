The Hartswood Films production beat the likes of EastEnders, Strictly Come Dancing, The Great British Bake Off and Game of Thrones.
But its star, Benedict Cumberbatch, lost out on the best actor prize for a third time.
The honour went instead to Jason Watkins, for his role in The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies.
Backstage at the Sunday night ceremony , Sherlock writer Steven Moffat confirmed three new episodes would be filmed next spring.
