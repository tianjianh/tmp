[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alvaro Morata scored his first goal since returning to Real Madrid as he helped his team beat a stubborn Celta Vigo side and go top of La Liga.

Morata, who rejoined Real in June after a two-year spell at Juventus, finished after Celta Vigo goalkeeper Sergio had parried Marco Asensio's attempted chip.
The visitors quickly equalised through Fabian Orellana's powerful finish.
But Real, who hit the woodwork three times in the match, won it late on with Toni Kroos' composed finish.
The victory maintains Real's winning start to the season after they defeated Sevilla 3-2 in the Uefa Super Cup and Real Sociedad 3-0 in their La Liga opener last weekend.
Barcelona will move above Real Madrid on Sunday if they beat Athletic Bilbao.
Real dominated the game at the Bernabeu but were given a fright by a Celta Vigo side who finished sixth in La Liga last season.
Luka Modric hit the bar from 25 yards, before Gareth Bale's long-range free-kick also hit the woodwork as a Real side, without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, looked to make their dominance count.
Morata, who helped Real win La Liga in 2012 and the Champions League in 2014 during his first spell at the Bernabeu, put the hosts ahead before hitting the post moments later.
Real were ahead for six minutes before Orellana equalised in a rare Celta attack, but Kroos scored only his fourth La Liga goal in his third season at Real to win it.
Despite Ronaldo and Benzema missing through injury, there was still no place in Real's starting line-up for Colombian James Rodriguez.
Rodriguez, who joined Real in 2014 in a transfer that could be worth up to £71m, has failed to start a game this season and was only introduced after 69 minutes with the score at 1-1.
On Friday, Real coach Zinedine Zidane admitted Rodriguez's lack of playing time "could prove a problem" and admitted "some players" could leave the Bernabeu during the transfer window.
Zidane's quotes came after Spanish sports newspaper AS reported that Rodriguez would seek a move from the club if he did not start against Celta.
The transfer window closes on 31 August, with Real next in action on 10 September when they entertain Osasuna.
