Gerard 'Jock' Davison: Funeral held for murdered ex-IRA man

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral has taken place of former senior IRA figure Gerard 'Jock' Davison who was murdered in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 47-year-old was shot a number of times at Welsh Street in the Markets area on Tuesday morning.
A lone piper led the cortege carrying his body, which was draped with an Irish tricolour and a black beret and gloves, through the Markets area before making its way to Milltown Cemetery.
Mr Davison was buried afterwards in the cemetery.
Police have said they do not believe dissident republicans were behind the attack, and did not believe his murder was sectarian.
Three men have been arrested and released in connection with his killing.
It is understood Mr Davison was involved in the fight in a Belfast bar in January 2005 that led to the death of Robert McCartney, one of Northern Ireland's most high profile killings.
Mr Davison's uncle Terence was later acquitted of Mr McCartney's murder.
