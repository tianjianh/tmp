Bristol City Women boss Willie Kirk has signed a new contract with the Women's Super League One club until the end of the 2017-18 winter season.

The former Hibernian Ladies boss became the Vixens' head coach in April 2015.
After relegation to WSL 2 in 2015, Kirk led the club back to the top flight as second-tier runners-up last season.
"It was an easy decision for me to sign in order to bring stability to the club, especially to the squad and my staff," Kirk told the club website.
"When I first arrived we were in WSL 1, but I didn't get a proper crack at it. It was an inherited squad, but it is a lot different this time. It's my squad and I want to put my stamp on it. The club is moving forwards on and off the pitch."
Bristol City begin their 2017 Spring Series campaign at home to Reading at Ashton Gate on Saturday, 22 April.
After the conclusion of the Spring Series - a one-off, transitional competition as the WSL switches to a winter calendar - the next full top-flight campaign will start in September.
