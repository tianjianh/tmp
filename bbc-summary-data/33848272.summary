Spaniel Woody fell from the summit of Pen y Fan on Saturday after chasing a stone thrown by a member of the public.
Brecon Mountain Rescue Team attended after reports of members of the public putting themselves in danger by trying to help the animal.
The dog was stretchered off the mountain after suffering a broken tail and cuts and bruises.
Party leader David Grant said: "Woody was one of the best behaved casualties we have brought off the mountain.
"He was very well behaved, grateful, light to carry and didn't complain once."
