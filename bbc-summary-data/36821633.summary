Marcus Trescothick equalled Somerset's record for the most first-class centuries as the visitors dominated Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

The 40-year-old hit his 49th hundred to move level with Harold Gimblett, and reached stumps on day two unbeaten on 117 with Somerset 244-3 - 157 behind.
Johann Myburgh (54) and Chris Rogers (48) also contributed with the bat.
Earlier, Craig Overton took 4-54, including Steven Mullaney for 165, as Notts fell from 316-4 to 401 all out.
Former England batsman Trescothick, now in his 24th season with Somerset, is enjoying another golden summer in the County Championship having scored 798 runs at an average of 57.
Following three-figure scores against Pakistan and Middlesex in his previous two matches, Trescothick brought up his fourth Championship hundred of 2016 off 122 balls.
He also shared century stands with fellow opener Myburgh and captain Rogers, before Harry Gurney gave the hosts a boost with the wickets of Rogers and James Hildreth late on.
It was a different story for Nottinghamshire's batsmen either side of lunch, as they lost their last six wickets for just 85.
Their collapse was sparked by the dismissal of Mullaney, who could only add four to his overnight 161, before he nicked Overton behind.
After removing Samit Patel cheaply, the Somerset paceman cleaned up the last two batsmen in the space of three balls shortly after the interval to return his best figures of the season.
