The 23-year-old, who is contracted until the summer of 2017, was released by Yeovil following the club's relegation to League Two last season.
He then moved to Norwegian top-flight side Viking FK, but ended his stay in December.
"My main objective here is to get promoted," Moore said.
"It's a great club and I can't wait to get started."
Forest Green sit second in the National League and host Braintree on Saturday.
