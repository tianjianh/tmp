[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 1-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Green was Mansfield's superb sub for the third game in a row as he rescued a 1-1 draw with an 81st-minute leveller to deny Wycombe their first away league win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Bloomfield's 23rd-minute strike looked like winning the game until striker Green, among the substitutes for a fifth consecutive match, levelled after grabbing winners from the bench in the previous two outings.
Pat Hoban might have put the Stags ahead in the 11th minute after being put through by Mitchell Rose, but, having rounded the goalkeeper, Danny Rowe was there to clear off the line.
Wycombe then stepped up the pressure and Dominic Gape forced Scott Shearer to parry a powerful blast.
The visitors went ahead after 23 minutes as Paul Hayes split the defence with a ball down the centre that sent Bloomfield clear for a calm finish from 12 yards.
Stags brought on talisman Green in a double swap at the break and he and Rhys Bennett sent early headers wide.
Mal Benning fizzed a first time 20-yard effort over and forced Jamal Blackman to save another from the same distance.
But Green was the hero nine minutes from time as he hooked in from 10 yards after substitute Darius Henderson had nodded down a Benning free-kick.
