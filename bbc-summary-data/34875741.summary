Eddie Jones has been named as England's first foreign head coach.

The 55-year-old Australian has agreed a four-year deal with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to replace Stuart Lancaster and will start in December.
Jones has confirmed there will be no change to the policy of only selecting home-based players.
"I want players who want to play for England," he said. "If you want to play for England you have to be in the Premiership. I am happy with that."
Jones says he intends to speak with captain Chris Robshaw but is yet to decide who his captain will be.
Jones, who will take his first news conference at 13:00 GMT on Friday, leaves his role as head coach of South African franchise the Stormers - who he only joined in September after leading Japan in the World Cup.
His first match will be England's Six Nations opener against Scotland at Murrayfield on 6 February as he looks to resurrect England's fortunes after their failed World Cup campaign.
"I hope to build a new team that will reflect the talent that exists within the English game. I believe the future is bright for England," Jones said.
"I'm now looking forward to working with the RFU and the players to move beyond the disappointment England suffered at the World Cup."
Jones, who has had success with Japan, South Africa and Australia at World Cups, said: "The opportunity to take the reins in, possibly, the world's most high-profile international rugby job doesn't come along every day, and I feel fortunate to be given the opportunity."
Jones will be among the best paid coaches in world rugby, with RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie adding: "Eddie is a world-class coach, with extensive experience at the highest level with Australia, South Africa and Japan.
"We believe that the appointment, which was unanimously approved by the RFU board, is the right one to bring England success in the short, medium and long term."
Jones is expected to bring former England captain Steve Borthwick on to his coaching team, who he worked with at Saracens and Japan. Borthwick is currently under contract as forwards coach at Bristol.
Former Australia captain David Campese, who played 101 times for the Wallabies, says opting for a foreign coach like Jones, who he feels is no improvement on Lancaster, shows that England are "desperate".
"I don't think they should have stuck with Stuart Lancaster because he's a school teacher. Unfortunately rugby is a professional sport and we don't need school teachers. I think Eddie is one as well," he said.
"Don't you want an Englishman to coach an English team and win the World Cup?"
But former Australian flanker Phil Waugh, who played 79 times for his country, said England would benefit from Jones' taste for experimenting with selections.
"One thing he's very good at is talent identification so he'll pick the best players and work with those guys to get the best out of them," Waugh told BBC Radio 5 live.
"England have suffered from probably being a bit too conservative in selections and not necessarily picking the most attacking and most dangerous players.
"Eddie Jones will roll the dice on those guys and select the ones he thinks will have the most potential to be dangerous in four years' time."
BBC rugby union correspondent Ian Robertson added: "Jones will get it to the stage where the players will do anything for him. England are very lucky to get him."
A hooker in his playing days, Jones never made it beyond the New South Wales representative side.
He gave up a career as a teacher to coach his old club, famous Sydney side Randwick, in 1994. He then spent three years in Japan before returning in 1998 to take charge of Super 12 side ACT Brumbies.
In 2000, Jones' Brumbies finished runners-up in Super 12, before becoming the first team from outside New Zealand to win the tournament in 2001.
He took the Australia job in 2001, winning the Tri Nations in his first season and beating the All Blacks on the way to the 2003 final in Sydney.
Jones was sacked in 2005 after a run of eight defeats in nine games.
He has since had two spells at Premiership club Saracens as a consultant, as well as assistant to the South Africa side that won the World Cup in 2007.
Jones took the Japan job in 2012 and presided over a period of unprecedented success for the 2019 World Cup hosts, including a run of 10 successive wins, a record for a tier two nation, and beating South Africa in Brighton.
He was officially unveiled as Stormers coach 10 days ago before a planned return to Super Rugby. He never took charge for a single game.
BBC rugby union reporter Chris Jones: "His first priority is of course the Six Nations, but before that he needs to start considering the composition of his Elite Player Squad - which will be named in January - and get his head around the unique framework of English rugby.
"Unlike in Australia and Japan, Jones will have to become accustomed to dealing with players who are managed and 'owned' by their Premiership clubs. Building relationships with the directors of rugby - something Stuart Lancaster did well - is of significant importance.
"But unlike the conciliatory Lancaster, Jones will also rattle some cages, and as his recent comments in the media have shown, he is not afraid of speaking his mind, questioning the whole structure of the game in England as well as calling the Six Nations a 'dour' competition.
"Jones' ultimate remit will be a simple one; to deliver a consistently successful England team after twelve years of relative failure. He will need to bring clarity in terms of selection and game plan, and ensure that the richest and most well-resourced rugby-playing country in the world no longer wallows in under-achievement."
