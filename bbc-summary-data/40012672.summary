A scan revealed the defender suffered a tear to his anterior cruciate ligament in Saturday's 4-0 win over Dundee.
A club statement said: "He will deal with our medics on the proposed operation or rehab as appropriate. All at Accies wish him a full recovery."
Hamilton travel to Tannadice for the first leg on Thursday before hosting the return game on Sunday.
"He was out of Sunday anyway because he was suspended, so he was going to miss the second leg regardless," said manager Martin Canning of 23-year-old Devlin.
"It is a blow as he's been great for us all season, but hopefully we can get Georgios Sarris back for Thursday as it would be replacing like for like."
Sarris missed the weekend win over Dundee with a back problem.
Accies' victory ensured that they finished the season one point clear of Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who have been automatically relegated.
Canning is hopeful that Accies can build on that win, which ended a run of four straight defeats.
"It was a very similar performance to the Tuesday night game against Ross County when we didn't get any breaks at all and when we played really well," he added.
"The last two performances have been of a good standard and the pleasing thing about Saturday is there was a lot of pressure on that game.
"So to go and perform that way hopefully bodes well for Thursday, because there'll be a lot of pressure on this game as well.
"Maybe Dundee weren't bang at it as they normally would be because they couldn't go down, but I think United will be.
"So we've got to be careful of falling into the trap of thinking 'we've turned up, beaten Dundee comfortably, the games gone great'.
"It isn't going to be the same on Thursday. It can be if we go and play as well as we have, but we need to win the battles first."
