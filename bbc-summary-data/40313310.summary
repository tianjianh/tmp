[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eighteen suspected illegal immigrants from Iraq, Syria and Iran have been found in the back of an "exceptionally hot" lorry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The people inside waved to catch the attention of passing motorists, who flagged down the driver on the A22 in East Grinstead just before 09:30 BST.
A man and a woman were taken to hospital suffering from dehydration, but later discharged.
The driver was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration.
The 63-year-old driver pulled over in a bus stop close to the junction with Dorset Avenue.
The nearby Trinity Methodist Church was then used as a refuge centre until immigration enforcement officers arrived.
Six people claiming to be children were passed to social services to have their age assessed.
A Home Office spokesman said: "All will be processed in line with immigration rules."
Sgt William Keating-Jones, of Sussex Police, said: "The vehicle was exceptionally hot and it was important we reacted quickly.
"This was a great multi-agency response to a potentially life-threatening situation, with emergency services, immigration officials, volunteers and even local residents all pulling together."
