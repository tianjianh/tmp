[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 1-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford had to settle for a point for the second week running as they lost further ground on the top two with a draw at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bantams dominated but were grateful for Jordy Hiwula's 53rd-minute equaliser after falling behind to Isaiah Osbourne's opener four minutes earlier.
Bradford almost led inside four minutes but Saddlers goalkeeper Neil Etheridge produced a superb instinctive save to tip over Mark Marshall's point-blank strike.
Etheridge also foiled Josh Cullen and Hiwula towards the end of the half but made the pick of his saves two minutes after the interval, clawing Cullen's 20-yarder out of the bottom corner.
And the hosts went in front with their first real chance of the game in the 49th minute, Osbourne drilling the ball into the bottom corner from just inside the box.
Hiwula levelled four minutes later as he was denied by the excellent Etheridge one-on-one but tucked the rebound into a gaping net.
Full-back Jason McCarthy had two chances to win it for Walsall, but his rasping drive was tipped onto the bar by City keeper Colin Doyle and his header from the resulting corner was blocked on the line.
