Election 2015: Lib Dems will insist on public sector pay rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Lib Dems say they would refuse to join a coalition with a party that did not agree to raise public sector pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Clegg will say his party's policy, announced last month, would be a "red line" in post-election negotiations.
The parties are trying to rally support on the final weekend of campaigning.
David Cameron will urge voters to "stop and think" about the "historic choice" facing them on Thursday, while Labour will attempt to put pressure on the other parties over tuition fees.
The two largest parties appear to be neck and neck according to most of the opinion polls carried out for the Sunday newspapers.
This suggests a hung parliament is likely, and the Lib Dems have been setting out their "red lines" - with public sector pay joining education spending, a £12,500 personal allowance, £8bn for the NHS and an emergency "stability budget".
Mr Clegg has already said his opposition to an EU referendum - as proposed by the Conservatives and UKIP - will not be a red line.
He has also said he would talk to the largest party first if there is a hung parliament, and that he would not join a government that relied on support from the SNP or UKIP.
His final policy demand involves public sector pay rising with inflation for two years from 2016, and then by more than inflation once the deficit has been dealt with.
What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Public sector pay was frozen for the first two years of the coalition government, followed by 1% rises. Schools have been given the power to award top-performing teachers a rise of up to 2%.
The Conservatives plan to continue "restraining" public sector pay, which was increased by up to 1% in March.
Labour's manifesto says any decisions on public sector pay in the next Parliament must "prioritise those on lower incomes", be evidence based and respect pay review body recommendations.
Mr Clegg will say it is time to offer public servants "some light at the end of the tunnel".
He will add: "Liberal Democrats will not enter a coalition with a party not prepared to back pay rises for people working in the public sector.
"They have paid more than their fair share, and now enough is enough."
His party has sought to portray itself as the centre-ground "anchor" of a future coalition.
Mr Clegg also told the Independent on Sunday he would not allow his party to "split" as a result of pressure to go into coalition, saying this would be a "disaster".
Mr Cameron, meanwhile, will urge people not to vote tactically for the Lib Dems or back UKIP if they want him to remain in Downing Street.
He will say a vote for UKIP would let in Labour, which would herald a "sharp turn to the left" and that the Lib Dems would also be willing to side with Ed Miliband's party.
"As you spend time with your family and friends, I'd urge all voters to take a moment and stop and think about the decision they have to make in just four days' time," he will say.
"It's no exaggeration to say Britain will be making an historic choice."
Labour, meanwhile, will claim Conservative plans for spending cuts suggest a rise in tuition fees up to £11,500 a year.
The party said this was based on a £1.5bn cut to the higher education budget by 2018-19.
