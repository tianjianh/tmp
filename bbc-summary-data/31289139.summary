[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Stafford Hospital emergency and inpatient surgery moved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emergency surgery and operations requiring an overnight stay have moved from the former Stafford Hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In November, Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which ran what is now known as County Hospital, was dissolved after a Â£6m inquiry into care failings.
Surgical services and cancer referrals have been transferred to The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust (RWT) and Royal Stoke University Hospital.
Inpatient gynaecological, general and emergency surgery have been moved.
The former Stafford Hospital became part of University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust (UHNM) and Cannock Chase Hospital joined RWT.
Patients would be re-allocated to consultants at either of the two hospitals and given the choice of where they would like their surgery or care to take place, the Wolverhampton trust has said.
