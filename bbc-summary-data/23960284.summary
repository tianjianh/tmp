About the price of football calculator

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Here's how the BBC's 2014 Price of Football calculator and survey were compiled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The calculator works by adding up your costs for tickets, food and programmes and multiplying them across the season.
This season we have also compiled data on replica shirt prices, sourced from the clubs.
Because there is such a great variation in ticket prices between and within clubs, this figure is intended to give a general indication only.
Choosing 'season ticket' assumes that the holder buys the cheapest season ticket, and attends every home game in that league during the season, spending the same amount on food and drink per game.
Cup ties and play-off games are not included in the calculation.
The comparison of ticket costs between clubs works best if you enter realistic figures.
To provide a comparison at the end, we show how the price of the cheapest season tickets vary within your club's league.
Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football surveys.
Some data comparisons are not available for clubs which were not included in previous years.
The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season.
Comparisons are not available for clubs which were not surveyed last season, or promoted to the Conference in 2014 (Altrincham, Dover, Eastleigh and Telford) or which do not operate traditional season tickets (Barnet).
Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as British teams.
Some women's teams did not provide costs for a replica shirt; in these cases the calculator uses the equivalent price for a replica men's shirt.
The BBC contacted 207 clubs for the study. Of those, 176 were in England, Scotland and Wales and another 31 in Europe.
We recorded the prices for the most expensive, and cheapest, season tickets and adult match-day tickets as well as the cost of a cup of tea, a pie, a programme and an adult replica shirt.
The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists.
Rangers FC are omitted from the survey and calculator because they did not provide data to the BBC.
