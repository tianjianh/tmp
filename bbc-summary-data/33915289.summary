[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford says not having a union jack on Great Britain's World Championships kit is a "terrible choice".

The Briton, 28, tweeted a picture of his vest for the championships in Beijing, showing a British Athletics logo instead of the union jack flag.
Scot Eilish McColgan replied by saying "it looks like you're representing British Athletics instead of GB".
Rutherford agreed with the steeplechase star and said the change was "stupid".
McColgan, 24, added: "It's unfair for athletes not supported by UK Athletics to have to wear it. It doesn't make any sense. Bring back the flag."
She told BBC Radio 5 live: I think it's a little bit disappointing to see the flag is absent from the kit. Don't get me wrong I would quite happily compete in a bin bag if it meant representing Great Britain in the World Championships."
"I think it's just a shame that it's been replaced by a company logo and a British Athletics logo."
Paralympian shot putter Sam Ruddock joined the debate by saying: "The flag says so much, to so many people, more than a brand ever could."
Rutherford responded with: "Exactly. I'm proud to be British. This is a terrible choice."
The World Championships in Beijing start on 22 August and Britain are sending a 63-strong team captained by European 400m champion Martyn Rooney.
Team-mate and hurdler Cindy Ofili said she was "excited" to get her first British kit since being deemed eligible to represent Great Britain, posting a picture of training clothing that features several union jack flags.
British Athletics is the brand under which UK Athletics markets the sport.
In a statement, it said the union jack "remains an integral part" of the kit and that the inclusion of the British Athletics brand is to "help create a strong team identity" similar to that created by Team GB for London 2012.
