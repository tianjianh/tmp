The 75-year-old died of natural causes on Sunday after a short illness.
The character Sid arrived on the show as a young tearaway from Birmingham on 30 September 1963 and remained in the drama until his death in 2010.
Editor Sean O'Connor said Devereux's voice was "instantly recognisable and full of rich character".
"As an actor Alan was adept at both intense drama as well as dead-pan comedy. He was a wonderful member of The Archers' family," he added.
Former editor Vanessa Whitburn said: "Alan was a consummate and brilliant radio actor.
"Always a delight to work with, his versatility as publican Sid Perks meant that he created superb partnerships with the actresses who played all three of his wives.
"A modest man, I don't think he knew just how talented he was."
Fellow actor Trevor Harrison, who plays Eddie Grundy on the drama, told the BBC Devereux was a "lovely, sensitive man".
"I was privileged to know him both professionally and socially," he said.
"He had a natural gift for acting and was very talented. He was a wonderful Sid Perks and will always be remembered as a part of Ambridge [the fictional location of the show]."
Devereux leaves behind his son and daughter, Tracy Jane White, who played his on-air daughter Lucy for more than a decade.
The character Sid, a borstal boy, first appeared in the show as a guest at the Grey Gables Country Club, and went on to become the landlord of The Bull pub in 1972.
Buffy Davis, who plays Jolene, starred alongside Devereux in the controversial "sex in the shower" scene in 2000 before becoming the publican's third wife.
She told the BBC Radio 4 website: "Alan was a one-off, there was no one like him. He possessed a wicked sense of humour and was uniquely talented, I loved him."
