Jersey introduces mandatory helmets for cyclists under 14

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cyclists in Jersey under the age of 14 will be forced to wear helmets, after a vote by politicians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
States members voted in favour of the law change brought by transport minister Deputy Kevin Lewis.
People failing to wear helmets could face a fine of up to Â£50, although Deputy Lewis said this was unlikely.
He said the legislation would be "sensibly enforced" so children failing to wear helmets could be dealt with by the parish hall or a warning.
Asked why he did not increase the minimum age to 16, as recommended by the environment scrutiny panel, Deputy Lewis said: "The limit was negotiated by my predecessor.
"It is my wish and desire that once young people get into the habit of wearing a cycle helmet for a number of years, they would wish not to take them off later on."
Previous attempts to make helmets compulsory for all cyclists have been rejected.
