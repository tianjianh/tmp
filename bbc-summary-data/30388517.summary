QPR have denied Steven Caulker was involved in an altercation and say he was taken to hospital after cutting his head during a lunch with team-mates.

Rangers say the defender slipped over during the squad get-together the day after Saturday's 2-0 win over Burnley.
The Sun claimed Caulker was injured after a fight broke out at a pub that Crystal Palace players were also at.
But QPR's head of communications Ian Taylor insisted: "Steven Caulker was not involved in an altercation."
Taylor added: "He suffered a cut to his head, which he received treatment for at hospital before being discharged the same evening."
Taylor also explained that players had been given permission to have Sunday lunch together given QPR's next game against Everton was not until Monday, 15 December.
QPR owner Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to comment on the claims.
"Steven Caulker slipped over and hurt his head and is fine," wrote Fernandes. "Nothing else to report."
Former Tottenham and Cardiff centre-back Caulker, who has one England cap, has made 15 appearances this season, scoring once.
