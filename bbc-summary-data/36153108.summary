The 22-year-old joined the Super League side on an 18-month deal last June and helped the Yorkshire club retain their top-flight status.
He has scored three tries in 12 Super League appearances this season.
"I had a slow start to the year, but once (coach) Chris Chester came into the club I found my groove again," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
