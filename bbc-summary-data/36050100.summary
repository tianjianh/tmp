Sam Allardyce: Sunderland relegation worse for club than me

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce says Premier League relegation would damage the club more than his own career.

Allardyce, 61, is in charge of his fifth top-flight team but has never been relegated.
The Black Cats are third-bottom of the table, four points behind Saturday's opponents Norwich with a game in hand.
"If I had that one relegation against my career from the Premier League it would hurt, but it's more important for the club than me," said Allardyce.
When Allardyce replaced Dick Advocaat in October 2015, Sunderland - last relegated in 2006 - were second bottom and without a win from their opening eight games.
They face Norwich at Carrow Road having taken only four points from the past six games.
"It would hurt immensely if the club got relegated, for the club's sake first, not mine. I've had a fantastic career," added Allardyce.
"My career will take whatever way and whatever form it needs to take.
"The players - most of them - will never get a club better than this, with its facilities and its supporters, playing in the top league in the world, and they really need to realise that.
"That's their big challenge in the next six games."
