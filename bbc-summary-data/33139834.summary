South Wales Police are looking for Arnel Martinez Raymundo, 47, in connection with the attack of a 43-year-old woman from Grangetown.
After the attack, he walked in to the car park between Wyndham Crescent and Severn Road in Canton at about 11:05 BST Friday.
He removed his dark, long-sleeved top and threw it away before leaving.
Police said he was also wearing dark trousers and flip flops at the time.
Det Insp Wendy Gunney said: "We are keeping an open mind as to where he went after this. He may have continued on foot, taken public transport or left in another vehicle."
