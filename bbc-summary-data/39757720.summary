Celtic should have scored more goals - Brendan Rodgers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Brendan Rodgers thinks Celtic should have been more ruthless in front of goal after beating Rangers 5-1 for the second time this season.

Scott Sinclair and Leigh Griffiths scored in the first half.
Callum McGregor, Dedryck Boyata and Mikael Lustig struck after the break as the champions picked up their biggest victory at Ibrox.
"It was a very comprehensive win," said Rodgers. "The only disappointment is that we should have scored more goals."
Celtic's unbeaten domestic run now stretches to 42 games, with four league games and the Scottish Cup final remaining.
In six Old Firm derbies this season, Celtic have won five, with the aggregate score 16-4 in their favour.
Rodgers' first experience of the fixture ended in the same scoreline at Celtic Park in September but he was much more satisfied with this display as they moved 36 points clear of Rangers in third place.
"What I look for is improvement in performance, and from the first 5-1 to today's 5-1 there's a totally different dynamic to the team," he added.
"I said when I came in my job was to build a team who could go into any stadium without fear and play.
"Obviously this is one of the great rivals for Celtic, so for us to come here and show that was pleasing.
"We had a couple of moments, like the goal at the end, which typify it.
"Our defenders defend forward. They are aggressive, step in, and that's where the fifth goal comes from, with Mika [Lustig] winning it and then scoring like a winger or centre forward.
"But you have to earn the right. Fundamentally in any game you have to defend, and how I like my team to defend is with that aggression and high level of pressing, and the players did it right the way through.
"From the first to the last minute their physicality in the game was top class.
"Rangers started off with a diamond and if you're not concentrated, not organised, you can get outnumbered and outpassed. But the players tactically were absolutely superb in the game.
"So yeah, a big difference in terms of the 5-1 at the beginning of the season to the 5-1 today."
