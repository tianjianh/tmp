[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford Bulls' future has been secured after the administrators confirmed the Super League club has been sold to Omar Khan's consortium.

The Bulls had been in administration since June and were facing liquidation.
But administrator Brendan Guilfoyle said in a statement that he had sold Bradford Bulls Holdings Limited to OK Bulls Limited for an undisclosed sum.
The Rugby Football League will not ratify the takeover until next week, but that is expected to be a formality.
The Bradford restaurant owner's consortium, which included Bradford South MP Gerry Sutcliffe, and Bradford Park Avenue were confirmed as front runners to buy the Bulls by the Rugby Football League.
And a total of four bids were placed for the Bulls, including one from Super League (Europe) Ltd which was considered a last resort.
My main duty as administrator is to get the best return for creditors - and this was the best deal on the table
"This is a great achievement for Bradford Bulls, the players, fans and the city of Bradford," said Guilfoyle.
"My main duty as administrator is to get the best return for creditors - and this was the best deal on the table.
"Omar Khan has also passed the Rugby Football League's test as being a 'fit and proper person' to run a rugby club as well as being a passionate fan of the Bulls."
Despite being deducted six points for entering administration, the Bulls remain in the Super League play-off places with two matches remaining after a run of three straight wins.
Guilfoyle added: "I am really pleased that we were able to retain the playing squad without selling off young stars - which in the end was a crucial decision to achieve the sale.
"There are many people to thank in making this deal possible, not least employees, coaches and the interim chief executive who have all been working without pay.
"But I'm sure they would join me in saying the fans' support has been outstanding and they have played a major part in this rescue.
"And through all this the players have won an extraordinary string of matches."
