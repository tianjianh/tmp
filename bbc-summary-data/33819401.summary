No move to keep G-Joey aircraft in Channel Islands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No official approaches for a "retirement home" for the Channel Islands' most famous aircraft have been made locally, Aurigny has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
G-Joey, a yellow trislander, flew for the last time in June having served the Channel Islands, Southampton and Dinard for nearly 40 years.
Euan Mahy, Aurigny's media relations manager, said "a number of aviation museums in England" were interested.
He said it was important that wherever it was housed it had the "proper care".
Mr Mahy said: "We would want the aircraft to be housed and displayed inside to preserve its airframe and fittings.
"We are negotiating with one specific enterprise, but it is too early to release any further details. That will be done jointly, at a later date."
