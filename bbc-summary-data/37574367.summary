Arsene Wenger: Robert Pires says Arsenal boss & England 'a good combination'

Former Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires believes Gunners boss Arsene Wenger would be a good fit for the England manager's job, but hopes the Frenchman stays beyond the end of the season.

Wenger, 66, has just celebrated his 20th anniversary at the London club.
"I hope this is not the last season. Arsenal need a longer time with Wenger," said Pires, 42.
"But if he wants to work with the national team it would be a very good combination."
Frenchman Wenger is the longest-serving - and most successful - overseas manager in England, having won 15 trophies, including three Premier League titles and six FA Cups.
Pires, who played for Arsenal from 2000 to 2006, said the "challenge" of a new role would appeal to his compatriot.
The former France international - speaking at the launch of Star Sixes, a six-a-side tournament featuring former players such as Carlos Puyol and Deco - also backed Arsenal to challenge for the Premier League title.
"I believe in the squad because I still train with the team and know all the guys," he said.
