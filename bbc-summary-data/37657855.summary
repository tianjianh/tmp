Farmers using food banks after government payment delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hill farmers have had to use food banks following the government's failure to pay more than a thousand commoners their EU subsidies, the BBC has learnt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rural Payments Agency is still reviewing the 2015 basic payment claims for 1,200 people living on common land.
One couple with two young children said they had defaulted on their rent and were "living off a credit card".
The RPA, the government body that pays farmers' EU subsidies, said it would resolve any issues as soon as possible.
More on the farmers using food banks, and other news
The BBC understands the issue has arisen from the digital re-mapping of all common land in England to calculate the 2015 BPS payments.
The family, who told the BBC they had been unable to pay their rent, farm 200 acres on the North York Moors.
The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: "In June we had to sell 40 ewes with lambs and this autumn we've sold more female lambs to pay the animals feed bills after our credit ran out.
"We are now are using a credit card to buy food."
The subsidy they have not received, the basic payment, makes up 90% of their farm income.
Julia Aglionby, from the Foundation for Common Land, said: "We are getting increasing numbers of hardship cases as people do not know where to turn.
"It's a catalogue of errors by the RPA."
The charity Farming Community Network said it was issuing food bank vouchers to those with serious cash flow problems.
Mary Alford, who farms on Dartmoor in Devon, said she was still waiting for a third of her payment.
"I can't do a cash flow, the deadlines are constantly being broken and no one is accountable," she said.
The European Commission has not commented on the delay in payments.
