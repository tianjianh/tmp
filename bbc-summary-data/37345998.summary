[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everton 0-2 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich reached the fourth round of the EFL Cup with an impressive victory at in-form Everton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Naismith gave the visitors the lead against his former club with a fortuitous finish that looped in after the striker slipped while shooting.
City's Alex Pritchard cleared an Enner Valencia shot off the line before Josh Murphy scored a decisive second with a superb rising drive from distance.
The defeat is Ronald Koeman's first as Everton manager.
The Dutchman made six changes to the team that beat Middlesbrough 3-1 at the weekend to take the Toffees up to second in the Premier League, but his starting XI still had plenty of ability and experience.
Only Robbie Brady remained from the Norwich team that beat Nottingham Forest at the weekend, and they were forced on the back foot for much of the game.
However, while the Toffees wasted the chances that came their way Norwich seized theirs, be it through a slice of luck - in the case of Naismith - or via the superb execution of Murphy.
The Canaries' victory is their first at Goodison Park since September 1993, when Efan Ekoku scored four times in a 5-1 win.
The result was also a measure of revenge for Alex Neil's team, who were beaten on penalties at Goodison Park in the fourth round of this competition last season.
Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "Of course I'm not happy about the result, because in cup football you don't get a second chance, but we did everything to score.
"Norwich had a bit of luck for their first and we did not have that luck.
"We're happy with the league but disappointed with this. From tomorrow we need to prepare for Bournemouth. It's no reason to stay down."
Norwich manager Alex Neil: "To a man, everyone was fantastic. They gave everything.
"We wanted to win the game. We came with a method which the players carried out perfectly."
