Robin Garton: New appeal after walking poles found

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the disappearance of Robin Garton have made a new appeal for information following the discovery of walking poles in Glen Coe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Garton, 69, from Devizes in Wiltshire, disappeared on 25 September on a hillwalking trip in the area.
Despite extensive searches involving helicopters, divers and search dogs, there has been no trace of him.
The poles were recovered near Aonach Eagach Ridge, but a subsequent search of the area revealed nothing.
Police Scotland said the poles were Lecki telescopic trekking/walking poles in a black and gold colour.
Officers said they would like to hear from anyone else who may have lost poles on the ridge, a prominent feature in Glen Coe.
Mr Garton's family are also helping the police establish if they were his.
Robin Garton was reported missing after he failed to meet up with friends as planned in Kinlochewe in Wester Ross.
A memorial service has been planned by Mr Garton's family. It will be held at St Johns Church, Devizes in December.
