The Perth man is accused of running the alleged paedophile ring involving men he knew, aged 35 to 47.
The girl suffered the alleged abuse over two-years before being saved after a tip-off from the public in April.
"She was rescued from this horrible situation... and is safe," Detective Superintendent Glenn Feeney said.
Police seized several computer storage devices which allegedly contained 149 videos of the girl.
"To give an idea of the scope, one of these storage devices contained 200,000 videos and four million photos," Det Superintendent Feeney said. "It's disgusting material. There's no words to describe it."
The eight men have been charged with a range of offences including sexual penetration of a child, sexual servitude, stupefaction of a child, and child pornography offences.
