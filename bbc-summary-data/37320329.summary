The doctor attacked the 21-year-old woman in the secluded intensive care unit of the hospital in Ahmadabad on Sunday, police said.
Another worker of the hospital has also been arrested for allegedly helping the doctor carry out the crime.
Police said the doctor gave the patient strong drugs to make her unconscious, before sexually assaulting her.
The Apollo Hospital said it was "fully co-operating with the police".
"Since the investigations are [ongoing], we would not like to comment on the incident," the NDTV website quoted Sandeep Joshi, an official at Apollo Hospital, as saying.
The doctor is a Pakistani national who has been working in India on a long-term visa since last year, NDTV reported.
Rape and gender crimes have been in the spotlight in India in recent years after the brutal gang rape and murder of a student in 2012 in Delhi.
In response, tough new anti-rape laws were introduced in the country.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country .
