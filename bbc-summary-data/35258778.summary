Both men and women are now being told it is best not to consume any more than 14 units a week, which is around six pints of beer, and those should be spread over three days.
But science shows that even then there is still some risk of developing alcohol related illnesses.
Pregnant women are also now being advised not to drink at all.
The guidance, issued by the UK's chief medical officers, marks the first full review of alcohol guidelines since 1995.
Dr Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, said: "Many people drink alcohol, and most do so in ways that do not significantly put them at risk of alcohol-related harm, but new evidence has emerged on the potential risks and benefits from alcohol consumption.
"That is why over the past two years, my colleagues and I have been working to produce revised alcohol guidelines.
"Informed by a number of expert panels, we have looked at the medical and clinical evidence, as well as the evidence around how such guidance affects behaviour.
"Individuals will make their own judgements as to risks they are willing to accept from alcohol, whether to drink alcohol, and how much and how often to drink. These guidelines should help people to make informed choices."
Dr Tom Black, of the British Medical Association, said people drinking more alcohol than in the past had become the "norm".
"The main problem nowadays isn't the problem drinkers, the alcoholics, as such," he said.
"It's the middle-class or retired people drinking a lot of wine or spirits and doing it on a chronic, daily basis.
"The result is we're seeing a lot of liver disease [and] a lot of other diseases tied into it - physical, psychological and social problems."
Addiction NI, a charity helping those with alcohol and drugs problems, said there was a need for society to "change our relationship with alcohol".
"There is a need for a major alcohol awareness campaign to help people understand alcohol," Thelma Abernethy, the charity's chief, said.
"We have legalised it, normalised it and include it as part of our weekly grocery shop, but yet do not realise that it's the world's most powerful drug, which can have a negative impact on individuals families and communities."
In a statement, the Campaign for Real Ale consumer group, said: "The best kind of health advice is that based on clear and undisputed evidence.
"We are uncertain whether there is sufficient agreement among experts to support these new guidelines."
