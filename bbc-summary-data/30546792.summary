Miss World beauty pageant gets rid of the swimwear round

Love it or hate it, the Miss World swimsuit round is no more.

The contest's chairwoman, Julia Morley, says it won't be included in next year's competition as organisers shift focus from physical beauty to "brains and personality".
In an interview with Elle Magazine, she explains: "I don't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis.
"It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn't do anything for any of us."
The competition was set up as the Festival Bikini Contest in 1951 by Julia Morley's late husband Eric.
The following year, some countries threatened to pull out of the pageant over objections to putting women on stage in bikinis.
The swimsuit round was then made a single part of the competition.
Winners were crowned in a gown and interviews were brought in.
In 1974, Julia Morley introduced "Beauty with a Purpose", the service element of the competition which has helped raise more than Â£600m for charity.
But in the last few years, organisers say they have started to find the bikini round old-fashioned and unnecessary and that section of the contest hasn't been broadcast.
Instead contestants have been judged privately in front of a small panel.
The 74-year-old says: "I don't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's.
"We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.
"We don't want to just make them feel like they are walking bodies."
Last Sunday, Rolene Strauss from South Africa was crowned the 64th Miss World winner in London.
