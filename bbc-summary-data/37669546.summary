Jason Marr scored the only goal of the game as Alloa displaced Brechin at the top of League One.
Albion Rovers won at Livingston, Stranraer hammered Stenhousemuir and Peterhead beat Aidrieonians as four of the day's five matches ended in wins for the away side.
Queen's Park bucked the trend with a 1-0 home victory over East Fife.
Goodwin replaced Jack Ross - who left to take over at St Mirren - as Alloa boss this week, and after one match in charge he finds his team top of the table.
Marr headed home from a free-kick delivery midway through the second period to seal the points - and top spot - for the visitors.
Livingston missed the opportunity to go top after slumping to a 2-1 home defeat to Albion Rovers.
Goals from Stevie Boyd and Ryan Wallace put Albion in control, and although Liam Buchanan reduced the arrears with a late penalty, the visitors held on for the win that moves them up to fourth.
Gregor Fotheringham's goal proved decisive as Queen's Park secured a 1-0 victory over East Fife at Hampden.
Peterhead won at Airdrieonians despite being behind up until the 66th minute following Iain Russell's opener.
Two goals in a minute from Fiacre Kelleher and Rory McAllister turned the game on its head, and Leighton McIntosh's injury time goal sealed it for the Blue Toon, who move off the bottom of the table.
Stranraer had six shots on target against Stenhousemuir, and scored five of them.
William Gibson started the rout, before two goals in five minutes from Kyle Turner and Craig Malcolm gave them a comfortable half-time lead.
Christian Nade found the top corner just six minutes after coming off the bench, and two minutes later Malcolm grabbed a second as Stenny slumped to the bottom of the league table.
