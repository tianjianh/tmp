Transfer deadline day: Confirmed deals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The January transfer window has closed in England and Scotland after a hectic final few hours of business.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The most expensive incoming transfer was Southampton's £14m signing of Italy striker Manolo Gabbiadini from Napoli, while Crystal Palace agreed a loan deal for Liverpool and France defender Mamadou Sakho very late on.
Elsewhere, Burnley broke their transfer record to sign Republic of Ireland winger Robbie Brady from Norwich, while Odion Ighalo was the major exit, joining Chinese Super League club Changchun Yatai for £20m from Watford.
See below for a full list of the deadline-day deals and see every Premier League move on the transfer wall here.
Signings announced in December, some of which only went through once the window opened, can be found here.
