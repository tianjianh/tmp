The three main indexes drifted lower early in the day, but reversed course after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen hinted that rates could rise as early as next month.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,337.5 for its sixth straight day of gains.
The Dow Jones rose 0.5% to 20,504.4, while the Nasdaq rose 0.3%, to 5,782.5.
Banks, expected to gain from higher interest rates, were among the main gainers. Goldman Sachs rose 1.29% and Bank of America added 2.82%.
General Motors jumped 4.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 following news that France's PSA Group, maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars, is exploring a deal to buy Opel, GM's money-losing European business.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with the healthcare segment adding 0.73%.
Apple rose as high as $135.09, an intraday record, before ending with a gain of 1.30% at $135.02, its highest-ever closing price.
