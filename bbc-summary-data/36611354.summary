Hoban joined the U's from Irish side Dundalk in November 2014, but scored only six goals in 53 games.
The 24-year-old had spells on loan with Stevenage and Grimsby Town last season, but failed to find the net in 13 combined appearances for the two clubs.
"His hold up-play and link-up play is exceptional for this level," Stags manager Adam Murray said.
"He is someone who will help us keep the ball in the final third for longer periods and bring our other attacking players into play."
