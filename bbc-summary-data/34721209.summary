Owens, 21, scored nine tries in 18 games for the Vikings last season but was allowed to depart by head coach Denis Betts.
He crossed for 30 scores in 87 games during five years as a professional at Widnes, and is also a kicker with 122 goals to his name.
"Jack is an experienced player," Saints coach Keiron Cunningham said.
"He plays in a number of positions and will add depth to our squad for 2016.
"He has a good attitude and is keen to learn and develop."
