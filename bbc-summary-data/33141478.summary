Posters which described the cat, Murray, as "aggressive" and urged its owner to have him neutered were spotted in Clifton village, Bristol.
Murray's owner said he was a rescue cat from the RSPCA and was already neutered. Murray later returned home but was said to be "timid".
The RSPCA said it took "threats aimed at animals very seriously".
The owner said he was shocked as the cat looked "terrified". After returning home Murray was "off his food".
The posters, put up in the York Place area of Clifton, stated: "If this is your cat please do the right thing and have him neutered...
"No harm has come to this cat; however the cat trap will continue to be set to try to deter him."
An RSPCA spokesperson said if anyone caused "unnecessary suffering to someone's pet, they can face a fine of up to Â£20,000 or up to six months in prison".
