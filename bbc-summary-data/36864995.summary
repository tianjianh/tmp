Harri Jones suffered a fractured skull and cheekbone, has lost sight in one eye and has been placed in a medically induced coma for at least 10 days.
Doctors believe the 18-year-old's condition is not life-threatening.
The accident happened in Kavos on Wednesday - the first night of his first holiday abroad with friends.
Mr Jones, who works at a hotel, was wearing a helmet and had insurance but it did not cover riding quad bikes.
His family have flown to Kavos to be with him.
"They were riding the quads and there's not many road signs like there is here," said friend Shane Tarpey, who is back home in the UK.
"Harri didn't really know they were coming up to a junction and went straight into the road and into the lorry.
"He's fractured his skull and cheekbone and lost the sight in one of his eyes.
"He's in a stable condition and the injuries shouldn't be life-threatening but he's going to be in a coma for about 10 to 20 days.
"I'm keeping in touch with people out there for updates."
Mr Tarpey said more than Â£10,000 has been raised in two days to help cover medical expenses and added the support has been "absolutely incredible".
