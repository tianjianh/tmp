Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has apologised to residents of the northern city of Chandigarh for inconvenience caused to them by his visit.

Officials shut down schools and a public crematorium ahead of Mr Modi's visit on Friday to inaugurate a new airport.
Mr Modi tweeted that the inconvenience to residents was "totally avoidable" and said an inquiry would be held.
The measures were heavily criticised on mainstream and social media.
Local media was full of accounts of people whose daily routines had been disrupted by Mr Modi's visit.
The NDTV news channel spoke to a number of bereaved people who had been forced to use another crematorium in the western part of the city, after Chandigarh's main crematorium was converted into a temporary parking space for a public rally addressed by the prime minister.
Many schools and colleges reportedly had to cancel or postpone examinations after state officials announced that all educational institutes in the city would be closed.
Several politicians from the opposition Congress party who had been planning to greet Mr Modi were also pre-emptively detained, causing further outrage.
The Stateman newspaper asked whether the prime minister's visit was "above education, deaths and freedom".
Similar angry reactions were seen across social media. Journalist Rajdeep Sardesai tweeted: "Why are all schools, even crematorium in Chandigarh closed for PM visit to city? All oppn leaders detained/house arrest? Any answers?"
A parody account called India Explained noted that "GOI sternly warns those planning to die in Chandigarh today not to engage in such anti-national activities".
