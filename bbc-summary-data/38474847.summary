[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mat Sadler's late header prevented Shrewsbury Town slumping to a fourth successive defeat as they came from behind to draw at Swindon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams were reduced to 10 men in the second half at the County Ground, referee Nigel Miller sending off Shrewsbury debutant Aristote Nsiala before then later red-carding Robins midfielder James Brophy.
The game came to life in the 51st minute when Swindon's Luke Norris found himself facing an empty net before being fouled in the area by defender Nsiala, which led to a straight red card.
John Goddard stepped up to rifle the penalty past goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler, who dived the right way but could not prevent the ball rippling the back of the net.
Brophy was then given his marching orders in the 70th minute, picking up a second yellow card for a challenge on Freddie Ladapo.
Sadler claimed a dramatic equaliser in the 80th minute when his header bounced down off of the underside of the crossbar before the linesman waved his flag to signal it had crossed the line.
Town's first away point in three matches lifted them out of the relegation zone for the first time since Paul Hurst took charge, having been in the bottom four for the last four months.
