[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-1 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First-half goals from Ollie Clarke and Rory Gaffney were enough to earn Bristol Rovers victory over relegation-threatened Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side went in front inside the first minute as Clarke lashed home a low left-foot shot from the edge of the box after Chesterfield failed to clear a Lee Brown cross.
Gaffney doubled the advantage in the 18th minute with a clinical low finish, having been put in on goal by good work from Luke James.
James had the chance to net his first Rovers goal late in the first half when pushed by Tom Anderson inside the box, but his penalty was too straight and impressive Chesterfield goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann stuck out a strong left hand to save.
The visitors improved after the break and were rewarded when Sylvan Ebanks-Blake pulled a goal back in the 85th minute with a curling right-foot effort from the left side of the box.
But Rovers were never seriously threatened and it took a fine save from Stuckmann to stop Chris Lines adding a third for Rovers in stoppage time.
