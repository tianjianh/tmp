The programme features Sellers and many contemporaries who later became household names after performing in Gang Shows for World War Two service personnel.
It was lost from BBC archives but a copy was found during the making of a radio documentary on Sellers' career.
The show's producer, Chris Menaul, recalled it being "well received".
The two-part documentary, Showman, about impresario Ralph Reader was made by BBC Bristol in 1976.
Reader was best known for creating the Gang Shows for the Boy Scouts in the 1930s, and, later, wartime service personnel - which gave Sellers and other future stars, including Dick Emery and Tony Hancock, an early taste of showbusiness.
Sellers travelled the world performing with the Gang Shows during the war after he was deemed unable to fly with the RAF due to poor eyesight.
Mr Menaul recalled how Sellers agreed to do the commentary at the last minute.
"He was quite difficult to get hold of - he was quite a big star at the time.
"We recorded the voice track sitting on his double bed in his flat in Victoria," he said.
The recording had disappeared from the BBC archives but BBC Radio Solent producer Richard Latto tracked down a copy on old Philips 1700 video format owned by a current Scouts Gang Show producer in Edinburgh.
Mr Latto said: "It is rare in that it is Sellers as himself - playing it straight and not putting on his voices or characters."
In the programme, Sellers recalls how "a sizeable proportion of an entire generation of entertainers cut their teeth on the wartime Gang Shows".
Audio of the programme features in a BBC Radio Solent documentary, presented by his daughter Sarah Sellers, to mark the 35th anniversary of his death in 1980.
Ms Sellers said: "When I see my father performing, I don't think of him as doing impersonations. He really becomes a character, and he was very sensitive to what made people tick."
Sellers, who was born in Southsea, Hampshire in 1925, went on to star in the Goon Show and the Pink Panther movies.
Peter Sellers: From Southsea to Stardom is on BBC Radio Solent on Saturday, 25 July at 14:00 BST, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.
