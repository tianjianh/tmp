[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 3-1 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Erhun Oztumer's glorious free-kick and a Simeon Jackson double handed League One new boys AFC Wimbledon a rude awakening as they slipped to an opening-day defeat at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oztumer - a summer signing from Peterborough - crashed in a 25-yard free-kick off the post to put Walsall ahead just seven minutes in after fellow new boy Jackson was fouled by Chris Whelpdale.
Whelpdale should have levelled on 28 minutes when he smartly turned Saddlers defender James O'Connor but scuffed wide from 10 yards.
A double save from Walsall keeper Neil Etheridge kept the hosts in front, blocking from first Lyle Taylor and then Andy Barcham as Wimbledon went close.
But the Saddlers doubled their lead on 38 minutes as the Dons' defence made a hash of dealing with a floated Oztumer free-kick and Jackson bundled home from close range.
Walsall put the game to bed on 72 minutes when Jackson tucked home substitute Amadou Bakayoko's cross on the volley from close range.
Wimbledon claimed a 90th-minute consolation when Taylor picked himself up to fire home from the spot after being hauled down by Walsall full-back Rico Henry.
