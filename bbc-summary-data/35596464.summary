[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Florin Radu's 23-year-old victim came to the UK from Romania in August 2013 believing she would become a waitress but was forced into prostitution, police said.
The 30 year-old was convicted in his absence at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court in October 2015.
He has links across Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.
Radu was arrested at Luton Airport on 6 March 2014 before being charged and remanded, but was later bailed and went missing.
He was convicted in his absence of intentionally arranging or facilitating entry into the UK of a person with a view to their sexual exploitation.
Radu, of no fixed abode, is believed to have connections in Dudley, Wolverhampton and Coventry, as well as Luton and areas across Greater Manchester.
Det Cons Simon Hurdley, of the Greater Manchester Police Sexual Crime Unit, said: "We have been trying to trace Radu for some time and have exhausted all methods and so I would now like to ask for the public's help to find him."
Anyone with information is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers.
