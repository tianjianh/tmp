Durham Police said the men, both 19, toppled over a small wall while "joking around" but were able to get out with help from nearby door staff.
Both were checked over before being handed fixed penalty notices for causing alarm.
The deaths of Euan Coulthard, Sope Peters and Luke Pearce have prompted major concerns over the Wear's safety.
A new riverside safety plan has been launched to try and tackle the problem, including an education programme, breath testing and guardians on the streets of the city.
