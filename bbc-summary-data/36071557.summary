Esperance came back from a 2-1 first leg loss to Tanzania's Azam to win 3-0 and progress 4-2 on aggregate.
It was goalless at half-time but in the second period the home side cut loose to end lowly Azam's hopes of an upset.
The winners of the last 16 ties will play the losers in the Champions League for a place in the Confederation Cup group phase.
Esperance are joined in the next stage by fellow Tunisians, Stade Gabesian.
Gabesian had a 3-0 win over Zambia's Zanaco while Sagrada Esperanca of Angola are through against V Club Mokanda of Congo.
Uganda's SC Villa managed a 1-0 at home to FUS Rabat of Morocco on Wednesday but the goal was nothing more than a consolation as it finished 7-1 on aggregate.
Umar Kasumba scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot in the 56th minute.
