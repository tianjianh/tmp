Leeds United have to change their mindset now they are outside the top six, head coach Garry Monk has said.

Monk's side lost 1-0 to Wolves to drop to seventh in the Championship table with three matches to play.
The Elland Road side had been in the play-off places since a 2-1 win over Rotherham on 26 November.
"We're on the hunt now. We've got three games to do it now and we have to play for our lives," the 38-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I know 100% that this group will give everything in these next three games and if we take nine points then we give ourselves a great chance.
"We now have to change our mentality and it can be a dangerous situation for other teams because they can change their mentality to protecting a little bit.
"I have great belief in this group."
Leeds are behind sixth-placed Fulham on goal difference after the Craven Cottage side recorded a 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Monday.
Former Swansea boss Monk felt his team were punished for a slow first half against Paul Lambert's side.
"The first 45 minutes was one of the poorest of our season. There's no excuses," he added.
"We took the game to them in the second half and asked questions of them and that's how it needs to be from now on."
