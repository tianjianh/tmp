Australian MP Bob Katter said he may hang up his trademark Akubra hat after the company said it was going to start using only foreign rabbit fur.

The broad-brimmed felt hats have been produced in Australia for more than 130 years, although Akubra has been using some imported furs since the 1990s.
But the company plans to close its local rabbit processing operation to cut costs.
Mr Katter, an independent Queensland federal MP, said he was "hopping mad".
"It would be a terrible tragedy if one of those great icons vanishes," Mr Katter told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
"In all seriousness I will consider my options," he said.
"It does not set a good example and it does not set me with a desire to continue to wear an Akubra hat, and that would be something that would be shared with so many other people."
Akubra chief financial officer Roy Wilkinson said he spoke briefly with Mr Katter on Thursday morning.
"Our factory still employs 85 Australians, we're still Australian-made, and we hope [Mr Katter] still supports us," Mr Wilkinson told the BBC.

Mr Wilkinson said the fifth-generation family-owned business was committed to manufacturing in Australia but had been forced to make a commercial decision.
He said a number of factors had influenced Akubra's decision, including a lack of Australian rabbits and competing with a high demand for fur in China.
"We can't get enough rabbits to do what we do," Mr Wilkinson said.
"The Chinese market has driven up the price dramatically, up almost 300% overnight," he said.
The furs will be predominately sourced from France, Belgium and the Ukraine.
Mr Katter is almost always pictured wearing or carrying an Akubra hat.
Last year, he showed his support for the brand when he presented celebrity musician Pharrell with his very own Akubra, later tweeting:: "You will wear it well mate."
