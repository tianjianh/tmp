An absent Taylor Swift dominated the American Music Awards, winning three prizes, including album of the year and song of the year.

One Direction also fared well, being named favourite group and artist of the year, for the second year in a row.
Jared Leto made a moving speech about terror attacks in Paris, recalling the time his band played at The Bataclan.
Celine Dion then sang Edith Piaf's Hymne a L'Amour against a backdrop of Parisian landmarks.
"Tonight we honour the victims of the unimaginable violence that took place in Paris and around the world," said Leto, who sings with rock band 30 Seconds to Mars.
"France matters. Russia matters. Mali matters. Syria matters... The whole world matters. Peace is possible."
The Paris attacks were very much on the minds of the other performers and nominees.
Singer-songwriter Charlie Puth said he had been in Paris a few weeks before the attacks and was heartbroken by the news.
"I want to write a song for Paris," he told the ABC News.
Ashton Irwin of 5 Seconds of Summer, said the attacks "will change what we write about in the future".
"We have a young fan base, and were almost the communicators of what's going on in the world."
However, the rest of the awards show took a less sombre tone.
Host Jennifer Lopez opened the ceremony with an extended dance routine, set to a medley of the year's biggest hits - including Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk, Taylor Swift's Bad Blood and Drake's Hotline Bling.
Audience members Nicki Minaj and The Weeknd, whose songs were included in the mix, looked somewhat bemused by the honour.
Alanis Morissette performed her breakthrough hit You Oughta Know, which turns 20 this year, accompanied by Demi Lovato; while Charlie Puth and Meghan Trainor locked lips at the end of an impassioned performance of their duet Marvin Gaye.
Actress Anna Kendrick skewered the cliches of acceptance speeches as she collected the best soundtrack prize for her film Pitch Perfect 2.
Reading out a "thank you" list, she praised arranger and producer Alana Da Fonseca and music director and vocal producer Deke Sharon, adding "you only made me want to kill myself three times".
"You're a ruthless little group of sociopaths and I admire that about you," she added.
She then thanked music producer Harvey Mason Jr "for not telling anyone about that hooker we buried", before giving her final shout-out to executive producers Julianne Jordan and Julia Michaels, exclaiming: "I don't like you at all!"
One Direction addressed their upcoming "hiatus" as they collected the ceremony's top prize, artist of the year, telling fans: "We're gonna go on a little break, gonna spend some time with our families."
They were not the only multiple award-winners: The Weeknd and Nicki Minaj both took home two trophies, with Minaj scooping the hip-hop album of the year prize for the third time in her career.
Ariana Grande was the surprise winner of best female, beating Taylor Swift. She used her speech to thank her grandmother, who accompanied her to the show.
The singer said her "nonna" had contributed to her victory, telling her before the show: "Ariana I went on the computer. I voted, so I think you'll win."
Earlier, Marjorie Grande was seen dancing in the front row as her granddaughter performed a cabaret version of her latest single. Focus.
The evening ended with a three-song medley by comeback kid Justin Bieber, riding high on the success of his new album, Purpose, which topped the US charts last week.
The former teen star performed an acoustic version of his summer smash What Do You Mean? followed by the dance hit Where Are U Now and a rain-soaked version of the current UK number one, Sorry.
