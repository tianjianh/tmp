Jack Archer was hit by the car on Chapel Lane, in Bingham, Nottinghamshire, at about 22:15 BST on Monday.
A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene, police said.
Jack was described as "cheerful and happy" by his friends and teachers.
Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire.
Toot Hill School said the community was "deeply saddened" by his death.
It said: "Our thoughts are with Jack's family, friends and students, who will be devastated by this sad news.
"Jack was always a cheerful and happy student who had a real zest for life."
Some of his friends have spoken of their shock after finding out about Jack's death.
"It was my birthday yesterday and then I wake up this morning and find he is gone," one boy said.
"He was a good mate of ours. He always had a smile on his face, cheeky, mischievous, quite funny lad.
"You just think it is never going to happen to you."
Insp Simon Heads, of Nottinghamshire Police, said he will leave "no stone unturned" in the search to find out what happened.
"From what I understand the boy was actually overtaken by another vehicle before the vehicle that struck him," he said.
"Mum and dad are clearly devastated, which is the reason why we are absolutely determined to find out for them what happened to their boy last night."
Insp Heads added they needed to find the car and driver and had appealed to the owners of two cars, which are thought to have passed Jack before the crash, to contact the force.
