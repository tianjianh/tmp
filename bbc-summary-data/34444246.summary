Staff attacked with 'electric device'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two women were assaulted with what has been described as an "electrical implement" during a robbery at a shop in Kelso.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three men wearing green balaclavas entered the Original Factory Shop on Bowmont Street at 09:00.
They assaulted two female members of staff and stole a sum of money before escaping in a rust coloured Toyota Celica.
Both of the women were treated by ambulance staff.
One was subsequently taken to Borders General Hospital as a precaution but did not need further medical treatment.
The robbers were described as looking dishevelled. One had a Scottish accent and another an English accent.
They dumped the Toyota Celica in a Sainsbury's car park on the A698 following the robbery, but it is not known where they went afterwards.
Det Insp Paul Batten said:  "This is a serious incident which has left two female members of staff traumatised.
"These men showed no regard for their wellbeing and we are eager to trace them as soon as possible.
"Anyone who was in the area at the time of incident and saw anything suspicious, or saw the rust coloured Toyota Celica in the vicinity, is asked to contact police immediately."
