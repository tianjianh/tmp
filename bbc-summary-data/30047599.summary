Dorset Police said officers were unable to identify "a number of small devices" found at the house in St George's Road in Dorchester on Thursday morning.
The death of the man, in his 40s, is not being treated as suspicious.
Insp Steve Marsh said he wanted to reassure residents there was "no risk to the immediate area".
He added: "On searching the address, a number of small devices were discovered that officers were unable to identify.
"As a precaution, we called upon the army's bomb disposal unit to inspect the items and deal with them."
