In the absence of a local premiere, a group of extras from Dracula Untold have organised their own red carpet charity screening and gala night.
The black tie event, with a fundraising auction, is sold out and proceeds will go to cancer and arthritis charities.
Bobby Marno, who played a soldier, said he and other extras decided they would get together when the film reached cinemas.
"The idea just grew and grew and now it is a gala event, raising money for worthy charities," he said.
Vlad (Dracula) is played by Welsh actor Luke Evans, who has appeared in the Hobbit. His main enemy, Mehmed, is played by Dominic Cooper.
The production had its main base in an east Belfast factory.
Other filming locations around Northern Ireland included the Giant's Causeway, Mount Stewart, Divis and Black Mountains, Roe Valley country park in County Londonderry, and Killynether Woods and Scrabo in County Down.
An investment of Â£1.6m from Northern Ireland Screen is expected to bring a return of Â£13.5m to the local economy.
NI Screen chief executive Richard Williams said he was excited to see the end result as Dracula Untold arrived in cinemas.
"It is a wonderful showcase for Northern Ireland and it was a real coup for us to have the movie made here," he said.
The first-time feature film director is Gary Shore from Dublin, who began his career making commercials.
