Gales in north Wales force Holyhead to Dublin ferry cancellations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gale force winds in north Wales have forced high speed ferry sailings to the Republic of Ireland to be cancelled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strong gusts meant the Irish Ferries high speed crossings from Holyhead to Dublin at 11:50 and 17:15 GMT were scrapped.
Also cancelled were the 08:45 and 14:30 GMT high speed service between Dublin and Holyhead.
The Met Office said the weather in the north west of Wales would become "drier and brighter" on Tuesday afternoon.
Passengers from the high speed ferries are being transferred to cruise ferry sailings instead, Irish Ferries said on its website.
Stena Line services to and from Anglesey have not been affected.
HM Coastguard at Holyhead said they had experienced "occasional" gale force 8 gusts but the winds appeared to be easing and they had not had any reports of people getting into difficulty in the sea.
