Orphaned otter cub found on roadside near Welshpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An orphaned otter cub has been found on the side of the road in mid Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tired animal was spotted by a man at 21:30 BST last Friday at Glanhafren, Cyfronydd, near Welshpool.
When it was still there three hours later, he took it home in a box and contacted the RSPCA.
RSPCA inspector Phil Lewis said the uninjured cub was doing well and had been taken to the charity's Stapeley Grange Wildlife Centre in Cheshire for rehabilitation.
He advised anyone who sees a wild baby animal to check they are genuinely orphaned or abandoned before moving them, as the mother could be nearby.
