The long-running Yorkshire-based series beat EastEnders, Coronation Street, Doctors and Hollyoaks.
Emmerdale's Danny Miller, who plays Aaron Livesy, won both best actor and best male dramatic performance.
EastEnders actress Lacey Turner picked up the best actress and best female dramatic performance awards for her role as Stacey Branning.
The award for best storyline went to EastEnders for Stacey's postpartum psychosis.
Fellow EastEnders star Steve McFadden, who has played Phil Mitchell for 26 years in the BBC One soap, received an outstanding achievement award.
In a pre-recorded message broadcast at the London ceremony, he paid tribute to Dame Barbara Windsor, who played his mother in the soap and left the show earlier this month.
"Last but not least, I must mention Barbara Windsor, who has been an absolute pleasure to work with, and a wonderful, wonderful person and friend in my life.
"Thank you Barbara for everything."
Other winners included BBC One's Doctors for best episode for the Heart of England, while EastEnders' Bonnie Langford was named best newcomer.
Coronation Street's Connor McIntyre won best villain for his portrayal of Pat Phelan in the ITV soap.
The awards, voted for by the public, took place at the Hackney Empire and were hosted by Phillip Schofield.
