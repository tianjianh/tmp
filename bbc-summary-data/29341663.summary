So the iPhone 6 bends a bit - is it a big deal?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guess what? If you apply huge amounts of pressure to a 7mm thick smartphone made of aluminium, it will bend.

This video from Unbox Therapy proves that conclusively. This one proves plastic phones also bend, eventually.
But a small number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners are claiming the devices can bend after everyday use.
So far Apple has not responded to suggestions that leaving the new iPhone in your pocket can leave it misshapen, or that customers who wear skinny jeans are the worst affected (that's if they put the handset in their back pocket).
Hanzoh posted the above picture on macrumours.com which led to several users complaining of a similar problem.
Comments ranged from, "I hope thats a manufacturing defect on a certain batch!" to "No reason this should be happening on any Apple Phone. Period."
The below picture was posted by DevinPitcher of his friend's iPhone 6: "Put it in his front pocket and it was like this when he took it out after getting in the car."
A few more examples appeared to emerge on a twitter account dedicated to so-called "bend-gate".
With huge amounts of media attention around Apple product launches, this article included, relatively minor issues can get blown out of proportion.
When it went on sale in 2012, a handful of users claimed the iPhone 5 could bend out of shape.
And as #bendgate trended on Twitter, one user posted a photo of their apparently wonky iPhone 5S.
But Apple is not the only company to face complaints from users about flexible phones.
In 2013, some Sony Xperia Z1 users reported their phones bending after being left in a pocket.
Jennyung posted the picture below on a Sony forum asking if anyone else faced the same issue.
Of course, bendy phones are not always a bad thing, at least according to some manufacturers.
Samsung recently unveiled the Galaxy Note Edge, with a curved edge to the display.
And it hasn't exactly started a trend, but LG made a big deal of launching the world's first curved, flexible smartphone.
We saw the phone on show at Mobile World Congress in February 2014.
