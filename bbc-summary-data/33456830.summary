Tube and train strikes: Commuters face travel disruption

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tube and train strikes are causing travel misery, with the entire London Underground network shut down and many rail services cancelled.

Tube services were halted on Wednesday evening after a walkout by Underground staff over pay and conditions. They will not resume until Friday morning.
The Tube dispute centres on night services, set to begin in September.
A walkout by First Great Western staff has halved high-speed services between London, the west of England and Wales.

An extra 200 buses are being laid on, as well as additional river services, to help cope with demand in the capital, TfL said.
London Overground, DLR, TfL Rail and tram services are unaffected by the industrial action.
Those able to travel outside peak times are being urged to do so.
On Thursday morning Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, said: "I am very sorry your journey has been disrupted. This strike is unnecessary."
The strike began at 18:30 BST on Wednesday when members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and Unite walked out in a 24-hour action.
At 21:30, members of the train drivers' union Aslef began their own 24-hour stoppage.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "The strike action on London Underground is rock solid across all lines.
"That means an end to the attempt to bulldoze through new working patterns."
This Tube strike is as much about personalities as it is about the deal they are trying to hammer out.
The team negotiating for London Underground is new to this. The chief operating officer Steve Griffiths joined from Virgin Atlantic earlier this year, and my understanding is that no-one on the management side of the table has experience with rail deals.
Not that long ago, bosses on both sides would have got together, informally, away from the negotiating table - maybe over a beer - to see if they could smooth the path for an agreement.
That has not happened this time.
So we have got a group of frustrated unions, led it seems by Aslef, who feel they are being pushed around, a frustrated London Underground who say the unions refuse to talk about the main issues and four million tube passengers in the middle.
London mayor Boris Johnson has refused to rule out a delay to the opening of night Tube services, which are at the centre of the dispute between unions and London Underground.
Asked whether he expected the 24-hour service to launch on 12 September as planned, Mr Johnson said: "We will get it done this autumn."
The Tube strike coincides with a separate, 48-hour walkout by First Great Western staff, which began at 18:30 on Wednesday, causing disruption to rail services between London, the west of England and Wales.
Wimbledon spectator attendance is lower than last year and officials have not ruled out whether the travel disruption is a contributing factor.
A Wimbledon spokesman said: "There will be a reduction in the queue today because tickets are not available to buy for the show courts.
"We can't tell if it is down to the Tube strike."
Just over 37,000 spectators were at the All England Club on Wednesday, compared with a record attendance of 40,477 in 2014.
TfL warned that rush hour was likely to start earlier on Thursday as people made alternative arrangements to get home. It said buses, Overground services, river and Emirates Air Line services, as well as the cycle hire scheme were all likely to be in high demand when people headed home.
LU chief operating officer Steve Griffiths thanked Londoners for their patience and said: "We are, as we always have been, ready to talk at any time to sort out this dispute."
On Monday, members of all four unions rejected a "final" pay offer from LU which included a 2% rise this year and £2,000 for drivers on the weekend night Tube service.
The typical salary for a Tube driver is £50,000 a year, the RMT said, but the unions maintain the new plans would be disruptive to their members' lives.
They claim some employees are concerned they will have to work more overnight shifts and may have to work on their own at some stations.
The disputed weekend night services are set to begin on 12 September on sections of the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the strike was of benefit to no-one.
"We stand shoulder to shoulder with workers, families and commuters who want to go about their lives without disruption. I urge the strikers to accept the good offer that employers have made and get back to work," he said.
Aslef organiser Finn Brennan said the responsibility of the strikes "rests squarely with London Underground management" who "squandered the window of opportunity" to resolve it.
About 20,000 Tube workers are expected to walk out during the course of the strike.
Talks are set to resume on Friday.
