A schoolboy was killed after he was hit by a motorbike as he tried to cross a busy road, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhys Rubery, 16, from Pencoed, Bridgend county, was walking home from the beach on a pathway near Merthyr Mawr when he was struck on 12 July.
An inquest in Aberdare Coroner's Court heard he suffered a traumatic brain injury and was airlifted to hospital but died the next day.
A conclusion of accidental death was recorded by the coroner.
Rhys was walking home with friends, trying to figure out the quickest route, when the accident happened.
The inquest was told he thought he saw a gap in the traffic and ran into the road, but failed to see a motorcycle approaching from behind another car.
"The motorbike hit Rhys, sending him a few metres in the air and landing on the other side of the road," friend Guto Pari said.
A woman driving in the opposite direction stopped her car just in time to avoid driving over him.
His mother, Jo Rubery, described him as "an exceptional young man" with "the ability to achieve whatever he wanted in life".
The hearing was told motorcyclist Lawrence Thom was taken to hospital with a concussion and had very little memory of the incident.
