Organisers said about 3,000 people took part in the demonstration in the city centre, ahead of a UN summit in Paris on Monday.
The march began at Castle Park and finished on College Green, where a rally then took place.
It was one of hundreds of marches taking place around the world on the eve of the summit.
Mayor George Ferguson, who attended the rally, said: "Bristol is doing more than any other city in the world in 2015 to promote the things we have to do to tackle the climate.
"This march is saying a relatively small city like Bristol can have thousands of people coming out onto the streets because they care deeply about this issue.
"This isn't just about climate, it's also about justice and poverty, and those things unite people from all persuasions."
The COP21 conference in Paris will try to craft a long-term deal to limit carbon emissions.
