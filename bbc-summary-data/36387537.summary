Mr Rehman said of his wife: ""She was a loving mother to four beautiful children, a devoted wife, a beloved daughter and the most caring of sisters.
"She has been taken from us at the age of 34 and my children have been deprived of their mother.
"As everyone can appreciate and understand that the circumstances have torn our hearts apart."
He said they were at a junction in their lives where they had wanted to "watch our children grow, to love them and spend quality time as a family and make memories."
Police say they are keeping an open mind as to what led to the care worker's death, but are treating the case as murder.
They have not commented on unconfirmed reports that she was attacked during a "botched" burglary while her family was at a funeral.
Bedfordshire Police's Det Ch Insp Adam Gallop said it was a tragic incident and asked anyone with information to get in touch.
He said: "Even small pieces of information could be crucial.
"You might have been driving or walking along Overstone Road and either saw or heard something suspicious - if so we want to hear from you."
Residents reported shouting, swearing and screaming in the street on Monday night.
