Reece Wabara: Bolton Wanderers sign defender until end of 2016-17 season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Bolton Wanderers have signed defender Reece Wabara on a deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wabara, 25, had been a free agent since leaving Wigan in the summer after promotion from the third tier.
The ex-Manchester City player had loan spells with Ipswich, Oldham, Blackpool and Doncaster while with the Premier League outfit before a move to the latter in 2014.
In a tweet, Wabara said he wanted to "aid in the promotion push."
Bolton are third in League One, two points behind second-placed Scunthorpe having played one game fewer.
