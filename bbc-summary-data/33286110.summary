Street artist Shepard Fairey is wanted by police in Detroit after they say he tagged buildings across the city.

An arrest warrant has been issued for the designer, best known for creating the "Hope" image of President Obama during his 2008 election campaign.
He was commissioned to paint a huge, 18-storey mural in Detroit last month but police say he used his down time to plaster buildings with posters.
The warrant accuses him of two counts of malicious destruction of property.
Each is punishable by a prison sentence and a $10,000 (Â£6,347) fine.
"When you're in Detroit, we welcome your work, Shepard Fairey, your commissioned work, not your Wild West work," Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay said.
"Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal," she added.
However, Fairey laughed off the charges, calling them "hilarious".
The artist, who has been arrested 17 times in his 20-year career, told the Independent he did not know what the warrant would amount to.
"Sometimes it's a day or two in jail. Normally the charges get downgraded. Most of the arrests aren't for serious stuff," he said.
Fairey's commissioned work was the largest mural of his career - a 184ft by 60ft stencil on the side of an office block, which took  more than 300 cans of spray paint to complete.
It featured many of his recurring motifs - lotus leaves, a peace sign, the scales of justice and a stylised image of the late wrestler and Princess Bride star Andre The Giant.
But Fairey had told local newspaper The Detroit Free Press he intended to tag buildings during his visit.
"I still do stuff on the street without permission. I'll be doing stuff on the street when I'm in Detroit," Fairey said.
Police say that between 16 and 22 May, Fairey pasted nine posters, including some with the face of Andre the Giant on buildings around the city, causing damage totalling $9,105.54 (Â£5,779.20).
Detroit is trying to shed its reputation as a haven for illegal street artists. Last summer, Mayor Mike Duggan formed a quality-of-life task force targeting graffiti and building code violations. The team has since apprehended about a dozen people suspected of vandalism.
"Whether it's appealing to the eye or not, it is a crime," Ms McKay said. "He is well aware of the law, and instead of respecting the city of Detroit he took us two steps back."
