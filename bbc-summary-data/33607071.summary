Alan Drennan, a mechanic and doorman from Newtownabbey in County Antrim, had left with friends for a holiday to the Spanish island on Saturday.
The 21-year-old is understood to have died less than 24 hours later.
His father, also named Alan, said he has not yet been contacted by Spanish authorities.
He added that his son "hadn't even his case opened" when his body was found in the room.
Spanish police told BBC News NI there were no signs of violence and the death appeared to be of natural causes.
However, they are waiting for an autopsy to be carried out and could not say when that would take place.
Mr Drennan Sr said he was told of his son's death by the fathers of two of the friends on holiday with him.
They visited his house on Sunday evening to inform him.
Mr Drennan Sr said: "[One of the men] turned round and said: 'Listen, I have bad news about your son.'
"He said: 'Your son was found dead this morning.'
"I couldn't take it in, I couldn't get my head around, and I went to bits.
"I had left Alan to the airport at five o'clock on Saturday evening and kissed him goodbye."
Mr Drennan Jr had been staying at a different hotel to his friends and had returned there on Sunday morning after a night out.
"I was talking to one of his friends, and they're just so sad - they're trying to piece it all together," Mr Drennan Sr said.
"They had left him on Sunday morning, they had partied until seven o'clock in the morning.
"Then at five o'clock on the Sunday evening they didn't hear from young Alan.
"They went round to his hotel. [The receptionist] started crying and said: 'You need to get in touch with the police - [he] was found dead this morning.'"
He added that his son and his girlfriend had made arrangements to move to Australia to "start a new life" on his return from Ibiza.
A repatriation trust set up in the name of Kevin Bell, a Newry man who died in a suspected hit-and-run in New York in 2013, is covering the cost of bringing Mr Drennan Jr's body back to Northern Ireland, his father said.
He said his son "had a heart so big" and and "just loved what he was doing".
"Everybody that knew Alan has a loving word, he was such an honest person. He was so helpful, he was a super young lad.
"I lost my mother when I was five and my father when I was 13, and I never thought that I would be losing my son."
