A court in Egypt has sentenced two belly dancers to six months each in jail for inciting debauchery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Suha Mohammed Ali and Dalia Kamal Youssef - known as the Egyptian Shakira and Bardis - were arrested over their scantily-clad performances in videos.
Lawyers filed complaints, saying they were outrages to public morality and harmed the image of Egyptian women.
In March, a well-known dancer - Safinaz - was sentenced to six months in jail for insulting the national flag.
She appeared in a video wearing a dress in its colours.
Another dancer, Salma el-Fouly, received a six-month sentence in July for a video in which she wore skimpy clothes while making fun of male gropers.
The male cameraman was also jailed for six months, while a second man who produced and appeared in the video was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison.
