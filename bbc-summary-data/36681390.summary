Barracuda Championship: Martin Laird holds narrow lead after round one

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Martin Laird birdied his last hole to take a slender lead after the first round of the Barracuda Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scot, 33, had eight birdies and a bogey to end the day on 15 points.
That put him one clear of 2013 winner Gary Woodland, Australian Greg Chalmers and Colombian Camilo Villegas.
The tournament - formerly known as the Reno-Tahoe Open - is the only one on the PGA Tour to use a modified Stableford format, with eagles worth five points and birdies worth two.
American Woodland said: "An eagle in this format, you really jump up that board."
