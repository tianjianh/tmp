Second-half goals from Colm Byrne and Ben McDonnell booked a semi-final encounter against Donegal.
A free from Stephen McBrearty in the fifth minute of injury time saw Donegal edge an ill-tempered clash with Derry by 0-14 to 2-7 in Ballybofey.
Armagh hammered Down 5-16 to 0-9 to set up a last-four game with Monaghan, who thrashed Fermanagh 1-15 to 0-3.
Cavan led  0-4 to 0-1 after 10 minutes but Tyrone senior star Cathal McShane kicked four points to put the visitors ahead for the first time at 0-6 to 0-5 at the break.
Colm Byrne's classy finish put clear daylight between the sides before McDonnell's fisted goal clinched victory.
Derry trailed 0-11 to 0-5 before Niall Loughlin's goal brought them back into contention against Donegal.
In a dramatic finish, the game looked set to go to extra time when Niall Toner cancelled out McBrearty's free, but the latter nailed another last-gasp free to clinch a win for Donegal.
Crossmaglen star Oisin O'Neill kicked 1-6 from midfield as Armagh thrashed Down.
Cathal McKenna and Shane McPartlan starred up front, kicking 1-5 and 2-2 respectively, while Conor Martin also weighed in with 1-3 in an impressive Orchard display.
Barry McGinn scored the only goal as Monaghan defeated Fermanagh 1-15 to 0-3 in Inniskeen to set up a last four showdown with Armagh.
Both semi-finals will be played on 30 March.
