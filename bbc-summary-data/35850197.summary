David Walliams, Alesha Dixon, Gary Lineker and Greg James were among those who hosted the BBC show, broadcast from London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
Highlights included a Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em sketch featuring tennis siblings Andy and Jamie Murray.
The total of £55,444,906 breaks the previous on-the-night record of £51m.
Britain's Got Talent judge Walliams, who has a long association with Sport Relief, revived Little Britain character Emily Howard for a sketch with former England footballer Peter Crouch.
Actor Idris Elba starred as Luther in a one-off sketch which reunited him with Ruth Wilson, who plays nemesis Alice Morgan in the BBC One crime drama.
The overall total included money raised by Sport Relief Challenges, including Jo Brand's Hell of a Walk.
The challenge saw the comedienne take on an incredible 135.7 miles as she walked across the UK from east to west, raising £1,159,220.
Eddie Izzard is still raising money for Sport Relief by running a gruelling 27 marathons in 27 days across South Africa. He has completed 24 marathons so far.
And BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James raised more than £1m by completing a triathlon a day for five consecutive days, across five different UK cities.
Fundraising efforts will continue on Sunday as the Sainsbury's Sport Relief Games take place around the country.
