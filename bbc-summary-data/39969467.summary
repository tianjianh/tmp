Hull Kingston Rovers have signed winger Justin Carney from Salford Red Devils until the end of the 2018 season.

Carney, 28, was suspended for eight games by the Rugby Football League on 2 May after being found guilty of racially abusing Toronto Wolfpack player Ryan Bailey.
The player leaves by mutual consent following an internal investigation.
Meanwhile, Salford have signed 25-year-old Ireland forward James Hasson from Australian side Parramatta Eels.
"James is a player that adds some real competitiveness to our squad," said Salford head coach Ian Watson.
"We've had some injuries to our middles with Adam Walne and George Griffin, and James is exactly the kind of player that can step into that role. His NRL experience with Manly and Parramatta will be invaluable."
