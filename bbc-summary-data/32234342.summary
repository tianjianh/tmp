[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police believe Cambuslang body is missing Blantyre man

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police believe a body unearthed by workmen in Cambuslang is that of a man who went missing in 2012.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Human remains were discovered at the Dale Avenue industrial site on Tuesday.
A forensic examination suggested the body had been in place for "a considerable time", and officers believe it may be that of Blantyre man David Baird.
The 54-year-old went missing in June 2012, and officers are liaising with his family.
The death is being treated as unexplained, and inquiries to establish the full circumstances are under way.
Further forensic tests will also be carried out to firmly establish the identity of the deceased.
