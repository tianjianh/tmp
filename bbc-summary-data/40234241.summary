Criterium du Dauphine: GB's Kennaugh wins stage seven but Froome loses time on Porte

Britain's Peter Kennaugh won stage seven of the Criterium du Dauphine, but defending champion Chris Froome lost time on leader Richie Porte.

Team Sky rider Kennaugh rode solo to the win on Alpe d'Huez, pulling away from compatriot Ben Swift in the final three kilometres to win by 13 seconds.
Australia's Porte attacked at the end to gain 23 seconds on Britain's Froome, who stays second.
He leads the Briton by one minute two seconds before Sunday's final stage.
That will see riders tackle a punishing mountainous trek which ends on the summit of the Plateau de Solaison.
"To win at L'Alpe d'Huez is better than being an Olympic champion," said Isle of Man rider Kennaugh, who won gold at London 2012 as part of the team's pursuit.
The Tour de France, of which Froome is a three-time winner, starts on 1 July.
