Burundi country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burundi, one of the world's poorest nations, is struggling to emerge from a 12-year, ethnic-based civil war.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since independence in 1962 it has been plagued by tension between the usually-dominant Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority.
The ethnic violence sparked off in 1994 made Burundi the scene of one of Africa's most intractable conflicts.

Pierre Nkurunziza, a former Hutu rebel leader, became the first president to be chosen in democratic elections since the start of Burundi's civil war in 1994.
In 2015 Burundi was plunged into its worst crisis since the end of a civil war in 2005, when Mr Nkurunziza's ultimately successful bid for re-election to a third term sparked protests by opposition supporters who said the move was unconstitutional.
Operating in a turbulent political climate, Burundi's media are subject to self-censorship and occasional government censorship.
In June 2013 President Nkurunziza approved a new media law which critics condemned as an attack on press freedom. The law forbids reporting on matters that could "undermine national security, public order or the economy".
Some key dates in Burundi's history:
1890 - The kingdoms of Urundi and neighbouring Ruanda (Rwanda) incorporated into German East Africa.
1916 - Belgian army occupies the area.
1962 - Urundi is separated from Ruanda-Urundi and becomes independent.
1993 - Ethnic conflict claims some 300,000 lives.
2015 - Unrest sparked by president's plans to stand for third term.
