The 34-year-old Pakistan-born left-hander was released by Sussex in September after two seasons at Hove.
Last month he was named the Bangladesh Premier League's player of the tournament after scoring 215 runs at an average of 53.75 and taking 17 wickets.
"When you consider his batting abilities, this really makes sense at this moment in time," said Essex head coach Chris Silverwood.
"We have a number of young players coming through, so someone with Ashar's experience will be invaluable to the group.
"We believe he can make an impact across all three competitions this coming season."
Zaidi has scored more than 5,000 first-class runs, including 12 centuries, and taken 89 wickets at an average of 30.32
"I hope to be able to continue my good form from this winter into the new season," he said.
"Having spoken to a few of the players at Essex, I know they are all excited for the new season under Chris Silverwood and I look forward to linking up with everyone over the next few weeks."
