[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 1-1 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford staged a second-half fightback but were held to their fourth successive draw by struggling Bury, who are without a win in 14 matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors, who ended a run of 12 defeats in a row with a goalless stalemate at Fleetwood on Boxing Day, went in front after 39 minutes when Scott Burgess latched on to a long through pass and lobbed the ball over the advancing Colin Doyle.
The goal came less than minute after Jordy Hiwula had missed Bradford's best chance.
Left-back Matt Kilgallon's cross was helped into his path but the on-loan striker saw his close range shot blocked.
Bradford began the second half brightly and deservedly equalised after 52 minutes, moments after Doyle had saved Burgess volley at the second attempt.
The ball was quickly cleared up field for James Hanson to head the ball into path of Hiwula. Ron Lainton saved Hiwula's shot but could not hold the ball and Nicky Law fired the rebound into the net to level the scores.
The home side continued to dominate but could not turn pressure into goals and substitute Mark McNulty twice missed good chances after Hanson headed the ball into his path and the tall striker also provided chances for Law and substitute Haris Vuckic, but their shots were off target.
