Hibernian match-winner David Gray says their 'Roy of the Rovers' Scottish Cup final victory will inspire them to return to the Premiership next season.

Gray's injury-time header ended a run of 10 losing finals for the Edinburgh club since their last Cup win in 1902.
He admitted "it certainly helps" ease the pain of missing out on promotion after their play-off defeat by Falkirk.
"We are gutted we are not going up but this gives us a lot of confidence we can win the league next year," he said.
"It is what you dream about - scoring a winning goal in the last minute of the cup final. It is Roy of the Rovers stuff.
"We are so disappointed we are not getting promoted - we believe we were good enough to get out of this league [Championship].
"But winning the cup puts to bed everything that has been said about us not having the bottle.  It is such a great effort by everyone involved with the club.  I am so happy."
Hibs led with an early goal from Anthony Stokes but it appeared they might face further misery when Kenny Miller's header levelled matters and Andy Halliday's superb strike put Rangers ahead after 64 minutes.
But two superbly-flighted corners from substitute Liam Henderson saw Stokes head in with 10 minutes left before captain Gray performed the same trick in added time.
"They say every cloud has a silver lining, and today we have got that silver lining," said Hibs head coach Alan Stubbs.
"I am quite emotional. I probably dreamt this - I thought we were going to win the game 3-1 weeks ago.
"I knew the players were so disappointed last Friday [after their Premiership play-off semi-final defeat by Falkirk] but I saw by their reaction when they came back in on Monday they were ready for this game.
"They are history makers. You work with them every day and they have had a lot of bad luck against them, so to see them achieve it is fantastic."
Stokes, who arrived on loan from Celtic in January, had scored seven goals in 26 games prior to Saturday, but despite missing a host of other chances, his eighth and ninth goals proved his ability on the big occasion.
"I have never doubted my own ability," the striker told BBC Scotland.
"It is down to me to perform and I have done that today. I am just glad this club has got the hoodoo out of the way and finally won the cup."
Many Hibs supporters invaded the pitch as the final whistle blew, leading to some ugly confrontations and Rangers saying some of their players were assaulted.
Mounted police on horses entered Hampden to help keep supporters apart and restore order before the Hibs players were presented with the trophy, while Rangers' received their medals in their dressing room.
"The fans got a bit excited coming onto the pitch," said Hibs midfielder Fraser Fyvie.  "But the way they have supported us this season and again today was fantastic.
"It has been a good while since we won a cup so they have maybe got a bit carried away but you can understand it.
"To be honest we wanted promotion and we will go for it again next season but I just want to enjoy this for now."
