Women's Super League One: Arsenal Ladies 0-1 Manchester City Women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City moved a step closer to their first Women's Super League title as a 1-0 win at Arsenal kept them seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea.

City's Scotland striker Jane Ross won the game, deflecting in England captain Steph Houghton's second-half free-kick.
Arsenal's Jordan Nobbs was denied by a fingertip save from Karen Bardsley before half-time, but the hosts rarely went close to finding an equaliser.
Victory assures City of qualification for the Champions League for 2017-18.
FA Cup winners Arsenal, who also lost 1-0 at City last weekend in the semi-finals of the Continental Cup, are now 15 points behind the leaders in third place.
Their hopes of securing a top-two spot for a place in Europe look slim after second-placed Chelsea's win at Reading.
City have played a game more than rivals Chelsea but will win the title if they avoid defeat at home to the Blues when they meet on 25 September.
Nick Cushing's side will also be crowned champions even if they lose to Chelsea but then beat Birmingham City in their final match on 30 October.
Match ends, Arsenal Ladies 0, Manchester City Women 1.
Second Half ends, Arsenal Ladies 0, Manchester City Women 1.
