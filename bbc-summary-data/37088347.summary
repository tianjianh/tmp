Ali, the 20-year-old who won silver at the 2015 European Championships, was fighting for the first time, having received a bye in the previous round.
He was outclassed by 19-year-old Finol, who earned a unanimous points decision.
Finol moves into the quarter-finals, where victory would guarantee him a bronze medal.
"I've been here for too long," said Ali. "I felt sluggish and too anxious. I was to trying too hard.
"I've been waiting around waiting to box and watching everyone else and I let that get the better of me. I was in there and nothing was flowing and couldn't get a rhythm going."
