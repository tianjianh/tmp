Lauren, 18, previously won silver at the 2015 World Rowing Championships having only taken up rowing earlier that year.
She is also a former wheelchair track racer who represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
Here, Lauren answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
If you weren't an athlete, what would you want to be and why?
I would definitely like to be a radio presenter/ DJ. I have a passion for music and listening to new artists, therefore I have always wanted to have my own radio segment to show people new and current music.
Also the perks of being an athlete mean that you get to do radio interviews with stations such as the BBC and whenever I  go into the studios and see the presenters doing their job I always get a buzz off it.
And I'm a real chatterbox so I could talk all day on the radio and never run out of topics to talk about!
What or who made you get into sport?
I have participated in sport since a young age. I think my real passion for sport stemmed from my love of competition.
In middle school I was in every sports team and I just loved competing against other schools - when my mother saw this passion she devoted her spare time to taking me to athletics training and my swimming lessons after school.
It was my involvement in the clubs outside of school that made me want to pursue a career in sport.
What keeps you motivated to train?
Before competing in Rio my sole motivation was to win a gold medals - there was no other focus other than becoming Paralympic Champion.
However, after achieving my dream I find that my motivation to get me through the exhausting winter months is actually my motivation of self-development. At this time of year, it is hard for me to visualise the next competition and winning, so a big part of my motivation is sourced from a vision of a better me.
There is always room for improvement and there will always more speed, strength and technique to be gained.
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
That it's not as easy as it looks!
Paralympic sport in particular is only ever in the public eye every four years and, being the great sporting nation that we are, everybody sees the success of the athletes.
I would say that because we are such a successful team many people now expect you to keep winning gold medals and that winning is easy for some athletes. The reality is that it just gets harder.
To keep competing and achieving at this level you have to keep pushing yourself that extra one per cent every season and you have to make one more sacrifice each time.
Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
A typical day for me would be to wake up at 5.30am, get dressed and eat breakfast before heading down to the gym for 6am and spend 30 minutes stretching and warming up ready for my aerobic session on the ergometer (the actual name for a rowing machine).
I usually spend 60 minutes physically rowing on the ergometer before getting changed into fresh kit and head to my strength and conditioning session which will consist of an hour of lifting weights and then 30 minutes of strengthening my core. I usually finish training before 10am.
I will then attend lectures at University all day. In the evening I like to spend some time stretching again to release all the built up tension from training in the morning.
My training days depend on the time of year. At the moment I will train between two or three times per day with one day off per week.

What was your favourite subject at school and why?
My favourite subject at school was always PE. I was always the one pupil who thought sports day was the Olympic Games!
Who is your biggest inspiration?
My mum!
Growing up it was just me and my mum so we have a very close bond and I always remember her working extremely hard and still coming home and take me to whatever sports training I had on that particular night. She's worked incredibly hard all her life and even though she isn't my sporting hero, she's the woman I aspire to be.
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
Before every competition we will always have a physical routine in place to get us prepared for the race and that routine may be different for every race.
However, before every race I will always listen to the same playlist of songs which I've titled 'Time to win gold' and I will always listen to a series of short motivational videos that are on my phone.
The combination of the music and videos makes me mentally ready for the race and really focuses my mind on the end goal and the end result.
How do you feel before a major event or competition and how do you manage your nerves?
Managing your nerves before a major competition I find extremely difficult. Before my Paralympic final I was a bag of nerves from the moment I woke up!
I just like to get in the boat and start rowing. As soon as I get on that start line I am focused and relaxed because I know that I have practised every single stroke hundreds of times over.
Once I begin to row I don't think about anything, my body just sets into auto drive and the nerves disappear.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career?
My 'golden moment' is quite literally the three minutes and 55 seconds it took to row to win my Paralympic gold medal!
There is no higher achievement in my sport than winning a Paralympic Gold and when you achieve that the sensation is indescribable.
I still gaze at my medal and just sit and wonder how a picture of that medal was once my phone wallpaper for months and months and now it belongs to me!
