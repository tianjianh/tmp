Food in place of fines at Merthyr Tydfil libraries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Got an overdue library book? Errant borrowers in Merthyr Tydfil can leave their wallets at home if they are fined - as long as they bring a tin of food instead.

Libraries in the town are offering "Food for Fines", asking for donations of food as a means of getting people to return late books.
The food would be distributed to those in need around the town by a charity.
Reader Rhodri Thomas said: "This is the closest we will get to fine dining."
People can bring in spare tins, packets and dried food to cover any overdue library books.
Principal librarian Jane Sellwood said: "If you have late books, bring them back. You won't get fined but we will ask for a food donation instead."
The library service is working with charity Donation Station, which runs other schemes in the town to help people struggling with finances.
One initiative offers shoppers the chance to donate money towards a hot meal and a drink for a homeless person when paying at a store's till.
Ms Sellwood added: "All donations will be given to the Donation Station and even if you don't have fines, you can still donate.
"This is a great opportunity to declutter your house, clear your library fines and contribute to a good cause all at once."
Merthyr Tydfil is classed as one of the most deprived communities in the UK, with low rankings in income levels, employment, health, education, access to services, community safety, housing and the environment.
