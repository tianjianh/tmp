Lancashire have renamed the Pavilion End at Old Trafford after James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket taker.

A naming ceremony took place before the start of England's fourth Test against South Africa at the ground on Friday.
The Burnley-born bowler, 35, has played for Lancashire throughout his career, and said he was "blown away".
"To have this happen when I'm still playing and potentially bowling from that end is a bit surreal," he added.
"It is something that usually happens when people have stopped playing or are further down the line. It is just an amazing honour."
Another Lancashire bowling great, Brian Statham, has an end named after him at the ground.
Former England spinner Graeme Swann was full of praise for his old international team-mate and welcomed the new name.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Sports Panel, Swann said: "Jimmy is a legend. Everyone talks about Statham and Atherton and people like that, but I think it should be the Jimmy Anderson ground to be honest. He's done more for Lancashire County Cricket Club than anyone else.
"He's the only player in the England team, fast bowler anyway, who genuinely wants to play every game for his county when he's playing for England. Jimmy is a geek and he wants to play cricket for Lancashire. He bleeds red blood."
