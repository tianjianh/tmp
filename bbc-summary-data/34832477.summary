The company's Zune players and digital music service were launched in 2006 to rival Apple's iPod and iTunes.
But they never made a considerable impact and Zune hardware was discontinued in 2011.
On Sunday, the Zune music download and streaming service was quietly retired.
Any remaining Zune players will still work as an MP3 player, but will no longer be able to stream online music.
Microsoft said the last remaining Zune subscribers would be switched over to its Groove music platform.
