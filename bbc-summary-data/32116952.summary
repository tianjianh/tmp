[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northamptonshire PCC Adam Simmonds under investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Northamptonshire is being accused of leaking confidential details of a criminal case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating PCC Adam Simmonds over an alleged offence of misconduct in public office.
He is accused of disclosing "sensitive" information to third parties in 2013.
The complaint was made by the police panel that monitors Mr Simmonds and he is yet to be interviewed by the IPCC.
Mr Simmonds, who represents the Conservative Party, said the IPCC never told him it was investigating the two allegations and he found out through his media team.
"It's extraordinary I should learn of the investigations through third parties," he said.
The IPCC said allegations were made by the county's police and crime panel, which monitors the PCC's conduct.
In a statement, the IPCC said Mr Simmonds was suspected of breaching the Data Protection Act by "inappropriately" disclosing "sensitive and confidential" information.
The organisation declined to give any further information.
"I have yet to be interviewed or questioned by the IPCC so I cannot yet fully respond," Mr Simmonds said.
Chief Constable Adrian Lee said he was aware of the IPCC investigation.
"We both value the transparency and openness that such investigations can provide," he said.
