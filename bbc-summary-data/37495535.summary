Trains and trams were halted and traffic lights knocked out of action as one of the most ferocious storms in decades swept across the state.
Officials said damage to key facilities near the city of Port Augusta had forced the grid to shut down.
More than 21,000 lightning strikes were recorded within a 12-hour period and 1.6m people were left without power.
Latest reports say electricity has begun to be restored to the state capital Adelaide, although full services might not be restored until Thursday morning.
Adelaide saw traffic gridlock as officials struggled to restore power.
And there were long queues at the city's airport.
Some people tried to make light of the situation.
