Former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan says Wales' Andrew Selby is "one of the best talents" he has ever seen.

Selby fights Louis Norman for the vacant British flyweight title on Saturday, 14 May in Cardiff.
"If Selby is as good as I think he could be, he'll be fighting for a world title before 10 fights," said McGuigan.
"That's how good he is. I really think Andrew Selby is one of the most talented kids in the world."
McGuigan is promoting the bill at Cardiff's new Ice Arena on which Lee Haskins defends his IBF world bantamweight title against Ivan Morales.
Selby made a dazzling start to his professional career, beating Tanzanian Haji Juma in Newport on October, 2015.
Leicestershire's Norman, 22, has been beaten once in 13 bouts, against Charlie Edwards for the English flyweight title on the night Anthony Joshua won the Commonwealth heavyweight title.
"You might say that Andrew Selby is expected to win and they're going to say 'well how long will this guy last?'," McGuigan told Sport Wales.
"But Louis Norman's a very tough kid, went the distance with Chris Edwards for the English title and is a very good fighter.
"He's determined to win. He's young and ambitious."
McGuigan believes Andrew Selby has been rejuvenated since turning professional after being part of the British Lionhearts' amateur set-up based in Sheffield.
"He's won a world silver, two European gold medals. He's competed at the highest level for a long time," said McGuigan.
"I think he lost a little bit of his ambition in the amateurs.
"Now that he's turned professional, now that he's fighting for a British title in his fifth fight - which is a record for a Welsh fighter - he's really motivated.
"In sparring he's turning bigger, stronger guys on their head - he's very, very talented. Very special."
