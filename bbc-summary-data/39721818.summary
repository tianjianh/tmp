The ex-Edinburgh and Italy coach, a former mixed martial arts fighter, also worked with Gold as defence coach at South African Super Rugby side Sharks.
"I'm a huge believer in fit well-conditioned teams," Gold told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"Pre-season will be tough but it will be critical for laying foundations."
Gold announced on Tuesday he was committing himself to another season with Worcester, after saving them from relegation.
"I've known Omar for a number of years," added Gold. "I've seen the work he's done at a number of of different clubs.
"He comes from a martial arts background and has a fantastic attention to detail.
"I've been happy with the coaching staff we have but I thought that was one area we could improve on."
Lebanon-born, Zimbabwe-bred Mouneimne worked under Nick Mallett with the Italian national team for two seasons before joining South African side Southern Kings in 2012.
He has since also worked with Edinburgh, back at Kings, then Lyon, and two South African teams, Pumas and Sharks, where he requested an early release from his contract to go and work for French Top 14 side, Stade Francais.
Meanwhile, Warriors academy graduate Andy Short has been forced to retire from his home-town club with a recurring hip injury at the age of just 26.
The Worcester-born back, who could play on the centre or on the wing, made his debut in 2010 before moving in 2013 to Bristol, where he spent two seasons.
He returned to Warriors 2015, but has been limited to just eight appearances following a succession of injuries.
Short, who graduated with a first-class honours degree in leadership and management at the University of Northumbria, is now studying for a Masters in building surveying.
"As I hang up my boots, I will be leaving the game behind with a heavy heart but looking forward to whatever life brings me next," he said.
"My time in the game has been a rollercoaster, with ultimate highs and painful lows, but I wouldn't change a thing."
