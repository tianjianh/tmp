[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A priest has been found guilty of sexually abusing two boys after telling one of them he was "preparing" him for a girlfriend.

The Reverend Christopher Howarth, of Rocks Park Road, Uckfield, was found guilty of 26 offences against the boys, now aged 19 and 20.
Hove Crown Court was told the former teacher paid money to the boys in return for sexual gratification.

The offences, including seven counts of sexual activity with a child, took place between 2004 and 2012 in the Uckfield area of East Sussex.
Howarth, 67, was an unpaid non-stipendiary priest until he was suspended by the Diocese of Chichester in December 2012.
He was a teacher at Uckfield Community Technology College before he retired in 2007.
He was remanded in custody to await sentencing on 7 August.
