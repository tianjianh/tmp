He adopted "Pancake" and they have formed such a close bond that they go to see clients together and hang out in his office.
"If I leave him on his own he goes crazy so I just take him with me," said Mr Hutchinson, from Didsbury in Greater Manchester. "He follows me around everywhere - he thinks I'm his mum."
He said he hopes his office buddy will eventually become more independent and pursue a high-flying career of his own.
"We'll all miss him, but we won't miss the cleaning up."
