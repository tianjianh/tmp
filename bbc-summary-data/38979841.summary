The Highland Heartbeat Centre was opened in 2005 after hundreds of thousands of pounds was raised through a public fundraising effort.
The rest of the money needed was provided by the British Heart Foundation.
NHS Highland said alternative arrangements would be provided to the people who use the centre.
The health board said it wants to use the space for other clinical services that needed to be on the Raigmore Hospital site.
A campaign called Big Hi-5 Stop opposes the closure.
The group representing cardiac patients and their families said the centre and its staff provided important services.
A meeting between health board staff, members of the campaign and cardiac patients' support group Bravehearts was held on Wednesday.
Following the meeting, a spokesperson for NHS Highland said: "As we have said before the Heartbeat Centre will close but not until alternative arrangements are in place for cardiac rehabilitation.
"We have made a lot or progress to address the various changes required but that work is ongoing. We hope that this will completed by May.
"Ultimately what we are aiming for is to see many more people supported via the cardiac rehabilitation service than is possible under the current arrangements."
Another meeting is to be held on 15 March.
