Budget airline Wizz Air is to begin flights from Belfast International Airport to Lithuania on Wednesday.

It will run two flights a week to the country's capital, Vilnius.
Lithuanian Honorary Consul Bill Sinnerton said the flights were a "lifeline" for the 20,000 Lithuanians who have made Northern Ireland their home.
In March, Wizz Air launched a direct service to Katowice in Poland.
