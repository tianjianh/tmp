[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Blackman said it was "becoming a challenge" to spend more time working away from Aberdeen with the committee, which often travels around the country.
She was elected to the Aberdeen North constituency in May 2015.
The SNP is to put forward Edinburgh MP Deirdre Brock to replace Ms Blackman on the committee.
Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary Dave Anderson is also to leave the committee, to be replaced by Ian Murray, his predecessor in the role.
Ms Blackman, who was cautioned by parliamentary officials for taking her two children into a meeting of the committee earlier in the year, denied that any strain on her family life was behind her decision.
She said: "It has been a privilege to serve on the Scottish Affairs committee and I am proud of the work I have taken part in for over a year now.
"I have made the decision to step down from the committee so that I have more time in my constituency.
"As many people know, the committee travels regularly around Scotland and unfortunately for me it was becoming a challenge to spend even more time working away from Aberdeen."
The committee, which is chaired by fellow SNP MP Pete Wishart, is to start an inquiry into Scotland's place in Europe following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
