Stevenage had an exciting tie with Tottenham Hotspur, and everyone assumed Spurs would win. But the game finished 0-0, which means there'll now be a replay between the two sides at White Hart Lane.
On Saturday Birmingham held on to a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, meaning they too will have a replay.
Leicester City finished Norwich City's hopes of cup glory with a 2-1 victory, while Stoke did the same to Blackpool 2-0.
In a north-south battle, Bolton beat Millwall 2-0.
Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Sunderland leaves the team with hardly any chance of lifting a trophy for the seventh season in a row.
