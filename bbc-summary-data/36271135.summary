Walter Scott death: More charges in South Carolina shooting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police officer accused of the fatally shooting a black motorist in South Carolina is now facing additional federal charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Slager, who is white, has been charged with violating the civil rights of Walter Scott, who was unarmed and running away when he was shot.
The state has already brought murder charges over the traffic stop that ended in tragedy in April 2015.
A lawyer for Mr Scott's family said the federal charges were historic.
Chris Stewart said: "This is history in so many ways. This never happens."
As well as a civil rights violation, the federal charges also include obstruction of justice and unlawful use of a weapon during the commission of a crime.
The case reignited a long-running debate in the US about the police use of lethal force, especially against African Americans.
Video footage filmed from the dashcam of Mr Slager's car showed what looked like a routine traffic stop - until Mr Scott got out of the car with the police officer in pursuit.
Although the video does not capture Mr Slager firing eight shots, gunshots and shouting are heard off-screen.
A second video filmed by a bystander shows the pair scuffle and then Mr Scott fleeing again.
His death sparked rallies in North Charleston, with chants of "No justice, no peace".
Mr Slager was fired from his job and North Charleston approved a $6.5m civil settlement with Mr Scott's family last autumn.
