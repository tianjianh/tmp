Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool owners want to offer manager new deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool's owners have approached manager Jurgen Klopp about extending his contract at Anfield.

Klopp, 49, only joined Liverpool in October, then agreeing a deal until 2018, with the option of another year.
But the club's hierarchy is looking to extend that contract as a show of faith and to ward off any potential debate on his future.
German Klopp took Liverpool the finals of the League Cup and the Europa League last season.
Any new deal would not necessarily involve fresh terms over payment.
Klopp is already in the top bracket of earners because of his status and past achievements, having guided Borussia Dortmund to two German titles and a Champions League final before his move to Anfield.
