[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forty jobs are set to go in Antrim after the IT firm Fujitsu said it will close its maintenance and repair centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Japanese firm employs more than 800 people across Northern Ireland.
It said that following a review it will transfer the work in Antrim to Belfast, and Solihull in England.
The company added that it will offer relocation and redeployment opportunities in an effort to minimise the number of redundancies.
"As a result of this decision, regrettably 40 employees at our Antrim facility have been put on notice that their jobs are at risk of redundancy, triggering a formal consultation period with all affected employees and their representatives," it said.
