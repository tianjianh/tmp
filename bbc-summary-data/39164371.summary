[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Mirren 0-0 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Mirren and Dunfermline both had to settle for a point in a game of plenty chances in Paisley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Eckersley's half-volley almost put the Buddies in front but Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch did well to turn it over.
The visitors went close late on when Michael Paton's low effort was flicked wide by a defensive boot.
St Mirren now have nine games to reduce the four-point gap between them and ninth-placed Ayr United.
The Honest Men's home loss to Falkirk means the Paisley men have reeled them in ever so slightly, but both St Mirren boss Jack Ross and Dunfermline counterpart Allan Johnston will feel that a little more cutting edge in front of goal would have delivered three points.
Murdoch worked hard to deny Cammy Smith, Rory Loy and the impressive Lewis Morgan.
Michael Moffat had a couple of good opportunities for Dunfermline and Kallum Higginbotham also tested Billy O'Brien early on.
The visitors claimed for a penalty when St Mirren defender Gary Irvine sent Paul McMullan sprawling, but referee Stephen Finnie was unmoved by the appeals.
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "When you look at other results it's a point gained.
"The performance reflected a team that was trying to win the game.
"It's a point in the right direction and given where we were a little while ago - almost written off - I think we're back in contention to avoid finishing in bottom place."
Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: "It must have been a great game for the neutral.
"St Mirren put us under a lot of pressure early on but after the initial 15 minutes I thought we weathered the storm and were the better team.
"It was just our final decision-making that let us down.
"Gary Irvine put a challenge in from the back on Paul McMullan and it looked a penalty."
