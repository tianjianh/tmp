Three weeks after his death, David Bowie has lodged 12 albums in the UK top 40, equalling a record set by Elvis Presley in 1977.

The Starman's swansong, Blackstar, spent a third week at number one, with Best of Bowie, Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust all in the Top 10.
Adele remained at two, while Suede, who were heavily inspired by Bowie, scored the highest new entry at number six.
Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not chart after its release on Thursday.
The record was considered ineligible as it was initially given away via the streaming music site Tidal. Official chart company rules state that free downloads do not count towards the top 40.
However, the Bajan star did score a new entry in the singles chart. Work, her duet with Drake, made its first appearance at 13 after just 48 hours on sale.
The highest new entry, at three, is a dance version of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car by London-based producer Jonas Blue.
His tropical-flavoured remake, which features vocals by singer Dakota, beat the original song's performance, which charted at number five in 1988; and reached number four in 2011 following a rendition on Britain's Got Talent.
According to his official Facebook page, Blue explained he "had the idea to recreate one of his mother's favourite songs that he remembered hearing on repeat as a child".
Canadian star Shawn Mendes is still at number one with his breakthrough hit, Stitches. It sold 13,000 copies more than its nearest rival, Justin Bieber's Love Yourself; and was the most streamed song of the week, notching up 3.51 million plays.
Meanwhile, Elle King's performance on last week's Graham Norton Show saw her single Ex's & Oh's jump from 64 to 15; while her album Love Stuff climbed 40 places to land at number 18.
Bowie's other albums in the top 40 include: Nothing Has Changed (5), Heroes (28), Diamond Dogs (30), Station to Station (32) and Scary Monsters (36).
