[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-0 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Christian Walton proved Luton's hero as his brilliant penalty save earned them a draw at Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hatters stopper produced a fingertip stop to thwart Vadaine Oliver from 12 yards after Haydn Hollis was held in the box.
Then from the resulting corner, Carl Dickinson hit the crossbar as County pushed hard for a victory that would have cemented their position in the top seven.
Dickinson's miss followed that of Aaron Collins, who clipped the post with a header in the first half as County tried desperately to make home advantage count.
But in truth it was a game in which defences were largely on top, with Hollis having an outstanding game in the heart of the hosts' defence.
It meant Luton's threat was limited but in the time he was on the pitch, Jack Marriott looked Luton's best hope of a goal. Twice in the first half he had shots, both of which were just off target as honours ended even at Meadow Lane.
