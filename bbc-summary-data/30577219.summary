Free trees given away by Berkshire council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Berkshire council is giving away thousands of free trees in a bid to make its towns and villages more green.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has 5,000 saplings on offer which residents can collect on a first come, first served basis.
Planting guidance and the types of species available can be found on the council's Adopt A Tree website.
The trees can be collected from Braywick Heath Nursery in Maidenhead and elsewhere until 17 January.
Councillor Derek Wilson, cabinet member for planning, said: "These trees will hopefully increase the numbers growing in the borough, particularly within towns and villages where they are most needed, and so improve the environment for all."
To pick up a tree, residents need to bring along a token, printed in the latest issue of Around the Royal Borough council newspaper, or provide evidence they are royal borough residents.
The trees, all one-year-old native species, come with their own shrub guard and compost.
