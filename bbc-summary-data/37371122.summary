[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wales, England & Scotland rise in Fifa world rankings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have risen a place to 10th in the Fifa world rankings, one spot above Spain, following their 4-0 World Cup qualifying win over Moldova.

England are also up one place to 12th after beating Slovakia 1-0.
Scotland's 5-1 triumph in Malta means they are the biggest climbers among the home nations, up seven spots to 44th.
However, after their 0-0 draw with the Czech Republic, Northern Ireland are down two slots to 30th, a place above the Republic of Ireland.
Wales went into the top 10 for the first time in July 2015 and reached a record eighth in October that year.
In August, 2011 Wales were ranked 117th, but their rise to be alongside some of the world's strongest nations included qualifying the 2016 European Championship.
It was the nation's first major tournament since 1958 and they progressed to the semi-finals in France, where they were knocked out by eventual winners Portugal.
