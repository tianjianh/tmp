Southend United 3-0 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Will Atkinson bagged his first two goals of the season to inspire Southend to a 3-0 win against his former side Bradford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Atkinson, without a goal since February, fired the Shrimpers in front before doubling his tally in the second half to help Phil Brown's side make it six League One games without defeat.
The midfielder's first goal came in the 14th minute when he collected a fine through ball from Simon Cox before sending a calm right-footed shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the net.
High-flying Bradford came close to equalising when James Hanson headed Mark Marshall's free-kick against the crossbar before visiting goalkeeper Colin Doyle twice denied Southend midfielder Anthony Wordsworth in the lead up to half-time.
But the Shrimpers, who have not lost at home since August, finally doubled their lead in the 72nd minute when Atkinson drilled an excellent low shot into the bottom left-hand corner.
The hosts sealed their win four minutes from time when Romain Vincelot diverted Marc-Antoine Fortune's right-wing cross into his own net.
