A site in Fareham will be followed by one in Farnborough in early 2017. The other locations are yet to be revealed.
IBM already provides data storage for cloud clients in Britain including Boots, National Express, Dixons Carphone and Travis Perkins.
The government said it was a boost for the technology sector.
IBM, which currently employs 15,000 people across the UK, has not yet revealed how many jobs will be created at the new sites.
They will add to the company's existing cloud facilities in Portsmouth and Chessington, which have been operating for more than five years.
The UK expansion is part of IBM's shift to cloud services.
Robert LeBlanc, of IBM Cloud, said: "IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands."
Minister of State for Digital and Culture Matt Hancock said: "Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business."
