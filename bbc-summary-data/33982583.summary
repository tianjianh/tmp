Memphis Depay: Man Utd forward dazzles in iconic shirt

Memphis Depay's European bow at Old Trafford was so sumptuous that manager Louis van Gaal said he wanted to "kiss" his fellow Dutchman.

And it is easy to see why Van Gaal felt so strongly about his £31m summer signing, who scored twice and set up the other goal in Tuesday's 3-1 win over Club Brugge in the first leg of their Champions League play-off.
Whether it's #Memphis or #Depay - he prefers just Memphis because he does not want to use his father's surname - his performance made him an instant hit inside Old Trafford.
Since Cristiano Ronaldo's departure in 2009, Manchester United have struggled to find a worthy heir to the number seven shirt, but the search may finally be over.
The number seven shirt has an iconic status at Old Trafford - as well as Ronaldo, think George Best, David Beckham and Eric Cantona.
Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia and Angel Di Maria have all worn it and failed to live up to the expectations.
But the heavily tattooed Depay, who was signed from PSV Eindhoven in the summer, reportedly told Van Gaal he wanted the number on his back.
He was quick to add this message to his Twitter account after his impressive European debut for United.

Van Gaal, who coached Depay at the 2014 World Cup, had described the Netherlands forward as "one of the greatest players of his generation" when he signed him in June.
And he was feeling the love again after Tuesday's match.
"I want to kiss him tonight," the United manager said.
"He's never satisfied. I like that. You have to know what you are doing and also what you can do and then your desire to improve is higher. And that's Memphis."
Depay doesn't lack confidence and seemed to find his feet on a classic European night under the Old Trafford floodlights.
But he still felt this was room for improvement when discussing his own performance.
"I'm happy that I scored, and of course I'm happy that we won," said Depay, Eredivisie's top scorer last season with 22 goals.
"But I must admit I'm a bit disappointed because I could have scored the last two chances and got a hat-trick.
"I will think about that tonight and forget about it tomorrow."
As impressive as Depay was on Tuesday he failed to surpass Rooney's first appearance in a United shirt 11 years ago.
After completing his £27m move from Everton in the summer of 2004, Rooney scored a hat-trick on his debut against Fenerbahce.
The only thing Depay may want to work on after his performance was his celebration.
Twitter users were not kind to the Dutchman who attempted to try a dance move from the video to Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae) by American rapper Silento.
Thankfully Depay's team-mates cut him off before he could really get into the dance. His whip may need some work.
