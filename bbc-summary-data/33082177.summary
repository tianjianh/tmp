Samuel Tweed: Newtownards pensioner admits 1974 court escape and guns offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner who escaped from a court more than 40 years ago has appeared back in court where he pleaded guilty to the escape and possessing weapons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Tweed, from Mark Street in Newtownards, County Down, is now 73 years old.
He escaped from custody at Belfast Magistrates' Court in May 1974 where he had been facing firearms charges.
He had been arrested in connection with the discovery of a weapons cache in the city the previous month, April 1974.
The haul included 10 revolvers, nine pistols, a sawn-off shotgun and assorted ammunition.
He was re-arrested in September 2012 and was later charged in court over the 1974 escape and having guns and ammunition with intent.
At Belfast Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, he was re-arraigned on three charges of having guns and ammunition and escaping from custody.
He pleaded guilty to all three charges.
Tweed had faced two further firearms charges but a prosecution barrister asked the court not to proceed with those, in light of Tweed's guilty pleas to the other offences.
The judge released him on continuing bail pending pre-sentence reports.
Tweed is due to be sentenced at the end of August.
