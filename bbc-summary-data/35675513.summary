The victory was the first time Burnley had beaten Rovers at Turf Moor in 38 years and took them a point above Middlesbrough, who beat Wolves 2-1 on Friday night.
Paul Lambert's visitors might feel aggrieved they did not get anything from the game, having had 15 attempts to Burnley's eight and being dominant in the second half.
Blackburn also felt they should have been awarded a first-half penalty when Hope Akpan went down under the challenge of Stephen Ward, while Heaton was again on hand to deny Bennett's low drive in the second period.
Michael Keane did have a late chance to seal it for the hosts, but the centre-back scuffed Scott Arfield's delivery when free in the area as Sean Dyche's side held on to a hard-fought win.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "That's my sixth Lancashire derby and I've not seen a decent one yet.
"They've always been tight affairs and we thought it might be that type of game again.
"It was cagey and awkward but obviously I'm delighted we came out on top and it is fantastic for the town and the fans. For me it's three points and another win but for the town it is a different thing."
Blackburn boss Paul Lambert: "I thought we should have won. We were brilliant on Tuesday and we were great today.
"I'm sitting here totally relaxed because I thought we played a right good game against a side who have a lot of Premier League players and have more money than us.
"You wouldn't have noticed the points difference today and that's the level I want my players to play at."
