[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old ex-West Ham and Bradford player has not made a first-team appearance since featuring for Dagenham & Redbridge in September 2015.
Since then Hines has had surgery twice on the same knee, but has recently been on trial with Phil Brown's Shrimpers.
Hines, released by the Daggers in May, comes in following injuries to Southend forwards Nile Ranger and Simon Cox.
Both came off with knocks in Saturday's 2-0 win at Oldham.
