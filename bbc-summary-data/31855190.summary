The 27-year-old former England Saxons player made his senior debut in 2009 and has played 17 times for Dai Young's Wasps side so far this season.
"We are delighted to bring a player of Tom's quality and experience to the squad," Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys told the club website.
"I have always enjoyed playing at Kingsholm," former Saracens Academy member Lindsay added.
"It is a great, traditional rugby venue and, with the city hosting World Cup matches, it is going to be a great place to be next season.
"I was very impressed with David Humphreys' vision for the future of the club and it will be good to be part of it."
Meanwhile, former Gloucester and England hooker Neil McCarthy has joined Gloucester as the club's new head of academy.
"I felt the time was right to move back," McCarthy told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
He played for Gloucester between 2000 and 2002 and had been head of academy at Leicester Tigers since 2008.
