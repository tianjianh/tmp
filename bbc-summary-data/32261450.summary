A man driving a private ambulance has died in a crash with a double decker bus and a car in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dead driver was not a member of ambulance staff, police said, and working out how he was in the ambulance would form part of their inquiries.
The Coastliner bus driver was seriously injured in the crash on the A64 at Flaxton, near York, at about 20:30 BST.
Five of the 16 passengers on the bus and one of two people in the Toyota Yaris car were also taken to hospital.
Yorkshire Ambulance Service said they could not confirm who the private ambulance belonged to but said it was not an NHS vehicle.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said there was nobody else in the vehicle with him.
The bus driver was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, with serious but not life-threatening leg and abdominal injuries. The emergency services said the passengers were taken to hospitals in York and Scarborough and their injuries were also not life-threatening.
The ambulance service said it was thought other passengers may have gone to hospital without their assistance and about four people received attention for minor injuries at the scene.
The A64 has been closed while collision investigators examine the scene and police said it would remain shut for some time. They asked motorists to avoid the A64 near York.
North Yorkshire Police are asking anyone who witnessed the crash or saw either of the vehicles before the collision, to contact them.
