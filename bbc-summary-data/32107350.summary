The Football Association of Zambia (Faz) has confirmed it is looking for a foreign coach to replace current national team boss Honour Janza.

Janza was appointed as Chipolopolo coach last August after the departure of Patrice Beaumelle.
He was in charge of Zambia at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, where the team suffered a first round elimination.
But Faz president Kalusha Bwalya said Janza will soon be replaced.
the decision was made to find a foreign coach who will fit the national team profile
"The Faz executive committee sat and evaluated the performance of the technical bench and the decision was made to find a foreign coach who will fit the national team profile," Bwalya told the body's annual general meeting on Saturday.
"Janza still needs more training. We should not be blind that we put a local coach just for the sake of it."
Janza, who has been working as coach without a contract, will still be involved with the Zambia set-up after his successor is employed. Bwalya said Janza would revert to his initial position as Faz technical director.
Meanwhile, Zambian clubs have rejected a proposal that required officials who wished to stand for the Faz presidency to have first served on the executive as well as pay a nomination fee of approximately $3,000.
It comes as the association gears up for elections next year.
The controversial proposals drew widespread disapproval, with record 12-time Zambian champions Nkana one of the teams against the ideas.
"We feel people must be ushered in offices based on their capabilities and proven performance and not through underhand methods such as systematic barring of potential candidates," Nkana said in a statement.
"With regard to the proposed non-refundable astronomical fees to participate in Faz elections, this is a big joke that must be rejected by all sober-minded and football-loving fans and administrators."
Bwalya dispelled assertions that the proposals were meant to make him president of the association for life.
"We are democratic and if people feel the current constitution is okay, then the executive committee has no problem," Bwalya told delegates.
"It is not our intention to make councillors doubt the executive committee. We are here to serve you and if you feel it's not the right time, we have to abide by your decision.
"It is not my intention to be president for life."
Bwalya has been at the helm since 2008,  and the Faz constitution has no restrictions on how long one can be president.
