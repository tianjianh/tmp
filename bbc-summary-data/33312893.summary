James Gregoire died after being stabbed in Rosemary Road, Clacton in April.
Darren Gilbert, 22, of Holland Road in the town appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to murder. He will be sentenced in July.
Speaking of Gilbert, Essex Police said Clacton would be "safer for his incarceration".
Officers were forced to restrict access to the town centre following a fight in several streets late on 13 April, which culminated in the fatal stabbing of Mr Gregoire.
Gilbert was found after a manhunt and was arrested the following morning.
Det Insp Morgan Cronin, the senior investigating officer in the case, said: "I am pleased that Darren Gilbert decided to plead guilty due to the weight of evidence there was against him.
"This prevented the family of James Gregoire having to go through the emotional strain of a trial.
"While the verdict cannot bring James back I hope this brings them a form of closure to their tragic loss."
