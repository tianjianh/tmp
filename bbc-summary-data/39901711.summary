The 26-year-old, from Leeds, who won gold medals in both cycling and athletics in Rio last year, received the award at Buckingham Palace.
Cox had her UK Sport funding suspended in January while she took part in Channel 4 programme The Jump.
After receiving her award, she said: "Bonkers probably sums up my year. It has been crazy."
Posting on Twitter, the athlete said: "Always nice to have a chin wag with Prince William."
Ms Cox, who was presented with her MBE by the Duke of Cambridge, said: "Winning a gold medal [at the Paralympics] has been my aim for God knows how long, and then I win two plus a couple of others. This led to honours and I got to do loads of fun things like being on The Jump."
"It has been an amazing few months and now I am back at uni and training. I am now back to reality," she added.
Ms Cox, who had a stroke aged 23, and was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, became the first Briton since 1988 to win a medal in two sports at the same Paralympics.
She also took athletics silver in the 4x100m relay and bronze in the 100m, and she was picked to be Britain's flagbearer at the Rio closing ceremony.
Ms Cox said she is now aiming to compete in the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo.
She is also aiming to compete in the two-man bobsleigh at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in 2022.
