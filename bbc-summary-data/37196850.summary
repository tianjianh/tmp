[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall have signed young defender Kevin Toner from neighbours Aston Villa on a five-month loan until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year old Irishman, who can help cover the absence of left-back Rico Henry, is Saddlers boss Jon Whitney's 14th signing of the summer.
This is Toner's second loan move from Villa Park, having played six times for Kidderminster Harriers last season.
He played in Ireland for Ashbourne United and Home Farm before joining Villa in 2012.
"Kevin is an aggressive, front-foot defender who has quality on the ball," said Whitney. "He offers natural balance, a left-footer who can play at left-back."
He joins a Walsall side who have made an indifferent start to the season, having picked up just one point from their three League One games since winning on the opening weekend.
Henry's shoulder dislocation is not as bad as first feared, He is not yet back in training but, following MRI scans, the club now hope he will be out a case of weeks, rather than months
