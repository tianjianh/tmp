[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 1-1 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone salvaged a draw with York in a battle of the National League strugglers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon Parkin fired rock-bottom York into a third-minute lead by prodding Sean Newton's cross past Lee Worgan at the near post.
Parkin nearly doubled York's advantage 10 minutes later, but this time his close-range effort went wide, before Reece Prestedge equalised for Maidstone with a fine drilled effort from the edge of the area just after the break.
Maidstone have now won just one of their last nine games, while York are unbeaten in four, up to second from bottom and now three points off safety.
