OECD: Eurozone shows 'tentative' signs of recovery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The eurozone is showing "tentative" signs of recovery, according to the latest report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The OECD researches economics for the 30 nations that make up its membership.
For the eurozone, its leading indicator of economic activity rose in January and also turned positive for Britain.
The United States and Japan also continued to show signs of a pick-up.
"The United States and Japan continue to drive the overall position but stronger, albeit tentative, signals are beginning to emerge within all other major OECD economies and the euro area as a whole," the OECD said.
However, Brazil and China showed signs of weakness in January, according to the OECD report.
The OECD publishes its Composite Leading Indicators every month. The measure is designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity.
