The 16 lifeboats on duty during Saturday's Round the Island Race helped rescue one man overboard, two people with head injuries, one person with sea sickness and one with a broken arm.
The Portland coastguard helicopter also airlifted a competitor with a head injury and a member of lifeboat crew.
One of the competing yachts also had to be rescued after running aground off Ventnor.
The coastguard said the independent lifeboat from Sandown and the RNLI lifeboat from Bembridge towed the stricken vessel to safety after it became lodged on rocks.
More than 1,500 vessels took part in the annual event, which began and ended in Cowes.
More than 100 retired before completing the circuit.
