A post-mortem on singer and entertainer Cilla Black has failed to find a cause of death, reports from Spain suggest.

The late singer and entertainer died at her Spanish holiday home on Saturday, aged 72. Police say the indications point towards natural causes.
A spokeswoman for Andalucia's high court of justice, which is overseeing the investigation, said an accident may have contributed to her death.
It is believed she was discovered on her balcony by her son.
BBC News correspondent Robert Hall - who is in the resort of Estepona where Black lived - said paramedics arrived at around 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) but were unable to save her.
A report in The Sun claimed Black may have become dizzy after walking from an air-conditioned room in to midday heat.
It quoted a source close to the investigation as saying medical examiners would look at marks on her arm and elbow that could be linked to a fall.
But the judicial spokeswoman told the Guardian no firm conclusions had been drawn on the cause of death.
"From the facts that the police brought to the judge, there is no indication that would suggest any kind of violence precipitated her death," the spokeswoman said.
"This needs to be confirmed by the post mortem, but the evidence gathered by the police suggests that she died of natural causes, but that her death might have been provoked by an accident.
"At this stage, we can't know if she banged into something and this provoked her death - these are just theories at this point."
Born Priscilla Maria Veronica White, the Liverpudlian first found fame as a singer in the 1960s, with a string of top 10 hits including Anyone Who Had a Heart and You're My World.
Her career focus shifted to television in 1968, when she was given her own BBC One primetime series, and she went on to host Blind Date and Surprise Surprise for ITV.
Tributes to the star poured in from the world of entertainment after news of her death was announced on Sunday.
Sir Paul McCartney called her "a lovely girl who infected everyone with her great spirit" while Sir Bruce Forsyth said she would be "sadly missed".
Sir Cliff Richard said he had been due to visit her at her house in Spain next week. "Her passing away is a particular shock because despite the aches and pains we all suffer, she was always so upbeat," he said.
Hundreds of fans queued up to sign a book of condolence at Liverpool's town hall on Monday.
Friends said Black's health had been failing in recent months. She suffered from arthritis and both her hearing and eyesight were faltering.
Former EastEnders star Barbara Windsor told the BBC: "I've seen her twice in the last few weeks, and as always she looked immaculate. That was the thing about Cilla, she always looked spot-on.
"But I knew she wasn't very well, she didn't seem well."
In one of her final interviews, conducted in June, Black said: "I don't even sing in the shower these days, never mind touring."
"I'm too old. I can't do it like I did," she told Canadian DJ Robbie Lane on the Zoomeradio's British Invasion Show.
"I know Paul McCartney still does it, but he's an old ham! I've paid my dues. I think I deserve a little bit of rest."
"I'm content with what I have done and what I have achieved."
Black also expressed astonishment when Lane informed her that Anyone Who Had A Heart had been the UK's biggest-selling single by a female artist in the 1960s.
"I'm 72 years of age and for all that time I didn't know," she said.
"Well, I never. I can die happy now," she added with a chuckle.
