Belfast City Council is unveiling initial designs for Andersonstown, Brook and the Robinson centres.
Andersonstown will focus mainly on water-based family fun. Brook will get a new pool and an outdoor centre of excellence for gaelic games and soccer.
The Robinson Centre is to become an aquatic centre of excellence for the city.
In a statement, the council said the initial plans were part of its £105m leisure transformation programme.
The designs were drawn up following consultation with local communities and advice from experts.
All three centres will have a fitness suite, sports hall and exercise studio.
The council said that designs can be viewed until 1 October.
It is also hosting drop-in sessions to allow the public to respond to the proposals.
Earlier this year, some employees at 14 of the city's leisure centres went on strike over pay, pension and staffing issues.
In 2015, the Robinson Centre in east Belfast was closed after asbestos was found in the building.
