Crews were called to the property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan, just after 07:30 on Saturday.
The single-storey, mid-terrace house was "well alight" when they arrived at the scene.
The occupants were treated for severe smoke inhalation at the scene before being taken to hospital.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said: "Crews in breathing apparatus entered the burning property and managed to rescue two people from the house."
Appliances from Maybole, Girvan, Colmonell and the aerial rescue platform from Ayr remained at the scene on Saturday morning.
The SFRS said it would be working with Police Scotland to determine the circumstances surrounding the fire.
