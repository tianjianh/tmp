The 27-year-old has made 82 appearances for Dai Young's side since joining the Premiership side in 2012.
"He is a proven and experienced tight-head who will give us strength in depth in a key position," Quins boss John Kingston said.
"He has displayed a real hunger to be a regular starter and I have no doubt he will provide strong competition."
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Swainston's contract at the Twickenham Stoop.
