The Livingston-based company saw revenue climb by 11% last year to Â£15m.
The firm said growth was strongest in Germany and France, where its "i-limb" technology has been approved and funded by French health authorities.
A spin-out from the UK's NHS, Touch is backed by Archangel Investors and Scottish Enterprise.
Its products are designed for people with upper limb deficiencies.
Its range includes prosthetic hands that can be controlled via a mobile app.
Chief executive Ian Stevens said: "We are pleased with our 2015 performance and are proud that there have now been more than 5,000 i-limb wearers fitted worldwide.
"In 2015, we introduced the i-limb quantum and i-digits quantum hands, both of which can be controlled using simple gestures and are stronger and faster than their predecessors.
"We anticipate continued growth from sales of these electronic prosthetic hands and partial hands in 2016."
