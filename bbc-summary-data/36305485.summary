Photographer Olivia Acland has been documenting the barber shops that line nearly every busy street in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
Most people will tell you that they have a trusted hairdresser who they visit on a regular basis. Geoffrey, a 29-year old tour guide, said:  "Appearance is very important in Sierra Leone, people want to make sure their hair looks good."
Barbers also take on the role of counsellors, listening to clients agonise over their love lives or confide in them about family crises. The barber shop provides a safe space for people to sit back and unwind - after all, it's important to feel relaxed as someone takes a knife to your chin or a pair of scissors to your head.
