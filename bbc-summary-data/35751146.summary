The midfielder broke the deadlock with a right-footed finish after combining with Alex MacDonald and Liam Sercombe.
He doubled the lead after the break by running on to George Waring's pass for a low finish past Liam O'Brien.
Substitute Danny Hylton hit the bar before MacDonald headed in number three and Roofe completed his treble late on for the second-placed U's.
Oxford consolidated their automatic promotion push following defeat against Leyton Orient on Saturday while Dagenham are nine points adrift of safety at the bottom with nine games remaining.
