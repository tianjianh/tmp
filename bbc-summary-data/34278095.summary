The Edinburgh-based firm said revenues also fell by 29% to Â£14.5m.
Its Asia Pacific market was hardest hit, following a record performance in the previous period.
Latin America also saw a "significant decline", after "rapid" spending cuts by the Brazilian oil and gas market.
IndigoVision manufactures IP video security equipment for end-users such as airports, ports, casinos, police, prisons and governments.
On a positive note, the firm reported a 22% increase in sales in the UK market, which was boosted by police and safe city projects.
The company also said it secured "major" project wins in Colombia, as well as with a leading bank in Egypt and a large casino in the USA.
Chief executive Marcus Kneen said: "As we announced in April, trading in the first half has been challenging, but Latin America and the Middle East are now starting to show an improving sales trend.
"The group's activity is weighted towards enterprise markets where revenues are materially impacted by project timing and the wider economic backdrop, and these factors affected the first half performance.
"The group has a stronger pipeline of large projects for the second half of the year, predominantly from the Middle East and the Americas.
"Exciting new products were launched this period including FrontLine, the first body-worn video to be fully integrated into core video management software, giving users synchronised playback of both their fixed and body worn cameras from any location.
"Although the first half was disappointing, IndigoVision is in a good position to progress in the second half."
