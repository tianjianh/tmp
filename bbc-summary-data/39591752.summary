Hogan missed the crushing opening defeat of the season inside two days against Northamptonshire.
The Australian fast bowler comes into the 13-man squad instead of Owen Morgan.
Will Bragg, Timm van der Gugten, Graham Wagg, Ruadhri Smith and Kieran Bull are still unavailable through injury.
Glamorgan batsman Colin Ingram promised an improvement after the opening defeat.
"It was a poor start to say the least but I feel like during the week the guys have worked really hard," said Ingram.
"There is definitely a lot to prove and the guys are ready to go."
Australian seamer John Hastings is set to make his debut for a Worcestershire team under the fresh captaincy of Joe Leach, with Daryl Mitchell returning to the ranks.
Glamorgan (from): J Rudolph (c), N Selman, D Lloyd, C Ingram, C Cooke, A Donald, K Carlson, C Meschede, A Salter, M De Lange, M Hogan, L Carey, H Podmore.
Worcestershire (from): D Mitchell, B D'Oliveira, T Fell, J Clarke, T Kohler-Cadmore, B Cox, J Leach (c), E Barnard, J Hastings, J Tongue, J Shantry, G Rhodes.
