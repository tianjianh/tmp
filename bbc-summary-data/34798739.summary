Police officers came to the aid of an elderly couple who dialled 999 because they were lonely - and made them both a cup of tea.

The two Greater Manchester Police officers were sent to the home of Fred Thomson and his 95-year-old wife Doris in Middleton.
GMP Middleton tweeted: "Just dealt with a 95 year old couple who called the Police as they were lonely.
"What else could we do but make them a brew and have a chat."
Mr Thomson said he was touched by the officers' care saying that he felt like his home had been "locked off from everything".
He added: "You feel somebody cares and oh that does matter... simple things they talk about, nothing very special but they showed that they cared by being there and talking to you."
The officers, PCs Stu Ockwell and Andy Richardson, spent 30 minutes with the couple, putting the kettle on while they spoke to Mr Thomson.
Asked if the police should be spending time on such calls, PC Ockwell replied: "It's neighbourhood policing for me."
PC Richardson added: "We've got to look after people as well, it's not just fighting crime, it's protecting people in whatever situation they find themselves."
They received a series of supportive tweets from members of the public.
James McAuley tweeted: "@gmpolice hats off to Stu Ockwell guys. An amazing story and a very noble guy. Fred & Doris need more like him!"
And Ash Daswani tweeted: "@GMPMiddleton Just read the article about what you did for the elderly couple. Thank you for the wonderful job you all do..."
Juha Remes tweeted: "@GMPMiddleton Excellent job! It makes me so sad that the elderly get so lonely, but I am happy there are still people like you who care."
