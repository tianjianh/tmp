The US singer-songwriter will headline the Thursday night of the festival at Glanusk Park, Powys, on 15 August.
Kings Of Convenience, Band of Horses and Ben Howard have already been named as the four-day event's other headliners.
Smith is also among the acts chosen by Yoko Ono to play this month's Meltdown Festival at London's Southbank.
Other acts booked for this year's Green Man festival include The Horrors, Midlake, Local Natives, Edwyn Collins and John Cale.
Among the other prominent acts appearing are Roy Harper, The Pastels, Stornoway, and Johnny Flynn and The Sussex Wit.
Founded in 2003, Green Man has become one of the most popular alternative festivals.
In 2012 it won best "grass roots" event at the UK Festival Awards.
The festival, held annually near Crickhowell, was a sell-out last year with about 15,000 people attending.
Previous headliners have included legendary Belfast-born blues and rock singer Van Morrison, ex-Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Fleet Foxes, Super Furry Animals, Jarvis Cocker and Doves.
