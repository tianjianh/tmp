The fee for the 27-year-old Argentine, who scored 16 goals for the Seagulls in all competitions last season, could reach £10m based on appearances.
Brighton chairman Tony Bloom said the Championship club accepted a record fee after Ulloa made it clear he wanted to play in the Premier League.
"It was then a case of ensuring we received our valuation," he said.
Ulloa joined Brighton on a four-and-a-half-year deal from Spanish side Almeria for about £2m in January 2013.
Championship winners Leicester's previous record buy was Ade Akinbiyi, whom they bought for £5.5m in July 2000.
Brighton's previous record sale was midfielder Liam Bridcutt's £3m move to Sunderland in January.
