A woman whose son has a form of autism said he is not an "auction product" after waiting nearly a year for him to be placed in a school.

Mei-Ling Chan's nine-year-old son, Stanley, has Asperger's syndrome and has spent the past 10 months at home in Ponsanooth, Cornwall.
Cornwall Council said in a statement that "children with specific needs may require a specialist placement".
Miss Chan said her son had a "right" to go to school and has contacted her MP.
Miss Chan said Stanley was expelled from a school in November 2014 after reacting violently to a prolonged spell of bullying.
He attended a three-day familiarisation visit at another school in March but it ended prematurely because the staff were unable to cope with his behaviour.
In cases like Stanley's, the local authority asks schools to "express an interest in having a pupil placed with them" and once expressions of interest have been received all are considered before a final decision is made by the council's children's services authority.
The council said if no "expression of interest" was forthcoming, it would continue to search for appropriate provision by repeating the process and it could "potentially widen the geographical search".
"They've put my son out to be bid on by other schools," Miss Chan said.
"My son is a human, not an auction product - you can't auction your child off to schools."
"Yes my son has a disability, but he has the right to go to school and, if it was any other child, they get commissioned into a school within three weeks - my son's taken nearly a year and it's not right, it's absolutely not right."
The spokesperson from the office of Miss Chan's MP, George Eustice, said it had taken up the case with Cornwall Council on her behalf and will "continue to work with both parties to achieve a satisfactory outcome".
