Sales of the Raspberry Pi will go past that figure this month, said the Raspberry Pi project founder Eben Upton.
The milestone comes as the Raspberry Pi 3 is unveiled featuring new updates, including wi-fi and Bluetooth.
"We're calling it," said Mr Upton. "We're the best-selling UK computer ever."
The updated device also has a 64-bit processor onboard that gives the Pi 3 a 50% performance improvement on the Pi 2.
The release of the Raspberry Pi 3 on 29 February and it will go on sale for Â£30.
The Pi was designed to make computer code writing easy and first released in 2012.
The gadget is starting to be used widely in schools, "with 9-11 year-olds, we are seeing a lot of people get excited about it at that level," said Mr Upton.
