Volunteers are invited to work on the Talyllyn Railway in roles including on the locomotives, as a guard, on the tracks and as a museum attendant.
The railway, which has operated since the 1860s out of Tywyn, was saved from closure by enthusiasts in 1951.
Ian Drummond, of Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society, said volunteers did not need to be railway enthusiasts.
"For many of our folk, volunteering on the railway gives a sense of contributing to something worthwhile which brings enjoyment to thousands of people each year," he said.
"Others love being part of a community or having the chance to build self-esteem. Indeed many have found that the experience they have gained on the railway has benefitted them in their careers."
