[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 3-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton picked up their first win in nearly two months after thrashing Coventry at The Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals by Ricky Holmes, Ademola Lookman and Josh Magennis saw off the Sky Blues, who remain bottom of League One.
Charlton and Coventry fans marched to the ground together in a pre-match protest against their respective owners, Roland Duchatelet and Sisu.
As soon as the game kicked off, there was a six-minute stoppage in play after home and away supporters threw thousands of toy pigs onto the pitch.
Both teams hit the woodwork in the first half, but it was Charlton who took the lead in the 32nd minute when Fredrik Ulvestad's lobbed pass found Holmes, who poked the ball home.
Charlton goalkeeper Declan Rudd made a sublime double save early in the second half when he stopped Andre Wright's effort, then got back up to push Chris McCann's header away from goal.
The game was over with 12 minutes to go when Magennis unselfishly squared the ball to Lookman, who fired past Lee Burge.
The Northern Ireland international then scored himself in the 88th minute when he chipped over the helpless Coventry stopper to seal Charlton's first league victory since 20 August.
