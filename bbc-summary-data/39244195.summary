The 26-year-old Scot had previously won eight other world championship medals but clocked two minutes 54.369 seconds, to win the title, 0.12 seconds ahead of Canada's Marianne St-Gelais in second.
She also reached the 500m final, but finished last of the four competitors.
Christie has the chance of another gold in the 1000m on Sunday.
"I never expected to win the 1500,'' said Christie.
The world title represents an impressive resurgence from Christie, who said she was considering her future in the sport after being disqualified from all three of her events at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.
Livingston-born Christie has been focusing on the shorter distance events this season and has already set a new 500m world record of 42.335 seconds.
In the 1500m final, South Korea's Shim Suk-hee was third with her compatriot and defending champion Choi Min-jeong a distant fifth.
Christie was unable to challenge in the 500m final, recording a time of 43.835 seconds, with China's Kexin Fan winning in 43.605.
