One lane of the M4 in Monmouthshire has reopened after a five-vehicle crash.

The collision happened on the westbound carriageway between junction 23, Magor, and junction 24, Coldra, at about 15:25 BST.
Gwent Police said four people were believed to have been injured but the extent of their injuries is not known.
Earlier on Saturday, two people were taken to hospital following a crash at the same junction between a vehicle towing a horsebox and a motorbike.
That crash saw motorists face delays of up to 60 minutes as the exit slip road was closed - it was later reopened at 13:45.
The delays were not helped by the closure of the M48 Severn Bridge in both directions, which has been shut all weekend for maintenance work.
