[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny Newton opened the scoring in the 37th minute with a clever chip, while Jonathan Smith made it two on the stroke of half-time.
After the break, substitute Ben Kennedy curled a sublime third into the top corner, with virtually his first kick after coming off the bench.
Danny Collins nodded home a late consolation for Grimsby, who had former Gateshead man Sam Jones sent off for an off-the-ball incident in the 58th minute.
It was Grimsby's third red card in as many games this season, following the dismissals of Zak Mills and James Berrett earlier in the campaign.
Early on, a free-kick from Grimsby midfielder Luke Summerfield was clawed back from the line. However, there were plenty in blue who thought it had gone in.
It proved to be a rare moment of excitement for the visitors, though, who fell to their second successive defeat.
