The Citizens are in fourth position in the Welsh Premier League - three points behind second-placed Connah's Quay.
The club said the former Wales international had not been offered a full-time contract and wished him well.
Legg, who played for Swansea City and Cardiff City, was appointed manager on 1 August, succeeding Neville Powell who had been in charge for nine years.
Legg said nothing in football surprises him.
"They didn't see me as a long-term manager and didn't offer me a contract. So they saw fit to go with someone full time and didn't see me as that man," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"That's football, nothing surprises me.
"I have gone there, done a reasonable job and they are three points off a European place, so I haven't left them in a bad position.
"I wish them all the best in the future, there are no hard feelings from me.
"They have made the decision and there were no issues on my side."
Bangor said in a statement that Legg was removed from his position as he was unable to commit to a full-time contract due to his "personal circumstances and broadcasting commitments."
