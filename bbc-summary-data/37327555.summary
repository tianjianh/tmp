The device was towed by a Navy bomb disposal team to a detonation site in the Solent, where a controlled explosion was carried out at 08:45 BST.
Some trains were halted and early ferries were delayed, following the find on Friday afternoon.
Wightlink Ferries said services were now back on schedule.
The train line between Portsmouth and Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour has also re-opened.
A spokesman for Portsmouth's Queen's Harbour Master said: "We worked very hard to make sure the harbour was not closed.
"There were restrictions put in place for public safety and there was a certain amount of disruption to vessels earlier while the torpedo was towed out."
Dredging work is being carried out in Portsmouth harbour to allow the the navy's new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers to dock.
Three million cubic metres of sea bed is being removed to deepen and widen a 4 mile (7km) channel.
HMS Queen Elizabeth is due to be handed over to the MoD in 2016 ahead of being put into service in 2020.
