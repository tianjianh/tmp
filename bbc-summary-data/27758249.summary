[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The United States regained the Curtis Cup with a 13-7 win over Great Britain & Ireland in Missouri.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Great Britain & Ireland, who won the trophy in 2012, needed to overturn a 9.5-2.5 deficit on the final day to pull off an unlikely victory.
Georgia Hall, Gemma Dryburgh, Charlotte Thomas and Stephanie Meadow all earned singles wins for GB&I in the biennial amateur tournament.
But Emma Talley, Ally McDonald and Annie Park sealed victory for the US.
Talley, the US amateur champion, scored the trophy-clinching point with a 4&3 win over Bronte Law.
Talley said: "This was the best week ever. We all wanted to play for each other this week and we all did that."
