[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Buxton headed in a late winner to earn Wigan a vital league win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.

After a scrappy game the defender rose highest to power in Max Power's corner and move the Latics into 22nd place, just two points from safety.
Wolves went close through Dave Edwards, but Wigan goalkeeper Matt Gilks produced a great save to palm the Wales midfielder's header away.
The hosts have now lost three straight Championship matches and stay 18th.
Going into the fixture Wolves had won just one of their last five league games at Molineux against Wigan and struggled to fashion chances despite enjoying 59% possession.
Bright Enobakhare threatened, but Paul Lambert's side lacked cutting edge in the final third and were punished late on from a set-piece.
Buxton headed in a first goal since February 2015 to put Wigan ahead from just their second shot on target and Gilks tipped over Connor Ronan's 30-yard effort to make sure of the points.
The victory sees Wigan move up one place past Blackburn Rovers, who suffered a 2-1 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday.
Wolves boss Paul Lambert:
"I'm like everyone else, disappointed and angry with the way that we performed.
"We never did enough, that's for sure; it wasn't good enough. We were too passive, we never dominated the ball and were not aggressive enough with or without the ball.
"Normally my teams come out of the traps and that is the disappointing thing. If you don't do things right then you will get beat. We have to be better than that."
Wigan manager Warren Joyce:
"It was a tough game against a good side and the game could have gone either way, but in the end we have ended up with three points and we have got that really through effort, endeavour, bravery and guts.
"We have had a few kicks in the teeth and it shows a lot of character to come to a place like Wolves and stand up to them with the backing that they have got from the supporters and the stadium here."
