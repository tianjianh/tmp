Planet Earth II was a hit with viewers when it aired last year - and now it seems to have wowed Bafta as well.

The BBC One nature documentary has received nine nominations ahead of its annual Craft Awards, which celebrate behind the scenes talent in television.
Netflix drama The Crown follows with seven nominations, while the BBC's The Night Manager gets six.
The winners will be announced on 23 April, three weeks ahead of the Bafta Television Awards on 14 May.
Here's a rundown of which programmes are up for what.
The landmark natural history series receives two nominations apiece in the editing: factual and sound: factual categories and is also up for the original music prize.
Its remaining four nominations are all in the photography: factual category, which means the show is guaranteed to take home at least one award.
Netflix's epic chronicle of the early years in The Queen's reign sees Stephen Daldry and Peter Morgan recognised for their direction and writing respectively.
It's also got nominations for its costume design, production design and its photography and lighting, with additional nods going to its visual effects and titles.
The BBC's gripping adaptation of John le Carre's novel gets a best director nod for Susanne Bier and is also recognised for its sound and editing.
Like The Crown, it has also landed nominations for its production design, visual effects and titles.
With mutton chops like the ones Paul Dano sported in the series, it is hardly surprising the BBC's lavish adaptation of Tolstoy's novel is up for best make up and hair design.
Its other nominations come for its music, sound, production design and visual effects.
Charlie Brooker's nightmarish satire moved from Channel 4 to Netflix last year, a move that's clearly gone down well with the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
Seamus McGarvey gets a nomination for his photography on the Nosedive episode that starred Bryce Dallas Howard (above), while other instalments get shout-outs for their costume design, their visual effects and their make up and hair design.
Channel 4's topical drama about a TV personality accused of historical sex crimes gets recognised for its direction, editing, music and photography.
