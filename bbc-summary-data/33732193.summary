About 3,000 holidaymakers were inside the leisure complex on Douglas promenade when fire swept through the building on 2 August 1973.
The disaster led to changes in fire regulations in the Isle of Man, the UK and around the world.
Mayor of Douglas Sara Hackman will lay a wreath during the service at the Summerland memorial at 10:00 BST.
A permanent memorial inscribed with the names of all the victims was unveiled in 2013 on the 40th anniversary of the fire.
A one-minute silence will also be observed during a separate ceremony at 19:30 opposite the Summerland site.
Organiser Tina Brennen said: "The perception is that we have forgotten or don't care and I know that is not the case.
"There are thousands of people on this island who remember vividly the fire but the perception is that we have forgotten it because there has been no annual commemorations.
"There are headlines in the UK press about 'an island's forgotten tragedy', an 'island's forgotten shame', and it is none of those things, and I feel that very strongly."
