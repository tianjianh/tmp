As he prepares for a weekend of sell-out comeback shows with his band in Cardiff, Rhys has made the shortlist for American Interior.
The book - which was also a film, album and a live tour - tells of his ancestor John Evans's search for a tribe of Welsh-speaking native Americans.
The winner will be announced next month.
Rhys tells the story of Evans, a Snowdonia farm labourer who left for America in 1792 to search of the mythical Madogwys tribe.
Nominated for the poetry award is Jonathan Edwards, who has already won the Costa Poetry Award last year for My Family and Other Superheroes.
He is among 11 of the 18 authors on the English and Welsh-language shortlists who are there for the first time.
Others include Horatio Clare, who was a "writer in residence" on a freight ship to produce Down to the Sea in Ships.
Patrick McGuiness recalls his childhood in Belgium in Other People's Countries.
Carys Davies is nominated for her series of short stories set around the world, while Cynan Jones's short novel is set in rural Wales on a farm.
