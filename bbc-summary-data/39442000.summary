Judge Anaur Gonz치lez said that the suspect should be freed because he had shown "no carnal intent" when he penetrated a 17-year-old girl with his fingers.
A judicial panel said it would start an investigation into his conduct.
The suspect, Diego Cruz, is expected to be kept in custody pending an appeal by prosecutors.
Mr Cruz is one of four young men suspected of forcing the 17-year-old girl into a car after a New Year's Eve party on 1 January 2015 in the port city of Veracruz.
Judge Gonz치lez said that while Mr Cruz had touched the girl's breasts and "introduced his fingers in her vagina" he did not have a "lascivious" intent nor the intention to "copulate".
The judge ruled that Mr Cruz was therefore not guilty of sexual abuse but of "incidental touching and rubbing" and should not be jailed.
His ruling triggered widespread anger among Mexicans who denounced it on social media and questioned whether he had taken the decision because the family of the suspect was wealthy and influential.
The case, which has been dubbed "Porkys" in reference to a 1981 film featuring a group of high-school students out to lose their virginity, had already received much media coverage after the girl and her father denounced the fact that for months no arrests had been made.
After Judge Gonz치lez's ruling was made public, the hashtag #JuezPorky (#JudgePorky) began trending in Mexico.
The decision by the judicial panel to review all of Judge Gonz치lez's decisions was welcomed by many on social media who published links to the news with the words "justice".
