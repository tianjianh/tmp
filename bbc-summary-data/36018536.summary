The 1990s classic sitcom was a hit around the world and the prequel will air on BBC One this summer.
Howard, who is the sister of comedian Russell Howard, said: "This is a gift of a part... I can't wait to play her."
Set in the late 1950s, a young Hyacinth will be seen desperately trying to force her family to climb the social ladder.
The show will also star Katie Redford as Hyacinth's sister Rose.
In January 2015, Redford was cast as Bethany, Sarah Platt's daughter in Coronation Street, but was dropped after it emerged she gave a false age to win a part as a 14-year-old.
She was actually 25 at the time, but her CV said she was 19.
Hyacinth's father will be played by Game of Thrones and The Full Monty actor, Mark Addy.
He will be seen scraping a living as a part-time brush salesman who travels on a tricycle and also has an alcohol problem.
Young Hyacinth will also feature Tony Gardner (Last Tango In Halifax, Fresh Meat), Debra Stephenson (The Impressions Show), Tim Downie (Toast Of London) and James Wrighton (I Live With Models).
The prequel is being written by Roy Clarke, who was behind the original Keeping Up Appearances series, starring Patricia Routledge.
"Often, even during the elder Hyacinth's reign, I would wonder what this formidable mature lady would have been like as a young woman. Would the Hyacinth powers already be there? Well, to my delight, I've been given the chance to find out," Clarke said.
"I've been allowed to wander into her background and investigate, almost a piece of archaeology really, until there she was - Young Hyacinth in early blossom. I hope those who knew her in her prime will find as much pleasure in this recreation of her as I have."
