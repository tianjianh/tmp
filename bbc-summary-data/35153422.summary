[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Yorkshire PC Lee Lucas, 39, of Prince of Wales Road, Sheffield, also sent "suggestive and flirtatious" messages to vulnerable women.
He admitted eight counts of making indecent images and one of misconduct in a public office at a previous hearing at Sheffield Crown Court.
Lucas shared thousands of messages with eight women during 2013.
The women, some of which were also visited by Lucas, had contacted the force in relation to various incidents including harassment and domestic abuse, the court heard previously.
Lucas, who has been a PC with the force since 2010 and was based at Rotherham Police Station, was found to have had "excessive and unexplained contact" with the women after an internal investigation.
The inquiry also led police to discover he had 1,400 indecent images of children on his computer, the force said.
He was suspended by the force in October following his conviction.
Terry Mann, head of professional standards at South Yorkshire Police, said: "I would like to reassure the public that Lucas was the most serious case out of a very small number of officers who made improper contact with such victims.
"They have all now been dealt with."
