Andrew Humphries filmed the creatures at around 11:30 GMT off the coast of Torquay.
He said: "It was incredible. The two whales were slapping their fins on the water, then one disappeared and the other one came back and breached out of the water a couple of times.
"It was absolutely amazing to see."
He believes they are humpback whales, and there have been regular sightings of the species in the area in recent weeks.
The Sea Watch Foundation, which records sightings of whales, said it was rare for humpbacks to be seen off the UK coastline until recently.
In the last five years sightings have increased from about five per year to between 15 and 30, it said.
