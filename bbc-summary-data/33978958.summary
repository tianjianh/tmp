[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roderick Cameron, 54, from Perth, lost his job when he was found to be nearly three times over the legal alcohol limit.
He was given a two-year ban at Perth Sheriff Court after he admitted driving with excess alcohol in Crieff's West High Street on 22 July.
Sheriff Fiona Tait also fined Cameron Â£360.
Solicitor David Holmes, defending, said: "He has lost his employment. He drove a milk lorry.
"He had been drinking the night before and thought he was fit to drive."
The sheriff noted that Cameron had a previous conviction for drink driving over a decade ago.
