There was a large adult bath, a smaller, shallower and squarer bath used by children, and a paddling pool as well as a slide at one end and a set of diving boards at the other.
Ten years after it closed it was filled in.
Here is some archive footage from Forgotten Abergavenny taken at a 1960s swimming competition, where swimming skills were not the only ones tested.
