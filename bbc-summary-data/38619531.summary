Bradford City 1-1 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Meredith rescued a point for League One promotion-chasers Bradford in a draw with in-form Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meredith tapped home Mark Marshall's pin-point cross on the hour mark to cancel out Lee Gregory's 50th-minute opener.
The Londoners, who stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches in all competitions, had enjoyed the best of the first-half chances.
Steve Morison went close for the visitors with a volley in the fourth minute, before Bradford midfielder Josh Cullen had a shot beaten away by Jordan Archer.
Debutant Jake Cooper and Gregory both hit the Bradford crossbar with headers during a frantic 29th minute.
And the visitors were rewarded when Gregory showed great footwork and balance to create an opening and score shortly after half-time.
Meredith levelled for City 10 minutes later when he poked home Marshall's cross along the six-yard box.
Cullen saw a long-range effort saved before Marshall curled a shot wide as Bradford stepped up the pressure.
Morison had a header saved before Millwall goalkeeper Archer nearly fluffed a well-hit strike by Marshall in the closing stages.
