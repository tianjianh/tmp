[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 1-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Resurgent Oldham gave their League One survival hopes another boost as they battled to a narrow victory over Charlton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics have won five games out of eight since reappointing John Sheridan as manager, while the result was a first defeat of 2017 for mid-table Charlton.
The visitors missed a golden chance after only 15 seconds when Josh Magennis raced clean through on goal but blazed over with just the goalkeeper to beat.
And they were punished in the fourth minute as Chris Taylor fed Ollie Banks, whose sweet first-time drive from 20 yards gave Oldham the lead.
The away side came close to equalising when Jordan Botaka forced a goal-line clearance from defender Brian Wilson, but the Latics almost made it 2-0 as Peter Clarke headed against a post.
The Addicks created a string of chances either side of half-time, only for poor finishing to let them down and home stopper Connor Ripley denied both Patrick Bauer and Jake Forster-Caskey.
Charlton's high tempo made them a regular threat, but Oldham were dangerous on the counter-attack and Lee Erwin should have done better after breaking into the box.
Taylor's angled shot brought a save from Charlton keeper Declan Rudd and, at the other end, Ripley performed late heroics to thwart Bauer and Lee Novak.
