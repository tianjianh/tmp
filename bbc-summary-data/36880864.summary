A teenager who has become the face of a juvenile detention scandal has thanked Australians for their support.

Images of Dylan Voller cuffed to a mechanical restraint chair drew widespread condemnation after they were aired on television.
Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday convened a royal commission to examine treatment of juvenile inmates in the Northern Territory.
In a public letter, Voller said he wanted to make up for his past actions.
"I would just like to thank the whole Australian community for the support you have showed for us boys as well as our families," Voller wrote.
"I would also like to take this opportunity to apologise to the community for my wrongs and I can't wait to get out and make up for them."
The Australian Broadcasting Corp.'s Four Corners programme this week showed footage of teenage offenders stripped naked, assaulted and tear gassed at the Northern Territory's Don Dale Youth Detention Centre.
Voller, who has been convicted of crimes including car theft, robbery and assault, was targeted in a number of incidents.
One of the guards who worked at the juvenile detention centre revealed that Voller had been placed in the restraint chair on multiple occasions.
"I know of three times he was in the restraint chair," said youth detention guard Ben Kelleher.
"Dylan was never so still, he was never so sheepish as he was when he was in that chair. I think he had admitted defeat when it happened.
"I turned up for one shift and Dylan was in the chair and the other two times they were on incident reports I read once I got to work," he said.
What the program showed
In the letter released by his lawyers, Voller also thanked Four Corners for "helping to get the truth out there".
He is eligible for release in August. It will be the first time he has experienced freedom as an adult.
His lawyer called for the young man's immediate release and said his client was "scared for his safety".
The prime minister has refused to widen the scope of the proposed royal commission beyond the Northern Territory, despite pressure from Indigenous groups to do so.
Youth detention rates are three times higher in the Northern Territory than elsewhere in Australia, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
Although the institute does not break down Indigenous youth incarceration rates specifically for the Northern Territory, young Indigenous people across Australia are 26 times more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous youth.
The Northern Territory's attorney-general, John Elferink, has been stripped of his corrections portfolio in the wake of the scandal.
