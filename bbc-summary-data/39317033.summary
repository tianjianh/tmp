Hogg was injured in a collision with team-mate Mark Hudson in the first half of the Terriers' 4-0 Championship defeat by Bristol City on Friday.
The 28-year-old was taken to hospital for treatment before being discharged on Saturday afternoon.
He made 30 league appearances for Town this season to help them to third in the table with nine games to play.
A club statement said: "Although he is expected to miss the rest of the 2016-17 season, the club is happy that Jonathan is in no immediate danger and looks forward to seeing 'Hoggy' back out on the pitch as soon as is safely possible.
"Alongside Jonathan, everyone at the club would like to thank the medical staff at Bristol City and the NHS staff at Bristol Royal Infirmary for ensuring Jonathan was looked after and received appropriate care."
