[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old is no relation to Bill Tupou, who signed a one-year deal with the Super League side in October.
He told BBC Radio Leeds: "It came down to a decision between staying at the Sharks and coming here. I'm really pleased to be here.
"I've always been a fan of watching Super League games because it's an exciting league."
Tupou added: "Brian Smith coached my brother at Newcastle Knights and he said how good he was and I've only heard positive things from other people too.
"I feel refreshed and I'm looking forward to a new start. I'm not coming over for a holiday, I'll be ripping in."
