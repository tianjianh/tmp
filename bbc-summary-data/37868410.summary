Workers priced out of discrimination claims, says TUC

Thousands of workers are being priced out of challenging discrimination or unfair dismissal, according to a trade union body.

Fewer people are taking claims to an employment tribunal because of fees of up to £1,200, the TUC said.
It found that the number of workers filing such cases had fallen from 16,000 a month to 7,000 since the fees were introduced in 2013.
This included a large reduction in cases on sexism, racism and disability.
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady is calling on the government to scrap the tribunal fees because, she said, "people are being priced out of justice".
However, the Ministry of Justice said it was "right that those who use our tribunals should contribute to the £71m cost of running the service".
Analysing government figures, the TUC found unfair dismissal claims have fallen by 73% since 2012-13, the year before the introduction of the fees.
Discrimination cases on grounds of sex have dropped by 71%, race by 58% and disability by 54%, it found.
Frances O'Grady said: "These figures show a huge drop in workers seeking justice when they've been unfairly treated.
"The evidence is there for all to see. These fees - of up to £1,200, even if you're on the minimum wage - are pricing out thousands each month from pursuing cases."
Workers on the minimum wage have to pay the fee if a member of their family has savings of £3,000.
One woman who worked for a large media company says she was discriminated against when she was pregnant, but "by the time we felt confident that I could have won a tribunal we didn't have the money for the initial fee", she told the BBC.
The government launched the Help with Fees scheme last year, which waives or reduces the charges for the most vulnerable workers.
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it was also keen to promote alternative ways of resolving disputes where possible.
The TUC says the introduction of fees three years ago, for those taking tribunal claims, has priced people out of justice.
So ahead of the Autumn Statement, it's piling pressure on the government to scrap them.
Speaking on the BBC, Frances O'Grady had this challenge for the prime minister.
"We heard from Theresa May that she wanted to govern for the many, not the few," she said. "Here's one of the first real practical tests, scrap those fees and ensure that all workers have access to justice."
Others have concerns about the fees too. In June the Justice Select Committee warned that major changes were urgently needed to restore an acceptable level of access to the employment tribunals system.
The TUC is also calling on the Ministry of Justice to urgently publish a review on the impact of fees which was due by the end of last year.
The department says the review will be published in due course.
