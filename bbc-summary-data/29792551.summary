19:00: Major Nicola Roberts tells the BBC she has been "judged on my ability as opposed to my gender".
18:20: The World Service is joined by women who have served on the frontline to discuss their lives and what it is like succeeding as a woman in what is traditionally seen as a man's world.
We are speaking to women from USA, UK, Israel, Kenya, Pakistan and Australia - including a former bomb disposal expert, the first woman to kill a member of the Taliban and a woman who was the highest ranking female officer in the British armed forces.
Do you have a question for our guests about life as a woman in the military? Get involved using the hashtag #100Women.
17:30: There were a lot more comments on BBC Persian's Your Turn interactive debate earlier. Here's a flavour of a few more of them below (we told you it was lively):
Ali from Malaysia: "I make an effort with my cooking, and because of that, I get laughed at for being like a woman."
Mohammad from Tehran: "Women are not created to do the tough jobs, and that's why people laugh at them when they do."
Kouhyar: "There's a Persian saying: I give you my word as a man.  But my mother used to say: I give you my word as a woman, It was her way of challenging all the stereotypes."
Nasrin from Germany: "The brain of a human is not located in the muscles; so women don't need to be muscular like men, in order to be wise."
17:00: You can now watch Shappi Khorsandi speaking about the challenges facing her daughter.
16:45: Nigerian girl Shakarat says: "I told my mother I wanted to become president of Nigeria, and she laughed. She said you can't become president of Nigeria it's not possible because I am a girl." She's been talking to the  BBC's World Service. You can now listen to the full report.
16:38: There's been some heated debate today about everyday sexism on BBC Persian's Your Turn interactive programme. Here's a selection of some of the views expressed:
Sarvin, from Tehran: "If a woman talks to a man about something like parking the car or a business issue, he often says: 'I don't want to argue with you, because you're a woman'."
Shahnaz, from Tehran: "Things have changed and got much better now. Nowadays there are a lot of men who defend women's rights and equality."
Ali, from Malaysia: "I wouldn't laugh at sexist jokes,  I'd rather try to show some reaction against them."

15:04: One of our 100 Women has tweeted this:
14:59: Prof Lesley Yellowlees, the first female president of the Royal Chemistry Society, has some figures for us. She says only 8% of professors and engineering chemistry are female, compared to 16% in biology.
"To have so many graduates leave these disciplines is a waste. There is no such thing as a girl job or a boy job - there is just a job," she adds.
"My own experiences have been "hugely positive". I have enjoyed the rigour of research and the exhilaration of academic study - it is possible to have a career in science and have a family," she says.

"Be the person that a younger girl looks up to and says I can do this because she's done it."

14:05: Our keynote speaker, former Malawi president Joyce Banda, kicks off the event. She says women have made important strides in public life across the world. "Africa has done very well," she adds.
Ms Banda says women are able to compete  in politics "comfortably" and help other women, too. "Women leaders bring human faces to policy," she adds.
"It would be tragic for this world to ignore this enormous human resource called women," she warns.

10:54 The BBC's Shaimaa Khalil says there are "layers of problems" with education in Pakistan, as we hear from one of the country's girls who was beaten by her father after he found out she had gone to school behind his back.
10:32: People on Twitter are excited about our video of Kenya's boxing girls, if you missed it watch here
09:52: Listen to the touching moment when a woman discovers her niece has been released by Boko Haram as she speaks to the BBC's Nuala McGovern in Nigeria's capital Abuja.
09:48: One 15-year-old school girl tells Nuala: "The schools in the north west don't have security, no police man. The police, soldiers, most of them are scared.
"They [the government] say they employ all these men to go there and fight but I don't believe them."

Doreen, a schoolgirl from Nigeria, says she feels "sympathy for them [the girls]. I feel they were really unfortunate to be caught in such a situation."
She and other schoolgirls will be speaking to Nuala all day - and chided for straightening their ties by their school's head mistresses. Girls will be girls...
