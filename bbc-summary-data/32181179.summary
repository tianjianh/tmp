The "Lost Gardens" of Manchester has been produced by The National Trust as a "reminiscent homage" to the city's historical green space.
A team of gardeners used 10 tonnes of compost to create the display.
They took inspiration from Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, Shudehill Orchards and The Royal Botanical Gardens.
Parts of the display focus on the palatial glasshouses and grounds of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Old Trafford.
It welcomed 4.75 million visitors into the gardens for an exhibition celebrating Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887.
There are elements of the project that were inspired by the gardens at Shudehill in 1753, a contrast to the bus interchange in its place now.
The gardens will evolve over the year and the project will culminate in a display of pumpkins for Halloween.
National Trust Gardener in Residence, Sean Harkin, said: "Plants have been selected to give the true sense of what it would have felt like in each of the gardens and we have commissioned hand painted old signs similar to the ones people would have seen at Belle Vue and The Royal Botanical Gardens.
"Visitors will be amazed by the sheer scale of the installation and will be able to enjoy the sights and smells of the plants, relax amid the foliage and find themselves a world away from the hustle and bustle of today's Manchester."
