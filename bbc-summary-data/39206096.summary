The 22-year-old began his career at Fulham and spent spells with Barnet, Yeovil Town and Torquay United.
Allen was most recently at National League rivals Aldershot Town before being released in December.
"We are just waiting for clearance on that to go through," Wrexham manager Dean Keates said.
"All being well things will fall into place and he'll be available to be in the squad for the weekend."
Tenth-placed Wrexham, who have lost only once in nine games, host Gateshead, who are seventh in the table on Saturday.
Wrexham were found not guilty of failing to control their players in the cross-border derby at Chester on 21 January.
But defender James Jennings will have to wait to discover if he will be banned for his part in the mass brawl during the 1-1 draw at The Deva Stadium.
Jennings appeared at a Football Association of Wales disciplinary panel on Monday and pleaded guilty to a charge of violent conduct.
The 29-year-old, on loan from Cheltenham Town, will find out within the next two weeks if he will be banned.
"It is what it is," Keates added.
"We'll wait until the suspension comes through and we'll see where we go from there."
