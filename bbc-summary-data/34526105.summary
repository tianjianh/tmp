Sussex seamer Chris Jordan has been called up and will arrive in the United Arab Emirates during the first Test.
Finn, 26, claimed 4-16 in the second tour match against Pakistan A before being ruled out of the current series opener in Abu Dhabi.
"Gutted to be heading home from this UAE tour," he tweeted.
The England and Wales Cricket Board said Finn will return home for a "period of off-loading to aid recovery".
Former England spinner Graeme Swann told BBC Test Match Special: "It's a safe selection. They know what they will get with Chris Jordan.
"I can see why people might bemoan the lack of variation. On this occasion, Jordan probably deserves to be out here."
Finn returned to the Test side this summer after a two-year absence, taking 14 wickets in England's Ashes victory over Australia.
Jordan, 27, has taken 21 wickets at an average of 35.80 from eight Tests, the most recent of which was the defeat by West Indies in Barbados in May.
England play three Tests, four one-day internationals and three Twenty20s against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.
They tour South Africa over Christmas, with the first Test in Durban starting on Boxing Day.
England Test squad: Alastair Cook (capt), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler (wk), Alex Hales, Samit Patel, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Taylor, Mark Wood, Chris Jordan.
