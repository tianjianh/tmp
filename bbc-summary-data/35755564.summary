Men who dumped Italian's body in Regent's Canal jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men who emptied a man's bank account and then dumped his body in a canal have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Sebastiano Magnanini, 46, was found tied to a shopping trolley in Regent's Canal, north London last year.
Michael Walsh, 41, and Paul Williams, 64, received four- and two-year sentences after pleading guilty to preventing the lawful burial of a body.
Walsh and Daniel Hastie, 22, who was jailed for 12 months, also admitted conspiracy to commit fraud.
Mr Magnanini, who originally came from Venice, struggled with an addiction to Class A drugs.
He was trying to buy heroin in King's Cross on 22 September when Walsh took him back to his flat, where they took heroin and crack cocaine.
Walsh told the court Mr Magnanini gave him his bank card to obtain cash to buy more drugs.
He and Hastie used it to empty Â£1,900 from the account by forging the Italian's signature.
On 23 September Walsh returned to the flat to find Mr Magnanini dead, apparently from a drug overdose.
He said he "panicked" and enlisted Williams to help him dispose of the body.
Prosecuting, Emlyn Jones told the court that Mr Magnanini's hands and feet had been tied together in the foetal position to the trolley which was then weighted down with dumbbells.
CCTV footage showed them pushing the trolley towards the canal.
A statement from the victim's brother, read out in court, said it was a "cruel" and "callous" way to get rid of his body, adding that the last few months have been a "nightmare".
It read: "It is horrible to know that someone went to great lengths to conceal his body in the hope it would not be discovered."
Defending Walsh, Leon Kazakos said at the time the decision was taken to move the body Walsh was heavily intoxicated by heroin, alcohol and cocaine.  He added: "It is a regret he will carry with him for the rest of his life."
The court heard that Williams has also struggled with drug use and was intoxicated when he agreed to help Walsh.
Police are still investigating the circumstances of the Italian national's death.
The carpenter was jailed for 18 months in 1998 over the theft of a valuable painting from a church in Venice.
An inquest will take place at Camden Coroner's Court on 14 March.
