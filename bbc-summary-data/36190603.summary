Ashley Broomhall hopes to make the trek on Wednesday, the date of which - May the fourth- is often linked to the Star Wars phrase "May the force..."
He will wear his stormtrooper armour for the walk up 3,208ft (978m) Scafell Pike in the Lake District.
Mr Broomhall wore the costume for the treks up the two taller peaks.
It took him seven hours to walk up and down 4,406ft (1,344m) Ben Nevis near Fort William. On the way up he had a snowball fight with other walkers.
Before Ben Nevis, he tackled 3,560ft (1,085m) Snowdon in Snowdonia, Wales.
Mr Broomhall, from Whitchurch in Shropshire, has been doing the walks to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Lingen Davies Cancer Relief Fund.
He set himself the peaks challenge after his mother, Janet, was diagnosed with cancer.
The 28-year-old said: "My mum is now a year in remission and everything has gone brilliantly after her treatments.
"Unfortunately my auntie, Sue Toms, has also been diagnosed with breast cancer and, unlike my mum who just needed radiotherapy after her operation to remove the cancer, she has had to go through chemotherapy to shrink the lump down before her operation.
"Her operation is scheduled for next week and my mum will be going down to Cornwall to be with her and help."
He added: "We are all keeping our fingers crossed and because of my mum's experiences with her cancer she has been able to help my aunt and understand what she is going through."
Mr Broomhall has been a member of Star Wars costuming club the 501st UK Garrison for about six years.
Members attend events across the UK dressed in "movie-accurate" costumes to raise funds for charity.
