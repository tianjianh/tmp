The Cheshire-based Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace is unveiling My Former Life as part of an education programme it hopes to roll out to all UK schools.
It features an-ex jihadi fighter, US white supremacist, Irish Republican and a man who fought in Afghanistan.
The charity said it showed the "brutal reality of extremism".
Its chief executive Nick Taylor said the film showed what led the individuals into extremism and violent conflict and how they had turned away from it.
"They are sold false promises," he said.
He said they also described why they had united with the foundation to "fight for peace" against those who used violence and terrorism to further their aims.
"It was a very brave thing to do; not only to renounce their past violence but to admit it and share their experiences to help others," he said.
The project, which includes a 15-minute extract from the film, will be launched before an audience of education chiefs and other agencies, including the police, at the Foundation for Peace centre in Warrington later.
He said the education resource was set to change the way extremism is tackled.
"We are hoping to roll it out into every school in the UK," he said.
Mr Taylor said the project had been tested on more than 200 youngsters in schools and groups including multi-faith groups in Manchester, Leeds, Warrington, Liverpool and had received "positive feedback".
The foundation was established by the parents of Tim Parry, 12, and Johnathan Ball, three, who lost their lives in the 1993 Warrington IRA bombing.
