[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late equaliser from skipper Billy Sharp rescued 10-man Sheffield United as a dramatic game at leaders Scunthorpe ended 2-2.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After both teams had cancelled each other out in the opening half-hour, it was the Blades who took a 34th-minute lead as they chased a fifth successive win.
Defender Chris Basham popped up unmarked in the box to round off a well-worked free-kick routine with a good right-footed finish.
The Blades could have struck again in first-half stoppage time but Paul Coutts dragged his shot from the edge of the box well wide after brilliant work by Mark Duffy had set up the opening.
Scunthorpe stepped up a gear at the start of the second half and Richie Smallwood, making his full debut on loan from Rotherham, tested goalkeeper Simon Moore with a good 20-yard effort.

The home side were back on level terms in the 55th minute when Josh Morris burst into the box from the left to beat Moore at his near post with a blistering left-footed shot for his eighth goal of the season.
The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 69th minute when Basham was sent off for his challenge on Neal Bishop.
Scunthorpe looked to have won it in the 83rd minute when Duane Holmes burst into the box from the right to leather a right-footed shot past Moore into the far corner of the net.
But two minutes later the visitors were back on level terms when ex-Iron man Sharp scored from the spot after David Mirfin's foul on substitute Stefan Scougall.
