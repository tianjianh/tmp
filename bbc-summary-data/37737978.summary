[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Forbes, Gary Oliver and Jamie Lindsay had already gone close for the hosts before Kevin Nisbet fired past Andy McNeil to give Ayr the lead.
Thomas O'Ware headed home Forbes' outswinging corner to equalise.
Then Jon Scullion flicked on Lindsay's pass for Oliver to race clear and roll the ball home.
That secured Morton's third league win in a row and ended Ayr's four-game unbeaten run.
