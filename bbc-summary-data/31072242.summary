Australia pace bowler Mitchell Johnson is relishing the chance to play on a "fast and bouncy wicket" in Sunday's tri-series final against England.

The left-armer, player of the series in last winter's Ashes whitewash over England, is set to return in Perth after being rested for the group games.
The Waca wicket showed signs of variable bounce when England beat India on Friday to reach the final.
"It will be nice to play on a fast and bouncy wicket again," said Johnson, 33.
He took 37 wickets at an average of 14 in Australia's 5-0 Ashes win, but has not played a one-day international since Australia's defeat by South Africa in Perth last November.
Having missed Australia's four group matches, he is expected to feature in their final competitive ODI before the World Cup opener against England in Melbourne on 14 February.
Johnson added: "During the South Africa series the wicket got faster and faster, so I'm really looking forward to playing on such a nice wicket."
The final will be played on the same surface where England beat India by three wickets, James Taylor hitting 82 as they overhauled a target of 201 with 19 balls to spare.
"The wicket took everyone by surprise as to how it behaved," said England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who shared a 125-run stand with Taylor for the sixth wicket.
"I'll be interested to see how the wicket plays. We'll have to not turn up with any pre-conceived ideas and see how it plays and react to that.
"Australia are a strong side and much-fancied, and in their own conditions, and it's another great marker of where we're at as a team to come up against top-quality opposition."
Mitchell Starc, another left-arm fast bowler, has taken 12 wickets in four group games in Johnson's absence.
"He swings the ball and bowls fast, so I'm really looking forward to working with him," said Johnson. "We bowl well together in the short form."
