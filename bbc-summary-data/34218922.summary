[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the first time the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system had been used to select two members in the same ward in a by-election.
The SNP topped the vote in the Leith Walk by-election, while Scottish Labour won the second seat from the Greens.
The by-election was called after Deidre Brock of the SNP and Maggie Chapman of the Scottish Greens stood down.
The SNP's John Lewis Ritchie topped the Leith Walk poll with 2,290 votes. He was elected at stage one in the STV process with a swing in first-preference votes of 7.6% from Labour.
Labour's Marion Donaldson received 1,623 votes, ahead of Susan Jane Rae of the Scottish Greens on 1,381.
Ms Donaldson was elected at stage 10 of the voting process after other preferences had been considered.
The by-election was called after Ms Brock stood down when she was elected as the SNP MP for Edinburgh North and Leith in May.
Ms Chapman, of the Scottish Greens, resigned from her post to concentrate on standing for the Scottish Parliament in next May's election.
The turnout for the by-election was 25.1%.
The SNP also held the Midlothian West seat on Midlothian Council with a swing of 6.3% from Labour.
The party's Kelly Parry secured 1,540 votes, ahead of Labour's Ian Miller on 945 votes.
The by-election was called after Owen Thompson was elected as SNP MP for the Midlothian constituency.
