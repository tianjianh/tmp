Slaughtneil remain on course for a provincial treble after easing to an Ulster club football semi-final victory over Tyrone side Killyclogher.

The Derry club have already secured the Ulster hurling and camogie crowns and they were deserved winners in Armagh.
Slaughtneil led 0-6 to 0-4 at the break and they hit 1-3 without reply on the restart with Meehaul McGrath netting.
Paul Bradley fired over five points for 2014 champions, who will face Kilcoo in the decider in a fortnight.
Down team Kilcoo were also convincing winners on Sunday, scoring four goals in a one-side encounter against Maghery in Newry.
Mark Bradley's point gave Killyclogher an early lead but they failed to capitalise on a first-half wind advantage at the Athletic Grounds.
Paul Bradley slotted over four points while Shane McGuigan and Chris McGuigan were also on target as Slaughtneil went in with a two-point advantage at the interval.
The decisive period of the game came early in the second half, starting with McGrath firing in the only goal after good work from Se McGuigan.
Padraig Cassidy, Christopher Bradley and Paul Bradley pointed to leave Slaughtneil 1-9 to 0-4 ahead and effectively end Killyclogher's hopes of a comeback.
"We had a very specific gameplan and it paid dividends - it was all about getting the result," said Slaughtneil defender Chrissy McKaigue.
"Killyclogher were very difficult to break down in the first half but composure is a trait of our game and we waited for pockets of space to open up in the second half.
"Kilcoo are a well set-up team but we will focus on ourselves for the final.
"The Slaughtneil people are a very united community and have always supported us so it would be special to add the football title to the hurling and camogie successes."
