The incident occurred at about 23:20 on Monday at the Co-operative store in Moffat.
The cigarette kiosk was targeted and early estimates indicated the value of the haul was significant.
Det Sgt Hugh McCombe asked anyone who visited the shop on Monday night to think carefully if they might have seen anything suspicious.
"We would also want to hear from anyone who may have been in the Ladyknowe area around 23:20 on Monday night to get in touch if they have any information which might assist us in this inquiry," he said.
They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw three men walking in the area, two of them wearing baseball caps.
