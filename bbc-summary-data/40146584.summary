The 34-year-old will link up with the USA squad for international duty and then rejoin club side Houston Dash.
Lloyd helped City win the Women's FA Cup and finish second in the Women's Super League One Spring Series.
Her spell also saw City reach a first Women's Champions League semi-final.
Asked if she would ever play for the English side again, Lloyd told BBC Radio 5 live: "I'm not sure. I'm not closing any doors at the moment.
"I've had a fantastic experience here. Right now, my plan is to go back to Houston and see what happens in the future.
"Getting to compete in the Champions League was really special and playing at Wembley, winning the FA Cup final, was pretty surreal."

Lloyd played in four of City's eight Spring Series league games, without scoring, but was suspended for three of them, having been sent off in a 5-1 win over Yeovil on 21 May.
She appeared in all four of City's Women's FA Cup games, scoring in the final as they won at Wembley against Birmingham, and also netted twice in four Champions League appearances.
"I'm always learning. Obviously that red card, I did fail myself on that one, but you always have to find a silver lining," Lloyd added.
"I spent the last two weeks running a lot and training extra. I feel really sharp. I had to find some positive in it."
Carli Lloyd was speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Jo Currie.
