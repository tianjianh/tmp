New Welsh school pledge for Newport after plans thrown out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Education chiefs in Newport say a new Welsh language secondary school will open in the city in September, after original plans were thrown out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new school on the site of Duffryn High School was refused amid concerns over possible flooding.
But a meeting on Friday was told a temporary school would be sited at Ysgol Bro Teyrnon in Shaftesbury.
Council officials said it could be there for two years while the search for a permanent location continued.
Addressing the meeting of about 100 parents at Newport's Civic Centre, the council's head of education James Harris said the authority intended to press ahead with opening the new facility in the autumn.
Parents were also told by the new school's chair of governors, Elin Maher, that the governing body had recommended that the new school will be called Ysgol Gyfun Gwent Iscoed.
