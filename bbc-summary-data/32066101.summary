[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers executed warrants at 14 properties in Liverpool, Knowsley and Sefton and one in Greater Manchester. Searches continue at several addresses.
The police operation is in response to large groups of people who have been illegally riding the bikes.
It also follows the death of three people in off-road bike crashes.
Some of the bikes recovered are believed to have been stolen.
Ch Supt Jonathan Roy said: "We know that many people are plagued by the problem of off-road vehicles and actually find them incredibly intimidating.
"When they are ridden dangerously, they pose a huge risk, not only to the safety of the rider, but also to pedestrians and other law-abiding road users."
