[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school has been evacuated due to structural issues with its roof.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parents were contacted earlier to collect their children from West Kidlington Primary School in Oxfordshire.
They were told the closure was due to problems with the roof that had a "significant impact on a large proportion of the building".
Headteacher Simon Isherwood said his priority was making the school safe.
Mr Isherwood, who started in the post on Monday, added: "Everyone connected with the school is doing everything they can to put the school in the right position.
"The last thing I wanted to do was close."
Problems were first noticed on Monday when water started leaking through the roof.
A structural survey over the holidays had passed the roof as fit for purpose, Mr Isherwood said.
He added that families had been "very understanding" but that understandably there were "lots of parents who are incredibly frustrated, maybe even angry."
The main entrance, four classrooms and the hall are most affected.
The school teaches children aged between five and 10 and also has a nursery.
No date has yet been set for it to reopen.  However, options are being explored to set up portable classrooms, or teach classes elsewhere.
