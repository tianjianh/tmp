[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness man jumped from window to evade police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who jumped from a window in an effort to evade a police drugs raid in Inverness landed in front of several officers, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Court in Edinburgh was told Andrew Cairns, 40, was restrained by the officers in the incident in Inverness last July.
He has been jailed for five years and seven months for his part in an effort to supply Â£100,000-worth of drugs.
Another man, Mark Hammersley, 52, of Manchester, has also been jailed.
The father-of-six was sentenced to five years and three months.
Judge Lord Turnbull said both men would have faced seven-year sentences but for their guilty pleas.
Hammersley had earlier admitted being concerned in the supply of cocaine and amphetamine on 15 July last year at a house in Inverness and elsewhere.
Cairns pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of cocaine at the house on the same date.
