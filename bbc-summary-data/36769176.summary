There had been worries over his participation after he injured a hamstring at the national trials.
The six-time Olympic champion - who is the 100m and 200m world record holder - is part of a 63-strong Jamaica team.
Bolt, 29, was one of four athletes to be given a medical exemption to make the squad.
He has yet to prove his fitness but confirmed on Friday he would compete at the Anniversary Games in London on 22 July.
Bolt sustained his injury - a grade-one tear - during the first round of the 100m in Kingston and withdrew after winning his semi-final.
