Oliver McBurnie can shine for Swansea City, says former striker Warren Feeney

Former Swansea striker Warren Feeney believes Oliver McBurnie can be a big hit at the Liberty Stadium.

McBurnie scored twice on his debut as Francesco Guildolin's side beat Peterborough 3-1 on Tuesday to progress in the EFL Cup.
Feeney, the Newport County manager, signed McBurnie on loan last season with the 20-year old scoring a hat-trick on his debut.
"He has every chance of starting for Swansea I think," Feeney explained.
"He deserves his chance, he is a rough and ready centre forward who never gives up and he can score goals."
Feeney, who played for the Swans during a loan spell in 2007, admits he tried to sign the Scotland Under-21 striker in the close season, but now expects him to push Spanish strikers Fernando Llorente and club record signing Borja for a starting berth.
"Oli is one I tried to bring in at the start of the season, Swansea wanted strikers in and so we waited, but Oli started the other night and scored," Feeney told BBC Wales Sport.
"We have probably been constantly buzzing Alan Curtis' phone for the last five months, but he has kept us in the loop.
"But I think now it would be very hard to get Oli out [of Swansea].
"We have probably missed the boat now, because he will be pushing for starts for Swansea."
