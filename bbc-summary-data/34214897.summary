The Scots finished the penultimate day of their four-day match on 52-3 with seven second-innings wickets remaining.
Kyle Coetzer, Hamish Gardiner and Matt Machan all failed to breach 10 runs but Preston Mommsen and Richie Berrington are undefeated on 18 and 16 not out.
Michael Rippon top-scored for the Dutch in their second innings with 37 as they were bowled out for 123.
The Netherlands posted 210 in their first innings and bowled out their opponents for 133 to lead the contest by 77 runs.
Scotland battled back and Josh Davey took three wickets - including Ben Cooper and Roelof van der Merwe without scoring - while Safyaan Sharif (2-8) and Richie Berrington (2-7) also impressed.
But the Scots struggled to build on their lifeline as they chased their victory target of 201.
Coetzer only managed eight runs before being caught out by Van der Merwe, who soon trapped Gardiner lbw for seven. Machan fared even worse, scoring just three before Wesley Barresi caught him out to leave Scotland 18-3.
But Mommsen and Berrington gave Grant Bradburn's side some hope going into the final day on Friday.
