[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Benson almost gave the Daggers an early lead but his header was well cleared off the line by Alex Whittle after nine minutes.
The hosts continued to press, with Corey Whitely shooting wide, while York's Vadaine Oliver headed over the bar on the half-hour mark.
Jon Parkin wasted a couple of chances for the Minstermen before Amari Morgan-Smith hit the crossbar with a header in first-half added time.
York came close again after 50 minutes in bizarre fashion when Dan Parslow's pass eluded everyone and hit the post.
Dagenham's Elliott Romain tested Scott Loach with a fine header later on in the second half before Raymond curled home the winner with eight minutes remaining.
