[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic Park standing area work begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have begun the process of installing rail seats in their new "safe-standing" area of their stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Celtic Park will be the first ground in Scotland to pilot the use of the rail seats that can flip back to allow spectators to stand.
The area will accommodate 3,000 supporters.
It will be in use for all domestic matches, but the seats must be fixed down for all European games because of Uefa regulations.
The area is scheduled to open in time for Celtic's pre-season meeting with Leicester City on 23 July.
Meanwhile, Celtic have confirmed the departure of striker Carlton Cole.
The former England striker, who left West Ham United last summer, signed a two-year contract in October.
However, the 32-year-old made only five appearances - and scored once - for the Scottish champions.
Cole last featured as a substitute in an 8-1 thrashing of Hamilton Academical in January.
