[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old was twice approached by a man in his 40s and touched in an inappropriate manner after she got on the train at Newcastle, police said.
The assaults happened on the 12:00 service from London Kings Cross to Inverness on 16 August.
The man, who left the train at Perth, was about 6ft tall and had a shaved head and tattoos on his arms.
He was wearing blue jeans and a black and white polo shirt with a pocket and a logo.
British Transport Police said he was drunk and appeared to have been travelling with another man.
Det Con Andrew Egan described the assaults as "extremely unsavoury and unwarranted".
He said: "This was a busy service and I am anxious to speak with anyone who was on the train and has information which can help me identify the man responsible to contact BTP as a matter of urgency."
