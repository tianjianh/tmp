The decisive moment came in added time, when Grant Gillespie was brought down inside the area.
Referee Crawford Allan pointed to the spot and Bingham stepped up to score.
Hamilton were rewarded for their perseverance, after their key player Ali Crawford drew several saves from Kilmarnock goalkeeper Freddie Woodman.
His first-half volley was blocked by Woodman, and the goalkeeper was also out quickly to block when Crawford lifted the ball over the defensive line for Alex D'Acol.
Crawford also drove a shot from 20 yards on target after the break, but Woodman pushed the ball away. The goalkeeper also did well to tip over when Crawford flicked a looping shot on target.
Looking for a change in fortunes, Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark made a bold selection. Five members of his starting line-up were making their debuts, with three on loan from Newcastle.
One of those, Woodman, was in goals, and he enjoyed a fairly comfortable first outing. The best of the debutants was Kristoffer Ajer, on loan from Celtic and playing with strength and poise at centre-back.
Callum Roberts, another making his first start, drew a straightforward save from Hamilton's Gary Woods with a looping header, while the other new boys - Karleigh Osborne and Sean Longstaff - were steady enough.
Clark left his top scorer, Souleymane Coulibaly, on the bench, with the striker having been the subject of transfer interest from Egyptian club Zemalek.
In his absence, Kilmarnock laboured in the final third, although after the break Rory McKenzie drove wide from a good position.
Coulibaly eventually appeared off the bench in the 64th minute along with Kris Boyd, and the latter pulled a shot wide from a tight angle.
Kilmarnock fans found an outlet for the frustration, chanting "we want Johnston out" in reference to director Michael Johnston.
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "We didn't deserve to win the game, it wasn't a good match at all. We didn't create enough, we were a bit toothless at the top of the pitch.
"As the game wore on, Hamilton grew into it and we've made a couple of horrendous errors to give the penalty away. It's a very disappointing day, another cup competition where we've gone out of with a whimper.
"I think [Coulibaly] will [stay at Kilmarnock]. He's a great kid, he's enjoying himself here, he's not knocking on my door, his agent isn't ringing me to see what the situation is. It's going to have to take a crazy offer for him to go. The player isn't desperate to get out the door."
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "We've been done by [late goals] a few times ourselves in the league this season, so it feels nice to get the benefit of it.
"We were slightly the better team, we created more opportunities. But we didn't think the goal was going to come, it looked like it was going to be one of those days. The boys kept working hard and thankfully we got our reward."
