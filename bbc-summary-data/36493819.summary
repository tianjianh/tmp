Peake won silver at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and is targeting a Team GB spot in Rio.
The 30-year-old aims to break the Welsh record, which she currently holds, at Cardiff International Sports Stadium.
"I've done a lot of competitions trying to get the magical bar that is the Rio qualification," Peake said.
"There's quite a few goals for the weekend.
"A personal best would be nice and would also be a Welsh record. I've equalled it so far this year so I'd really like to step that up a notch."
British Athletics has set 4.50m as the qualification standard for Rio with Peake setting a personal best of 4.40m.
