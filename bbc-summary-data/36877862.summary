Dr Kate Granger set about fundraising for the Yorkshire Cancer Centre after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2011.
Her husband Chris Pointon announced her death on social media.
He said the 34-year-old died on Saturday "peacefully & surrounded by loved ones". He added: "RIP my soul mate & TY. Love u 4ever."
Dr Granger, who had been receiving care at St Gemma's Hospice in Leeds, achieved her fundraising target just three days ago.
Dr Granger, from East Ardsley near Leeds, had also tried to improve the way doctors and nurses speak to patients by launching the "Hello my name is..." campaign.
She had previously described how the doctor who informed her that her cancer had spread did not introduce himself to her, and did not look her in the eye.
The campaign went on to win the backing of more than 400,000 doctors, nurses, therapists and porters across 90 NHS organisations.
