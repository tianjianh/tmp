Mujahid Arshid, 33, is also accused of the kidnap, rape, and attempted murder of a woman in her 20s.
Vincent Tappu, 28, from Acton, west London, is charged with the kidnap of both women. The men appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court.
Celine Dookhran's body was found at an address in Coombe Lane West, in Kingston Upon Thames, on Wednesday.
The second woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, had earlier been treated for stab or slash wounds at a south London hospital.
A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of Ms Dookhran's death was a neck wound.
Police had started searching for the two women following a concerned call about their safety.
The men were remanded in custody. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on 26 July.
Both defendants will appear at the same court on 21 August.
