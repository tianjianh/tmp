[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-0 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Wright eventually made Cheltenham's pressure pay to see off promotion-chasing Carlisle at Whaddon Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Robins had endured a frustrating evening despite bossing much of the contest before second-half substitute Wright bundled home James Dayton's high cross at the far post in the 85th minute.
It was the least Cheltenham deserved for being the more enterprising side on a tricky Whaddon Road surface as Gary Johnson's men put together three straight wins in League Two for the first time this season.
Carl Winchester and the lively Billy Waters went close for the hosts early on but United were agonisingly close to a spectacular opener after 17 minutes when Mike Jones hit the crossbar from 25 yards.
Waters fired a half-volley straight at goalkeeper Mark Gillespie eight minutes before half-time as the hosts remained on the front foot, while Kyle Wootton's point-blank header was pushed away seconds prior to the interval.
After the break, Wootton thumped over after connecting with Kyle Storer's wild blast, Winchester fired wide of the near post and Wright somehow scooped over from six yards five minutes after coming on.
But with time ticking away, Wright made no mistake to give Cheltenham a nine-point cushion over the bottom two.
