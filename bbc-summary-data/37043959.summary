The 29-year-old, who is currently in Rio hosting coverage of the Olympic Games, said he was "a huge fan" of the show and "cannot wait to get started".
"I'm still waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me I'm dreaming! It's going to be so much fun," he added.
Oduba is the fourth star announced for the show, which begins in September.
He joins former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, singer Will Young and presenter Laura Whitmore, who were confirmed earlier this week.
Oduba, who also appears on BBC Breakfast, said: "I've been such a huge fan of the show for over a decade. So to actually take to the Strictly stage myself, I don't think I've been more nervously excited - aside from on my wedding day. Let's hope for fewer tears!"
