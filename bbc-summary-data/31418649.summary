A poorly otter cub found orphaned in Perthshire is recovering in the care of the Scottish SPCA.

The charity was alerted after the eight-week-old cub was found in Methven on 4 February.
Bosses said it was "amazing" the young female had survived a night out of her holt in the cold.
The cub, which SSPCA staff have named Dipper, will remain in their care until it is at least a year old before being returned to the wild.
Colin Seddon, the manager at the charity's National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Clackmannanshire, said Dipper was on the road to a full recovery.
He said: "The gentleman who called us had noticed Dipper the night before but rightly left her alone to give her mum a chance to return.
"However, when he checked again the next morning she was still there distressed and calling out.
"Dipper was too young to be out of her holt so it's amazing she survived a very cold night in the wild.
"She was extremely weak but after fluid therapy we're delighted to say she is doing much better. She is now stronger, feeding well from her bottle and wants to play, which we would expect for a cub of her age."
