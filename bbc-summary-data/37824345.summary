A fugitive double murder suspect who is said to have live-streamed a getaway has been killed in a shootout with police, officials in Oklahoma say.

They say Michael Vance died in the "dramatic" shootout on Sunday night nearly Leedey, west of Oklahoma City.
The 38-year-old suspect earlier in the day shot and wounded a police officer, triggering a police chase.
Last week he posted two Facebook videos after wounding two police officers. He is suspected of killing two relatives.
Vance had indicated he intended to target several people linked to a sexual assault case against him.
"Letting y'all know, look, this is real," the suspect, wearing a blood-soaked shirt, said in one of the Facebook videos, which police believe was filmed inside a police car he had stolen during last week's shooting of the two officers.
"If you want to know what's up next, stay tuned to your local news," said Vance.
He had been recently released from Lincoln County Jail in Oklahoma, where he was being held on an allegation of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl.
Vance, according to the Oklahoman newspaper, had been scheduled to appear in court next month to face the felony charges.
