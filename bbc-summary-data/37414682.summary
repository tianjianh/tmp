[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-3 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Vaughan bagged a brilliant brace as Bury continued their magnificent winning run with victory against MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vaughan scored twice, either side of a Ben Reeves strike, before Zeli Ismail added a third to ensure the Shakers remain second in the table following their fifth victory in a row.
Bury took the lead against the run of play through a Vaughan volley in the eighth minute following a mistake at the back by Paul Downing.
MK Dons dominated the first half and only a resilient Ben Williams kept them at bay. Reeves and Downing were both denied by spectacular Williams saves, before Nicky Maynard had his curling effort pushed around the post by the keeper.
Substitute Samir Carruthers crashed a shot against the post two minutes into the second half before Downing cannoned a header back off the upright on the 57th minute.
Reeves equalised deservedly from close range on the 64th minute but four minutes later Vaughan restored Bury's lead with a clinical finish.
And the Shakers wrapped up the win when Ismail ran the ball into an empty net five minutes into added time as the Dons threw caution to the wind.
