[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 4-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sutton's sequence of three straight wins ended as Chester halted a run of three games without a victory, in a game played in heavy rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chester almost led in the second minute, Tom Shaw hitting a post from 12 yards and heading the rebound over. The Blues were ahead a minute later when Blaine Hudson headed a cross from a free-kick inside the far post.
On seven minutes the advantage was doubled when Kane Richards dribbled from inside his own half, and from his saved shot Ryan Lloyd volleyed home.
Chester 'keeper Jon Worsnop and opposite number Ross Worner made excellent second-half saves, while home defender Theo Vassell was carried off after a long delay in play. Kane Richards was then fouled in the box and Tom Shaw converted an 85th-minute penalty before Richards lashed home.
