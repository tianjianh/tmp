Funding for NI mortgage debt advice service increased by 50%

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Funding for Northern Ireland's main mortgage debt advice service has been increased by 50%.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following recommendation by a Stormont-backed taskforce, the Housing Rights Service (HRS) will see its budget for mortgage advice rise to Â£340,000.
Last year the HRS worked with more than 1600 households in Northern Ireland.
The taskforce examined the high levels of negative equity and repossessions. It recommended that advice services be better targeted and better funded.
Director of the HRS, Janet Hunter, said she was "delighted" that the Social Development Minister, Mervyn Storey, had been able to provide additional money.
"This means we will be able to help even more people facing difficulties with housing debt."
