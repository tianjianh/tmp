[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield halted a run of three straight League One defeats with a point at Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stalemate was Oldham's third goalless draw in four home league games this season.
Oldham almost made a 10th-minute breakthrough when Billy McKay's powerful drive was smartly beaten out by goalkeeper Ryan Fulton.
Lee Erwin was also denied by Fulton while, at the other end, Oldham shot-stopper Connor Ripley saved low from Ched Evans after the striker led a quick counter-attack.
The lively Evans again tested Ripley by producing a clever flick to redirect Dan Gardner's miscued shot.
But Oldham came closest to a goal in the 52nd minute when Ripley's clearance was brought down by McKay, whose 12-yard shot hit the outside of the post.
On the hour mark, home substitute Lee Croft marked his introduction with a bending long-range effort which Fulton tipped out at full stretch.
More fine goalkeeping preserved the deadlock as Chesterfield winger Gboly Ariyibi saw his angled volley brilliantly saved by Ripley.
When Ripley was beaten after 77 minutes, Latics captain Peter Clarke rescued his team with a last-ditch clearance from Ariyibi.
