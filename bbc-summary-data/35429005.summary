[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tube maintenance workers vote for strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maintenance workers on London Underground have voted in favour of strike action in the dispute over plans for a Night Tube service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unions suspended plans for a series of strikes by drivers, station staff and other employees earlier this month.
But the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) went ahead with a ballot of its members employed by Tube Lines, part of London Underground.
They backed walkouts by 352 votes to 82.
The union's executive will meet to consider its next move.
The Night Tube was originally due to start on some lines at weekends last September, but no agreement has been reached on pay and conditions so the launch has been delayed.
No new date has been set for the planned service.
