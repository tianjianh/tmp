[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man pleads guilty to raping woman in Londonderry park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty at Londonderry Crown Court to raping a 33-year-old woman in a park in the Waterside area of the city 18 months ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Frickleton, 36, of no fixed abode, had originally denied the charge but subsequently admitted the offence in court.
Frickleton also pleaded guilty to another sexual offence.
He committed the rape in St Columb's Park on 19 October 2014.
Frickleton, who is originally from the Limavady area, is to be sentenced on 17 June following the preparation of pre-sentence and victim impact reports.
A prosecution lawyer told the court that Frickelton had a relevant conviction in the Republic of Ireland with significant similarities to the St Columb's Park offence.
Frickelton was returned to custody until he is sentenced.
