Last week's match between Forfar Athletic and Linlithgow Rose at Station Park was abandoned after 18 minutes following floodlight failure.
Smoke bombs were thrown onto the pitch shortly before the game was stopped.
Supporters will be searched as they enter the ground to prevent a repeat of last week's incidents.
Match commander, Chief Inspector Mike Whitford, said police will assist the increased number of stewards on duty at Tuesday's match at Station Park.
He said: "The increased presence of officers and stewards is unfortunately due to the conduct of a small number of individuals at the previous abandoned match, where a number of flares and smoke bombs were let off.
"As a result, those attending should be aware that there will be searches taking place at the ground to prevent any such items being taken in again.
"Anyone found in possession of any pyrotechnics at this match will be arrested."
The teams drew 3-3 in the original game, with the winner of the tie due to face Ross County in the fifth round.
Linlithgow Rose manager David McGlynn said the club would try to track down those responsible for throwing the smoke bombs, while club president Les Donaldson attempted to challenge the perpetrators at Station Park.
Mr Donaldson told BBC Radio Scotland: "All I wanted to do was try to show solidarity with the stewards and the police and try to get these people to realise how they were letting a club down that has never been in any trouble before.
"To be faced with this bunch of morons - they are not true Linlithgow supporters - we are just at a loss what to do."
