[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It gets their season back on track after three straight defeats.
Dumbarton made them sweat for the points though as second half strikes from substitute Ryan Stevenson and Robert Thomson made for an uncomfortable finale.
However, they were reduced to 10 men when Gregor Buchanan received a second yellow card.
Left back McHattie broke the deadlock for the home side with a well driven shot for his second league goal of the campaign.
Then a two-goals-in-two-minutes burst threatened to put the result beyond Dumbarton's redemption, starting with Callachan's strike with the aid of a deflection.
The Sons hardly had time to recover from that before Roberts lashed in a 20 yard effort for his first goal since moving to the Kirkcaldy club on loan from Rangers.
However, Stevenson started the comeback with a stunning 25 yard drive before Thomson scrambled a second from close range.
The first half display was exactly the response Rovers boss Gary Locke was demanding after them being knocked out of the Irn Bru Cup by Forfar and losses in the league to Falkirk and Queen of the South.
All the more positive as influential captain Jason Thomson was missing through injury and the defender could be out for a while depending on the result of a visit to a specialist next week.
His place went to Liam Smith who was brought in on an emergency loan from Hearts on Friday and he slotted well until the Raith defence were caught out twice late on.
First Stevenson lashed a stunning drive from 25 yards in to the left hand corner of Kevin Cuthbert's net to spoil to goalkeeper's return from injury.
Not that he had much to do up till then but when Thomson claimed his third goal of the season he had a few nervy moments before the home side finally closed out the win.
Dumbarton's hopes of levelling weren't helped when Gregor Buchanan was sent off two minutes from time for a second yellow card and the Sons have now won just once in 12 games in all competitions this season.
