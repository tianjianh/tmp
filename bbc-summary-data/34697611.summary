The prize, which is divided into three categories, is the only national award for children's books that is voted for entirely by children.
"They have chosen a truly great shortlist," said award coordinator Wendy Gilham.
Winners will be announced at a ceremony in London next May.
The awards were founded in 1980 by author and librarian Pat Thompson.
Past winners include JK Rowling, Malorie Blackman, Anthony Horowitz and Morpurgo.
The shortlist for younger children features German author Viviane Schwarz's Is There a Dog in This Book; Richard Byrne's This Book Just Ate My Dog; Gareth Edwards and Guy Parker-Rees' Fabulous Pie and Jeanne Willis and Adrian Reynolds' Read, Steady, Jump.
Horrid Henry's Krazy Ketchup, the latest from Francesca Simon's best-selling series, is shortlisted alongside Polly Yo-Hen's debut, Boy in the Tower, and Pamela Butchart's My Headteacher is a Vampire Rat on the shortlist for younger readers.
Finally, three-time winner Michael Morpugo is shortlisted for Listen to the Moon, along with Sarah Crossan's Apple and Rain and Kim Slater's Smart, in the older category.
