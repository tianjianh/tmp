[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 1-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brilliant solo goal by Aston Villa loanee Harry McKirdy on his full debut secured a much needed away win for struggling Stevenage at Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side had only just drawn level on 54 minutes to wipe out the visitors' interval lead when McKirdy picked up a loose ball in the centre circle and showed amazing pace to race clear on the break, and slot past Scott Shearer on 57 minutes to end the Stags' unbeaten run at six matches.
Three minutes earlier Pat Hoban had turned well to steer home the equaliser from close range after keeper Jamie Jones had been forced to claw a long Rhys Bennett cross away from his goalmouth.
After a poor first half-hour with few openings, the visitors had broken through on 32 minutes when Charlie Lee was allowed to get his head onto a Henry Cowans free-kick and flick the ball past Shearer.
Mansfield should have levelled five minutes later, but Mal Benning headed over from six yards after getting on the end of a long Kevan Hurst cross.
On 42 minutes Benning looked to receive a shove in the back from Ronnie Henry in the box as he tried to head at goal, but penalty appeals were turned down.
