Northern Ireland's chief constable has said the police would support any move to set up a body to monitor paramilitary groups.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Hamilton made his comments at a meeting of the Policing Board.
Last month he said that some members of the Provisional IRA were involved in the murder of an ex-IRA man
He said the organisation still existed but added there was no evidence that the killing was sanctioned by the organisation.
Kevin McGuigan Sr, 53, died after he was shot at his home in east Belfast in what detectives believe was a revenge attack for the killing of former IRA commander Gerard 'Jock' Davison in Belfast in May.
The chief constable said at the time that the two murders were the results of a "fall-out" within the republican community.
He said the PSNI had no information to suggest that "violence as seen in the murder of Kevin McGuigan" was "sanctioned or directed at a senior level" in the republican movement.
Speaking on Thursday, the chief constable said it was not the job of police to monitor the activity of paramilitary groups.
He said he would not support any move to change the law to make the PSNI responsible for monitoring the status of such groups.
Mr Hamilton said the investigations into the murders of Mr McGuigan Sr and Mr Davison were being conducted with "integrity" and that police would go where the evidence took them, "no matter what the political consequences".
Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr told the Policing Board that the IRA's operational tier, its "active service units", no longer existed.
The monitoring of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland was conducted by the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) up until 2011.
The IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign in 2005.
