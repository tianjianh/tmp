[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Animal welfare officers who were called out to reports of a donkey tied to a garden fence discovered a life-size plastic ornament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish SPCA was contacted about concerns that the animal was being kept in the back garden of a house in Airdrie with no shelter.
However, it turned out to be made of fibreglass and goes by the name Joshua.
Joshua's owner, the Reverend Georgie Baxendale, said: "This is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life."
He added: "I used to have two donkeys and bought Joshua as a reminder. He's very eye-catching and has appeared in many nativity plays over the years."
The Scottish SPCA said they were unsure whether the report was made as a prank or by a "well-meaning but short-sighted" passer-by.
