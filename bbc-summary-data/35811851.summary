Denis Betts: Widnes Vikings head coach says work ethic key to early success

Widnes Vikings boss Denis Betts says their strong start to the Super League season is a reflection of their meticulous work in training.

The Vikings are top of the table with five wins from their opening six games and next face Wigan on Thursday.
"You've got to be on your game and the lads and coaches are working hard to prepare and are reviewing how we can get better," Betts said.
"It's how we train and carry ourselves, those things don't just turn up."
Since regaining their Super League license in 2012, Widnes have failed to finish in the top half of the table.
Last season they went through the Qualifiers to retain their top-flight status, but Betts says they are better equipped to succeed this season.
"Working hard and making it happen week in week out, that's a skill and it's something that we've not been able to do throughout the last three years," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"We've got some distinctive, confident players so we've scored some points and passed the ball really well and asked some questions."

After Widnes thrashed Hull FC 46-6 last week, Betts admits he is finding it difficult to rotate his squad with his side performing so well.
"The tough thing at the moment is we've got three or four lads who you want to try and give some game time to, like Paddy Flynn, Pat Ah Van and Tom Gilmore," he added.
"It's hard to get Tom into the game and I know I'm going to have to use him. I need him fit and need him to get some game time, but it's hard when the half-back pair is playing as well as it is."
