[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Ireland, 39, was convicted of three offences of rape and three of sexual assault at the High Court in Dunfermline.
He committed his crimes between 2008 and 2015 in Cupar, Leven and Methil.
Det Insp Jim Leeson of Police Scotland, said: "Neil Ireland is a sex predator who targeted vulnerable women he calculated would not speak out."
He added: "It is thanks to their courage in coming forward and testifying against him that we have secured this conviction.
"It was a difficult and emotive investigation that required the input of multiple partner agencies but this result is testament to how seriously we take all reports of sexual offences and to the effectiveness of that partnership working.
"I would like victims of sexual violence to take confidence in outcomes such as this case and be assured that no matter how long ago the crimes were committed, Police Scotland will listen to them and be relentless in our desire to bring offenders to justice.
"Although nothing can undo the evil actions of Neil Ireland, I hope this conviction will bring them some sense of closure."
He will be sentenced later.
