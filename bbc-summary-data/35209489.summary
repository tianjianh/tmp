[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old from Leeds is being quizzed over the death of Daria Pionko, 21, who was found injured in the city on 23 December and died in hospital.
Police said a post-mortem examination found the Ms Pionko, who was Polish and a sex worker, died as a result of head and facial injuries.
A 38-year-old man arrested earlier has been released without charge.
West Yorkshire Police said Ms Pionko was found in Springwell Road in a managed area of the city where sex workers operate during set hours.
The managed area has been in operation since 2014.
It was introduced by the police, council and other agencies in an effort to reduce the impact of prostitution on residents and better engage with sex workers.
