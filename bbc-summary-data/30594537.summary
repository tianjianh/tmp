Coroner merger plan approved for county of Cumbria

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to combine coroner posts to create a single one for Cumbria has been approved by the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently, the county is served by a coroner for the south and east, and another for the north and west.
With one retiring, it was decided to merge the roles, in line with national moves to create larger coroner areas.
The number of assistant coroners will remain the same, and inquests will continue to be held at appropriate locations around the county.
The change has been officially confirmed by the Lord Chancellor and Chief Coroner's Office following a formal consultation by the Ministry of Justice.
David Roberts, north and west Cumbria coroner, who will become the senior coroner for Cumbria from 1 January 2015.
Councillor Ian Stewart, Cumbria County Council's cabinet member for the coroners service, said: "We're making this change to bring the county into line with the geographical footprint recommended by the Chief Coroner for England and Wales.
"A number of counties have successfully gone through this process and moved to a single coroner arrangement."
