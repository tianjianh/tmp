Dungannon man Farquhar suffered six broken ribs, a lacerated liver, a punctured lung and other internal bleeding in the serious crash in May.
Farquhar later said that the prompt action of race medics saved his life.
On Thursday, Farquhar said that scans had now revealed his broken feet.
In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland's The Nolan Show on Wednesday night, Farquhar said that he is determined to continue in the sport despite his continuing injury problems following the serious crash in May.
Farquhar - who has earned five North West 200 victories during his career - was airlifted to Belfast after being treated at the roadside by Dr MacSorley and the medical team.
