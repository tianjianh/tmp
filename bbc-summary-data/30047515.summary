Harry told reporters at the Royal Variety Performance: "I said congratulations on the bump."
However, he did admit that it "didn't look bumpy".
The royal couple chatted with the band about their touring plans, with Prince William promising he had been "keeping a close eye" on One Direction.
Liam said: "It's the most nervous I think I've ever been in my life."
Louis agreed it was difficult knowing what to do and said he was worried he got his royal manners in a mix.
"I didn't say, 'ma'am', I said, 'Hi. How are you? I'm Louis.'"
Liam laughed and joked that his bandmate was "off to a bad start".
The band were performing at the event along with Ed Sheeran and Ellie Goulding. She played at the royal couple's wedding.
The event is held in aid of the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund, one of the Queen's charities.
The show will be screened on ITV in December.
