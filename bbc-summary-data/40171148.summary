The losers of Sunday's last Ulster quarter-final between Cavan and Monaghan will meet Westmeath or Offaly.
Derry and Antrim play on Saturday, 17 June with the other Ulster teams in action on Sunday, 25 June.
Antrim will face Laois in the hurling qualifiers if they win Saturday's Christy Ring Cup final against Carlow.
The hurling qualifier will take place on the weekend of 24/25 June.
However, the big talking-point from an Ulster point of view following the draws is the pairing of Kieran McGeeney's Armagh and Pete McGrath's Fermanagh.
Armagh were the bookies' favourites going into Sunday's Ulster contest against Down but a dismal second-half display by the Orchard men saw the Mourne County earning a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 win.
Former Armagh star and BBC Championship pundit Oisin McConville said after Sunday's match that McGeeney would face a "very difficult job" in restoring his side's morale for the qualifiers.
And while Fermanagh were well beaten 1-20 to 1-11 by Monaghan in the Ulster SFC preliminary round, McGrath will believe that his side are capable of inflicting more misery on Armagh.
Under normal circumstances, Derry would be overwhelming favourites to beat Waterford but the Oak Leafers will be facing a side that only lost by a point against Cork in the Munster Championship a couple of weeks ago.
With Waterford having home advantage, Damian Barton's side after likely to be in for a testing afternoon.
Antrim are also likely to face a difficult test in Sligo with the Yeats County aiming to avenge their one-point defeat by the Saffrons in the Football League in February.
Despite that defeat, Sligo maintained their Division Three status in contrast to the Saffrons who were relegated on scoring difference after Longford snatched a draw at Corrigan Park in their final fixtures.
