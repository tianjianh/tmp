'Pangbourne is repulsive': DH Lawrence letter auctioned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A letter written by DH Lawrence describing a Berkshire village as repulsive and smelly has been put up for auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The author of Lady Chatterley's Lover maligned Pangbourne while inquiring about cottages to let in 1919.
He wrote: "Women use scent on their clothes, and petrol plus river plus pavement...  I suffer by the nose."
The letter is being sold in Edinburgh on Wednesday. It is estimated it will fetch Â£1,200.
A spokesman for auction house Lyon and Turnbull said Lawrence had been in "peevish mood" at the time the note was written.
It was sent a year before Women in Love was published and during a period Lawrence complained of living in relative poverty.
This came after he was forced to leave his Cornish home in 1917 following accusations that he and his German wife Frieda had been signalling to enemy submarines off the coast.
Lawrence, whose other novels included Sons and Lovers and The Rainbow, was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, in 1885 and died in France in 1930 aged 44.
