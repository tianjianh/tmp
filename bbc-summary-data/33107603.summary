St Joseph's Primary School on the Greystone Road in Antrim closed earlier this week.
A spokesperson from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) said the school would be closed while a survey was carried out to assess whether there was asbestos present.
The CCMS said it hoped pupils would be able to return to school on Monday.
But the spokesperson added that this would not be in the St Joseph's building, and an alternative was being arranged.
It is understood the asbestos was discovered during routine building work at St Joseph's.
Around 800 pupils attend the school.
In a statement, the Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland (HSENI) said: "HSENI is aware of issues in relation to asbestos management in St Joseph's Primary School in Stiles, Antrim, and has directed the education authority and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) to take the necessary actions to address the matter."
