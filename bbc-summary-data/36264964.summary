Double-murder accused Brett Rogers claims 'mystery man' responsible for killings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of the murder of his mother and her friend has claimed they were fatally stabbed by a mystery stranger while he was at the shops.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brett Rogers, 23, from Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, denies murdering Gillian Phillips, 54, and David Oakes, 60, at her home in the village.
He told Chelmsford Crown Court the pair were attacked while he was at the supermarket for five minutes last July.
He was handcuffed to an officer on the stand after attacking guards last week.
During a court session on 5 May, Mr Rogers punched and struggled with dock guards while a forensic scientist was giving evidence.

Giving evidence, he told the jury he was stabbed in the hand in an alley near his mother's house by a mystery man as he walked back from the shop.
Afterwards, he said, he went into the house "where I found my mum dead and David Oakes dead".
He said: "I got into a panic, moved the knives and called police. I just started to get worried."
Mr Rogers told the court he put his clothes and the trainers in the bin along with the knives "because they were covered in blood" before calling police.
Under cross-examination by prosecutor Simon Spence QC, Mr Rogers admitted he was capable of extreme violence "for no reason at all".
He said an assault on his father that resulted in a prison sentence was in self-defence, and he had pleaded guilty when the case came to court.
When questioned about the mystery man who he claimed killed Mrs Phillips and Mr Oakes, he said the man was a "complete stranger".
Mr Spence pointed out Mr Rogers had not spoken about the mystery man's involvement until 4 April this year in a defence document.
The trial continues.
