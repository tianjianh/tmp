The team making new episodes of Thunderbirds has moved in to the building in Slough where the programme was made 50 years ago.

Three episodes are being produced at Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to mark the 50th anniversary.
Jamie Anderson, son of Thunderbirds creator Gerry, said: "We are moving in to Stirling Road, which is exciting."
Filming is due to start on 1 September after new puppets have been completed from the original moulds.
Many puppets are in private collections worldwide.
The children's TV programme was written and filmed in Slough between 1964 and 1966.
Audio recordings of the original voice cast are to be used in the new episodes.
Stephen La Riviere is behind the project and has raised Â£218,000 through crowdfunding.
The original episodes were aired on ITV in 1965 and the channel is supporting the idea.
Mr La Riviere said he hoped returning to the trading estate site, run by Segro, would "inspire us in the same way it did the original production team".
Gerry Anderson lived in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire before his death in 2012.
He also created other TV classics including Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and Stingray.
