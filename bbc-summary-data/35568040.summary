St Mirren kept their Championship play-off hopes alive with a hard-fought home win over Dumbarton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawrence Shankland had a shot superbly blocked by Sons goalkeeper Mark Brown, then at the other end Frazer Wright's header was scooped off the line.
The second half was tight until David Clarkson squeezed a pass through to Shankland, who found the far corner.
Clarkson missed an achievable volley at the back post, but Alex Rae's men had done enough.
