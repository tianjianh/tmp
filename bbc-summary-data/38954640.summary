Ed Sheeran granted permission for parking lodge at Suffolk home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ed Sheeran has won an appeal to allow "incongruous" parking plans at his country home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals for a 1.5-storey "cart lodge" for housing vehicles at the pop star's house near Framlingham, Suffolk, had originally been rejected.
The "Castle on the Hill" singer appealed the decision on the grounds that an original cart lodge on the site was demolished.
The Planning Inspectorate has now granted planning permission.

Suffolk Coastal District Council had originally turned down the cart lodge in July, claiming it would be "an incongruous feature in the countryside".
It said the grey slate cart lodge would cause "considerable harm" and "present a creeping domestication" to the surrounding area.
In a report, planning inspector Amanda Blicq said: "It cannot be seen except by individuals in neighbouring gardens or at distance from the adjoining agricultural land.
"As such I disagree with the council that the cart lodge would cause harm to the character and appearance."
