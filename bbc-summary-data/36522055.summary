Trains are not running between Buxton and Hazel Grove, while there are limited bus services after Saturday's landslip, National Rail said.
A road in Higher Poynton, Cheshire, remains closed after part of it was washed away in the deluge.
There were further heavy showers earlier with 28.4 mm (1.1 in) rain recorded in Morecambe, Lancashire.
National Rail said: "A landslip near Hazel Grove means that trains are unable to run between Buxton and Hazel Grove.
"Disruption is expected to continue until the end of service on Sunday 19 June."
Middlewood Road in Higher Poynton will remain shut for a number of days while safety inspections take place, Cheshire East Council said.
A big clean-up operation is under way after parts of region were hit by flash floods over the weekend.
Some people were forced to leave their homes during Saturday night's downpours in Poynton.
