The German Cup holders are in the last 16 for the first time and face competition newcomers Gent after ending a five-match winless run with a 2-0 victory over Ingolstadt last weekend.
Midfielder Draxler said: "The fans were right to criticise us. We hadn't shown for a while what we could do.
"We've drawn a line under things now."
Germany international and World Cup winner Draxler, 22, scored the opening goal against Ingolstadt as Wolfsburg won for the first time since beating Manchester United 3-2 to knock United out at the group stage in December.
But coach Dieter Hecking believes there is still room for improvement as Wolfsburg, who are currently eighth in the Bundesliga, look for a positive result in the first leg in Belgium.
Hecking said: "Julian had his moment, he looked dangerous in front of goal, which is why we signed him.
"But he is also struggling for form. What applies to him also goes for the whole team. We can still do better."
Belgium champions Gent finished as runners-up in Group H to become the first Belgian side to reach the round of 16 since Anderlecht 15 years ago.
However, they have been overtaken at the top of the Belgian league by Bruges and needed two late goals to beat bottom club Mouscron 2-0 last Friday.
Their first goal came from on-loan Lokomotiv Moscow midfielder Mbark Boussoufa, 21, who is not in Gent's Champions League squad following doubts about his fitness.
Manager Hein Vanhaezebrouck said: "Boussoufa is much better physically and mentally than I was told. It's a shame about that list, I admit that."
