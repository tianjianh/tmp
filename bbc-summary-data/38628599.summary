A police station that once held the original "Peaky Blinders" gang in the early 1900s has closed.

The oldest parts of Steelhouse Lane Police Station in Birmingham date back to 1892.
West Midlands Police is relocating its city centre operations to a purpose-built station inside its headquarters, Lloyd House.
Ch Supt Chris Johnson said Steelhouse Lane was "struggling to cope with the demands of modern policing".
"The age of the building means it's expensive to run, there's lots of repairs, there is no level access for wheelchair users or people with prams, the public space is incredibly small with nowhere to expand intoâ€¦ the list goes on," he said.
The station shut for the final time on Sunday, with more than 500 people attending a closing ceremony.
As well as detaining members of the gang which inspired BBC series Peaky Blinders, serial killer Fred West was also kept in the cells following his initial arrest.
Police officer Derek Rowe worked at Steelhouse Lane from 1969 to 1986.
Of the closure, he said: "It's a bit sad really, but policing has moved on and buildings like this cost so much to run and police are under so much pressure these days to make every pound count.
"As long as they don't knock it down, I won't be too sad."
