The Shakers lost 5-0 at AFC Wimbledon in their FA Cup first round replay, three days after a 4-1 defeat at home to Southend in League One.
Flitcroft's side have also lost seven straight league games and dropped from from second at the end of September to their current 16th place.
"I'm hurting, the fans are hurting and I understand that," he said.
The 42-year-old told BBC Radio Manchester: "That hurt makes me even more determined to put it right for them.
"I want to put it right and out of that hurt I'm hoping will come some real fight. Sometimes when you're down to your lowest point the only way is up and to fight and I have to instil that in my team."
Bury are in their worst run of form since 2004 which is in contrast to September when they won six games straight.
"I need to apologise to the travelling fans who have taken time off and spent a lot of money coming down here," he added.
"That was an experienced group of players and the preparation led me to believe I would not see a performance like that, so I just have to apologise for the manner of the defeat."
