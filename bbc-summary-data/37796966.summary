Three budding photographers from the same Scottish town have scooped top prizes in the UK Landscape Photographer of the Year awards.
Lesley Smith and young winners Hannah Faith Jackson and Henry Memmott all hail from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire.
The coincidence was only discovered when Lesley, 45, revealed her win on the town's community Facebook page.
"There's no connection between us at all," she said. "I only realised after they announced the winners."
An exhibition of all the winning photographs will be held at London's Waterloo station from 21 November.
A community bid to take over a former church in Edinburgh has been given the green light by the Scottish government.
The former Portobello Old Parish Church in Bellfield Street is set to become the first urban community buy-out under new legislation.
Locals want to turn the church into a multi-purpose community hub for clubs such as Scouts and Brownies.
The government has agreed the project is of community benefit and given it first option to buy the building.
The project to repair damaged steelwork, which led to the closure of the Forth Road Bridge in 2015, has won a prestigious engineering award.
Amey engineers were given the Greatest Contribution to Scotland Award at the 2016 Saltire Society Civil Engineering Awards.
Judges described the repair to the "truss end link" on the bridge as "a remarkable" engineering feat.
A retired helicopter, which was bought at an MoD auction, has been transformed into a glamping pod.
The 17m (56ft) Royal Navy Sea King was bought by Stirling farmer Martyn Steedman for £7,000.
He has now had it converted into a holiday home, complete with a shower room and mini kitchen, which can sleep a family of six.
The idea for the conversion came to Mr Steedman and his wife Louise following the Sea Kings' final fly past over Stirling earlier this year, which marked the end of active service for the entire fleet.
Many of the Sea King's original features have been retained inside, except for the sonar station which was removed and donated to The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare, to make way for a shower room and mini-kitchen.
From the cockpit, holidaymakers can enjoy panoramic views over the Carse of Stirling. The flight deck has been refitted with swivel seats and a table made from an old fuel tank cover.
The gender pay gap has fallen in Scotland over the last year, official figures have revealed.
The difference between men and women's median hourly earnings for full-time work fell from 7.7% in 2015 to 6.2%.
Scotland had the third highest gross weekly full-time earnings for females (£482.60) after London (£609.50) and  south east England (£497.80).
With Halloween just around a shadowy, cobwebbed-cloaked corner supermarkets are jam-packed with orange pumpkins to be hollowed out as spooky lanterns.
But it was not always this way. The staple of the 31 October vegetable-based lantern was a turnip, or swede - or a neep as they are fondly known in Scotland.
Is the tradition of hollowing out the much tougher innards of a neep now long dead, or does it still survive in Scottish households?
Donna Heddle, professor of Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands, says she remains committed to the hardy turnip.
She says: "This is a very old tradition in Scotland and Ireland based on will o' the wisps and Celtic mythology which settlers and emigrants took to the USA and, not really finding neeps, used pumpkins.
"The whole Halloween celebration today has been taken over by the US version which bears no resemblance to ours."
Prof Heddle concedes that colourful pumpkins with their soft insides make for an easier proposition than a neep.
She adds: "Pumpkins are sold very cheaply up to Halloween.
"However, my husband uses a drill bit to hollow our neeps out."
