A man who strangled his partner has been given an indefinite hospital order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of 23-year-old Andrea Carr was found in December 2014 at the Birmingham home she shared with her boyfriend, Ozekell Empire.
Empire, 31, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and subsequently sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
Following a two-day trial of facts at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury were satisfied that he had killed Ms Carr.
A post-mortem examination on Ms Carr, who lived on Nechells Park Road, proved inconclusive but further tests concluded she died of asphyxiation.
In a statement issued through West Midlands Police, her family said: "Andrea is dearly missed and we hope that nobody else has to endure loss in these circumstances.
"We are happy with the decision of the court but nothing will replace Angie in our lives."
