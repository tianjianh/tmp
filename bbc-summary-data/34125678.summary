[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It began on Wednesday morning after the discovery of a suspicious object on My Lady's Road, off the Ravenhill Road.
A controlled explosion was carried out, and police later said it was an "elaborate hoax".
The Ravenhill Road was cordoned off for several hours, causing long traffic tailbacks.
