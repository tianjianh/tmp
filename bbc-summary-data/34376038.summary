[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matthew Morgan will start at full-back in one of three enforced changes for Wales' World Cup game against Fiji.

Wing Alex Cuthbert and centre Tyler Morgan also come into the side after Saturday's 28-25 win over England.
Matthew Morgan replaces Liam Williams, who has concussion, while Tyler Morgan and Cuthbert are in for Scott Williams and Hallam Amos, who have been ruled out of the tournament with injury.
James Hook, called up with Gareth Anscombe as cover, is on the bench.
Anscombe does not figure with head coach Warren Gatland saying he was "not 100%".
Wales' pack remains unchanged and back-rowers Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau will win their 50th caps.
"We have made three changes through injury but go into this game with a strong side," Gatland said.
"It is important we build on the success and momentum from last weekend and take that into Thursday."

Bristol's Matthew Morgan and Newport Gwent Dragons' Tyler Morgan, who was called into the squad as a replacement for the injured Cory Allen, will make their first starts of the tournament.
If Wales, who are second in Pool A behind Australia, beat Fiji they will top the group. England, in third, play the Wallabies on Saturday.
Although Fiji have lost their opening two games to England and Australia, the Pacific Islanders caused problems for their rivals and remain a powerful side.
"Fiji have performed very well in their opening two games and they will be coming to Cardiff looking to build on that themselves," Gatland added.
