Ceremony in Invergordon recalls Battle of Jutland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ceremony has taken place in Invergordon to remember the Battle of Jutland, the biggest naval engagement of World War One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The battle fought near the coast of Denmark during 31 May and 1 June 1916, involved about 250 ships.
The Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow in Orkney, clashed with the German High Seas Fleet.
Many of the Royal Navy's casualties were taken to Invergordon in Easter Ross.
Tuesday's commemoration coincided with a visit to the town on the Cromarty Firth by HMS Sutherland, a Type 23 frigate.
Youth organisations, including the Sea Cadets, joined the ship's crew in a march through the town.
