An application by RWE Npower Renewables for the 415ft (126m) turbines at Hemswell Cliff, near Gainsborough, was rejected last October by the council.
The Planning Inspectorate was due to deal with an appeal by RWE, but Mr Pickles will now have the final word.
West Lindsey District Council said it had voted unanimously to reject the plans due the impact on the landscape.
Campaigning against the proposal, Villages of the Cliff Against Turbines previously said the development would "ruin the countryside".
The groups claims about 5,000 "genuine letters of objection" have been sent opposing the development.
Gainsborough MP Edward Leigh said it was a victory for the campaigners.
"With the decision in Eric's hands, I am very confident we will have a result which reflects the very strong opposition this proposal has faced," he said.
"West Lindsey was completely right in refusing the application, and Eric Pickles has been vocal in backing up local decision-making."
The wind farm could power 11,600 homes, according to the energy firm.
