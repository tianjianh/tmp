Laura Marshall, 31, was found dead at an apartment block on Victoria Street in Lurgan on Sunday evening.
A 36-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death and is being questioned by police.
The police initially said Ms Marshall's death was being treated as suspicious and launched a murder inquiry after a post mortem examination.
Democratic Unionist Party councillor Carla Lockhart said: "It is devastating to think she has lost her life, in her prime.
"Victoria Street is a close knit community and people will be devastated with the news."
Dolores Kelly of the SDLP said she understood Ms Marshall was "very popular and outgoing".
"There is a great deal of shock and sadness," Ms Kelly said.
"She was loved by many and it is such a brutal end to such a beautiful young life."
Ulster Unionist councillor Colin McCusker said news of Ms Marshall's death was "a complete shock to the Lurgan community".
"It is very sad that someone so young has lost her life," he added.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Catherine Seeley also expressed her sympathy.
"This tragic event has sent a wave of shock throughout the community in north Lurgan and beyond," she said.
