Mull-based trust to study sea traffic effect on whales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mull-based conservation charity Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT) is to monitor the potential effects of marine traffic on wildlife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will match the movement of boats with that of whales and dolphins sighted or heard by using underwater equipment in the same area.
HWDT said it would be the first time it had attempted such a project.
The work will be done during the charity's latest season of research trips using its yacht Silurian.
The research will be conducted over the summer out of Tobermory on Mull as well as Kyle of Lochalsh and Ullapool.
