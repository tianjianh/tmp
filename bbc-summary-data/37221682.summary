Super League: Castleford Tigers 46-22 Wakefield Wildcats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Denny Solomona scored a first-half hat-trick as Castleford ran in eight tries to beat neighbours Wakefield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The winger went over before Rangi Chase extended the lead, and the hosts were 34-8 ahead at half-time lead thanks to Luke Dorn and Paul McShane's tries.
Jake Webster touched down on his return from injury and Luke Gale capped his excellent display with a late try.
Victory was Castleford's third in four games, but their play-off hopes are over after St Helens beat Hull FC.
Wakefield scored five tries through Tom Johnstone, who went over twice, Reece Lyne, Bill Tupou and Nick Scruton.
Chris Chester's side have lost six matches in a row and remain bottom of Super League.
On-loan former England forward Ben Harrison, who had been out since November after surgery on his wrist, knee and ankle, made his long-awaited return for Wakefield.
