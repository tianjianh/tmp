[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two Kilcoo players are suspended in racial abuse case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Kilcoo players are to be suspended by Ulster GAA chiefs following allegations of racial abuse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move follows a claim by Crossmaglen Rangers player Aaron Cunningham that he was the victim of verbal abuse during the 2 December Ulster football final.
The Ulster Council carried out an investigation and BBC Sport understands one Kilcoo player is to be banned for six months and another for four months.
Kilcoo said they had not been notified, and the players could appeal.
The two suspensions have yet to be officially confirmed by the Ulster Council.
It is believed the case was the first time an allegation of racial abuse had been lodged with the provincial governing body.
When an investigation was announced, Ulster GAA president Aog√°n O Fearghail, said anyone found guilty of racism would be dealt with severely.
Kilcoo released a statement saying the club condemned abuse and would co-operate with the Ulster Council's investigation.
The Gaelic Athletic Association, which governs the sport in Ireland, is to discuss how to deal with racism at its annual congress in March.
