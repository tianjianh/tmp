Burnley want promotion to the Premier League by winning the Championship title, says Clarets defender Michael Keane.

Keane scored an injury-time equaliser at Brighton as Burnley drew 2-2 to remain three points clear of Middlesbrough at the top of the table.
Sean Dyche's side were promoted to the top flight in 2014, when they finished second behind champions Leicester.
"The point gives us a bit of breathing space in the top two," Keane said.
The 23-year-old told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Obviously we want to go and be champions, we want to win the league. That is our aim but we've got to take it one game at a time.
"To get a point at Brighton in the way that we did is a great result."
Burnley have not been beaten in the league since Boxing Day and have won six of their last eight games to occupy top spot with just over a month of the campaign to go.
"We feel like no one can beat us at the minute," added former Manchester United trainee Keane.
"Even when we're down and we don't play well we just keep going, stick to what we believe in and it's paid off again.
"We've got seven games so there are a lot of points to play for, but a lot of the players have done it before, so hopefully they can help see the players like myself over the line who have never done it."
