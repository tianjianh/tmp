[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former SNP councillor to stand trial on 'abusive texts' charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Dundee SNP councillor will stand trial accused of sending "threatening and abusive" text messages to a Muslim activist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Melville is alleged to have sent the messages to Nadia El-Nakla, who works as a parliamentary assistant, the day after the Paris terror attacks.
Mr Melville was suspended by the SNP and resigned as a councillor when the allegations came to light.
He denies the charge and will stand trial in October.
Mr Melville, 36, entered a not guilty plea at Dundee Sheriff Court through his solicitors.
Court documents state that Mr Melville faces a charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards Ms El-Nakla between 13 November and 15 November 2015.
Prosecutors allege he behaved in a way "likely to cause a reasonable person fear and alarm" by sending a series of messages that "contained threatening, abusive and derogatory remarks regarding Muslims".
The charge is alleged to have been aggravated by religious prejudice.
Sheriff George Way set a trial for 18 October and ordered Mr Melville to attend a pre-trial hearing in September.
