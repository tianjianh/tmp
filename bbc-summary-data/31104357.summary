Transfer deadline day: Juan Cuadrado headlines spending

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea's £23.3m signing of winger Juan Cuadrado was the biggest deal completed on transfer deadline day as Premier League spending in the January window matched last year's £130m.

That figure fell well short of the record £225m spent in 2011.
Crystal Palace were the busiest top-flight club on deadline day, signing four players including Wilfried Zaha.
Hull announced the latest transfer, with Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye's move confirmed at 00:10 GMT.
There were 13 Premier League signings on deadline day, and 35 across the window.
A record summer of spending saw an outlay of £835m, which topped the £760m spent across the whole of last season. This window's spending takes the total for 2014-15 to £965m.
Dan Jones, partner in the sports business group at Deloitte, said: "Given the record level of spending seen in the summer, it is not entirely surprising that we haven't seen a new record for the January window.
"However, with all Premier League clubs recording record revenues, we might have expected one or two more major deals."
Some of the key findings from Deloitte's analysis of the January 2015 transfer window include:
The most surprising transfer of deadline day saw Manchester United sign 21-year-old Bolton defender Andy Kellett on loan.
There were five inter-Premier League transfers with Darren Fletcher moving from Manchester United to West Brom on a free transfer, Chelsea selling Ryan Bertrand to Southampton, Tottenham loaning Aaron Lennon to Everton, Robert Huth going from Stoke to Leicester on loan and Manchester United selling Zaha to Palace.
The Eagles also signed Bolton midfielder Lee Chung-yong and teenagers Andreas Breimyr and Keshi Anderson.
Tottenham signed MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli for a fee in the region of £5m and loaned him back to the League One club.
Despite being the biggest spenders, Chelsea made a profit on the day, selling Andre Schurrle to Wolfsburg for £22m and Bertrand for an undisclosed fee, as well as loaning Mohamed Salah to Fiorentina as part of the deal to sign Cuadrado.
Midfielder Filip Djuricic joined Bertrand at Southampton, moving to the club on loan from Benfica.
Manchester City had already done their recruitment, with striker Wilfried Bony joining from Swansea for a fee that could reach £28m. Arsenal did likewise in signing Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista for £11m.
Leicester broke their club record earlier in the window to sign Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric for more than £9m.
In Scotland, Celtic spent more than £2m on Dundee United midfielders Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven while Rangers signed five players on loan from Newcastle.
It was a quiet day across Europe - Schurrle's move apart - with Spain's transfer window having closed on Friday.
