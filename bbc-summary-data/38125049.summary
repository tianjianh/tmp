The world number 10 from Antrim made the clearance against Englishman Rod Lawler.
It put Allen 4-3 ahead, and the 30-year-old went on to secure a 6-4 victory.
"It was a big buzz as I'd never made one on tour. I'm very happy and it was relief when the black went in - I was nervous and I was shaking," he said.
The maximum is worth £5,000 from the rolling prize pot for 147s at ranking events, plus a £5,000 high-break prize if it is not matched.
Allen will take on Ryan Day or Kurt Maflin in the last 16 at the Barbican.
A beaten finalist at the Barbican five years ago, Allen came close to a 147 in 2010 at the World Championship, potting 15 reds and 15 blacks before missing the green.
He then went on to make a 146 in the same competition.
However, he made no mistake against Lawler and had been eyeing up the possibility after potting just six balls.
He added: "The balls were sitting so nice from 24 and I was thinking about it from then. The reds were all sitting, none on the cushions, and you can only mess it up from there.
"I went to the toilet afterwards to calm myself down and take deep breaths, control the breathing and take the shakes away."
