Victims and survivors had hoped a package would be up and running by now.
It would include a new investigations unit, an oral history archive and enhanced funding for Troubles-related inquests.
Speaking on BBC NI's Sunday Politics, Ms Thompson said some sort of agreement needs to be in place by Christmas.
"I believe that if we're going to see the legislation that is needed within this parliamentary session, then we need to see something for consultation, really this side of Christmas," she said.
"It's really important that was does get put in place is fit for purpose, trusted, transparent  and deals even-handedly with issues where different victims and survivors have different wishes and fears and priorities."
Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly says he wants an agreement  on dealing with the past as quickly as possible.
Secretary of State James Brokenshire  has said it is clear that the process would benefit from a more public phase.
Mr Kelly wants talks between all the parties.
"We're up for a short, sharp negotiation - let's get it sorted," he said.
"Yet the British government are not showing. I mean the proof is in the pudding, so if he [Mr Brokenshire] says that he's determined to do this  and there is a compromise then let him put it forward."
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt hit out at the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in's failure to resolve legacy issues.
"Within the basket of measures that are truth acknowledgement and justice we object to the fact that what we have at the moment is imbalanced, incomplete and imperfect and we're not supporting a continuation of that," he said.
"What we want is a full solution to truth."
