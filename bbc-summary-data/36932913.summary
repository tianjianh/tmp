Wayne Routledge scored twice as Swansea City sealed a comfortable 4-0 victory at Wolves in their penultimate pre-season game.

Routledge struck home with a volley to give Swansea the lead.
They doubled their lead when Kyle Naughton scored from an acute angle while Routledge tapped in his second and Oliver McBurnie sealed the win.
Wolves sacked ex-Swansea boss Kenny Jackett and appointed Walter Zenga as head coach hours before kick-off.
Former Wales international Jackett was Swansea manager between 2004 and 2007 and led them to promotion from League Two, the League One play-off final and the Football League Trophy.
The Swans, still without their Euro 2016 contingent of Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Lukasz Fabianski, dominated much of the game against a poor Wolves side who failed to trouble keeper Kristoffer Nordfeldt in the second half.
Francisco Guidolin's side's final pre-season friendly comes at home against French Ligue 1 outfit Stade Rennais on Saturday, 6 August (15:00 BST).
Wolves begin their Championship season away at Rotherham on the same day.
