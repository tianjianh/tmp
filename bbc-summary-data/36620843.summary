[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle have signed former Bristol City defender Karleigh Osborne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old centre-back was released by City earlier this summer, having spent most of last season on loan at AFC Wimbledon.
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Luke McCormick, 32, has agreed a new undisclosed-length contract with Argyle.
McCormick has made 287 appearances across two spells with Plymouth, including 48 last season as they reached the League Two play-off final.
Osborne replaces Peter Hartley, who left for Bristol Rovers earlier this month, while the club are still awaiting a decision from Curtis Nelson on whether he will sign a new deal.
