Wylfa Newydd: Anglesey nuclear plant design consultation begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation on design plans for a proposed nuclear power plant on Anglesey has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Environment Agency are looking at the plans for Wylfa Newydd.
The organisations will look at safety, security, environmental protection and waste management.
NRW's Tim Jones said: "Our purpose is to ensure that the natural resources of Wales are sustainably maintained, enhanced and used."
People are able to have their say on the proposals until 3 March.
But the public will have no influence on the technology used or the site location.
Once the consultation is over, NRW and the Environment Agency will look at the responses and make a decision on the acceptability of the design.
Horizon, the company behind the plans, estimates Wylfa Newydd, near Cemaes, will take about nine years to build and will have an operational life of 60 years.
It will employ 850 people and the final price tag will be about Â£12bn.
