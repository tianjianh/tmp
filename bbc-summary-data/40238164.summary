Chat: what did you think of The Voice Kids?

The Voice Kids kicked off on Saturday night with singers aged 7-14 facing blind auditions for the first time.

It's the first time that a junior equivalent of The Voice has come to the UK, although there have already been 30 versions of the show in other countries including Australia and France.
Will.i.am, Danny Jones, and Pixie Lott are the first judges to start the hunt for young stars in the UK.

I want to go on it, but it's very fun

Well I thought it was not good because I really want to go on it. But I still watch it. My favourite judge is Danny Jones because I'm a massive fan of McFly.
