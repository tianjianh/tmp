'He said yes!' London Marathon runner pops the question

A debut London marathon runner has proposed to her partner at the spot where he broke his hip in the race two years ago.

With a little over two miles to go, Marie Collinson, from Newcastle, dropped to one knee to the surprise of spectators, fellow runners, and of course, her partner of two years, John Dodds.
"In 2015, John broke his hip at mile 24 and couldn't finish the London Marathon, so I took the opportunity to propose and make mile 24 a happier memory."
The couple had met online that year as Marie sought to get fit through running, and John introduced her to the Wallsend Harriers club in Tyne & Wear.
Since joining the club, she says she has completed "71 parkruns, 5ks, 10ks, 10-milers and a couple of half marathons".
This year was Marie's first time running in the marathon, and she decided to make it a special day for John as well.
"This was my first, but John had done six previously.
"I now have the marathon buzz in a big way and I really want to complete all the world's major marathons - Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, New York and Boston - or should I say we would love to!"
The couple ran together and finished in just under five hours.
