[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 0-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A first-half goal from Keanu Marsh-Brown proved enough to give Forest Green Rovers a 1-0 win at Woking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers started brightly and took the lead after 19 minutes when Marsh-Brown converted a cross by Liam Noble, the midfielder making his debut following suspension after a summer move from Notts County.
Woking tried to force their way back into the match before half-time but forward Zak Ansah saw his effort saved by Sam Russell.
The visitors were forced into a change after 30 minutes when midfielder Rob Sinclair was replaced by Darren Carter and then had a header from Noble ruled out for offside.
Woking defender Jake Caprice fired a long-range effort over before Noble's free-kick was saved and substitute Matt Tubbs was denied a second Rovers goal in stoppage time by another decent stop from Cardinals keeper Michael Poke.
