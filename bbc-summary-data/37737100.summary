[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders nearly scored inside 14 seconds but Russell Griffiths saved well from Jamille Matt.
Brad Potts rounded Griffiths in the seventh minute, but blasted a shot against the bar.
Cheltenham took the lead against the run of play in the 18th minute when James Dayton's free-kick was deflected past his own goalkeeper by Danny Pugh.
Griffiths saved well again to keep out Kyle Vassell's shot but Blackpool levelled in the 45th minute after a counter attack. Cheltenham's corner was cleared and Potts led the charge, finding Vassell who beat Griffiths with a low shot.
The hosts regained the lead in the third minute of time added on when Jordan Cranston's cross from the left found Danny Wright at the far post and he notched his fourth of the season.
Vassell struck again less than two minutes into the second half, picking up the ball from Jack Payne and firing a superb shot inside the top left corner from 20 yards as it finished even.
