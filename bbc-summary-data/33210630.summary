Specialist staff from charity RSPCA had a "struggle" to get the ewe into one of the bags they use for such operations while on a slippery ledge overlooking Llanberis Pass, Gwynedd, on Friday.
Inspectors Mark Roberts and Mike Pugh abseiled over the edge to reach the sheep which was then lowered to safety.
"The sheep was fine," said Mr Pugh.
A sheep was rescued in a similar operation in March from from a tiny ledge on a sheer cliff in Gwynedd.
