[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Dundee nightclub to become gym and sports shop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Development of a Â£5m gym and sportswear outlet in a former Dundee nightclub has been approved, despite opposition from planning bosses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors had been urged to throw out the application for the Sports Direct development in the Stack Leisure Park, in the Lochee area of the city.
Planning bosses claimed the move could harm trade elsewhere in the city.
However, the development management committee instead chose to approve the plans, which could create 96 new jobs.
A report to the committee from planning chiefs claimed the proposal would have an adverse impact on the rest of Lochee and draw shoppers away from the city centre, where they said the development would be more at home.
However, when a motion to approve the plans was lodged by a cross-party pair of Lochee representatives - Labour's Tom Ferguson and SNP Lord Provost Bob Duncan - convener David Bowes was unable to find a seconder to support him in rejecting them.
The Sports Direct development can now go ahead at the former Venue nightclub building, which has been vacant for several years.
