The double Olympic cycling champion raced at the 2016 Festival having first sat on a racehorse 12 months before.
She finished fifth on Pacha Du Polder in St James's Place Foxhunter Chase.
"I don't think I'll ever ride at Aintree but if I get the opportunity to ride at Cheltenham and have a horse good enough, I will definitely take it up," she told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"It's so exhilarating, I can't even explain, it's such a thrill and I just love the company of the horses and how generous and accommodating they can be.
"They're a marvel. A wonder. I'm in love."
The 35-year-old was speaking after cruising to victory on Royal Etiquette in a charity race at Newmarket on Thursday.
Pendleton, who won Olympic gold in the sprint at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the keirin at the 2012 London Games, won at Wincanton on Pacha Du Polder, trained by Paul Nicholls, in February before going to Cheltenham.
"I'm going to carry on racing and see where it goes," she added.
"If opportunities come my way I'll definitely take them because it's been such an incredible journey the last 18 months and I don't feel like stopping any time soon.
"Its been a joy to be accepted into a new sport and welcomed. I love going to the yard in the morning, there's nothing nicer."
