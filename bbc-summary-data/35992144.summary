After the final whistle in March, Tyler was seen on camera helping officers clear up police tape from outside St James' Park after most of the 52,000 fans had left the ground.
The seven-year-old was given a signed football from the club and the chance to be a mascot when Newcastle United face Manchester City on 19 April.
