Reverend's silver cutlery sold for £4,000 at Colwyn Bay auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A silver cutlery set once owned by a leading Welsh religious figure has been sold for nearly £4,000 at auction in Conwy county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The collection of about 150 pieces was estimated to be worth up to £3,000 and weighed 7kg - more than one stone.
It previously belonged to Rev John Williams, the non-Conformist minister who helped recruit Welsh men to the Army during World War One.
The set was sold at Colwyn Bay to an unknown online bidder for £3,900.
Rev Williams, born in Llandyfrydog on Anglesey in 1854, was given the set as a wedding gift in 1899, accompanied with a brass tablet marking the occasion.
He began preaching at the age of 19 and in 1895 became pastor of the Princes Road Church in Liverpool before going on to preach in chapels and market places throughout rural Wales.
He died in November 1921 and was buried at Llanfaes, near Beaumaris.
The silverware was sold on behalf of Rev Williams' remaining relatives by Roger Jones & Co.
