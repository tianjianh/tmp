The Australian-born rapper opened up about her surgery in an interview with Vogue magazine.
When asked what she would change about her body, she said: "I did change something: Four months ago, I got bigger boobs. I'd thought about it my entire life."
The singer was reportedly fed up of having to use extra padding in her stage costumes.
The 24-year-old, who is dating basketball star Nick Young, also said she wanted to wear underwear without underwire.
Azalea said she didn't want to initially reveal her surgery because she was concerned about her fans and didn't want to make them body conscious.
"But then, I decided I wasn't into secret-keeping," she explained.
In the interview, the rapper explains how she was often told to get into modelling when she moved to the US.
"When I first got to the States, people told me I should think about modelling," she said.
"So I went to a few agencies, but once they measured my body. They didn't like me any more."
Azalea also revealed she measured a size zero on her top and a six on her bottom, which she says gave the fashion industry a headache.
The rapper also talked about the craziest rumour she'd heard about herself.
"[It was] that I used to be a man named Corey who had a sex change," she said.
