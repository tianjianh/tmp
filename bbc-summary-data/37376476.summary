Mohsin Bhatti was stabbed several times on Botanic Avenue in January 2015.
Ahmed Noor, 33, was given an indeterminate sentence at Belfast Crown Court after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The killer had paranoid schizophrenia and was using cannabis at the time.
A judge described the killing as a "truly horrific, unprovoked and brutal" attack on a vulnerable man.
The victim was a 29-year-old asylum seeker, originally from Pakistan.
Noor, who is originally from Somalia, was armed with two knives at the time of the killing.
The court heard that Mr Bhatti died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
