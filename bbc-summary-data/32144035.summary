The Telegraph leads with an open letter from 103 senior business leaders endorsing another Conservative-led government, and notes the executives oppose Labour plans to raise corporation tax. The letter warns that a "change in course" of policies could "put the recovery at risk".
Labour lays down the gauntlet on zero hours, writes the Independent. The paper says Labour's first Queen's Speech would propose legislation to ensure that employers would only be able to take workers on with a zero hours contract for 12 weeks before they offered them regular terms.
The FT also runs with Labour's plan to abolish all zero hours contracts. It says 1.8 million Britons work for firms that do not guarantee them any fixed hours, and adds that business organisation the CBI is "unhappy" at Labour's plan.
The Guardian leads with a different story: the Liberal Democrats' proposal for a new charter to "protect journalists from state interference" and end government-appointed broadcasting regulators.
Most experts believe the general election will result in no single party winning an overall parliamentary majority. So what's gone wrong with the system? Political commentator Danny Kruger offers his view.
"This is an unprecedented intervention in a British General Election... Their message couldn't be clearer,"
Chancellor George Osborne asked about the letter by business leaders in the Telegraph
"No one will be surprised that some business people are calling for low taxes for big businesses."

"It's not all about big business, it's not all about Tory peers."
Stuart Rose, Conservative peer and former Marks & Spencers boss on the business letter
"Yes we are the underdogs but look, the first ball's just been kicked in this campaign. We're nowhere near half-time let alone the final whistle. We can turn this around."
Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy on Labour's electoral prospects in Scotland
"If it's not good enough for us, I don't think it's good enough for the people of Britain."
Labour leader Ed Miliband on zero hours contracts
"Labour's proposals go too far. They are unnecessary and potentially damaging. Frankly, this is an example of politics trumping good policy.
