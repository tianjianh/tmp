The Guernsey school whose poor GCSE results sparked the resignation of the island's education minister has dramatically turned around its results.

The A*-C pass rate for La Mare De Carteret High School for five or more GCSEs including English and Maths was 42%, compared to 12% in 2011.
Vicky Godley, head teacher, said it was a huge step forward for the school.
The overall Bailiwick figures rose from 50.8% to 65.7% for five or more A*-C GCSEs, including English and Maths.
Alice Dewsnip, who attends Ladies' College, was one of two pupils in the island to be awarded 11 A* grades.
She said: "I'm just so pleased, it makes all the hard work worth it now... I was so shocked I was reading through and I couldn't believe it."
Nicole Hewlett, who goes to the same school, said of her 11 A* results: "When I opened it I was really confused, I couldn't work out what I'd got and then when I realised I was really happy."
Education Minister Robert Sillars said: "These results are a testament to the hard work of our young people not only over the last two years of their GCSE courses but throughout their time at school.
"As predicted the results at our High Schools have significantly improved after last year's dip.
"Our job is to ensure that we continue to build on this good performance."
The only school to record a big drop in the pass rate was St Anne's in Alderney, where it dropped from 56.3% to 31.6% for five or more A*-C GCSEs including English and Maths.
