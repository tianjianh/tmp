The judge said Gavin Thorman, 36, controlled a conspiracy which had done incalculable harm to Caernarfon.
The gang were sentenced at Caernarfon Crown Court on Friday.
The five-year covert investigation called Operation Yonside has been one of North Wales Police's biggest probes. It led to the seizure of almost £200,000 worth of cocaine and cannabis.
Thorman used the threat of violence to head up the network, the hearing was told.
And one of his lieutenants collected the drugs money while Thorman was in jail.
Police had a breakthrough when he boasted in Welsh about "making millions this time" while in prison, saying no-one could understand.
The police operation, involving several other forces, began after the seizure of £70,000 worth of cocaine in Caernarfon in 2009.
The defendants, mostly from Caernarfon as well as Manchester, pleaded guilty or were convicted of charges relating to the supply of the drugs.
Thorman arranged the supply of drugs from suppliers in Liverpool and Manchester, prosecution counsel Jayne La Grua told judge Merfyn Hughes QC.
In all, 48 mobile phones were found to belong to Thorman.
Passing sentence, the judge said: "Both in its structure and extent, it can be described as a large scale and sophisticated conspiracy."
The sentencing hearing began on Tuesday.
Richard Broadley, originally from Stockport, was described as one of Thorman's lieutenants, until the pair fell out.
His DNA was found on a pair of rubber gloves seized in November 2009 along with cocaine worth £69,400.
Adam Roberts, 33, from Caernarfon, was also described as another of Thorman's lieutenants, collecting drug money for him while he was in Liverpool's Altcourse prison.
Christopher Taylor, 29, from Caernarfon, was described as a courier and dealer whose home at 58 Pool Street, Caernarfon, was used as the gang's headquarters throughout 2013 and 2014, the court was told.
When his vehicle was seized in August 2014, it was found to contain £14,980.
