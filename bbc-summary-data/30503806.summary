Long-term joint waste deal sought for Dundee and Angus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two local authorities have launched a joint bid to tie up their waste and recycling needs for the next 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee City and Angus councils have issued tenders looking for bidders to treat and dispose of up to 90,000 tonnes of rubbish a year from 2016.
Waste from the two areas is currently disposed of at a waste to energy incinerator at Baldovie in Dundee.
The new deal would see more than half of household waste from the area recycled at a fixed price.
The Baldovie facility, which converts waste into electricity for the national grid, is currently leased by Dundee Energy Recycling Ltd.
However, the company has struggled financially since a fire in May 2012 forced the plant to close for a year, and has previously stated that it does not expect to trade beyond 1 January 2016.
Dundee City Council leader Ken Guild said the continuing use of the plant would save both councils a "considerable amount of money" in landfill tax, and provide long-term price certainty.
He said: "A new operator will be able to ensure that appropriate long-term investment is made at Baldovie to deal with residual waste from both council areas in the best possible way, ensuring that it will meet new stringent Scottish Zero Waste regulations and have a lasting positive impact on our environment."
Angus Council leader Iain Gaul added: "This project is complex, but it is one where the outcome for our residents is being driven by both councils.
"This joint working is a significant achievement."
The most recent figures for household waste recycling show Angus Council at 43.2% and Dundee City Council at 31.1%.
