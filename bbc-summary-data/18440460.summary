The dog, described as a Staffordshire bull terrier, barked at swans in Brookfield Park, Littlehampton, before leaping over a fence and attacking one.
The cob swan suffered serious injuries to its face and had to be put down.
A Â£500 reward for information which leads to a conviction has been offered by the Worthing and District Animal Rescue Service.
Sussex Police said swans had inhabited the pond for about 10 years and had recently hatched six cygnets.
Police community support officer Andy Orpin said the attack, which happened at about 08:00 BST on Saturday, had upset a lot of people in the community and left a family of swans without the protection of its cob.
"This really highlights the consequences of dog owners not maintaining control of their pets when using the park.
"If the people involved in this incident are located, we will consider prosecution," he said.
The owner of the dog was described as a white female, in her early 30s, of medium build, and with long blonde hair.
She was wearing a pink T-shirt and blue jeans.
Police said she had tried to get the dog to come out of the fenced area to prevent the attack but was unable to do so.
