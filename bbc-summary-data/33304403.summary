Trudy Jones, 52, from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, is understood to have been on the beach in Sousse when a gunman began firing on Friday.
"The reality of this horrific and brutal attack has now been brought home to our communities with the news that Trudy Jones of Blackwood is among those murdered," Islwyn MP Chris Evans said.
Ms Jones worked at a nursing home.
Staff at the home were notified on Saturday and it is understood her brother has flown out to Tunisia.
She had been due to fly home on Sunday and to go back to work at Highfields Nursing Home, where she was an activity coordinator, on Tuesday.
Manager of the home, Shawkat Ilahi, said: "All the staff and residents are all in terrible shock and, myself, I can't believe it... that this has happened.
"We were expecting her to come back to work on Tuesday."'
Mr Ilahi, who said Ms Jones's sister Jane also works at the home, added: "I even went to see the family and every single one of them [are] in shock."
He said of Trudy: "She was a very popular member of the team, always like a bottle of pop, always lively, always smiling."
First Minister Carwyn Jones had warned about the "possibility" Welsh tourists could be among the 38 people shot dead during the attack on the beach.
At least 15 are said to be British, but none have been officially identified by the Foreign Office.
Officials fear the UK death toll is likely to be in the mid to high 20s.
Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has reported links with Islamic State (IS), opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday.
More details have emerged of the attack, which saw Rezgui shoot at people on the beach near the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels.
He entered at least one of the hotel lobbies, where grenades were also detonated.
He then walked through the streets of Sousse where he was reportedly chased by local Tunisians, firing shots at them.
It has also been reported that local builders threw rubble down at him from rooftops as he passed by in the street. The attack eventually ended when he was shot dead by police.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered close to the scene a day after the attack for a rally against terrorism, with some holding candles and others carrying flags of the UK and Tunisia.
Many British tourists returned on Saturday on special flights while the two scheduled flights to Cardiff arrived on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the fiancee of a Welsh holidaymaker shot during the Tunisia terror attack has thanked well-wishers online.
