Guy, 19, finished 1.17 seconds behind China's Sun Yang who defended his title by clocking 3 minutes 42.58 seconds, with Ryan Cochrane taking bronze.
"I am over the moon with that. I gave it my best shot to try and get my hand on the wall first," Guy told BBC Sport.
Britain's Adam Peaty set a championship record of 58.18 to qualify for the 100m breaststroke final in Kazan.
"I was a bit more nervous than usual. That's like a final crowd out there," the 20-year-old said. "I did a lot of work on that front end to keep it as relaxed as possible. I'm kind of excited."
Peaty has set world records in the 50m and 100m breaststroke during a fine 12 months, with South African Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh qualifying from the other heat, alongside Brit Russ Murdoch who finished fourth. The trio meet in the final on Monday.
Defending champion, Australian Christian Sprenger, failed to progress.
Meanwhile, 24-year-old Jazz Carlin narrowly missed out on a medal after she came fourth in the women's 400m freestyle race.
"I gave it my best shot," said Carlin. "When you get to a World Championship, you're really racing the best in the world. That was my best today and to come fourth is really disappointing.
"I would have loved to be on the podium but that's the way it goes sometimes. I've got a few days off now so it will be nice to get a few days rest and move on ready for the 800m."
In the women's 200m individual medley, Siobhan Marie-O'Connor, 19, went through to the final after finishing fastest in her heat with a time of 2:08.45. Fellow Brit Hannah Miley, 25, also made it through after finishing fourth in the other heat.
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom set a world record in the 100m butterfly, clocking a time of 55.74 seconds to beat the previous best by 0.24 seconds.
France won the the men's 4x100m freestyle relay ahead of hosts Russia and Australia won the same event in the women's competition.
