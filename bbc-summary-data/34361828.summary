Plea to help uncover medieval village in Rhossili

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being urged to help uncover traces of a 15th Century village on Gower before it is swept out to sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National Trust is at Rhossili on Saturday, searching for remnants of a village which was engulfed by sand.
Recent storms have eroded the cliffs below where the village was located, but there are fears further erosion will mean it will be lost in the sea.
Robert Francis-Davies, chairman of Gower Landscape Partnership, said it would be "a coup" to find the remains.
