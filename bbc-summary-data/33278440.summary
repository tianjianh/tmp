David Cameron accepts EU treaty change delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron has accepted it may not be possible to change the EU's treaties before the UK's in/out referendum on the EU, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The PM has argued instead for an "irreversible lock" and "legally binding" guarantees that EU law will at some point in the future be changed to accommodate Britain's aims.
As recently as January Mr Cameron said he would be demanding "proper, full-on treaty change".
The PM is holding talks in Brussels.
Eurosceptics and those who want to leave the EU altogether have always been suspicious that agreements between political leaders can be later undermined in the courts.
They believe that legal or treaty changes are necessary to deliver the prime minister's negotiating objectives - in particular to free Britain from the EU's commitment to build an "ever closer union" of nation states and to ensure that benefits such as tax credits be withheld from migrants who have been in the country for less than four years.
David Cameron's critics may fear that the formula he is now using is a watering down of that commitment and will demand to know who would interpret any legally binding agreement reached between the UK and the rest of the EU.
Downing Street insists, however, that it is simply a reflection of the fact that any treaty change will require a time consuming ratification process in 28 different countries involving parliamentary votes as well as referendums in France, Ireland and Denmark.
They point out that when Ireland had a referendum in 2009 on the Lisbon Treaty all other EU countries had not yet ratified the proposed changes in EU law.
The prime minister is to formally set out his proposals to reform the EU at tonight's European Council summit dinner.
He has achieved his objective of speaking to all 27 EU leaders about his plans ahead of the summit, holding the final talks with his European counterparts on Thursday morning.
Mr Cameron also discussed EU reform with Council President Donald Tusk, who said the substance of the UK's proposals would be considered "but only in a way which will be safe for all Europe".
Mr Tusk warned that the fundamental values of the 28-member bloc "are not for sale and so are non-negotiable".
The PM's official spokeswoman said Mr Cameron had been clear he supported the fundamental values of the EU and the principle of free movement.
But she said "ever closer union" was not a principle Britain was attached to.
