Six teams have been shortlisted for a design competition to permanently light up 17 of London's bridges along the River Thames.

The Illuminated River project will see the pedestrian, road and rail crossings between Albert and Tower Bridge lit.
More than 100 international groups entered the competition which has raised Â£10m so far in private funding.
The designs are on display at the Royal Festival Hall during November with the winner announced on 8 December.
According to the organisers, the Illuminated River Foundation, the project will be funded "from private and philanthropic sources rather than the public purse".
The project has been backed by Sadiq Khan who said it would be a "wonderful celebration" of the river and "a major contribution to the growing importance of London's night-time economy".
The foundation said they hoped to install the winning design in 2018 depending on whether they could raise more funds and following consultation with local councils and the people who own the bridges.
Blurring Boundaries has been designed by the Adjaye Associates' who say their idea "re-imagines the bridges not as connectors, but as the heart of London itself".
The designers behind The Eternal Story of the River Thames say they "want to reveal the river as a breathing, pulsing organism" with the lighting of the bridges changing with the tide.
Synchronizing the City: Its Natural and Urban Rhythms would see the crossings "slowly fill with light like a vessel with liquid" during the night, before beams on each bridge shine into the sky.
Current is a "transformational artwork" which is "designed to enliven the Thames using dynamic light" in three different stages, according to its designers.
A River Ain't Too Much To Light would see the bridges being illuminated progressively, "to follow the ideal line of demarcation between light and shadow (twilight)", its designers say.
The Thames Nocturne would form "a ribbon of light connecting Chelsea to Wapping".
