GlenWyvis Distillery Community Benefit Society is working with Community Shares Scotland to raise more than Â£1.5m in investment.
So far the effort has received more than Â£517,000 in pledges to take shares in the venture.
The distillery would be built on farmland and be fully community-owned and powered by renewable energy.
Construction could start in June this year with the first run of whisky planned for Burns Night on 25 January 2017.
Farmer John Mckenzie, who is helping to lead the project, said: "From the outset we have envisaged the project as more than a distillery.
"It is an opportunity for all social investors to help reinvigorate the historic town of Dingwall."
He added: "GlenWyvis will be built on its whisky heritage, its community-ownership and its environmental credentials."
The community shares scheme was launched last month and is due to come to an end in June. The project's board have the option to extend the scheme if necessary.
