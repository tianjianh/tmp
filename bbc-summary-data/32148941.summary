[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester Tigers winger Miles Benjamin is likely to be out for the rest of the season because of a knee injury, reports BBC Radio Leicester.

The 26-year-old was injured in last week's win over Exeter.
Director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "With eight weeks of the season to go that is probably the last we will see of him."
Meanwhile, scrum-half Sam Harrison, 24, has signed a new deal, but the length of the contract has not been revealed.
Benjamin has been plagued by injuries since signing from Worcester in 2012, suffering a serious neck injury which delayed his first-team debut by 15 months.
He also sustained a knee injury that ruled him out for four months last term.
But Cockerill said: "It is certainly not too serious and he will make a full recovery in the next eight to 10 weeks."
