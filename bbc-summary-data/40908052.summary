[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donal McDermott scored the only goal of the game as Swindon Town prevailed at Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Rochdale man took the ball on the right and cut in-field onto his left foot before curling a superb effort past Barry Roche into the bottom right-hand corner from the edge of the box.
The visitors should have added a second in the 66th minute when substitute James Brophy headed over when unmarked just six yards out. They went close on several occasions through former Shrimps' striker Paul Mullin, who headed wide in the opening minutes.
After a sluggish start Morecambe began to cause problems.
Garry Thompson saw a close-range shot on the turn well blocked by Olly Lancashire before the same defender turned a Michael Brough left wing cross over his own goal.
Swindon keeper Lawrence Vigouroux then produced a fine save to turn away an Andy Fleming volley from the edge of the box before he did well again on the stroke of half-time to deny Aaron Wildig.
In the closing stages, Thompson went close with two volleys but Swindon hung on for the points.
