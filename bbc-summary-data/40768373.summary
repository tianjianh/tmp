The 21-year-old Welsh competitor finished five points ahead of her compatriot Gemma Frizelle with City of Birmingham's Mimi-Isabella Cesar third.
"I've had lots of competitions and training so just to know it's all paid off is really good," said Halford.
She has been selected in the British team for the world championships in Pesaro, Italy, at the end of August.
