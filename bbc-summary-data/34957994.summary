The 73-year-old, who died on 17 September, presented the Sunday Morning Gardening Show for 22 years and had been the station's on-air gardening expert for more than 40 years.
His co-presenter Tim Crowther led the service at St Peter's Church, Leeds.
Family and friends were joined by 100 Radio Leeds listeners.
Speaking at the time of his death, former editor of Radio Leeds, Rozina Breen, described Mr Maiden as "a gentleman".
She said: "We will miss Joe enormously: his enthusiasm, energy, generosity and kindness - not to mention his stellar knowledge of horticulture.
"He was a gentleman in every sense of the word and it was a complete privilege to work with him.
The memorial service will be played on Radio Leeds on Sunday, 6 December at 11:00 GMT.
