[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Choulay, 21, could make his debut in Sunday's Scottish Premiership visit to leaders Celtic.
Capped at Under-23 level by Morocco, he had spells at Espanyol and Barcelona before moving to Stoke in 2015 but has yet to play in the Potters' first team.
But Choulay did make six appearances during a recent loan spell at Shrewsbury Town in League One.
Hearts have already signed striker Dylan Bikey, defenders Andraz Struna, Lennard Sowah and Aaron Hughes and midfielder Malaury Martin in the January transfer window.
