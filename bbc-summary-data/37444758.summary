The ex-England international centre, 33, has played for the Black and Whites - his hometown club - for 15 years, making 371 appearances.
Yeaman is discussing a potential future behind-the-scenes role at Hull.
"It was a really tough call to make. Playing rugby is all I've done since the age of five. But, as they say, all good things come to an end." he told Hull's website.
"It's been something that I've been thinking about for a while. I'm 33 and I'm not getting any younger.
"My body isn't what it used to be. These last few weeks, particularly after winning the Challenge Cup, confirmed it for me."
August's triumph against Warrington at Wembley saw Yeaman become the only player to win the Challenge Cup twice with Hull, having also been part of their victorious 2005 squad.
He could bow out with two more trophies, as the winners of Friday's match against the Wolves will clinch the League Leaders' Shield, while Hull have already qualified for the play-off semi-finals and are eyeing a first Grand Final victory at Old Trafford on 8 October.
"There'd be no better way to finish my career with the year that we've had so far and what we could still potentially achieve," he said.
Yeaman's 176 tries make him third-highest try scorer in Hull's history.
Head coach Lee Radford, a former team-mate of Yeaman, said: "The many records he has will put him up there as one of the greatest players to have played for the club, and deservedly so.
"I hope he can go out on a high, and the stage is set for him to do so with the position that we're in at the moment.
"It will be sad when he puts his boots up for the final time."
