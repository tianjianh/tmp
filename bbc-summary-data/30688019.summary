A crowd of 46,800 watched as the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker returned to the club where he began his career.
A penalty from Atletico's Raul Garcia, after he had been fouled, and Jose Maria Gimenez's header sealed the win.
But Torres was quiet and was replaced after 59 minutes as the Spanish champions beat the European champions.
The 30-year-old, who signed on loan from Italian side AC Milan last week, was Atletico's top scorer for five consecutive seasons before he joined Liverpool in 2007.
More than 45,000 fans had attended the Vicente Calderon on Sunday when Torres was paraded, with 2,000 shirts adorned with his name selling within 24 hours.
But his second debut did not match the hype as he often found himself chasing balls close to the touchline or in an offside position.
Indeed, Atletico's opening goal - from Garcia's well-taken penalty after he had been fouled by Sergio Ramos - was their first shot on target and came just one minute before Torres was replaced by Koke.
In a game of few chances, Real's Sergio Ramos had a header saved in the opening minute and Gareth Bale, who scored the winner for Real in their 2-1 win against Barcelona in the 2014 Copa Del Rey final, had a headed effort disallowed for offside.
Atletico, who last won the competition in 2013, doubled their lead in the 76th minute as Gimenez headed in a corner.
They now play Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday, before the second leg at Real's Bernabeu on 15 January.
The winners of the tie will face either Barcelona or Elche in the quarter-finals.
