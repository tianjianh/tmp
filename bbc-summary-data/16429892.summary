Tuvalu Profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Media freedom is respected in Tuvalu but the market is very small. The government operates Radio Tuvalu. Many islanders use satellite dishes to watch foreign TV stations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government publishes the fortnightly newspaper Tuvalu Echoes in the Tuvalu language and in English.
There were around 4,300 internet users by December 2011 (InternetWorldStats.com).
