The 28-year-old Dutchman had been in talks with the Chinese Super League club for several weeks.
Chery scored 14 goals in 66 appearances for Rangers after joining from FC Groningen in the summer of 2015.
"Whilst it's disappointing to lose a player of Tjaronn's ability, I only want players at QPR who want to be here," R's boss Ian Holloway said.
"As a manager, when a player tells you he wants to leave with 18 months left to run on their contract, it's in the club's best interests to part ways and bring in players who want to play for the club."
