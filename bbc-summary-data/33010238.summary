[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been cleared of murdering her seven-year-old niece at a house in Nottingham but found guilty of cruelty towards the girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shanay Walker died from a brain injury at the property in Bestwood, in July.
A jury at Nottingham Crown Court cleared Kay-Ann Morris, 24 of killing Shanay, but convicted her of cruelty.
Morris's mother Juanila Smikle, 53, of Easegill Court, Top Valley, was also found guilty of cruelty towards the girl.
Smikle was found guilty of cruelty to three other children, but cleared of another charge of cruelty towards a fifth child.
Morris was cleared of a cruelty charge towards another child.
Both are due to be sentenced on Friday.
During the trial the jury heard Shanay came into Morris's care after her mother Leann Walker suffered depression following the birth of another child.
Morris was later granted guardianship in 2011.
Ms Walker said during visits Shanay showed signs of bruising and "seemed distant", the court heard.
She told the jury she received a phone message on the morning of Shanay's death from Morris saying: "I'm sorry. I wasn't strong enough."
A post-mortem report showed Shanay had more than 50 injuries on her body and had died of a brain injury.
The prosecution alleged Morris subjected her niece to a "sustained, vicious and brutal beating".
Morris elected not to give evidence at the trial but had previously told police officers Shanay had accidently fallen down the stairs.
