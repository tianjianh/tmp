Gorwel is calling for the post to be created after consulting businesses.
New Prime Minister Theresa May has made David Davis Secretary of State for Exiting the EU in her first cabinet.
Welsh ministers said they had already announced their "immediate priorities" following the referendum and would make further statements in due course.
Gorwel said businesses see Brexit as an opportunity to "transform" the Welsh economy and make it "less dependent on government support."
The think tank's chairman Meirion Morgan said: "With Theresa May now prime minister, we can be in no doubt that Brexit will dominate the UK Government's agenda for the foreseeable future.
"We're patently aware of the significant impact an EU exit will have on Wales and know the Welsh government is aware of it too.
"It is now crucial that the people of Wales have strong political leadership and we feel a minister is required to lead and focus on Brexit."
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "This is a broad set of recommendations, most of which represent a common sense approach and many of which we are already pursuing.
"The first minister has already announced our immediate priorities and will be making further statements in due course."
