[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nick McKinnel named as new Anglican Bishop of Plymouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new Anglican Bishop of Plymouth has been named as the Right Reverend Nick McKinnel, current Bishop of Crediton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bishop McKinnel previously spent 18 years as rector of St Andrew's Church in Plymouth.
The Bishop of Exeter said the new bishop would bring "his own distinctive brand of warmth and wisdom" to the job.
The Plymouth post has been vacant for more than a year since the resignation of the Right Reverend John Ford, who moved to Australia.
Bishop McKinnel was made Bishop of Crediton in 2012.
The diocese said his experience of Plymouth made him "a good candidate to become the bishop of the city and the surrounding area, including Torbay".
The Bishop of Exeter, the Right Reverend Robert Atwell, said: "He combines an instinctive feel for the art of the possible with a commitment to Christ and to mission which will serve Plymouth well."
Bishop McKinnel said: "I have greatly enjoyed my time as the Bishop of Crediton and now look forward as Bishop of Plymouth to working alongside clergy and parishes in the south and west of the diocese in the cause of Christ."
