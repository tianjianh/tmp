[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Sturgeon has a series of engagements in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, which are designed to promote Scottish businesses.
The first minister will bring together Scottish companies and Chinese investors during the five-day trip.
She will also undertake cultural and educational visits.
Ms Sturgeon is due to speak about women's rights in a keynote address to 100 senior women in government, academia and business in Beijing.
She will also raise the issue of human rights with Chinese authorities.
The first minister said: "I will be in China to promote Scottish innovation in all forms - from our emerging technology companies to our trailblazing Scottish designers to our oil and gas expertise.
"But Scotland's innovation isn't just about technology, we are also promoting a very distinctive approach to creating a more competitive economy - one that is based on a fair society.
"One of the guiding principles of our engagement with China is respect for human rights and the rule of law."
She added: "I also believe that economic growth and equality are two sides of the same coin.
"That is why I will be speaking about women's rights and the benefits equality can bring to the economy - both here in Scotland and for China."
Chinese visitors are estimated to have contributed Â£112m to the Scottish economy in 2012 and 2014, with exports to China reaching record levels of almost Â£580m in 2013.
