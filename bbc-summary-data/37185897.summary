The Orica Bike-Exchange rider, 24, attacked late on to win by 20 seconds, with Spaniard Luis-Leon Sanchez second and Italian Fabio Felline third on the 163.2km stage to Ribeira Sacra.
Yates' twin brother Adam was the first British winner of the Tour de France's white jersey this year.
Compatriot Chris Froome finished in the peloton to stay third overall.
He remains 32 seconds behind race leader Colombian Darwin Atapuma of BMC, with Spaniard Alejandro Valverde 28 seconds adrift in second.
Simon Yates, who returned from a four-month drugs ban in July after his team made an "administrative error" over an asthma inhaler, moved into 10th in the general classification, one minute 28 seconds behind Atapuma.
Yates said: "There were lots of twists and turns but I managed to come down [the descent] perfectly and I timed my attack to perfection.
"We really set it up well and I managed to take the opportunity and finish.
"It wasn't planned. We just tried to make it a hard race and I am really happy."
