Bijan Ebrahimi murder: Officers sacked for misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer and PCSO have been sacked over how they dealt with a Bristol man who went on to be murdered in a vigilante attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Kevin Duffy, 52, should have known Bijan Ebrahimi was in danger in July 2013 but refused to speak to or visit him, Avon and Somerset Police said.
He and PCSO Andrew Passmore, 56, were convicted of misconduct in public office last month.
Both have been dismissed this week, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Iranian-born Mr Ebrahimi, who was registered disabled, was wrongly suspected of being a paedophile by his neighbour Lee James.
He had called police to report being assaulted by James, days before he was attacked and killed outside his flat in Capgrave Crescent, Brislington.
Bristol Crown Court heard last month Mr Ebrahimi had called the non-emergency 101 number 12 times, trying to get police to investigate the assault.
The court heard he told one operator: "My life is in danger. Right now a few of my neighbours are outside and shouting and calling me a paedophile. I need to see PC Duffy."
But the trial learned that Duffy regarded Mr Ebrahimi as a "liar and a nuisance" and never went to see him, instead requesting Passmore conduct "a bit of a foot patrol" in the vicinity.
Passmore was convicted of misconduct in a public office for falsely claiming to have spent an hour patrolling the area.
James went on to kill Mr Ebrahimi and set fire to his body. He is serving a life sentence for murder.
Duffy and Passmore have not yet been sentenced.
In separate misconduct hearings held on Friday, Avon and Somerset Police said Duffy was found guilty of gross misconduct and dismissed without notice. Passmore was dismissed at a hearing earlier this week.
They are two of 18 officers and staff facing misconduct proceedings over the case.
