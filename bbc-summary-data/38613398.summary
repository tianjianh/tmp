Portsmouth Crown Court heard that Kevin Finch, 36, admitted attacking the 18-year-old woman in the car park off Old Blackgang Road, Niton, on 7 October.
Prosecutors said they would not seek a trial for four other alleged offences including kidnap and inflicting GBH.
Finch, of no fixed address, was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date.
The court heard that the victim had been picked up from Sandown High Street and driven to a car park in Old Blackgang Road where she was attacked.
