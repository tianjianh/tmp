Toulon outmuscled Scarlets as they moved clear in second place in Pool Three of the Champions Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts smashed their way to an 11-point interval lead with tries by Mamuka Gorgodze, Leigh Halfpenny and Romain Taofifenua.
Toulon survived two TMO decisions early in the second half before Guilhem Guirado secured the bonus point.
Ken Owens and John Barclay scored for Scarlets with Wales international Halfpenny claiming 16 points.
Scarlets struggled to handle Toulon's power, with France international centre Mathieu Bastareaud crashing through would-be tacklers as he set up the opening two tries.
The win lifts three-times champions Toulon to nine points in the pool, five behind defending champions Saracens.
Scarlets started well, but kicked attacking possession away and from their first attack Toulon set the tone for the game with giant centre Bastareaud crashing through to set up Gorgodze.
The Bastareaud battering ram again laid waste to the defence before Halfpenny strolled over on the left and within two minutes Taofifenua appeared to end the match as a contest as he stretched out a long left arm to claim Toulon's third try.
Scarlets hit back when hooker Owens charged over from close range after a fluid move.
The Welsh region came out fired-up for the second half with scrum-half Gareth Davies denied a try after television replays, even though Toulon's Jocelino Suta appeared to tackle him illegally.
Moments later, wing Steff Evans crossed wide out only to have the try disallowed when Scott Williams was adjudged to have knocked the ball on in the build-up - again after the television match official had a look.
Toulon weathered the storm, and when Guirado touched down after a powerful drive the contest was over, with Barclay's late try briefly raising hopes of a losing bonus point for the Scarlets.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac: "There was a massive swing in the game at 24-13 and I thought the [Steff Evans'] try was a fair try. I asked the referee afterwards 'how far backwards does the ball have to travel for you to award a knock-on'.
"I thought it was a good try and if it's awarded at 24-20 we're in the game. As it turned out there was a couple of errors that left them to get in with a try. Clearly a player is tackled on the ground and he's allowed to get up and carry on - there's a few things I wasn't happy with."
