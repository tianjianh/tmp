[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 2-1 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge moved into the League Two play-off places for the first time this season by beating Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uche Ikpeazu gave the U's the lead six minutes into the second half, running onto Conor Newton's pass and firing a rising effort past Ben Garratt.
Newton had missed the best chance of the first half, which the hosts had dominated, shooting wastefully off target when well placed following Harrison Dunk's pass.
Full-back Greg Taylor doubled the lead on the hour, robbing Chris Dagnall and unleashing a stunning effort which flew home via the underside of the crossbar.
Despite being comprehensively outplayed, Crewe found a way back into the match eight minutes later through James Jones, who fired a fine low effort across Will Norris from just outside the box.
Piero Mingoia came closest to building Cambridge's advantage and sealing their fourth straight league win, forcing Garratt into a parry after being played in by Ikpeazu.
The U's are now seventh, having been bottom until the end of September.
