Warburton has been out for three weeks after suffering a fractured cheekbone.
Cardiff Blues say Warburton is completely recovered from the cheekbone injury, but is suffering with "residual stiffness in his neck".
Warburton had a metal plate inserted in the injury suffered against Leinster and said he had been given the all-clear to return.
"From a head point of view the plate is absolutely fine to play now," said the 2013 British and Irish Lions captain.
Warburton is still hoping to lead Wales against Australia in Cardiff on 5 November.
Blues face Pau at the Arms Park after winning their opening Challenge Cup game at Bristol 33-20.
Warburton says there were no issues in recovering from his cheek bone injury.
"It was a fractured cheekbone - it sounds worse than it was - it was only a minor fracture," he said.
"I had the operation just under two weeks ago and they say as soon as the stitches have healed you're OK to go.
"The stitches have come out, it's all healed up nicely - just protect it with a bit of tape so it's a nice quick turnaround."
The inch-long metal plate inserted in the injury will remain in place.
