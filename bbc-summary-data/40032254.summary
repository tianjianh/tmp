Treehugger: Wawona, which showcases the giant sequoia of California, won an immersive storytelling award at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.
It will go on show for the first time in Wales at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot, from Saturday until 1 July.
The 15-minute experience is for four visitors at a time.
It was created in a collaboration between researchers at London's Natural History Museum and Salford University, using the latest 3D imaging techniques.
