Head coach Aitor Karanka has blamed his own mistakes for promotion-chasing Middlesbrough's recent drop in form but is confident he can "fix it".

Boro have lost their last two games and are now second in the table below new leaders Hull after Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest.
"I have to learn, I have to know the mistakes that I have made," Karanka told BBC Tees.
"It is not the players' mistakes because it has been my mistakes."
He continued: "The best thing is that I know the mistakes and fortunately I can fix it."
The Teessiders were on a run of five straight wins before defeats to Bristol City and Forest in the last week, having previously only lost four league games.
"Sometimes we have lost games playing well. But my concern is that we are losing the games and we are not playing well," said Karanka.
"It's the fourth game that we don't play in our way, but the best thing is that we have time to work on the pitch to recover our style."
Former Athletic Bilbao striker Kike Sola is Middlesbrough's only signing of the transfer window so far, but Karanka remains keen to strengthen his squad.
"I needed to do something [against Forest] and I didn't have the right players to make the substitution I would have liked to," he added.
