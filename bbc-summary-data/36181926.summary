The 25-year-old from Birmingham beat Russia's Konstantin Kravchuk 3-6 6-4 6-4 in Sunday's final.
Evans, a member of Britain's Davis Cup-winning team last year, is on course to rise from 123rd to around 97th - the first time he has broken the top 100.
He was ranked 766th in the world at this stage last year.
Evans will join fellow Britons Andy Murray (2), Aljaz Bedene (59) and Kyle Edmund (89) among the world's top 100 men in Monday's new rankings.
