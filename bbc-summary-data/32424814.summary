An Islamic centre in Australia, attended by two teenagers charged with terrorism-related offences, has closed its doors.

The al-Furqan Islamic centre in south-west Melbourne said it believed that it was the best course of action given the "pressure" it had received.
Five teenagers were arrested after anti-terror raids last weekend.
Police said the men were planning to carry out an attack during an Anzac memorial event.
The al-Furqan Islamic Centre said that the decision to close had "not been taken lightly".
It said in a statement: "We believe that given the constant harassment, pressure and false accusations levelled against the centre - particularly by media and politicians - this is the best course of action for the protection of the local community, its members, and the broader Muslim community that is often implicated in these insidious campaigns."
The centre and bookstore had come under scrutiny after it was revealed that three of those charged after the raids had attended it.
Harun Causevic and Sevdet Besim, both 18, have both been charged with conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts.
Another teenager was charged with weapons-related offences. The other two men have been released.
Nearly 200 police officers took part in the Melbourne operation early on Saturday morning.
The al-Furqan centre has said that it had no connection with the anti-terror raids.
On Tuesday, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Fontana said that al-Furqan had come to its attention among other centres.
"It's more about some of the individuals who are opening up or trying to influence these young people, they are the people of real concern," he said, as quoted by ABC News.
Al-Furqan has been at the centre of controversy before. It was also attended by Abdul Numan Haidar, a teenager shot dead in September after he stabbed two officers.
