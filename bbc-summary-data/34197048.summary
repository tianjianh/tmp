Rob Brydon play Future Conditional could 'upset critics'

Matthew Warchus, who has replaced Kevin Spacey at London's Old Vic, says he might ruffle feathers by beginning his first season with a "bullish" play about the British education system.

Future Conditional, which opened on Thursday, stars Welsh comedian Rob Brydon as an inspirational teacher.
It deals with middle class angst over school places, and the debate over public and private schools.
"I don't know if it's going to upset the critics," Warchus told the BBC.
"It's pretty bullish in the things it's got to say about privilege and private education and the Oxbridge system, but everybody from all different backgrounds come in for a beady stare by this play. It's a great leveller."
But, as it turns out, the reviews have been largely positive.
Awarding four stars, The Guardian said Tamsin Oglesby's new play "crackles with intellectual energy".
The Stage, also giving four stars, said Warchus had set out his Old Vic stall with "a big, ambitious piece of new writing".
The Mail, however, dubbed the play "simplistic tosh".
The opening night audience included former Labour leader Ed Miliband and actress Tamsin Greig.
Speaking after the performance, Warchus said: "I don't think all theatre should be about contemporary social issues, but some theatre has to be.
Brydon said he'd noticed the play was sparking debate.
"On one level it's a piece of entertainment but it's so much more - you go away and just want to talk about it."
He said he intended to invite his former drama teacher, Roger Burnel, from his days as a pupil at  Porthcawl Comprehensive School in Wales.
"I'm still in touch with him, we're still very good friends - he was very inspirational for me."
Tara Hanley, a teacher with 18 years' experience in both the state and independent sector.
"Rob Brydon's performance was spot on. The play was very perceptive about the dynamics in a classroom where you have this constant bouncing back and forth between a teacher and 30 kids who want to participate and to get their own control.
"It captured the fun and the frustration of that.
"There are a lot of teachers who end up in acting and stand-up comedy. I think there is a huge similarity: To be a good teacher you have to be a good entertainer.
"Teachers will enjoy it because they will see things mirrored back at them. A lot of teachers will agree with the political ideology that lies behind it: There is a strong criticism of a middle class culture. The private system is clearly battered in this.
"A lot of public debate about education assumes that just because you've been to school you understand it. There are things that were shown in the play that fill in some of the gaps."
Future Conditional is at the Old Vic until 3 October
