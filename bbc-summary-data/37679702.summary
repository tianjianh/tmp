Campaigner Margaret Aspinall, who lost her son James in the tragedy, collected the award on behalf of the "mothers, sisters, daughters and aunts" and their 27-year fight for the truth.
Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in Britain's worst-ever sporting disaster on 15 April 1989.
Fresh inquests concluded in April that the victims were unlawfully killed.
Police errors were blamed for the crush while the Liverpool fans were cleared of any blame.
The Hillsborough Family Support Group chairwoman received the award from Prime Minister Theresa May.
Jane Luca, Chair of Women of the Year, said: "The mothers, sisters, daughters and aunts deserve to be recognised as our Special Women of the Year for working tirelessly for 27 years to establish the truth of what happened at Hillsborough.
"This award also honours those mothers who have died before seeing justice done."
Anne Williams, who refused to accept the original accidental death verdict into the death of her 15-year-old son Kevin and led the fight for new inquests, died from cancer in April 2013.
More than 400 women attended the awards in London including some mothers of the fans who died during the fateful FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.
The Women of the Year awards have recognised and celebrated women of all backgrounds since 1955.
