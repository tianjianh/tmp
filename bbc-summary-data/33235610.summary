The pound jumped by 0.85%, or more than one euro cent, to â‚¬1.4072, although against the dollar the pound was down 0.26% at $1.5783.
On the stock market, the FTSE 100 was 16.93 points higher at 6,842.60, adding to the sharp gains seen on Monday.
However, the FTSE was lagging gains elsewhere, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 both up more than 1%.
Shares in business supplies distributor Bunzl dropped 1.6% - the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 - after it said organic revenue growth had slowed in the first half of its financial year.
Bunzl also announced it had bought four businesses in the US, Colombia, Canada and France.
However, the most eye-catching move was in the FTSE 250, where shares in Ladbrokes jumped 16% after it said it was in merger talks with Gala Coral.
