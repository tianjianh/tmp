The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said a Mayday call was received at 12:40 BST reporting he had fallen from the vessel in French waters.
RNLI lifeboats from Eastbourne, Newhaven and Shoreham and the UK Coastguard helicopter were involved in the search.
The search was suspended at 21:00 BST, the UK Coastguard confirmed.
Matt West, duty controller for the UK Coastguard said: "Following a comprehensive search effort in the area with nothing found, a decision has been taken to suspend the search pending any further information."
The MCA said the vessel was 30 miles south of Newhaven when it happened.
The French Coastguard was also involved in the search.
