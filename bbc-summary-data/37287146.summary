Wigan Warriors' second-half fightback kept alive their faint hopes of winning the Super League Leaders' Shield with victory against fellow Grand Final hopefuls Hull FC.

Having trailed 12-4 at half-time, with George Williams' score cancelled out by Fetuli Talanoa and Mahe Fonua, Wigan dominated the scoring after the break.
Sam Powell sneaked in from dummy-half to pull within two points.
Taulima Tautai then stretched out to turn the match late on and stun Hull.
Matty Smith's late penalty goal on the hooter added to the result, which leaves Wigan and Hull three points behind leaders Warrington, who have 41 points and need one win to secure silverware.
Challenge Cup winners Hull have eyes on a treble and looked to have passed this test of character after a dominant first 40, marshalled by Marc Sneyd's dangerous kicking game.
However, Shaun Wane's side muscled up in defence and attack in the second half, keeping the home side from scoring, and took advantage of late errors to come away with the two points.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford told BBC Radio Humberside:
"We got what we deserved, this time of year you can't dominate a side for 60 minutes and not execute your chances.
"For the last 10 minutes you can't make errors like we did and win games of footy.
"We've got to fix our skill set up, the last 20 I don't know what happened so I will have to look at the interchanges.
"The quicker we can stop mentioning the Challenge Cup the better."
Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was a very tough win. I'm really pleased with the desire we showed, the effort was 10/10, but smartness 2/10.
"To be honest I felt our defensive effort was fantastic, but our first attacking set was 11 minutes from half-time. If we're smarter and get teams into an arm wrestle, go kick-for-kick, we can trouble teams.
"There are things we need to work on, I'm not going to get carried away but it was a great win against a fantastically coached team.
"Just to get the win today was a good effort. We're in control [of our destiny], we're tight in the dressing room and we have belief."
