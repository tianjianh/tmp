The 22-year-old Welsh taekwondo athlete says she is determined to defend her title in Rio after her bronze medal at the World Grand Final.
Jones says she lacked "grit" in her latest event, but feels well-placed to succeed in 2016.
"I'm in a better place than I was going into London. I'm definitely going there to get gold," she told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'd be devastated with anything less."
Jones claimed the -57kg category gold at London 2012 when she was still 19 years old.
This year she won the World Grand Prix event in Manchester, but was below par in the final event of the year in Mexico.
Jones beat Swede Nikita Glasnovic in the third-place fight-off.
"I'm really disappointed in myself with my performance there," she added.
"I know I'm a lot better than how I fought, I think it's just been too many competitions.
"I just didn't get up for it the way I had for the other ones. I'm disappointed at myself because I don't think I went for it as much as I should have."
However, Jones believes that, after a break, she will be ready to begin serious preparations for her Olympic campaign.
"I'm in a great place for Rio," she said.
"I've medalled in every Grand Prix and I'm just getting better and better and I'm world number one going into 2016.
"I'm in a great place to become double Olympic champions. I have to keep going and pushing the boundaries and keep getting better and better."
