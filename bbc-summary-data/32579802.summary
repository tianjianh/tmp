Sheku Ahmed Tejan Bayoh died after he was held by officers in Kirkcaldy in the early hours of Sunday.
Police Scotland previously confirmed a female police officer was injured during the same incident but gave no further details.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has launched an investigation into the matter.
A PIRC spokeswoman said: "The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has directed the Police Investigations & Review Commissioner (PIRC) to carry out an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of 31-year-old Sheku Ahmed Tejan Bayoh in Kirkcaldy on Sunday 3 May who had been detained by police shortly before his death.
"A report on the PIRC's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course.
"As this is a live investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
An appeal has been issued by the PIRC for witnesses who were in Hayfield Rd, near Hendry Road, Kirkcaldy between 07:00 and 08:00 on Sunday.
The PIRC is keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed any incident in this area.
Fife Divisional Commander Chief Superintendent Garry McEwan said earlier: "This is a tragic set of circumstances and my condolences go to the man's family.
"The investigation of deaths in Scotland is the responsibility of Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who have instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner to lead on this inquiry."
