Notts County 1-4 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County's miserable home form continued as they were comprehensively beaten by mid-table Exeter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jayden Stockley opened the scoring for the visitors before Izale McLeod levelled the game going into half-time.
Substitute Jake Taylor's low finish put Exeter back in front and Christian Ribeiro's neat header gave the visitors a two-goal cushion.
Ollie Watkins' cool finish punished slack County defending to seal the points for the Grecians.
