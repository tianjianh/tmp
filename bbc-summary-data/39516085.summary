Parking charges u-turn at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to raise parking charges at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary have been dropped following concerns from staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parking at the privately-run visitor and patients car parks was to increase from £7 a day to £15.
Staff had complained that they would be worst hit by the rise.
Announcing the u-turn, NHS Lothian deputy chief executive Jim Crombie said the health board had listened to the concerns of its staff.
He said: "We have discussed with staff the proposal to increase parking charges and we have listened to the concerns they have raised.
"We have fed this back to our private sector partners and have agreed that charges will remain at the current level for this financial year.
"We understand the impact that travel to and from work can have on staff but also the frustration patients and visitors experience when trying to park to attend an appointment or visit a patient.
"We will use the review to explore these issues in detail."
NHS Lothian does not own or operate the car park at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.
The charges for the car park are set by Consort Healthcare in line with the PFI agreement.
Hospital parking charges were abolished by the Scottish government in 2008.
Charges were removed from 14 hospitals but could not be scrapeed at three PFI car parks.
Parking charges remain at Edinburgh and Glasgow Royal Infirmaries and Ninewells in Dundee.
