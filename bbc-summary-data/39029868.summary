Science and Skills Secretary Julie James will announce the cash on a visit to Porthcawl in Bridgend county on Tuesday.
Porthcawl Maritime Centre will include water sports and exercise facilities, a coastal science centre and an outdoor theatre.
It is hoped work will begin in the summer and it will open by 2019.
The £2.1m for the development, which is being built on land owned by Bridgend council, has come from the European Regional Development Fund.
It is expected to cost in excess of £7m and has already secured lottery funding.
