Dozens of people have turned out to honour Claudio Ranieri after a peaceful march was organised by an 11-year-old Leicester City fan.

Jack Stephens said Ranieri had "done the impossible" by helping Leicester win the Premier League and was the team's "greatest ever manager".
He invited fellow fans to show their gratitude ahead of Leicester's home game against Liverpool.
It is Leicester's first game since Ranieri was sacked.
Jack, from Leicester, said: "I wasn't very pleased because I personally thought it was the wrong decision.
"As a chairman I think you need to show more loyalty to your manager."
Fans gathered at the Clock Tower at 18:00 GMT where they sang Leicester City and Claudio Ranieri songs alongside a gospel choir from De Montfort University.
They then marched through the city, finishing at the King Power Stadium at 19:45.
Jack's mother Lucy said there had been a lot of interest in the celebration - including from Italian news media - after Jack and his 18-year-old sister promoted it on Facebook.
"We've had messages from Spain and abroad and it's really got people going," she said.
"Obviously because Ranieri is such a classy man he's not said anything against anybody."
Ranieri said his "dream died" when he was sacked nine months after winning the Premier League.
Former Leicester City player Gary Lineker admitted the sacking made him "shed a tear" and said: "I think they should be building statues to him, not sacking him."
