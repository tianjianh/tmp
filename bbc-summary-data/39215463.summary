The team of Aileen Neilson, Rob McPherson, Gregor Ewan and Hugh Nibloe beat Germany 6-3 in their last round-robin match on Thursday.
It secured second place in the overall standings behind Russia, to whom they lost 8-7 earlier in the competition.
They will face Russia in Friday's play-offs with the winner going straight through to the gold-medal match.
The losers will have a second chance to reach the final against the winners of the play-off between third and fourth. The line-up for that match will be decided after Thursday's second series of round-robin matches.
The Scots, who accrue qualification points for Great Britain during the Paralympic cycle, have already qualified a team to represent Great Britain at the Winter Paralympics, which start in exactly a year's time.
They finished the round-robin phase with six wins from their nine games, losing to Canada and the USA, as well as Russia.
