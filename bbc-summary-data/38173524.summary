The opener, 24, was this week added to the Test squad for the current tour of India as a replacement for the injured Haseeb Hameed.
Jennings, captaining the Lions, made 101 not out as they chased 175 with 16 of their 50 overs to spare.
"That couldn't have gone much better," the left-hander said.
"To spend some time in the middle for me was great, even if they were one-day runs, which is obviously different to how things will be in India."
The Lions face the UAE again on Saturday before Jennings joins the Test squad in India for the remaining two Tests.
England trail 2-0 in the five-match series. The fourth Test in Mumbai starts on 8 December.
Jennings, who was born in Johannesburg and is the son of former South Africa coach Ray Jennings, captained South Africa Under-19s.
This year he completed a four-year qualification period to be eligible for England.
