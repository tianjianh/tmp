The 33-year-old, who has featured just four times for the Potters this season, had a loan stint with the Seagulls in 2002-03 when he was at Arsenal.
"Steve has played virtually his entire career in the Premier League," said Brighton boss Chris Hughton.
"He knows this club and will supplement our existing midfield options."
Sidwell, who had spells at Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa and Fulham before joining Stoke in the summer of 2014, becomes Brighton's fourth signing of the January transfer window.
"We need to make sure we have good options in every position," added Hughton.
"Steve is another experienced head. He is a player who's proven at the very top level of English football and is a top professional."
