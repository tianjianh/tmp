Kvitova, 26, and defending champion Belinda Bencic will compete at the pre-Wimbledon tournament.
Bencic, 19, defeated Agnieszka Radwanska in the 2015 final and is currently ranked 10th in the world.
"I think it's the best preparation for Wimbledon and I have some fun memories there," Kvitova said.
The tournament at Devonshire Park takes place the week before Wimbledon from 18-25 June.
