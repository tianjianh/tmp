[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some of the world's top cyclists will head to Southwold on 15 June for the third Women's Tour, with the 132km (82 miles) stage one ending in Norwich.
The tour, which was won by Germany's Lisa Brennauer in 2015, will take place over five days and end in Kettering.
It will also pass through Warwickshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire.
The first stage of the race will begin a few miles down the coast from Aldeburgh, where Lizzie Armitstead crashed while celebrating a stage victory last year.
Armistead, who was ruled out of the rest of the tour, says she is excited about this year's event.
"As a British rider it's a privilege to be able to compete on home roads," she said. "The British public have really taken to cycling and you can see that when the race goes through different towns the community really gets behind it."
