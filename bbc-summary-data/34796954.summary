[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Azeem Hafeez, the son of Sandwell Council's former deputy leader Mahboob Hussain, will not be charged, police have said.
Mr Hafeez said: "My arrest did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties.
"I'm considering taking legal action."
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: "The 30-year-old man who was arrested in connection with an investigation into irregularities regarding the sale of former Sandwell council properties between June 2012 and September 2014 has been released without charge and told no further action will be taken against him.
"He was arrested from an address in Oldbury on 1 April 2015. He was on police bail throughout the intervening period."
The investigation into the sale of the council's former properties continues, the West Midlands force said.
Labour-run Sandwell Council said it would co-operate with the police investigation when it began in October.
In October,  Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain stood down as chairman of the council's asset management and land disposal committee.
At the time, the council said Mr Hussain's resignation was a neutral act that did not imply any wrongdoing.
In a personal statement, issued last year, Mr Hussain said: "I fully expect the audit service's investigation to clearly show I have followed all the proper rules and procedures."
He has also since resigned from the authority's ruling cabinet, along with former economy chief councillor, Ian Jones.
