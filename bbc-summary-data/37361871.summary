Rosco, a nine-month-old Border Terrier, was taken from outside 82-year-old owner Leonard Ormond's Napier Drive home.
Almost two million people visited a Facebook page appealing for the pet's safe return.
Mr Ormond's son Gordon said his father was "ecstatic" at the news.
He said: "I'm going to pick him up tomorrow, but we don't want to give out his location because we don't want someone else getting him.
"But it's confirmed. We got his microchip checked and it is Rosco.
"Obviously, it's been a pretty traumatic month."
Police issued an appeal to trace two men in a grey Ford Transit van after Rosco was taken from the pensioner's garden on 15 August.
Mr Ormond said the response on social media to help find Rosco had been "incredible".
He said: "It's amazing really, two million people reached.
"We always hoped we would get him back.
"Social media has been an active power for good in this case."
