On Friday the St George Illawarra second row was named in an initial 58-strong Tonga squad for their forthcoming Asia-Pacific World Cup qualifier against the Cook Islands.
Frizell played three Tests for Wales in the 2013 World Cup.
Wales team manager Bob Wilson said: "We met with Tyson earlier this year... and he gave a clear commitment to Wales."
Wilson added: "On seeing the announcement by Tonga we have been in contact with Tyson to check if this was correct and we are delighted to say that the player remains a Welsh international.
"He is a huge talent and his assurances that he is committed to Wales' push towards the 2017 Rugby League World Cup is a great boost to us all."
Wales say they have been aware for some time that Frizell is unavailable for this year's European Championship.
Wollongong-born Frizell made his debut for Wales against Ireland in 2011 and made two further appearances in the Four Nations tournament the same year.
