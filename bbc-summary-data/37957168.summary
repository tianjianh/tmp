The trio of Jack Carlin, Ryan Owens and Joe Truman repeated last weekend's win in Glasgow, again beating France into second place in Apeldoorn.
Emily Kay, who won the new-look omnium last week, finished second behind Kirsten Wild in the four-race event.
Chris Latham was second in the scratch race; Rachel James and Katy Marchant were fifth in the women's team sprint.
Britain did not qualify for the medal rides in the men's team pursuit, with senior academy riders Matt Wall, Ethan Hayter, Matt Bostock and Joe Holt recording the fifth fastest time.
Racing continues on Saturday with the men's sprint, women's keirin, women's 500m time trial and men's points race.
