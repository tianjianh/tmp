The 27-year-old was given an extended break by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger after helping his country retain the Copa America in June.
"I hope I got it right, that he had a good rest and regenerated a little bit. We will see on Sunday," Wenger said.
However, new City signing Leroy Sane will not feature in the game.
German international midfielder Sane, 19, joined City for Â£37m from Schalke on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Wenger believes City have appointed Guardiola to improve their record against other big teams.
City finished fourth last season but won just one of 10 matches against other teams who finished in the top six.
"If they took Guardiola, it is certainly because they are conscious of that problem," Wenger said.
Guardiola has won the Champions League twice as a manager and also claimed three Bundesliga titles in three season with Bayern Munich.
City start their Premier League campaign at home to Sunderland next Saturday, while Arsenal open their season with a home game against Liverpool next Sunday.
