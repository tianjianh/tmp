A cliff path linking Dorset's Highcliffe Castle with the beach below is in imminent danger of collapse, engineers have warned.

The "zig-zag" at Highcliffe, near Christchurch, was initially closed in March amid fears about its stability.
A survey has since found failure of the timber support is "potentially imminent" and it needs rebuilding.
So far, Â£530,000 has been earmarked for the project but it is not yet known how much it will cost.
Christchurch Borough Council said it hoped to re-open the path in time for Easter 2018.
