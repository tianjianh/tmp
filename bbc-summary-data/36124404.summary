Kyren Wilson outplayed Northern Ireland's Mark Allen to take a 7-1 lead in their second-round match at the World Championship in Sheffield.

Kettering's Wilson, 24, punished a series of poor Allen safety shots as breaks of 50, 55, 93 and 103 helped him win the first seven frames.
World number seven Allen took the final frame of the session but is now in big trouble in the best-of-25 match.
The players resume the match at 19:00 BST at the Crucible.
However, Allen, who looked in good form after winning the Players Championship last month, has a major task on his hands to get back into the game.
Wilson, who won the Shanghai Masters earlier this season, edged a tight first frame after an errant Allen safety shot on the final pink.
A 50 break helped Wilson - first-round conqueror of Joe Perry - take the second frame before a shot-to-nothing double on the second last red saw him forge a 3-0 advantage.
While trailing 55-5 in the next, Allen had a chance to hit back but missed a difficult red along the cushion as Wilson clinched the frame with a run of 55.
In the first frame after the mid-session interval, Allen got in first but missed a black off its spot on 25 and Wilson inflicted more punishment on the Antrim man by wrapping up the frame with a 93 break.
A run of 49 helped extend Wilson's lead to 6-0 and Wilson fired in his only century of the session in the next as his 103 break was started with another double.
Allen avoided a session whitewash helped by a break of 48 as he hit six reds and six blacks before breaking down as he chased a possible maximum.
