Between 2013 and 2014, Paul Kelly directed donation money meant for flood victims to his partner's dance company, Leeds Crown Court heard.
The 55-year-old from Southwark, London, admitted seven charges of fraud at a previous hearing.
He was dismissed by Asda in September 2014 after an internal investigation.
The supermarket retailer said they were "incredibly disappointed" and expected the "highest standards of integrity from its colleagues".
An Asda spokesperson said: "We are pleased that our internal controls worked and respect the decision made by the court today.
"In 2015 we made an additional donation by way of a gift to the Asda Foundation so that none of the good causes it supports were financially disadvantaged as a result of this matter."
Det Insp Paul Hobson, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "We welcome the custodial sentence that Kelly has been given.
"He abused his position of trust to defraud a charity fund out of a large amount of money. We will now be seeking to recoup the stolen money."
