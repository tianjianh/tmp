Archaeologists uncover clues to life of Iron Age man

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Archaeologists have been able to provide insights into the life of a man whose remains were found at an Iron Age site on Orkney.

A human jaw with two teeth was discovered centrally placed in a large, carved whalebone vertebra within the ruins of a broch earlier this year.
Analysis, including radiocarbon dates, of the find on South Ronaldsay show the man died when he was 50 or older.
His diet also appears to have been unusually rich in fish.
Archaeologists said the isotopic values of his bone chemistry showed that he had consumed "a surprisingly high quantity of marine-derived protein",  probably largely fish.
They said most isotopic studies of human remains from the Middle Iron Age, "the time of the brochs", tend to show very low levels of fish proteins in the human diet, even in coastal areas.
Brochs, also known as Atlantic roundhouses, were fortified homes built in the Scottish islands and Highlands.
The University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute has been leading digs and studies of a broch at The Cairns, South Ronaldsay.
The analysis of the jaw bone and teeth, including the Orkney Archaeology Society-funded new radiocarbon dates, show that:
Archaeologists suggest the remains may be of an important man given the ritualistic style of his burial among animal remains in the broch.
Martin Carruthers, site director and The Cairns and Masters Programme Leader at the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, said: "It may not be pushing this line of consideration too far to suggest the possibility that it was his death that occasioned the final abandonment and decommissioning of the broch.
"There are plenty of examples from different cultures around the world, where the death of an important person, who had a significant association with a particular house, resulted in the end of that entire house as well."
Further analysis of the human remains are planned.
