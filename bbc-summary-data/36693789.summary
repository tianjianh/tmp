The Japanese player, 26, secured a 7-5 6-3 7-5 victory over the 2009 boys' singles champion.

Nick Kyrgios and Feliciano Lopez were tied 6-3 6-7 (2-7) when play was suspended for bad light. The winner faces Andy Murray in round four.
Organisers confirm play on middle Sunday
Cilic might need to be at his best if he is to repeat his 2014 US Open final victory over Nishikori, after the Japanese player took a fraction less than two hours to overcome his Russian opponent on court three.
Nishikori was on top from the off and took a two-set lead before a lengthy rain interruption.
Kuznetsov improved after the restart and broke Nishikori's service to go 3-0 up but lost his own after a second shorter rain break. The Russian was broken again in the 11th game before his Florida-based opponent held serve for victory.
"At certain moments, I was playing aggressively," said Nishikori. "He can be a really tough player, especially here.

"It was a tough third set. But I tried to be a little bit more aggressive, took a little bit of time with changing with the slice. The serve, too, I changed a little bit. It started working better."

Hewitt made a U-turn in March on his decision to retire from tennis after January's Australian Open.
