[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Kirkwood, 27, from Glasgow, pretended to be "Sheryl Davies" when he asked a 16-year-old girl if she was interested in becoming a prostitute.
As part of a "run through", he persuaded her to perform a sex act on a fictitious friend called "David" - who turned out to be Kirkwood.
He was caught after he contacted two other girls - one of whom was aged 14.
Kirkwood, from Glasgow's Drumchapel area, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Sexual Offences Act and another of being involved in a fraudulent scheme.
Jailing him at Glasgow Sheriff Court, Sheriff Martin Jones QC said that "whole sorry episode" would not have happened if Kirkwood had not met up with the girl.
He told Kirkwood: "Due to the gravity of these offences, a custodial sentence is the only appropriate one in this case."
The sheriff also ordered Kirkwood be supervised for another two years on his release and placed him on the sex offenders list indefinitely.
The court heard that Kirkwood had got in touch with the 16 year-old in August last year after setting up a Facebook page in the name of "Sheryl Davies".
"Sheryl" claimed to be involved with an escort agency and asked the teenager if she was interested.
Kirkwood then repeatedly sent a number of messages requesting that the girl send naked photos of herself in different poses.
He claimed the pictures would be used as a profile for the escort agency.
The court heard the unsuspecting teenager "genuinely believed" that she was in contact with a female involved in this line of work.
"Sheryl" continued and suggested the girl meet her friend "David" to help her get a job.
The youngster agreed to meet "David" at a car park in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire where the sex act took place.
Police later became involved following reports Kirkwood contacted two others girls while posing as "Sheryl".
He had been in touch with another 16 year-old about being an escort, but the teenager said that was "horrible".
Kirkwood messaged a 14-year-old girl and she also refused to get involved.
