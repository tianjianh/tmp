Scrum-half Sarel Pretorius raced 80 metres for the opening try after Dorian Jones had kicked two penalties.
Jones added two more shots before his solo, shorter-range dash to the line after the break at Rodney Parade.
The two teams meet again in Pau next Saturday, but Dragons have a worry over wing Tom Prydie who was helped off in the second half.
