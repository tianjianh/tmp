The 19-year-old, who has yet to make his debut for the Seagulls, scored 15 goals while on loan at Dagenham & Redbridge last season.
"He has an unbelievable left foot," Imps manager Boss Danny Cowley told the club website.
"He'll help us improve as we lacked a bit of left-sided balance last season."
