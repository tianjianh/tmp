Worcestershire are still waiting to find out when Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal will arrive at New Road.

The 37-year-old re-signed for the county in February after his bowling action was cleared following a ban, but he is not expected at Worcester until after Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh.
The tour, in April and May, is still to be officially finalised.
"We're waiting to hear from Pakistan whether the trip will go ahead," said director of cricket Steve Rhodes.
"He'll be here to play for us at some stage, sooner rather than later. When it will be we just don't know," he told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
Ajmal, who has taken 178 wickets at an average of 28.10 in 35 Tests, spent the winter remodelling his action after he was banned from bowling in September.
"His action is a bit more orthodox now he's had to make a few changes but he's a very determined character," added Rhodes.
"He's bowled thousands and thousands of balls to get his action cleared again and we're looking for him to make an impact in country cricket again."
Pakistan's tour, which is scheduled to begin on 15 April and involves two Tests, two ODIs and a T20, has been approved by the Pakistan government, subject to security clearance.
Newly promoted Worcestershire begin their County Championship season on 12 April at home to defending champions Yorkshire.
England all-rounder Moeen Ali could figure in the season opener, having practised this week following an abdominal strain suffered during the World Cup.
Moeen was left out of England's squad to tour the West Indies, but he may play against Yorkshire before possibly joining the Test squad in the Caribbean.
