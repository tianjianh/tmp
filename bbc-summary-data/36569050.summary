Ireland well beaten by Sri Lanka in second ODI at Malahide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A century from Kusal Perera helped Sri Lanka complete a 2-0 series win with a 136-run victory over Ireland in their one-day international at Malahide.

Perera scored 135 as the tourists made good use of a run-friendly wicket with an imposing 377-8 from their 50 overs.
Andy McBrine top-scored for Ireland at number eight with 79 off 64 balls, including seven fours and two sixes.
Sri Lanka's total never looked in any real danger and Suranga Lakmal helped see off the tail, with figures of 4-38.
After Perera and Danuska Gunathilaka, who made 63 off 78 deliveries before being run out, had put on 147 for the opening wicket, Seekkuge Prasanna contributed 95 off 46 balls, his best one-day total, to help put Sri Lanka in control.
By the time Perera was eventually out, caught by Paul Stirling off Tim Murtagh in the 42nd over, Sri Lanka had pushed on to 309 to leave Ireland facing a testing run chase.
The total was the highest accumulated in a one-day international in Ireland and the visitors scored 212 of their runs in boundaries, 32 fours and 14 sixes.
Murtagh was the most successful of the Irish bowlers, with three wickets for 66 runs from his 10 overs.
In reply, Ireland's top order, though, failed to make an early progress, as opener William Porterfield went for eight and number three Ed Joyce for nine.
John Anderson scored 34 and Stuart Poynter 36, before McBrine put up some late resistance with his maiden ODI half-century.
After their heaviest home defeat in a one-day international, Ireland will look to bounce back when they play Afghanistan next month in a five-match ODI series, the first game at Stormont taking place on Sunday, 10 July.
