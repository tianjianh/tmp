The Labour leader of Cardiff council says he remains committed to the city after surviving a confidence vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Opposition parties on Cardiff council tabled the motion against Phil Bale after he was forced to make last minute changes to pass his budget.
He said he believed in "Cardiff, its people, its businesses and its future", and was "proud" of his achievements.
Potential Labour rebels were told they could face party disciplinary measures if they voted against Mr Bale.
Conservative councillor Craig Williams, who put forward the motion, said the city had been damaged by a divided ruling Labour group.
Liberal Democrat Judith Woodman said the budget process had been a fiasco that left Cardiff's reputation "in tatters".
Speaking after the vote, Mr Bale insisted the Labour group was "united" in fighting for a better settlement for local government.
He also told BBC Wales that he had never considered his position, despite personal attacks, including criticism of his appearance.
During the no confidence debate, he told councillors he made no apology for being "more likely to wear Primark than Prada".
"I believe in Cardiff, its people, its businesses and its future," he said.
