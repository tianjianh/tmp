The show, based on the novels by Winston Graham and starring Aidan Turner, will see its second series aired on BBC One this autumn.
Set in the 18th Century, the drama follows the life and loves of dashing Cornish mine owner Ross Poldark.
The third series, based on the fifth and sixth books of Graham's collection, will begin filming later this year.
The show has made a heart-throb of Turner, who previously starred in BBC Two series Being Human and in The Hobbit trilogy on the big screen.
The first series of Poldark was a hit for the BBC when it was broadcast on Sunday nights last year.
Its ratings peaked at 9.4 million viewers across TV and iPlayer, and its accolades included the audience award at the TV Baftas.
The series finale in April drew in 5.9 million TV viewers and was praised by critics, including the Telegraph's Allison Pearson who called it "devastatingly good".
The show's production company Mammoth Screen said the series was a "passion project" for all those involved.
"It's with real excitement that we prepare for both the launch of series two and our return to Cornwall to shoot series three," managing director Damien Turner said.
"Winston Graham and [scriptwriter] Debbie Horsfield's extraordinary flair for storytelling means the saga of Ross, his friends and enemies will go to even more thrilling places."
The 10-episode second series will be set in 1794 and see Ross and his wife Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, return in a story set against the backdrop of the French Revolution.
New characters will also be introduced into the saga, including Midsomer Murders star John Nettles as Ray Penvenen, one the country's richest landowners, and Endless Love actress Gabriella Wilde, playing his niece Caroline Penvenen.
