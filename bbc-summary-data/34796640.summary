Huge Fraisthorpe turbine blades slowing traffic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers have been warned 27 huge wind turbine blades are being moved from Immingham to Bridlington over the next two-and-a-half weeks, slowing traffic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Humberside Police are escorting the 197 ft (60m) blades from Immingham Dock to a wind farm near Fraisthorpe.
While testing the 100-mile route, a roundabout needed to be widened and some traffic lights had to be removed to allow the loads to turn corners.
The company transporting the blades said it was its biggest ever UK load.
Two pieces are being moved each day from Monday to Saturday, starting at the docks at 09:30 and reaching their destination at about 15:00.
The route takes the heavy loads along the M180 to the M18 and M62 before taking smaller roads. Due to their size, the route has to avoid the Humber Bridge.
