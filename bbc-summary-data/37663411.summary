The Wednesday striker was in the right place to collect David Jones' volley and guide a shot past Alex Smithies just before half-time.
Conor Washington headed into the net for Rangers, but the effort was ruled out for a push, and Daniel Pudil's shot hit the post for the Owls.
Tom Lees then cleared Tjaronn Chery's shot off the line as the hosts held on.
Wednesday, who have won five of their seven league matches at home this season, almost went further ahead through Hooper and Adam Reach on the break, while Fernando Forestieri shot just wide.
The defeat ended QPR's five-match unbeaten run and dropped them to 13th.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal:
"My players have been unbelievable this week, against very difficult teams. I'm very happy about what my players did; it was special today.
"The Championship is unique. The number of games, the crowds and the intensity - it is unique. And this is a situation we need to be able to play in.
"So far all the teams have lost games and this can happen. There is not a big value difference between any of the teams.
"We are resilient and reacting well all of the time. We are in a good way in the league."
QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"I think we deserved at least a point from the game but that's football.
"When anyone comes to Hillsborough they know they will be under pressure. They are a very good side, whoever comes here knows that.
"We had the pressure on us today but they didn't work our keeper too much, he did not have many saves to make throughout the game.
"But nor did we create much ourselves. My players played well but didn't create as many chances as we could have."
