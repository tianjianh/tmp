The animal artwork will appear at the junction of Pear Tree Road, Lower Dale Road and Normanton Road, in Normanton, Derby, in April.
Charity Sustrans said the design would help make the area more appealing for people and help slow down cars.
The charity has been working with different communities in England to help redesign busy streets.
Dan Robertson, from Sustrans, said: "Through simple changes like this we can really change the feel of a space into a place people want to be in.
"This is one of several such initiatives that are happening here in Normanton at the moment."
The initiative came from design workshops held over 18 months.
The tiger design was created as a way to increase awareness of pedestrian needs in the area by highlighting where people want to walk.
The tiger will be painted on to roads and pavements on 12 April.
