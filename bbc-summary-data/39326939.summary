Crusaders midfielder Richard Clarke has emphasised how manager Stephen Baxter is the driving force behind the club's bid for a third league title in a row.

The Crues are four points ahead of Linfield at the top of the table but could extend that to seven if they beat Ballinamallard United on Monday night.
"The pressure from Stephen has been relentless," explained Clarke.
"He has high expectations, never lets you rest on your laurels and always keeps you on your toes."
"That has filtered through the dressing room and we want to win every game.
"We haven't lost too many over the last few years and that shows our resilience and is testament to the squad we have built here," added the former Glentoran player, whose side have lost just two top-flight fixtures during this campaign.
For his part, the Crues boss is sticking to the adage of taking 'one game at at time' as the north Belfast club chase a hat-trick of Premiership crowns.
"The points tally will look after itself. We just have to chalk the games off, concentrate on the next game in front of us and we'll see where it takes us. We won't be getting too carried away.
"Winning football matches is a pressure business in any league in the world but when you're at the top of the table it's a nice pressure to have.
"It's true that the pressure cranks up a little bit at this time of the year but we'll just continue to work hard at what we do."
The champions are set to be without club skipper and central defender Colin Coates for four to six months as he undergoes surgery on an ankle injury.
Ballinamallard lie 10th in the table, eight points ahead of Carrick Rangers, who occupy the relegation/promotion play-off spot.
"We have a lot of injuries but we'll prepare right, compete and do our best," said Mallards manager Gavin Dykes ahead of the Seaview clash.
"We are delighted to be going to play at a club like Crusaders and it gives our players a chance to showcase themselves."
