[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 0-0 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln City missed a chance to extend their lead at the top of the National League after they were held to a goalless draw at Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A clash of heads between Aldershot's Will Evans and Lincoln's Matt Rhead early on led to a lengthy stoppage before the game stuttered into life.
Aldershot, looking to extend a 10-game unbeaten run, survived early scares when Terry Hawkridge and Luke Waterfall both went close in quick succession.
Bernard Mensah forced a fine save out of Paul Farman at the other end just before the break, but Lincoln - who are three points clear and have a game in hand over their rivals at the top - came closest to breaking the deadlock when Waterfall headed onto a post on the hour mark.
