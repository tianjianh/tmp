Major defends claims of Pakistan 'school coup'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 97-year-old Briton has defended his role after what has been called a coup at a school named in his honour in Pakistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geoffrey Langlands stood down as head of the public school in the north-west Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province two years ago.
But now his replacement's future is in doubt after Maj Langlands was lobbied by teachers who were recently sacked.
He told the BBC the dispute had been "forced" upon him.
Maj Langlands is a former British army soldier who has worked in the education field in Pakistan since independence in 1947.
He helped set up what became Langlands Public School and College, the first government-owned owned English medium public school in Chitral, in 1988.
Two years ago, at the age of 95, he retired, nominating Carey Schofield, a British author and educational expert, as his successor.
In February, Ms Schofield sacked eight teachers at the school in the Chitral district, citing disciplinary and performance issues.
While Ms Schofield was out of the country renewing her visa, the sacked teachers lobbied Maj Langlands and succeeded in blocking the renewal of Ms Schofield's work permit.
During her absence, in mid-June, Maj Langlands turned up in Chitral again, took over the school, and issued an order dismissing Ms Schofield and reinstating the sacked teachers.
The UK's Times newspaper called the move "a very British coup".
But Sirajul Mulk, who previously served on the school's board, told the BBC that the sacked teachers were "taking advantage of Mr Langlands' old age".
He said they "went to Lahore, complained to Mr Langlands, and got him to sign a letter requesting the interior ministry to not renew Ms Schofield's visa."
Mr Mulk said the teachers then made Maj Langlands sign an order reinstating them and re-appointing himself as principal.
Authorities in Chitral abided by these orders under instructions from the provincial government, Mr Mulk said.
Both the Interior Minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, and the regional chief minister, Pervez Khatak, were Maj Langlands' students at Lahore's Aitchison College.
Maj Langlands spoke to the BBC by telephone from Lahore, where he lives. He said the letter to the Interior Ministry was "forced upon me".
"I did not write the letter, I only signed it," he said. He did not want to say who forced it on him.
Asked if it was correct to say that he was being used by some people, he said: "To some extent I am, that's why there are some people very much on my side, and others definitely against me."
He said he understood that Ms Schofield "was running the school by herself, without discussing anything with anybody, and spending money".
Maj Langlands said her return would aggravate the matter.
"There is so much going on, that all I want is to get some good clear-up," he said.
He said that he did not want to continue as principal, and that a replacement had already been put in place who should become the "first Chitrali principal of the school".
Correction 29 June 2015: This article has been amended to reflect the fact that Carey Schofield retains the support of the school governors but for visa reasons is currently unable to return to Pakistan to resume her duties.
