Gavin Dykes lands job as Ballinamallard United manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish Premiership club Ballinamallard United have named former Derry City boss Gavin Dykes as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 48-year-old replaces Whitey Anderson who quit the Ferney Park hot seat after 10 years in charge.
Dykes managed Derry in 2003-04 and later went to Sligo Rovers as head of youth development.
As a defender, he played for Derry, Finn Harps and Sligo in the League of Ireland, and also Newry City in the Irish League.
He was most recently assistant manager at Finn Harps, based in Ballybofey, County Donegal.
Ballinamallard are currently waiting to hear when the second leg of their promotion/relegation play-off against Institute will take place.
Before Anderson quit, the Mallards won the first leg away 2-1.
The end of the Premiership campaign has been dogged by a complicated dispute over whether Carrick Rangers should have been docked points over former boss Gary Haveron's failure to properly serve a touchline ban.
A points deduction would have seen Carrick automatically relegated and Ballinamallard would have been safe.
