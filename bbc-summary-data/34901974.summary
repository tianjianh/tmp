Cheshire East Council waived rules three times for physio firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council waived its own financial rules three times when awarding contracts to a firm run by the local authority leader's physiotherapist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Other companies were not able to bid for the contracts - collectively worth £156,000 to Core Fit Ltd - which were offered by Cheshire East Council.
Details of the deals came following a BBC Freedom of Information request.
Councillors have called for an external inquiry while the council said no "unlawful expenditure" had been made.
Conservative Michael Jones, leader of Cheshire East Council, has always insisted he has made no money from the contracts awarded to his personal physiotherapist Amanda Morris's company.
Her firm, which runs fitness classes in schools, has not commented.
Senior Labour councillor Laura Jeuda said the council had "refused to provide any meaningful explanation" as to why the normal rules were waived for the contracts.
But the authority's chief executive Mike Suarez said there had been no "unlawful expenditure or any breach of EU procurement rules".
The firm's three contracts were all awarded between June 2014 and March 2015 without any competitive tender exercise. Forms were signed to waive the rules.
At least three companies must be invited to compete for any contract worth more than £10,000, according to Cheshire East Council's rules.
The constitution states the rules can be waived in "very limited exceptions" which are "essential to the efficient running" of the authority.

In October Mr Jones told fellow councillors he had no involvement in the council's procurement process but said: "I did introduce my physio to the council."
He told the meeting he did declare his link to Core Fit Ltd, adding: "I had no vested interest and I make no money from that."
Answering councillors who have called for an independent external investigation, chief executive Mike Suarez said: "I see no reason for [one] and have discussed that view with the external auditors, who are independent of the council and satisfied that the approach the council has taken does not require their formal involvement."
