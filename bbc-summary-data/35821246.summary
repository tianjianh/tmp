Former Fifa officials Chuck Blazer, Jack Warner and Jeffrey Webb are among those being sued by world football's governing body, which has submitted documents to US authorities.
Fifa has been in turmoil since allegations of corruption in May 2015.
In total, 41 individuals and entities have been charged by US authorities.
A US investigation exposed widespread corruption at the top of world football and Fifa esitmates millions of dollars were diverted from the sport illegally through bribery, kickbacks and corrupt schemes carried out by the defendants.
In a statement, Fifa described itself as a "victimised institution", with new president Gianni Infantino saying those convicted "abused positions of trust".
He added: "They caused serious and lasting damage to Fifa, its member associations and the football community.
"The monies they pocketed belonged to global football and were meant for the development and promotion of the game.
"Fifa as the world governing body of football wants that money back and we are determined to get it no matter how long it takes."
Infantino, 45, was elected as Fifa chief last month following the suspension of predecessor Sepp Blatter, who had been in charge of the governing body since 1998.
He said that once the money had been recovered, it would be directed back to its original purpose to benefit and develop international football.
Ifantino added: "These dollars were meant to build football fields, not mansions and pools; to buy football kits, not jewellery and cars; and to fund youth player and coach development, not to underwrite lavish lifestyles for football and sports marketing executives. "
