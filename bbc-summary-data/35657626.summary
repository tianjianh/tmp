[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mazher Mahmood, 52, of Purley, south London, pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice at a hearing at the Old Bailey.
His co-accused, Alan Smith, 66, a retired driver from Dereham, Norfolk, also pleaded not guilty to the charge.
They will face a two week trial starting on 19 September.
The pair have been accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of public justice between 22 June and 22 July 2014.
The charge states that Mr Smith changed a draft statement he gave to police in the case of the former X Factor judge.
The former News Of The World reporter, who often posed as a sheikh during his investigations, claims to have helped put more than 100 criminals behind bars during his 25-year career.
The two men are currently on unconditional bail.
