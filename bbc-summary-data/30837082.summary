How the 2015 Oscars selfie might look

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are 20 stars competing for the four main acting awards at this year's Oscars. This got Newsbeat thinking about the most retweeted image ever... and how it might look this time around.

The famous picture, by Ellen DeGeneres, has now been retweeted 3,367,000 times.
So here's a closer look at some of the nominees who could be in the frame, subject to the length of Neil Patrick Harris' arms.
Patrick Harris, this year's host, is best known for playing Barney in How I Met Your Mother. He's not new to hosting. He's fronted the Emmy Awards twice and the Tony Awards four times.
Julianne Moore is nominated for best actress for her performance in Still Alice. She's been nominated for an Oscar four times before, but has never won.
Keira Knightley is nominated for best actress in a supporting role. She played Joan Clarke, a wartime codebreaker in the Alan Turing biopic The Imitation Game.
Patricia Arquette is nominated for best actress in a supporting role for Boyhood. The film was shot over 12 years and was also nominated for best picture.
No surprise here. Benedict Cumberbatch is nominated for his role as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game.
One film, two nominations. Felicity Jones is nominated for best actress and Eddie Redmayne is nominated for best actor, both for The Theory of Everything. There's been a huge amount of Oscars excitement around Redmayne's performance, but he's staying cosmic about the hype: "If you listen to all the buzz that's where madness lies."
Batman to Birdman. Michael Keaton is nominated for best actor for his performance as Riggan, an actor who is best known for playing a superhero.
A supporting actress nomination for Emma Stone. She plays Sam in Birdman, the daughter of Michael Keaton's character.
Reece Witherspoon has certainly earned this best actress nomination for Wild. The film is about her character Cheryl who goes on a thousand-mile hike to "reclaim control of her life".
This is Meryl Streep's 19th Oscar nomination. She's nominated for best supporting actress for her role as the Witch in Into the Woods. She knows the drill.
