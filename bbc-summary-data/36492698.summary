Finn Russell: Glasgow fly-half to make full recovery, says Townsend

Gregor Townsend says Finn Russell is expected to make a full recovery from the "very bad" head injury sustained in Glasgow Warriors' Pro12 semi-final defeat by Connacht in May.

The Warriors head coach told BBC Scotland that the fly-half, 23, should be back training later this month.
"He sees a lot of specialists every week and they've been really pleased by how he's progressing," said Townsend.
"He was in yesterday and he's taking things step-by-step."
However, Townsend cannot at this stage of the rehabilitation put a date on the Scotland cap's return to action.
"We don't expect Finn to be back in training for another few weeks," Townsend said.
"He's in great spirits, we expect him to make a full recovery and we'll see him back playing sometime next season."
There had been concerns over whether Russell would be able to return to competitive rugby, such was the severity of the injury.
He was carried off on a stretcher early in last month's defeat by eventual tournament winners Connacht.
And Russell, capped 19 times by Scotland, will miss the national team's summer tour to Japan.
"We've got doctors who've been involved in sport for a number of years who haven't seen such a clash of heads," Townsend said.
"But it's testament to the work of our staff, those of Connacht and the medical staff in Ireland who helped us out for the first few days, that he has made a full recovery.
"I'm sure he'll be itching to play again very soon."
