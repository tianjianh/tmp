"I didn't want them to see me being bullied and not stand up for myself," she tells Radio 1 Stories.
"It wasn't just for me. It was for people who listen to my music and feel how I was feeling at that time."
In September she received online abuse after she was pictured holding hands with Robert Pattinson.
The 27-year-old says: "I didn't want them to see me being bullied and not stand up for myself because ultimately I'm ten times stronger than somebody hiding behind a weird name on Twitter.
"I wanted to show that I can stand up for myself so then hopefully another person will see that and want to stand up for themselves."
She says she tries not to let online comments affect what she does creatively but admits tabloid stories can be difficult for her.
"It doesn't affect me at all or what I create. Sometimes it's just frustrating because those sorts of tabloids are just looking for a headline," she says.
"That headline is often so far from the truth."
She admits to reading what people are saying about her.
"I remember at the height when things were really bad for me. I remember lying in bed at 3 o'clock in the morning and it's embarrassing but I was just reading through everything, reading every single comment.
"I just couldn't believe the world was like that. I guess I'm quite naive for someone who's come through the internet, I don't engage with it that much. I just couldn't believe people think like that or say things like that.
"It was morbidly fascinating."
The World of FKA twigs is on Radio 1 on Tuesday at 21:00 GMT.
