[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir David Murray's Glasgow-based call centre company Response has lost a major contract with Sky.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Response said its contract would end on 15 April after the satellite broadcaster reduced its number of outsourced suppliers from nine to two.
About 950 Response staff, who work on the Sky account, will transfer to new supplier, Herotsc.
The Falkirk-based firm plans to run the Sky account from a new call centre in Glasgow's Atlantic Quay.
Brian Bannatyne, managing director of Response, said: "Our people employed on the Sky account have delivered a great service to Sky's customers.
We are confident they will continue to do so. We thank them for excellent contribution over the years.
"Response will continue to focus on the transformation of its business and the delivery of its vision. We remain hugely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead."
Chris Stylianou, managing director of Sky's customer service group, said: "We have particularly valued the contribution of many of the committed and talented customer service advisors who Response have helped train and nurture.
"We are therefore delighted that some of those great people will continue to support Sky's customers as they move over to work with Hero."
A spokesman for Hero said: "Following the decision by Sky to move their sales and service support work to Hero, Response will begin a consultation process for those staff who worked on the Sky account.
"HEROtsc will be involved, to ensure a smooth transfer of affected employees.
"We fully understand this can be a confusing time for those people affected and Response and HEROtsc are working together to make the transfer process as simple and straightforward as possible."
