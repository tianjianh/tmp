Junior Lewis, Tom Hitchcock, Jai Reason, Kenny Davis, Jason Goodliffe, Ben Goodliffe, Ben Nunn, Femi Ilesanmi and Matt Paine will all depart.
Ferrier declined the offer of a new deal and will be allowed to leave if the "right offer" comes in.
The 22-year-old England C international was Wood's top goalscorer in 2016-17 with 12 goals in 32 appearances.
"For any clubs interested or reading this, we have recently turned down offers in excess of Â£50,000 for Morgan and we do expect movement on this over the summer," said the club website.
