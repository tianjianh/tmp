The 23-year-old was discovered at 22:51 BST on Thursday after reports of a disturbance, Northumbria Police said.
A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and a section of Ladykirk Road, Benwell, has been cordoned off.
Northumbria Police have referred themselves to the police watchdog, the IPCC, because of recent police contact with the woman and the man.
The force said the matter had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission "as a matter of course".
Extra officers are in the area to reassure residents. Anyone with information has been asked to contact detectives.
