Gemma Collins in Twitter mix up with Paralympian Collis

If you've been on Twitter in the last 48 hours, you'll have seen Gemma Collins trending in the UK.

The TOWIE star caught the attention of the online community after taking an al fresco shower in Sunday's episode of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.
Trolls made fun of her size with memes, cruel comments and GIFS - while others defended the 33-year-old.
But the tweets, pleasant or not, weren't all being sent to the right Gemma.
Gemma Collis, a wheelchair fencer who competed in the 2012 London Paralympics and was a torchbearer for those games and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, was quick to point out that she was getting some of the tweets aimed at the reality star.
"Please stop tweeting me abuse," she wrote during the first evening of the show.
She later added: "Nobody should be subject to abuse. Bullying directed at anyone is wrong. Upsetting to find many are willing to tweet such horrible things."
But the athlete isn't the first to be the victim of mistaken identity on the social media site.
John describes himself as: "Computer science educator, father of four, social liberal, atheist and not a retail store".
The final bit of detail has been included because of how frequently he is mistaken for the shop.
Recently, he's getting a fair bit of stick about penguins.
In May 2013, the Twitter user with the handle @EdwardSnowden rowed from London to Paris. He says it was "awesome".
A month later, he found himself telling people he wasn't the source of one of the worst information leaks in US history.
Ashley Kerekes' bio reads: "I'm not a freaking cricket match!"
But with the handle @theashes, you can't blame people for sending her their views on how England or Australia are getting on.
Manchester United fans lovingly refer to Dutch striker Robin Van Persie as RVP.
So understandably, when he scored a hat-trick for the club back in April 2013 they wanted to congratulate him online.
Only thing is, the handle @RVP that lots of fans were using belongs to Ravi Prasad, an IT consultant from India.
At the time he told the BBC: "I'm a fan of Robin van Persie, so I understand people wanting to congratulate him... but it's a real nuisance for me."
