[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-2 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A debut goal from new signing Ryan Taylor helped Port Vale overcome a two-goal half-time deficit to draw with Oxford at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Newcastle man scored from the penalty spot after Rigino Cicilia had halved the deficit following strikes from U's pair Chey Dunkley and Daniel Crowley.
Defender Dunkley gave the visitors the lead after 11 minutes, rising highest to meet Chris Maguire's free-kick from the left and guide a header past the stationary Jak Alnwick.
Oxford doubled their advantage just eight minutes later when Maguire slipped in Marvin Johnson to cut-back to Crowley who tapped home into an empty net.
The Valiants started the second half much brighter and got their reward after 54 minutes when Cicilia fired home his first Vale goal after Nathan Smith nodded down Taylor's free-kick.
Taylor, who signed for the club just 24 hours before the match, sealed the comeback five minutes later, slotting home past Simon Eastwood after Cicilia was pulled down in the box.
