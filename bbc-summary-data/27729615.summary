World Cup 2014: Lawro's predictions - second group games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is predicting the outcome of every game at the 2014 Fifa World Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The second round of group games include must-win matches for England, against Uruguay, and Spain, who face Chile, after both teams suffered defeats in their opening fixtures.
Brazil and Mexico are the first teams to play their second game, on the same day as the opening fixtures in Group H. Those results are also included in Lawro's predictions.
Before the tournament, Lawro picked his two teams to go through from each group and reach the knockout stage.
He is backing Argentina to win the World Cup and lift the trophy at the Maracana on 13 July, and believes England will reach the quarter-finals.
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
