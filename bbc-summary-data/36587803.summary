Stuart McCall says Bradford City are a "perfect fit" as he starts his second spell as boss of the League One club.

McCall first took charge following the Bantams' relegation to League Two in May 2007, but quit in February 2010 with his side 16th in the table.
The 52-year-old has since managed Rangers and Motherwell, and left his role as Scotland coach to rejoin City.
"The last time I was here it certainly wasn't a perfect fit, but it is now," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I don't like to keep looking back, but the last time I was here the club had just dropped into the bottom division, and in hindsight I let my heart rule my head because it was a place I wanted to come to.
"But it was a totally different football club and I was a totally different manager."
Bradford lost to Millwall in the League One play-off semi-finals in 2015-16 and McCall, who was appointed following former manager Phil Parkinson's decision to take charge at Bolton, is targeting promotion to the Championship in his first season.
"That's got to be the aim," he said. "The club have been progressing nicely over the last few seasons and we don't want that momentum to stop.
"For me as a manager, it's about getting the best of what you've got, whatever that may be, whether that be big signings coming in, or young signings, or young players or players on loan.
"It's about getting the best of what you've got and that's something I've been able to do over the last few years."
