Iraq violence: Islamic State attacks kill dozens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two suicide attacks claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS) have killed at least 30 people in and around the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first attack targeted a commercial area in the mainly Shia district of Baghdad al-Jadidah leaving 19 dead.
A second bomb hit an army checkpoint in Taji, north of the capital, killing 11 people, including soldiers.
The Sunni jihadist group has frequently attacked security targets and Shia Muslims, whom it considers apostates.
The group has intensified its attacks in Baghdad as the Iraqi army continues a major offensive to try to drive it from the IS stronghold of Falluja, 60km (37 miles) west of the capital.
More than 80 people were injured in the attacks, which happened at about 09:00 (06:00 GMT).
What is Islamic State?
IS still controls large swathes of territory in the country's north and west, including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city.
The group is also under pressure in neighbouring Syria, where it has been targeted by government forces and US-backed rebels.
