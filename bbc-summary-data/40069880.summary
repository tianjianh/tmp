[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Callaghan, who worked for aviation company Woodward in Ayrshire, will join Kilmarnock full-time in July.
It follows a re-organisation that led to former chairman Michael Johnston standing down as a director.
Director Billy Bowie said: "Kirsten has a wealth of experience in running a premier league club."
Callaghan, a Kilmarnock season ticket holder, is a BA Hons graduate in strategic management and HR management and is currently studying for her masters in HR management.
"Kirsten, who previously held a senior position with Woodward, will play an integral part in developing the club, working with the current team to achieve business objectives," added Bowie in a statement on his club website.
The Premiership already has another female chief executive - Hearts owner and chairwoman Ann Budge.
They will be joined next season by former Motherwell chief executive Leeann Dempster, who is presently with Championship winners Hibernian.
Kilmarnock have yet to announce the future of interim manager Lee McCulloch.
