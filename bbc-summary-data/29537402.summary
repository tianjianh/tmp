A Wasps supporter who has initiated a petition against the club's move from High Wycombe to Coventry has said fans have been let down.

Wasps, who will start playing games at the Ricoh Arena from December, say they understand it is a sensitive time and have attempted to address supporters' concerns on their website.
Alexander Hayton has supported Wasps since 1998, when he was 10 years old.
"It feels very much that as a fanbase we've been abused," he told BBC Sport.
"There's a loyalty the fans have shown the club the last few seasons. As far as I'm concerned loyalty swings both ways.
"I will never support another club. Once a Wasp, always a Wasp. But my time of regularly attending home games is over unfortunately."
The Premiership club have traditionally been located in the north west London area during its 147-year history, predominantly in Sudbury, and have spent the past 12 years paying rent to play at Wycombe Wanderers' Adams Park ground.
Owner Derek Richardson saved Wasps from going into administration two years ago, but the club have continued to lose Â£3m a year.
Wasps completed a deal to buy a 50% share in the Ricoh Arena on Tuesday and say the move "gives the club the best opportunity to thrive as a business, which will support further investment in the squad".
"It's sad to leave London but there was no other choice. You can't sustain a business on gates of 5,000," said Wasps captain James Haskell.
Hayton has amassed more than 2,000 signatures on his e-petition opposing the move.
"It's sad the club has shown us no loyalty whatsoever," he said.
"One of the great things about Adams Park is the number of kids you get there. If they're playing rugby with their school in the morning, can they get up to Coventry in time for a game?
"I think Wasps as we know it are dead. You can't look at a club that has been in a location for 150 years and say the location has nothing to do with its identity.
"Wasps have assumed a model of seeing sports clubs as franchises rather than part of the local community. That's broken what made Wasps a great club."
