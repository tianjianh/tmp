Luton Town 1-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton were held to a draw by fellow promotion chasers Carlisle, who finished the match with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were ahead with the first attack, Shaun Miller's header spilled by Christian Walton and Jason Kennedy tapping home on five minutes.
However, Luton levelled on 10 minutes, Jack Marriott crossing for Danny Hylton to notch his 14th of the season.
Alan Sheehan shot straight at Mark Gillespie, while Nicky Adams' effort was tipped over by Walton.
Marriott then missed a glorious chance, heading straight at Gillespie from Stephen O'Donnell's inch-perfect delivery, and curled another effort marginally wide.
In the second half, Cameron McGeehan almost bundled his way over the line, denied by a brave Gillespie stop, while Kennedy's overhead volley was easy for Walton.
Carlisle's Michael Raynes was dismissed for an apparent elbow on Hylton with 10 minutes to go but they should have won it in stoppage time, Adams denied from close range by Walton.
