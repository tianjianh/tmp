Campaigners say it is a positive step in the right direction but say newspapers need to do more to represent women for the "amazing things they do" rather than for decoration.
Not everyone is happy with the decision though.
Three Page Three models have their say.
Emma is a Page Three star and she told Newsbeat that parents and feminists should be more concerned about access to porn that children have on their mobiles and tablets.
She told Newsbeat that she thinks campaigners should focus on bigger issues.
"There are way more important issues for feminist to be tackling than trying to ban a pair of boobs," she said.
"Whether you decide to get your boobs out doesn't define you as a person. I do have a brain, I have 11 GCSEs, 3 A-levels and a degree."
Emma told Newsbeat that she wishes feminists would stop singling out her profession.
"You see women's magazines and they are far more damaging to younger girls and women by putting down people's weight. I am confident with my body.
"I used to be bullied at school but it's given me so much confidence. It's empowered me and I get paid very well."
Emma told Newsbeat that campaigners say they are standing up for her rights but she wished they would leave her alone.
"The whole point of feminism is equal rights and for women to be able to do what they want from their own choice.
"I'm not being forced to do the job I do. I do it because I want to do it. "
One of the best known Page Three models is Melinda Messenger. She says her time doing it was fun.
"I will always have fond memories of working with The Sun even though it was only for a short while. I'm older and wiser, it's not something I would advise any girl to do.
"The paper has made the right decision, and it shows a great understanding from The Sun to end Page Three in this current climate.
"We live in a time now, where we are one click away from seeing thousands of naked images of both men and women.
"Our kids have full access to a whole gamut of images, a lot of which are potentially damaging to the development of their sense of self and I think this is the bigger issue we should be concerned about.
"As a mother myself I'm constantly worried about how easy it is for our kids to access porn, but also did they really need to see a topless woman in a family paper too?"
"I commend the Sun for taking out Page Three. That page should now be used for tackling the bigger issues of society, like abuse of all kinds and the readily available internet pornography that is having a damaging effect on how our kids view themselves."
Another Page Three pin-up, Jodie Marsh, has been defending her old job after being criticised on Twitter.
She said: "So-called 'feminists' really annoy me. Telling girls they shouldn't do Page 3 is not being a feminist; women should do whatever they want.
"I loved doing Page 3, it was good money. I thought 'Blimey, people are willing to pay to see my boobs'.
"I felt powerful, I was definitely in control and all the people (mostly women) I worked with were fab. I never felt exploited - in fact the opposite."
She denied that being a model meant she was selling out women.
"I am very much a feminist. I believe women can do it all and have it all. Women who slag off other women are just jealous and insecure.
"Women shouldn't be fighting to be equal to men. We are there already."
