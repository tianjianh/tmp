Explosives lit up the sky and loud bangs were heard as a fire took hold at the shop on 05:00 BST on Bitterne Road West.
The footage, shot by a local resident alongside a police cordon, shows a sudden large blast followed by fireworks going off in the street.
No-one was injured but about 60 residents living within 100 metres (328ft) of the fire on the site of the Southern Fireworks Factory and the Flower Factory were evacuated from their homes.
