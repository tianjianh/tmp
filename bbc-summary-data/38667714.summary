Chelsea Hyndman inquest: Convicted boyfriend seeks review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man convicted of causing his girlfriend's death while on a Greek island is seeking a judicial review into an inquest's findings.

Chelsea Hyndman, 20, died on Crete in May 2010, with Luke Walker found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm leading to her death.
Her inquest heard of a "disagreement" in post-mortem test results, with one suggesting a fall may have killed her.
At Wakefield Coroner's Court, a narrative verdict was recorded.
Coroner Jonathan Leach said Ms Hyndman, of Castleford in West Yorkshire, met Walker, now 29, in 2008 while working in Malia.
On 16 May 2010, she suffered abdominal pains and was taken to hospital, where her condition deteriorated. Despite emergency surgery, she died the following day, the coroner's court heard.
During the trial, held in Greece, the court heard her injuries were caused by an assault by Walker, from Brierley Hill, near Dudley in the West Midlands, five days earlier.
Walker was given a three-year suspended sentence.
A Greek post-mortem examination found Ms Hyndman's pancreas ruptured after multiple blows, but Allen Anscombe, a pathologist employed by Walker's family, said a fall while on a night out 11 days earlier may have caused her death.
Mr Leach said: "I cannot make a determination inconsistent with the court in Greece.
"The only conclusions open to me are that of unlawful killing and a narrative verdict."
He added: "A narrative conclusion is more appropriate in this case."
Andrew Scott, Walker's barrister, asked the coroner to consider questioning how the Greek trial was conducted, but this was rejected.
The coroner said he accepted the medical cause of death provided following the post-mortem tests, which was blunt force trauma to the abdomen.
Following the inquest, Ms Hyndman's family did not wish to comment.
Mr Scott said: "We're actively pursuing a judicial review over the issue about the coroner's treatment of the record of conviction from Greece.
"This has never happened in a case before, and the higher courts need to be involved."
