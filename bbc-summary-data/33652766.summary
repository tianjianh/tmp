Three fire engines were called just before 11:00 BST to a fire in a shed containing gas cylinders in Riverdale Court, Brundall.
Flames from a bonfire had spread to nearby wooden buildings which led to the properties being evacuated and trains on a nearby line being halted.
Residents have now been allowed back and trains are running again.
Fire officer David McLeod said the shed "caught fire from a rubbish bonfire but it contained cylinders that caused an explosion".
Resident Stuart Sayer, 51, said he heard a "huge explosion" which made his house shake.
"I heard the fire engines arriving and about 10 seconds later the explosion," he said.
"I ran out and checked neighbours and saw three fire engines and five or six police cars.
"It was near a primary school but luckily they are all on holiday.
"There were small fragments falling from sky after the explosion," he added.
Abellio Greater Anglia said its trains were running again but any delays should clear during the afternoon.
