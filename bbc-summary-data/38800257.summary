Swansea City have signed Aston Villa forward Jordan Ayew in a deal that sees Wales international Neil Taylor move in the opposite direction.

Swansea will pay up to £5m - plus Taylor - for the Ghana international who has signed a three-and-a-half year deal at the Liberty Stadium.
Ayew is the brother of former Swansea forward Andre Ayew.
"I'm sure his brother has given him the inside track on the club," said Swans head coach Paul Clement.
"He is a very good acquisition. He's versatile and dynamic to attack the lines and get in behind defences.
"He will certainly give us something different to what we've got."
The 25-year-old Ayew, whose brother Andre played for Swansea last season before joining West Ham for £20.5m, is currently with Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations.
Taylor, 27, has made more than 150 appearances for the club since his arriving from Wrexham, who could still receive a cash windfall through a sell-on clause.
His departure ends a six-and-a-half year association with the Swans.
The left-back moved to the Liberty from non-league club Wrexham in 2010 and played for the Swans 179 times.
"Neil has been a great servant for this club. I had a really nice discussion with him about his position," added Clement.
"He said he wanted to take this opportunity and I supported that. It's the right time for him to have a new challenge and we wish him all the best.
"We brought Martin Olsson in from Norwich so we ended up with three left-backs with Neil and Stephen [Kingsley] as well. I only really need two."
Elsewhere, a potential loan move for Benfica defender Lisandro Ezequiel Lopez will not happen.
Meanwhile, the club's Dutch striker Marvin Emnes has rejoined Blackburn on loan.
