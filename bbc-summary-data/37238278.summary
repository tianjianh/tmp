Emigration: Number of people leaving Northern Ireland down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emigration from Northern Ireland fell to its lowest level in nine years in the year ending mid-2015, according to official estimates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The number of people leaving was estimated at 21,500 - down by 5.6% compared to 2014.
The number of people coming to live in Northern Ireland in 2015 was estimated at 23,600.
During Northern Ireland's economic boom years, annual net immigration peaked at almost 11,000.
The overall Northern Ireland population was estimated to be just over 1.85 million in June 2015, an increase of 11,100 on the previous year.
The figures, from the the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra), also show a continuing trend towards an aging population.
The number of people aged 65 and over in Northern Ireland increased by 2.1% in 2015 to reach 291,800 people, almost 16% of the population.
Within that group, the population aged 85 and over increased by 2.9% to reach 35,500 people or 1.9% of the population.
By contrast, the number of children aged 0 to 15 increased by just 0.4% to reach 385,200 or 20.8% of the population.
