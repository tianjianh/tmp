People caught killing birds of prey in Wales should face stiffer sentences, wildlife campaigners have said.

North Wales Police's rural crime unit recently launched a campaign to target bird of prey poisoners after attacks on rare peregrine falcons and buzzards.
Former Springwatch TV presenter Iolo Williams said it was "heartbreaking" those convicted often get just a fine.
North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Winston Roddick has called for "tougher" sentencing powers.
Mr Williams told BBC Radio Cymru: "There is nothing more heartbreaking than successfully bringing someone to court but at the end of the day the court gives them a fine of Â£150 to Â£200.
"It's important the courts take these matters seriously."
Crimes against wildlife carry a fine of up to Â£5,000 or a prison sentence of up to six months.
Mr Roddick said he would write to the Law Commission about stiffening up sanctions.
"I would like the magistrates' court to be given more powers to commit cases to the crown court as their sentencing powers are much tougher," he said.
