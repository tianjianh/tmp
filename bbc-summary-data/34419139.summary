Newport, bottom of League Two, parted company with Butcher on Thursday.
Byron Anthony and Michael Flynn will assist Sheridan, 51, for Saturday's home game against Exeter City.
"I am confident that if the players and fans work together we can help the squad climb the table, away from the relegation zone," he said.
Sheridan, who played for Leeds United, Sheffield Wednesday and Bolton Wanderers, has managed Oldham, Chesterfield and Plymouth Argyle, who he left in May 2015.
He has been appointed until the end of the season and is expected to confirm his permanent backroom staff in the near future.
County have approached Irish Premiership side Linfield regarding the possibility of appointing their manager Warren Feeney as Sheridan's assistant.
Ex-Northern Ireland striker Feeney spent three years with Cardiff City and had a brief spell on loan with Swansea City in 2007.
Sheridan's appointment comes less than 24 hours after  former England captain Butcher, along with assistant Russell Osman and chief scout Steve Marsella, left the club.
Their departures came after Newport County Supporters' Trust raised the required Â£195,000 to take over the club.
"The trust board are delighted that John has agreed to join us," a statement read.
"He comes with an excellent track record and we would ask fans continue to support the club by coming along to John's first game against Exeter on Saturday, and of course the first game as a supporter owned community based club."
