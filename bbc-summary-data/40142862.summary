[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tom Weir Statue Campaign said she had been an "inspiration" and a "determined woman with the biggest heart".
The campaign group unveiled its statue to Mr Weir at Balmaha on Loch Lomondside in 2014 on the 100th anniversary of his birth.
A garden in the couple's honour was opened in 2016.
Mrs Weir, a former teacher, moved to the village of Gartocharn, West Dunbartonshire, with Mr Weir in 1959 and lived there for the rest of her life.
A member of the Ladies Scottish Mountaineering Club since 1948, she met her husband on the bus on the way back from a climbing meet in Glen Coe.
The broadcaster and writer, who was best known for his long-running television series Weir's Way, died in 2006.
The Tom Weir Statue Campaign said in a Facebook post: "She truly was my inspiration to see our campaign come to fruition.
"Having worked closely with her every step of the way I had the privilege of getting to know this great woman behind the great man and said on many occasions that we were perhaps making the statue for the wrong person.
"I've never met a more determined woman with the biggest heart. Rhona, you will be sorely missed."
