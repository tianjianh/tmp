Glamorgan's opening first-class match of the season against Cardiff MCCU drifted to a tame draw as the students battled to 149-5 on the final day.

Lengthy time losses for rain ensured the Welsh county had to settle for bowling practice, eight days before their Championship season starts.
David Lloyd and Michael Hogan took two wickets each.
Glamorgan second XI player Jeremy Lawlor hit 50 not out and Academy opener Connor Brown 33.
Meanwhile, South Africa fast bowler Marchant de Lange could still be signed in time for the opening competitive game at Northants.
Seamer Ruaidhri Smith has been ruled out for six weeks with an abdominal tear, while Will Bragg (back), Timm van der Gugten (shoulder) and Graham Wagg (groin) are set to miss their final warm-up friendly against Nottinghamshire on Sunday 2 April.
Glamorgan coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport:
"Any opportunity we get to get in the middle is good, it got some of the competitive juices going though there are percentages to go up against first-class opposition.
"Jacques played well, it's nice for him, for the team and the supporters.
"The three injuries are being monitored day by day, it's unlikely all three will be fit for Northampton.
"We hope as many as possible of them will be fit, but if they're not, the players in those positions have had opportunities throughout pre-season."
