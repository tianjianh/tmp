[SN]TITLE[SN]
Surrey farmer Robert Fidler to face contempt of court hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer who built a mock-Tudor castle without planning permission may be found in contempt of court after failing to knock it down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Fidler built the home at Honeycrock Farm, in Salfords, Surrey, in 2002 and kept it hidden behind hay bales for four years.
He was told to knock it down by 26 June after losing a High Court appeal.
Reigate and Banstead Borough Council said it has lodged a claim for contempt of court proceedings.
A hearing will take place at the High Court on 22 October.
In 2008, Mr Fidler said he hid the "castle" because he believed a house that stood for four years without objection had a legal right to remain.
The four-bedroom property, on greenbelt land, includes a kitchen, living room, study, a gravelled forecourt and a conservatory.
In April Mr Fidler said he accepted he had no choice but to demolish the house, but in June he said it would be like Picasso destroying one of his paintings.
