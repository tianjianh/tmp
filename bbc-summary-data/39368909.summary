Thames Valley Police officer jailed over child sex images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been jailed after hundreds of "horrendous" child sex abuse images were found on his computers and mobile phone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Leigh Morris, 31, of Thames Valley Police, was arrested by his colleagues at his home in Milton Keynes.
Some of the most serious images found involved children as young as three, and one involved a baby.
He was jailed for 12 months at Luton Crown Court on Thursday.

Douglas Page, prosecuting, said the images consisted of a range of videos and still photographs.
Judge Michael Kay QC told him: "The images are horrendous.
"I have heard a lot about you. What one doesn't hear on these occasions is the position of each one of the children in those images. Each one of those children is a victim and has been abused."
Morris admitted three counts of downloading indecent photographs of a child, one of possessing an extreme pornographic image, and one of possessing a prohibited image of a child.
There were 131 images at Category A, the most serious level, while 217 were at Category B and a further 113 were at Category C.
He had used software to try to cover up what he had been looking at.
Cameron Scott, defending, said Morris was "deeply ashamed" of his behaviour and had self-funded a course with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation , a charity working with internet offenders.
He added Morris had damaged his family and lost his job.
Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said: "I am always deeply disappointed to hear of a criminal offence being committed by a police officer.
"This undermines the confidence that members of the public should rightly have in the police service and therefore he was dismissed from the force without notice following a special case misconduct hearing."
Morris must register as a sex offender for 10 years and abide by the terms of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
