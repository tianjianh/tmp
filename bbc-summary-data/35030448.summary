Police were alerted to an incident in Coilte Cresent in the Highland village at about 22:00 on Sunday.
A man wearing dark clothing and carrying what appeared to be a gun entered the house and demanded money from the homeowner, police said.
A man was later arrested in Cumbria and has been assisting officers investigating the incident.
A four-figure sum of money was stolen from the house in Drumnadrochit's Kilmore area.
Police Scotland said: "A high visibility police presence remains in area at this time to provide reassurance to the local community.
"Police are keen to hear from members of the public who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area prior to the incident.
"In addition, officers would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a silver VW Passat in the area earlier that day."
