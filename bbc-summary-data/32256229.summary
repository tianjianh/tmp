Remembrance crosses will be placed on the graves of Flintshire men who died at Ypres and the Somme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Locals have made the pilgrimage to the World War One battlefields of Flanders and France, and will place the crosses over the weekend.
The trip was organised by the Flintshire war memorials project, that received Â£10,000 lottery funding to tell the story of the area's war dead.
The group will lay two wreaths, with one at the Welsh Memorial in Langemark.
