Richard Stearman: 'My eyes lit up', says Wolves' Anfield FA Cup goal hero

Wolves defender Richard Stearman says he simply could not believe his eyes at getting the chance to become an FA Cup hero inside 53 seconds at Anfield.

Stearman's strike, bolstered by Andreas Weimann's killer second just before the break, set up Wolves' 2-1 fourth-round win over under-strength Liverpool.
The 29-year-old says he was stunned at just getting an early opportunity.
"It was right on my head. When it came across I knew I was in with a very good chance," he told BBC WM.
"My eyes lit up as soon as Helder Costa put it in the box. To be 1-0 up inside a minute was incredible."
Weimann, scorer of Wolves' second goal on his full debut for Wolves was part of the last Paul Lambert side to beat Liverpool at Anfield, also scoring in Aston Villa's 3-1 victory in December 2012.
And the sense of a big occasion, culminating in the post-match celebratory Icelandic clap to the euphoric away fans at the Anfield Road End, would have brought back golden summer Euro 2016 memories for two of Wolves' internationals, Wales midfielder Dave Edwards and Iceland striker Jan Dadi Bodvarsson.
Wolves are a young side, however, and the key message at Anfield from Stearman and Wolves' 30-year-old skipper Dave Edwards was to make the most of it and enjoy their big day.
"Me and Eddo made a point of telling the boys: 'It's not often we're going to be here, suck it up, and enjoy the day'," added Stearman.
"And, in the dressing room after the game we were going round saying: 'Remember this feeling as it's not going to come around too often'.
"Their fans weren't too happy with their team. But we limited them to shots from distance and, when they brought on their big hitters, we handled it well. We had a game plan and it worked."
Wolves are hoping to complete a permanent deal for Helder Costa in the next 48 hours, reports BBC WM.
The Portuguese winger is on loan for the season from Benfica, but Wolves have a sole option to buy him outright during the current transfer window.
The fee, which is expected to be about £13m payable to the Portuguese Primeira Liga leaders, would nearly double Wolves' existing transfer record - the reported £7m paid to Monaco for Ivan Cavaleiro in August 2016.
