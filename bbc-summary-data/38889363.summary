Fleetwood Town 2-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Bradford striker Devante Cole kick-started an unlikely comeback as the Bantams were beaten by promotion-chasing Fleetwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradford bossed an entertaining first half in which they squandered two good chances to grab the lead.
The first came on the quarter hour after Josh Cullen tumbled under pressure from Ben Davies.
Rory McArdle rose well at the back post to meet Nicky Law's curling free-kick, the Bradford wide man unable to direct his header under the bar.
The visitors went closer still when Romaine Vincelot picked the pocket of Kyle Dempsey, James Meredith charging away on the overlap.
Charlie Wyke was unmarked on the end of Meredith's driven cross but blasted spectacularly over the woodwork from close range.
Fleetwood were on the wrong end of a battering from the Bantams and finally cracked two minutes before the break.
Jordy Hiwula played a neat one-two with Wyke running beyond the last man and firing low past goalkeeper Alex Cairns.
After the break Bradford lacked the intensity of their first-half display but were still capable of causing the hosts problems.
Hiwula almost set up a second when he cut in from the left, Fleetwood clawing his shot away but only as far as Alex Gillead whose close-range effort was somehow turned over the bar by Cairns.
The hosts had made a double change, throwing caution to the wind in search of a leveller. The change brought the desired result with Ash Hunter pivotal in an unlikely equaliser.
He raced onto a hopeful through ball, driving a low ball across the six-yard box where former Bradford man Cole was waiting to pounce.
And the comeback was complete when Conor McLaughlin, who moments before had stung the palms of Bradford stopper Colin Doyle, ghosted onto a short corner, driving a devil of a ball across the six-yard box as McArdle turned the ball into his own net at the near post.
