"I'm thrilled to confirm that the @MTV European Music Awards are returning to London," announced mayor Sadiq Khan on Twitter.
The event will take place at the SSE Arena in Wembley on 12 November.
The awards, now in their 24th year, were last held in London in 1996, with Oasis and the late George Michael among the winners.
Other UK cities to have hosted the event include Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow.
Last year's ceremony, in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, featured performances from Green Day, Bruno Mars and Kings of Leon.
