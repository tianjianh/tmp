The poll, conducted by BBC Culture, asked 177 film critics from 36 countries to name their favourite films of the last 16 years.
Mulholland Drive, which stars Justin Theroux and Naomi Watts, was released in 2001 and earned David Lynch an Oscar nomination for best director.
It tells the story of an aspiring actress who moves to Los Angeles and befriends an amnesic woman.
The neo-noir mystery film was not one of the year's highest grossing films at the box office but it received warm praise from critics.
In the Mood for Love, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung and set in Hong Kong in the 1960s, took second place in the poll.
The film, which was released in 2000, was directed by Wong Kar-wai and earned a nomination for the Palme d'Or - the top award at the Cannes Film Festival.
There Will Be Blood, which was released in 2007, was the third most popular with critics.
The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano and tells the story of an oilman on a ruthless quest for wealth.
Spirited Away, a Japanese fantasy animation film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, took fourth place in the poll.
The most recent film in the top 10 was Richard Linklater's Boyhood, which took fifth place.
Released in 2014, the coming-of-age film shot with the same cast over 12 years won the best film Bafta in 2015 and a best supporting actress Oscar for Patricia Arquette.
The most recent recipient of the best film Oscar, Spotlight, came in 88th place.
Only two other best picture winners made the top 100 - No Country For Old Men (which was placed 10th) and 12 Years a Slave (44th).
