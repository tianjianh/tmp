A "drone" boat capable of carrying out 12-hour surveillance missions is being developed for the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers.

The vessel, being created in Portsmouth by BAE Systems and ASV, will be used on the new Queen Elizabeth Class ships.
The modified rigid inflatable boats are capable of unmanned operations up to 25 miles (40km) away from their parent vessel.
They can also be remote controlled from land or ship, or piloted normally.
The boats, which can travel in excess of 38 knots (44mph), are intended to carry out high-risk missions without putting sailors in danger.
Les Gregory, product and training services director at BAE Systems, said the boats were capable of performing multiple roles.
Dan Hook, managing director for Fareham-based ASV, which develops unmanned marine systems, said the technology would allow the boat to complete "complex missions and navigate through waters avoiding collisions".
He said: "This gives it the flexibility and sophistication to operate in a number of different tactical roles, whether it's patrolling areas of interest, providing surveillance and reconnaissance ahead of manned missions, or protecting larger ships in the fleet."
