The Glenfiddich Collection 1937 fetched £68,500 at the Bonhams Whisky Sale.
Bonhams said it was the highest paid at auction for a bottle of Glenfiddich and a Scottish auction house record for the sale of a single malt.
The bottle was laid down in cask 843 at the Glenfiddich Distillery at Dufftown, Moray, in 1937.
It was bottled 64 years later in 2001.
Auctioneers estimated before the sale the bottle would fetch between £25,000 and £35,000. It was bought by a bidder in the Far East at the whisky sale on Wednesday.
The auction house said it was "highly unusual" for a single malt Scotch whisky of this age to have kept its strength, which is what made the bottle so special.
It is the oldest and rarest bottling ever undertaken at the distillery.
Bonhams Whisky specialist Martin Green said, "The record price reflects the exceptional rarity of the Glenfiddich Rare Collection 1937 and its great appeal to collectors everywhere."
