Derek Serpell-Morris, 74, who played sets at Glastonbury and gigs across the UK, disappeared from his home in July.
His great-niece Jennifer Griffiths has been sent a photograph which was taken at Waterloo Station on Monday evening.
She said the resemblance was "uncanny" and he owned the same hat and scarf. "My gut is telling me that it's him," she said.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said the photo had been handed to the investigations team and was forming part of their inquiry.
The picture was shared on social media and was passed to Ms Griffiths on Wednesday morning.
She said: "As soon as saw it my stomach turned. I thought, 'oh my God'.
"There were so many resemblances - the way he's dressed, underneath the coat he was smartly dressed.
"He also has a scarf and hat exactly like that. The only thing I can think is that he's lost his mind and doesn't know what he's doing."
Ms Griffiths said other family members who have seen the photo also think it is of him.
"The resemblance is uncanny," she said.
Martin Ball said he and his friend, who took the photo, spoke to the man for about five to 10 minutes.
"He looked like he was struggling. We asked if he was okay.
"He seemed quite intoxicated, he started singing. We don't know if he was drunk.
"Now I have Googled 'DJ Derek', we are 100% certain it was him. I would be very shocked if I found it wasn't."
Ms Griffiths said she was planning to contact all the homeless shelters in London, and to put up posters in the city.
