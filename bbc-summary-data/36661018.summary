Defender Kelly headed home from Andy Hall's corner in the 14th minute to give the Irish Cup winners the lead.
Palmi Palmason levelled by volleying a right-foot shot into the net from 12 yards five minutes before the break.
Substitute Holmbert Fridjonsson found the net with a penalty on 79 after Andrew Doyle conceded the spot-kick.
Glenavon were without striker Declan O'Brien and midfielder Andy McGrory, who are both on holiday, while injured pair David Elebert and Kevin Braniff were ruled out, along with long-term absentees James Singleton and Kyle Neill.
Kelly's opener got the Lurgan Blues off to the perfect start, before Mark Sykes saw a shot saved as Gary Hamilton's side sought to extend their advantage.
Palmason struck to bring the home side level and Fridjonsson's penalty proved decisive on the night.
Eoin Bradley and Gregory Moorhouse had chances for the visitors in the second half.
The second leg will be staged at Mourneview Park, Lurgan, on Thursday 7 July.
