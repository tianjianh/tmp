[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fifth GP practice terminates contract in north Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fifth GP practice is to terminate its contract with the health board in north Wales, affecting 8,000 patients.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it would manage Pen Y Maes surgery in Summerhill if another team of GPs does not take it over in October.
No reasons have been given for the contract termination.
The Pendyffryn Medical Group in Prestatyn terminated its contract in September citing a failure to recruit new doctors.
In December, a GP in nearby Rhuddlan terminated her contract, blaming the challenges and pressures of growing demands.
The health board will run the practices from April.
It is currently managing two other practices in Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, and Wrexham's Beechley Medical Centre.
