Firefighters in five appliances from both Kent and Essex were called to the east bore tunnel just before 13:00 BST.
Both tunnels had to be closed while the fire was extinguished. There are no reports of any injuries.
Amy Spencer tweeted: "Scariest moment ever, The Car in front of me was on fire in the dartford tunnel, we all had to evacuate."
She added: "Thought I was going to die."
Luca Regan, 14, from Colchester, said: "Everyone started to run and scream out of the tunnel in fear the car was going to explode."
The fire has led to congestion in the area with traffic on the M25 anticlockwise queuing back to Junction 4 for Orpington.
