Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the Australian Open in the first round by Fernando Verdasco.

Should the defeat be treated as a one-off, or does it indicate the 14-time Grand Slam champion, who turns 30 this year, is in a state of decline?
Here, BBC Sport analyses the facts and figures:
Nadal's defeat by Spanish compatriot Verdasco was only his second ever first-round exit at a Grand Slam.
But it followed a 2015 season in which he failed to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since 2004.
As well as not winning a Slam, Nadal only managed to win three ATP Tour titles in 2015. It is the joint fewest titles he has won in a season since 2004.
Perhaps the true indication of whether Nadal is in a state of decline will come during the clay season - his favoured surface.
The left-hander, nicknamed the 'King of Clay', has won nine of his Grand Slam titles on the surface at the French Open, including five in a row between 2010 and 2014.
