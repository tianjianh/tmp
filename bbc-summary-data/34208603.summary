[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Wight cuts to council tax benefit planned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents on the Isle of Wight receiving help with paying their council tax can expect cuts to their benefit next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council said cuts to its budget from central government means it is looking at capping the help it offers.
Proposals include raising the minimum payment from claimants from 20% to 30% and taking into account other benefits such as Disability Living Allowance.
A public consultation on the proposed changes runs until 6 November.
Leader of the Independent-run Isle of Wight Council Jonathan Bacon said: "We are under increasing pressure from government to change the way we support local residents around council tax support."
He added the council may have to make "tough decisions" on saving money while still providing "support to those residents who are on a low income".
Consultation recommendations will be considered by the council's executive in November, with a view to bringing in changes from April 2016.
