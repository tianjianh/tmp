Actor Bryan Cranston has helped a teenage Breaking Bad fan secure a date for his prom, by filming a special proposal in character as Walter White.

Cranston was approached by Stefan Montana, 17, in New York outside his current Broadway show All the Way.
Referencing a famous Walter White line, the actor warned Montana's friend Maddie that she should "tread lightly" if she dared to say no.
After being sent the invitation on Instagram, she accepted that night.
Cranston's Breaking Bad character, a high school chemistry teacher turned drug dealer, first delivered the famous line during a confrontation with his brother-in-law Hank, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
In the video proposal, Cranston said: "If you don't go to the prom with Stefan, then maybe your best course of action would be to tread lightly."
A grinning Montana, from California, then followed it up with a request of his own: "Maddie, will you go to the prom with me?"
He told the New York Daily News that he and Maddie are both big fans of the Emmy Award-winning AMC series, broadcast by Netflix in the UK.
"He really is the nicest guy in the world. It really is true. He's not really a celebrity, he's a dude," Montana told the paper.
"He didn't have to help me out but it was pretty amazing," he added.
