The government-funded Everton in the Community Free School will be run by the club's charity and is expected to open in September 2012.
It will provide education and sports tuition for 120 14 to 19-year-olds.
Its approval was announced in the House of Commons by Education Secretary Michael Gove.
Everton FC chief executive Robert Elstone said: "We have played a huge part in the Liverpool and Merseyside community for over 100 years and this latest move demonstrates our desire to continue to make a difference where it counts."
Everton FC manager David Moyes added: "It will, unquestionably, provide a real chance for some less-privileged, less-fortunate children to embrace and benefit from a high-quality education."
