[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owner Brookside Products Ltd said it had "done everything" but had failed to find a buyer for the plant.
Director Doug Aitchison, said it was a "sad" day, but that a third of the firm's 64 workers, had found other jobs or been redeployed within the firm.
The family business set up in 1987, moved to Maryport in 1995. The factory smokes and packages salmon.
Mr Aitchison said: "Unfortunately there is no good news.
"The 30-day consultation period has passed and while initially there seemed to be a reasonable level of interest, discussions with interested parties have come to an end and no formal offers have been received.
"We have explored all the options and there seems to be no viable alternatives. Sadly, this means the facility will now close.
"We are sorry this has happened and we have done everything we can to avoid closure. This is a sad day for us all."
He added that more than £400,000 had been invested in the firm over the last three years, to "no avail".
