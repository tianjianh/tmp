Schoolboy Bailey Gwynne was stabbed, by a fellow pupil, at Aberdeen's Cults Academy on 28 October 2015.
The findings of an independent report into the incident are being announced.
The report had been commissioned by Aberdeen City Council, Police Scotland and NHS Grampian.
The student's killer, who cannot be named, was jailed for nine years for culpable homicide.
The BBC revealed, earlier this year, that concerns had been raised about the boy nine years previously.
