A memorial garden in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, is being planned ahead of the 20th anniversary of her death, Kensington Palace has said.

Historic Royal Palaces, the charity responsible for overseeing the plans, said the garden was in the "very early stages of development".
It will be the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana if it reaches completion.
Diana died in a car accident in Paris with her partner Dodi Fayed in 1997.
Historic Royal Palaces recently advertised for a new gardener to help with the project, which is expected to be completed before the anniversary on 31 August 2017.
A spokesman for Kensington Palace confirmed that plans were being explored by palace officials and management at Historic Royal Palaces.
He said Diana's sons, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, were being kept "informed" about the garden project.
A spokeswoman for Historic Royal Palaces said: "Our plans are still at the earliest stages of development, and we're recruiting for staff to help us explore the possibilities."
The other London memorials are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.
