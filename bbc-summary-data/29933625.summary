Burnley manager Sean Dyche is relaxed about his side's wait for a Premier League win, saying "by no means are we at the bottom of the valley".

The Clarets lie bottom of the table after 10 games on four points, five from safety.
"How many worries can you have?" said Dyche. "You could bog yourself down with that junk. Nobody's dead - we're playing football.
"The players are motivated to win games and so am I."
Burnley welcome Hull to Turf Moor on Saturday, with Steven Reid likely to be available after six weeks out with a groin injury.
"Sometimes you've got be in the bottom of the valley to see the top of the mountain," added Dyche. "By no means are we at the bottom of the valley because it's a great journey for us."
Burnley, Championship runners-up last season, spent modestly in the summer and have concentrated on improving the club's infrastructure, something Dyche says they do not regret despite their struggles on the pitch.
"My job as manager depend on winning games," he said. "I'm not naive to that but there has to be a balance to how this club goes about it.
"We had a supersonic journey last year to the Premier League so all the things that should be in place that are at other clubs were not in place."
Burnley were beaten 3-0 at Arsenal last Saturday and Dyche revealed Gunners' manager Arsene Wenger invited him to his office after the game.
"We had a good chat about everything," he said. "We'd had as many key passes into the box as they had at the stage of the season and we spoke about that.
"The defining moment is we don't have (an Alexis) Sanchez - he didn't want to loan him to us."
