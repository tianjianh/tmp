The man was tracked down via the social network by animal rights activist Saurabh Gupta.
Animal lovers in India were outraged by the 23-second clip of the man swinging the dog by its hind legs and throwing it at a parked car.
Activists had called for the arrest of the man soon after the video went viral on the social media.
Mr Gupta had had taken screenshots of the man's Facebook account before it was deleted, according to a report in the Times of India.
The report added that Mr Gupta, who works with people for animals, contacted friends of the man on Facebook to track him down and then approached the police with the man's mobile number and address.
"I had immediately saved the video and took screenshots of his Facebook profile. I knew he will deactivate his account if he gets noticed. I had, therefore, started contacting his friends, who had liked that video," The report quoted Mr Gupta as saying.
Police arrested the man on Monday night.
