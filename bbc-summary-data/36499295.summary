Donald Skene also headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: "I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers", to the Muslim congregation after being arrested.
The 38-year-old, who is from Dundee, will be sentenced in July.
In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene is seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepare to enter the prayer room.
Skene, who was on licence at the time of the offence after being jailed for assaulting his sister, then walked around the prayer room for several minutes.
Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: "His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down."
Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him.
Mrs Gilmartin said: "There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room.
"The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them.
"He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts 'I'm white but I'm one of you'."
Skene, 38, admitted charges of breach of the peace and resisting arrest.
Allegations that the offence was religiously aggravated were deleted by the Crown.
Defence solicitor Gary McIlravey said: "This is a man who has his own issues in the background.
"He is awaiting counselling for post traumatic stress disorder which may have contributed to this offence."
Sheriff Simon Collins QC deferred sentence until 8 July for social work background reports and released Skene on bail.
