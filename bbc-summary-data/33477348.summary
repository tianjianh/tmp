[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Egypt's Al Ahly managed a goalless draw in Mali against Stade Malien despite being without seven key players in the Confederation Cup on Sunday.

Holders Ahly remain second in Group A with four points after a convincing 3-0 over Tunisia's Esperance in their opening match.
Etoile du Sahel top Group A with a second win in a row as they overcame Esperance 1-0 in a Tunisian derby watched by a Rades crowd restricted to 30,000 because of security concerns.
An Ammar Jemal goal on 50 minutes proved decisive after Etoile had Brazilian Diogo Da Costa red-carded during the opening half.
Esperance are bottom of the group, having lost both their matches so far.
Egyptian club Zamalek came from behind to beat South African hosts Orlando Pirates 2-1 in Saturday's African Confederation Cup match in the north-eastern city Nelspruit.
Substitute Mustapha Fathi scored the winner seven minutes from time to make it two victories out of two for Zamalek in Group B.
Lehlohonolo Majoro had given the Pirates the lead on 68 minutes with Nigerian Maroof Yusuf equalising four minutes later.
The result puts Zamalek top of Group B.
On Friday in Group B, three-time Confederation Cup winners CS Sfaxien came from behind to draw 1-1 with AC Leopards.
Leopards made the long trip north as underdogs, but they went into the fixture having stunned hosts Sfaxien 2-0 three years ago en route to winning the competition.
Captain Ali Maaloul hit an equaliser after Cesair Gandze's first half opener to earn three-time winners Sfaxien their first point of the campaign.
