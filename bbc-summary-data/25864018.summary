It will see the town host a range of concerts, comedy and community activities over three days.
Among the acts involved are Big Country, the Mull Historical Society and Fred MacAulay.
The festival also hopes to see some 5,000 people served up a haggis meal over the weekend.
Earlier this week, MSPs paid tribute to the success of the festival, first held in the town in 2012.
The event says it is about "coming together to celebrate with your friends, pals and visitors" without the need for a degree in Scottish literature.
Among the attractions this year are a Burlesque Burns Supper, Homecoming Carnival and a Midnight Roller Disco.
Some of the events will be staged in the Spiegeltent venue which has been put in place on the town's Newall Terrace.
As part of a drive to get more people enjoying Burns Suppers, a special mascot - Hamish the Haggis - has been touring schools.
During the festival, he will host an "interactive family show" including a children's Burns Supper.
There will also be 10-minute Burns Suppers hosted by Jane Brown, President of the Robert Burns World Federation.
