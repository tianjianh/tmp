[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-2 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reggie Lambe struck the winner at Wycombe as Carlisle consolidated their automatic promotion place in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians, who remain third despite having manager Keith Curle sent off from the dugout late on, are now five points clear of fourth-placed Luton, but it is three defeats in a row for Wycombe, who drop to ninth.
Wycombe had the perfect start in the second minute, as Anthony Stewart played the ball into the danger area and Adebayo Akinfenwa glanced into the bottom corner.
But Carlisle quickly hit back when Jamie Proctor was found in space by Lambe and the on-loan Bolton striker picked his spot from the edge of the area.
Route one then led to the Cumbrians taking the lead on 34 minutes, as Mark Gillespie's free-kick was flicked on by Proctor and Lambe was then able to poke the ball past Jamal Blackman.
Akinfenwa struck a post with a header early in the second half for the Chairboys, who despite exerting some considerable pressure, could not find an equaliser.
