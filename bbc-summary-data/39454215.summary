A Vietnamese child and a 33-year-old Vietnamese man were found by immigration enforcement officers at the Crystal Nails & Beauty shop in Buckley.
The child has been referred to social services while the man now faces deportation after the raid on Tuesday.
Crystal Nails & Beauty were served with an illegal worker notice.
"Those who use and exploit illegal workers face severe financial penalties," said Richard Johnson, from Immigration Enforcement in Wales.
"We are happy to work with businesses to ensure the right pre-employment checks are carried out, but those intent on operating outside the law will be found and will be punished."
