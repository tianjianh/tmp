The 28-year-old has won two titles with Chiefs since joining the club in 2012.
Fitzgerald is Leicester's second signing this week, following the arrival of Peter Betham from Waratahs.
"He's a really good workhorse - he's probably a younger, slightly fitter version of Louis Deacon," Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"He makes a lot of tackles and does a lot of the graft but also he's a very good footballer as well.
"He catches passes really well, he runs with the ball and carries the ball really well and has played a lot at six.
"If you've played at six for the Chiefs, you're clearly a good player and a good footballer."
Leicester are fifth in the Premiership, three points behind Exeter Chiefs, who occupy the final play-off place with three games left.
