Lynette White: Civil action after failed police corruption trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A date has been set for High Court civil action following the collapse of the UK's biggest police corruption trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight former South Wales Police officers are suing the force after they were cleared of allegations relating to the investigation of Lynette White's murder in Cardiff in 1988.
The charges included perverting the course of justice and perjury.
But the 2011 case collapsed following a failure to disclose evidence.
Boxes of documents, which should have been shown to defence lawyers, could not be found.
An initial hearing will take place in July and the full court case is scheduled for October.
It is being brought by former chief inspectors Graham Mouncher and Richard Powell, Chf Supt Thomas Page and detectives Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood and John Seaford.
Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Anthony Paris, who became known as the "Cardiff Three", were jailed for life in 1990 after being convicted of the murder but their convictions were quashed on appeal in 1992 after judges were told they had been "fitted up" for the crime.
The real killer, Jeffrey Gafoor, was arrested in 2003 after a breakthrough in the DNA evidence.
South Wales Police said they were unable to comment due to ongoing litigation.
In February, the Home Secretary Theresa May announced that a QC, Richard Horwell, had been asked to investigate the lessons learned from the collapse of the corruption trial.
