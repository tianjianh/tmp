Robert Milkins was just relieved to progress to the televised stages of the UK Championship, despite a thumping 6-0 first-round win over Vinnie Calabrese.

The Gloucester potter said it was hard to judge his form after winning a scrappy match, littered with mistakes.
The 39-year-old told BBC Sport: "Vinnie really struggled. I am not going to go over the top on the result.
"At the start I was really struggling. I was too nervous as I have not had the best start to the season."
Milkins, a five-time ranking event semi-finalist, plays David Grace in the second round on Sunday.
"There was a lot of pressure on me," Milkins added. "But hopefully now I have won a match, I can kick on and start playing better.
"Vinnie made it easy for me. He is a much better player than that and a very dangerous player.
"I was expecting more but these things can happen. I have lost 6-0 and made it easy for my opponent. It worked out well for me.
"It's a great tournament and a great place and everyone loves playing here - and there is massive pressure to do well.
"Everyone wants to get the first one out of the way and get in to the tournament."
