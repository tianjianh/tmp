Archaeologists say the 10-month dig at Must Farm in Whittlesey has transformed their knowledge of Bronze Age Britain.
Evidence of fine fabric-making, varied diets and vast trading networks were found during the dig.
In the next few days, archaeologists will begin clearing the site and returning it to the quarry's owners.
The many finds from Must Farm will be moved to the Flag Fen Centre on the outskirts of Peterborough.
What the excavation has revealed:
Cambridge University archaeologist and outreach supervisor Selina Davenport said: "The site will be backfilled and returned to the quarry."
As to the artefacts being kept nearby, she said: "It's really important that it's staying as close as it can to where we found it and it's forming part of that Bronze Age story that Flag Fen already tells."
Analysis of wood used to build the settlement suggests it was only lived in for a short time before it was destroyed.
Despite this, archaeologists said the site gives an "exquisitely detailed" insight into everyday Bronze Age life.
