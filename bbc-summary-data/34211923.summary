Salford and former Great Britain prop Adrian Morley has announced that he will retire at the end of the season.

Morley is Super League's longest-serving player, having made 173 appearances in spells with four clubs.
He won the 2005 Super League title with Bradford and four Challenge Cups - one with Leeds and three with Warrington.
The 38-year-old, who won 30 caps for Great Britain and 23 caps for England, also had a six-year spell with NRL side Sydney Roosters from 2001 to 2006.
"When I look back on where I've been and what I've done I'll certainly be very satisfied and proud," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"There's been certainly lots of ups and downs in my career, but more ups than there are downs."
Morley, who will continue working for Salford as an ambassador, was the first player to win 50 international caps.
He reached the mark in the 2011 Four Nations final against Australia and made the last of his 53 international appearances in 2012.
At club level, he became one of English rugby league's finest exports during a successful spell with the Roosters, helping to end their 27-year wait to be NRL champions in 2002.
Later, he captained Warrington to Challenge Cup wins in 2009, 2010 and 2012, as well as Super League Grand Finals in 2012 and 2013.
