Bradbury, 21, made his debut against Leinster in October 2014 and signed his first professional contract with the club the following year.
The back-row forward made his Scotland debut in the 19-16 victory against Argentina at Murrayfield in November.
"I love Edinburgh and that is a huge reason for me to stay," Bradbury said.
"It's also great to have the opportunity to continue playing my rugby in Scotland as I look to build on my cap. Now, for me, it's about getting as many [caps] as I possibly can."
Edinburgh acting head coach Duncan Hodge told the club's website: "Magnus has worked very hard to get to this point, and his training ethic and determination to continue improving shines through every single day.
"He drives standards and is a great example to the other young players in the squad.
"Securing an asset such as Magnus is a real statement of intent going forward."
