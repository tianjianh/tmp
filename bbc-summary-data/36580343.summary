The left-back joined Rangers in 2011 from Hearts and was given the captaincy last season by manager Mark Warburton.
He led Rangers to a Championship and Challenge Cup double.
"These are hugely exciting times for the club and I'm delighted to be part of it for the next three years," said Wallace, who was entering the final year of his previous contract.
"I knew I was running into the last year," the 28-year-old told the club website.
"We were just starting the talks at the end of last season but we had big games to play in that period and I was happy to let it sail through the summer and into pre-season."
