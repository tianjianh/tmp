Aiden McGeady opened the scoring when he blasted in his first goal for Wednesday after beating Eric Lichaj.
The away side doubled their lead when Fernando Forestieri squared for Gary Hooper to score a simple finish.
Barry Bannan was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle, but Marco Matias latched onto Atdhe Nuhiu's flick-on to secure the win with a neat finish.
The Owls had collected three draws and two defeats in their previous games but Carlos Carvalhal's side were dangerous throughout and deserved their win.
Wednesday had not scored in their last three games but only Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries' string of important saves to deny Forestieri and Bannan kept it down to 1-0 at half-time, with a Jorge Grant header the closest the hosts came.
The win means Wednesday, who had looked to be slipping out of the play-off race prior to the game, stay sixth - a point ahead of seventh-placed Cardiff City.
Forest, meanwhile, who had a 13-game unbeaten run from November to February, have now lost five of their last six Championship games, conceding nine goals and scoring just two.
Nottingham Forest boss Dougie Freedman:
"We do have a lack of options. Sheffield Wednesday have paid Â£15m to turn themselves into a top-six side.
"If we had Oliveira, Lansbury, Assombalonga and Fryatt fit, we would see what would happen. But we did not.
"We are waiting for international clearance on Macheda as well, hopefully that will come through in time for him to play next week against Hull.
"Nelson will be out for at least six weeks with his groin injury. He might make it back for the final week or two, maybe. But we are probably looking at the rest of the season and that is very difficult to take."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"I do not want to waste one second talking about promotion. We must use our time to prepare for the next game, to control what we can control. Anything else is artificial.
"We try to win the next game, beyond that, we must not lose our focus and concentration. Winning our next game is within our control. That is the only thing we can control. So we will focus on that.
"We deserved the win and we deserved the goals, because we played good football and that is important. We won by playing good football. Our fans enjoy the way that we play and we are happy."
