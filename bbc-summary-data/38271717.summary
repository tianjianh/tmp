[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Forest 0-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Helder Costa and club-record signing Ivan Cavaleiro were on target as Wolves beat Nottingham Forest to earn their sixth Championship win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A match of few chances saw Wolves lead with their first decent opening when Costa fired the ball home from a tight angle five minutes before the break.
A lacklustre Forest struggled to respond in the second period.
And Cavaleiro's simple finish, after Ben Osborn lost possession in midfield, secured victory for the visitors.
The win, which is the second in six games under Paul Lambert, takes Wolves up to 18th place in the table.
The Molineux club are now five points clear of the relegation zone and just one point and one place behind Forest, who are winless in three matches.
An injury-hit Reds side are now just six points clear of the relegation zone.
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Nottngham:
"Too many players didn't give a good performance and if four or five players don't play at a good level then the team is weak.
"It was disappointing because it was a good opportunity for players to help the team, but they didn't perform well."
Wolves boss Paul Lambert told BBC WM:
"It is night and day from when I came in and that is no slight on anybody. I'm not going to say that we are going to do things great in a short space of time but if we can get progress, then that is the main thing.
"I thought we were excellent, full value and looked really composed.
"We have terrific attacking options, but we may need more personnel wise, but going forward I thought we were excellent."
