[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pep Guardiola's Manchester City have been backed emphatically to win the Premier League this season by BBC Sport users.

More than 80,000 people have predicted their final Premier League table this week in our special selector, with 78% putting City in top spot.
Chelsea and Arsenal are next, while Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool have been tipped to qualify for the Champions League.
Manchester United - who finished fifth last season - have been predicted to repeat that feat, with Burnley, Sunderland and Hull favoured for relegation.
Manchester City have won every game this season, so it is perhaps no surprise that BBC Sport users backed them so heavily to win the Premier League for the third time - and a fifth English title overall.
Liverpool and Manchester United were the only other teams tipped to finish top by more than 5%.
Middlesbrough received the fewest nominations for the title, just behind Swansea and Stoke.
Last year's winners Leicester were only the ninth-most popular choice to win the title, finishing eighth overall.
Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have been tipped to qualify for the Champions League - but 32% did think that Arsenal would miss out this time around.
Manchester United were predicted to finish fairly evenly between first and sixth but overall it's a fifth-placed finish and another season in the Europa League forecast for Jose Mourinho's side.
Everton have made a strong start to the season under Ronald Koeman but it has not been enough to persuade most users that they hold a serious Champions League challenge - it's seventh for them.
Burnley were the most popular choice for 20th place - with 35% of all users putting them dead last. In total, 72% chose the Clarets for a place in the bottom three and relegation.
Sunderland (64%) and Hull (45%) were the next most common choices for relegation, with Mike Phelan's fine start with the Tigers obviously not making enough of an impression.
Bournemouth are the side making the equivalent of a final-day escape, while West Ham have been predicted to end up bang in the middle in 10th.
