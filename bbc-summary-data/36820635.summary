The Senegal forward, 31, collapsed during a challenge with another player, with his left leg giving way beneath the knee as he fell down.
The incident happened while playing for Shanghai Shenhua in the derby against Shanghai SIPG on Sunday.
"It could end his professional career," said Shenhua coach Gregorio Manzano.
Former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea frontman Ba joined the Chinese side from Turkish club Besiktas for about Â£12m last July.
He is the division's top scorer with 14 goals in 18 games this season.
