Andy Rose: Coventry City fans deserve to see return to early-season form

Midfielder Andy Rose says the Coventry City fans "deserve" to see the players reproduce the form that lifted them to the top of the table in November over the last three games of the campaign.

The Sky Blues, who are six points off the top six after two wins in a row, still have a mathematical chance of making the League One play-offs.
"We'll be looking to give the fans what they deserve," said 26-year-old Rose.
"We need to give them a few more wins and we're looking forward to that."
Melbourne-born Rose came off the bench to score his first Coventry goal as he grabbed the winner in Tuesday's 1-0 victory over Bradford City to keep their promotion hopes alive.
Regardless of whether City can sneak into the play-offs, Rose wants a return to the kind of form that saw the Sky Blues go 11 games unbeaten earlier in the season.
"We need to live up to the success the team had earlier in the season," Rose told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"The fans haven't been getting enough of that, we need to make sure they go home happy.
"We'll really challenge for promotion next season but, six points out with three games to go, who's to say we can't do it - stranger things have happened."
