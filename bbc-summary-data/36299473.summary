Sheku Kanneh-Mason, a Year 12 pupil at the comprehensive Trinity Catholic School and the Royal Academy of Music, said winning was "a wonderful feeling".
Dobrinka Tabakova, chairman of the judges, paid tribute to his "sincere and moving performance".
The award, which is now in its 38th year, took place on Sunday at the Barbican, in London.
The competition is one of the most prestigious awards for amateur players.
The three finalists performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in front of a live audience, and were judged by a panel of experts.
Kanneh-Mason, who plays in the Chineke! Orchestra and the JRAM Symphony Orchestra, performed Shostakovich's Cello Concerto No. 1.
He said: "I'm so grateful for all the support from my family, the Junior Royal Academy of Music, my teacher Ben Davies and Chineke! that have helped me on this extraordinary journey."
Ms Tabakova said: "He was electric. There was something about the way he drew the audience in.
"In today's society, which seems to be swept by mediocrity, he shows how hard work, dedicated and talent can lift you out."
The other finalists were French Horn player Ben Goldscheider and saxophonist Jess Gillam.
Each of the finalists had made it through four stages to play at the Barbican, from regional auditions to semi-finals last week.
