Police said half a dozen houses had been targeted in Fetcham and Bookham over the last two weeks.
Det Insp Richard Haycock said it was believed the burglars used the nearby M25 as an escape route.
"We've got excellent road and travel links in the south east which make it very easy for criminals," he said.
"We are working with our colleagues across three or four counties to make sure we have a joined-up approach."
Cash, jewellery and electrical items have been stolen in the break-ins over the last four months at homes in Kent, Surrey, Sussex and south London.
Crowborough, Crawley, Haywards Heath, Horley, Redhill, Smallfield, Sevenoaks, Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone are among the towns targeted, along with the Bexley, Orpington and Croydon areas of London.
"We think these criminals are looking for houses that look unoccupied with lights out of an evening, bins left out, letters at the door," said Mr Haycock.
"We do think they are connected.
"We are using all of the data available to us to try and predict where these criminals are going to go next and try to get ahead of the game."
