[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side went close in the fourth minute when Tarique Fosu saw a shot cleared off the line by Matty Pearson.
But the U's took the lead three minutes later when Fosu picked out Drey Wright and he found the net with a fine low effort from 25 yards.
Colchester goalkeeper Sam Walker denied Pearson but both Wright and Richard Brindley came close to doubling the U's lead before half-time.
However, Accrington equalised just before the hour when Romy Boco ran from inside his own half and planted a low shot past Walker via a deflection after a home attack had broken down.
And Stanley scored the winner 10 minutes later through Kee, who tapped home from three yards after skipper Scott Brown had got clear in the area and picked him out.
Brown was sent off in stoppage time after receiving a second yellow card, but the visitors held out for victory.
