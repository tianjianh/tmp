A Birmingham club where a teenager took a "bad batch" of drugs and later died had a shortfall in security staff working on the night, a report says.

The Rainbow's event manual said 78 Security Industry Authority (SIA) staff would be on duty on New Year's Eve - but only 38 worked, a report stated.
Dylan Booth, 18, died after taking a class A pill at the club, said police.
Clubbers' mouths and long hair must be checked for drugs under new conditions imposed by Birmingham City Council.
The licence holder has 21 days to appeal against the changes. The BBC has approached the club's solicitors for comment.

West Midlands Police asked Birmingham City Council to review the Rainbow's two licences due to concerns over "serious crime and disorder".
The authority's licensing sub-committee met on Monday and modified the licences for the Rainbow on Lower Trinity Street and The Arena on Hack Street.
Councillor Barbara Dring said: "These reviews highlighted various concerns relating to the management of the premises, after a number of people who had attended the New Year's Eve event were hospitalised - one of whom died.
"Evidence from West Midlands Police officers revealed the interim steps imposed by this committee on 14 January have proved successful and were seen to be having a positive impact, in particular tougher search protocols and the use of covert security, at The Rainbow venues."
As part of the review, the committee was shown photographs of drugs seized or surrendered at events held at the Rainbow on 5 April and 16 November 2015.
A new drugs policy and undercover SIA staff will be introduced at both venues under the licence conditions.
Random searches will be carried out on shoes, socks, belts and bags.
Staff will be drugs-trained by police and signs will go up warning of the club's zero-tolerance drugs policy.
PC Ben Reader said he had conducted checks at the nightclub since Mr Booth's death.
He said: "I believe each of the interim steps have had a positive impact on the way that the venue has operated in 2016."
