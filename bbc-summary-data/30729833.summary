The film made in the Ceiriog Valley aims to spread the message about their importance in pollinating plants.
Beekeeper Kirsty Williams, who has 50 hives and has been producing honey for 30 years, premiered the film to pupils at her village school, Ysgol Pontfadog.
Her free DVD has been sent to 150 primary schools across the region.
She received funding from economic development company Menter a Busnes as part of its Bee Co-operation Project to promote beekeeping and bee habitats in north Wales following their decline.
