West Brom boss Tony Pulis has criticised Saido Berahino for lacking respect and being "immature" but says he sympathises with the striker, who is available for selection on Saturday.

Berahino had said he would not play after a move to Tottenham was blocked.
Spurs had four bids rejected for the 22-year-old, who has been left out of the team for the past three matches.
"Saido is immature at times but I'm more concerned with getting him back playing," Pulis told BBC WM.
"The fact that he wants to play for a top team, I wish most of the players here would have those expectations and ambitions.
"The problem Saido has is in the way he's gone around it. He's not shown the respect to people around this club that he should have.
"It's unfortunate that Saido's been exploited by a system I've said I don't like and I think it should be changed."
West Brom play Southampton at home in a 15:00 BST kick-off, with Pulis' side 15th in the Premier League table with four points from their first four matches.
