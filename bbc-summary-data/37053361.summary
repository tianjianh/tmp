The 22-year-old, who has won seven caps for Wales but was not part of the Euro 2016 squad, signs for an undisclosed fee from Championship rivals Wigan.
"I'm chuffed to be back in South Wales and really happy to join a big club like Cardiff," said Huws, who spent last season on loan at Huddersfield.
"I know most of the coaching staff from Wales, and can't wait to join up with the boys now and get started."
Llanelli-born Huws left Swansea City as a youngster and started his professional career at Manchester City, where he made one first team appearance.
He joined Wigan Athletic in July 2014 but has failed to secure a regular first team spot.
City manager Paul Trollope is keen to add to his squad before the transfer window closes at the end of the month with a striker now the priority.
"We are still looking in other areas as well, we know what we need and why we need them," Trollope added.
"We are aware of where we need to improve."
Trollope said midfielder Stuart O'Keefe suffered a suspected broken arm in Cardiff's 1-0 defeat to Bristol Rovers in the EFL Cup first round while the Bluebirds have also confirmed the departure of defender Fabio.
