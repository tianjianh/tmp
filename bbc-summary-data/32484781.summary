[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sixth-form college beset with financial problems has told students it is scrapping A-Level courses.

Totton College, in Hampshire, has been trying to secure a merger with a partner organisation to help tackle its "growing financial challenges".
About 90 pupils have been affected and are being helped to find alternative places from September.
The college said demand for A-Levels had fallen but it would continue to offer vocational courses, such as BTEC.
Acting principal Jo Landles said the decision had been taken "with great regret".
She said: "We believe that by making a clear decision now, we are giving prospective students sufficient time to consider their options and we are working closely with other providers to minimise disruption for the students involved."
The college, on the outskirts of Southampton, has been looking for a potential partner since Eastleigh College ended take-over negotiations last month.
A statement said: "The college continues to seek a partner for a merger that works in the best interests of its students and the local community.
"The college's board of governors is continuing its discussions with a potential partner. Meeting students' needs will absolutely be at the heart of any decisions and we are still actively recruiting for new learners to start in September 2015."
Totton College is funded by central government's Education Funding Agency.
