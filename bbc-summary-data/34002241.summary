Jonathan Ollivier died ahead of the final show of Matthew Bourne's production of The Car Man at London's Sadler's Wells Theatre on August 9.
Bourne's New Adventures company is now proposing a project for youngsters in Northampton as a "positive legacy".
A spokesman said it "wanted to create more stories like his" in the town.
Ollivier, 38, started dancing as a boy in Northampton and began his professional career at Cape Town City Ballet, also dancing for companies including the Northern Ballet Theatre and the Alberta Ballet Company in Canada.
He worked on a number of roles with New Adventures including The Swan in Swan Lake and, on his death, was described by Bourne as an "irreplaceable artist".
The proposal is being steered by Re:Bourne, the company's charitable-arm, which works with young people from all backgrounds and encourages those who may not have access to the arts to get involved with its work.
Director James Mackenzie-Blackman said he had met with the Ollivier family who were "really thrilled" the company wanted to initiate a project in his hometown.
"Jonny discovered dance unexpectedly - we want to create more stories like that in Northampton and if we can do that, it will be a very positive legacy," he said.
"It's in the very early stages but we hope to go into communities were there is either poor uptake of arts or difficulty accessing them.
"What's really struck us in the past week and a half is how many young dancers - especially male dancers - have been inspired to dance by Jonny. That's really touched us and we would like to see if we can replicate some of those values in his hometown."
The Ollivier family have set-up a fundraising page in memory of the dancer with all donations being split equally between Re:Bourne and the London Air Ambulance.
