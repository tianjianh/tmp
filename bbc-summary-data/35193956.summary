A conservation charity has said a cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley felled for the second time in just over two months will not be reinstated.

The artwork at Clavell Tower, Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset, was hit by a boulder and cut off at the ankles in stormy weather.
The life-size figure was created to mark 50 years of UK building conservation charity Landmark Trust.
The charity said it was likely to be the "end of the road" for the work.
A spokeswoman said: "On Christmas Eve the Gormley sculpture at Kimmeridge Bay again succumbed to persistent heavy seas, this time presumably hit by a boulder hurled off the beach by the force of the storm.
"We are taking steps to recover the work imminently.
"It was always intended to have a relationship with the landscape and nature.
"Its position on this exposed stretch of Kimmeridge Bay has certainly brought that dynamic to the fore."
The trust said it did not yet know where the installation would be moved to, but that the "most important thing is removing it safely, given the weather, location, tide times, and holiday season".
John Bickerton, owner of Lulworth House B&B, found the statue during a walk with his family on Saturday.
He said: "We were sprinkling my mother's ashes on the far side of the bay before going round to take a family picture with the sculpture.
"We quickly realised it wasn't standing and when we got there could see it had sheared off at its thinnest point - the ankles. This time it looks like it might be fatal."
Sir Antony said he was "thrilled" when the sculpture toppled into the sea in September, calling it proof of its "dynamic relationship" with nature.
