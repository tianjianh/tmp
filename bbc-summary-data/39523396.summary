[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 0-0 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham extended their unbeaten run to three games with a well-deserved 0-0 draw at Crawley in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Robins, clawing their way clear of danger towards the foot of the table, were twice thwarted by the woodwork.
Crawley were forced into a late change when striker Matt Harrold, set to make his first start since August 22, was injured in the warm-up and Dean Cox was promoted from the bench.
Rhys Murphy, leading the Reds' attack, should have done better when put through by skipper Jimmy Smith on 17 minutes but keeper Scott Brown made a smothering save.
Harry Pell threatened for Cheltenham early on when he had a shot saved by keeper Glenn Morris following a pass by Danny Wright.
Pell went close again just before the break when he headed a Liam Davis cross just wide.
Pell looked set to score moments after the interval when a strong run took him into a good position but his low shot was parried by keeper Morris and cleared off the line.
Crawley lived dangerously with Dan Holman going close twice before seeing his fierce drive rebound off the inside of a post.
Kyle Storer also struck the woodwork late on for the Robins as Crawley, now with only one win from their last 10 games, hung on.
