Fleetwood Town 0-0 Bradford City (agg: 0-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford City booked their place in the League One play-off final after a goalless draw at Fleetwood saw them win through 1-0 on aggregate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bantams striker Charlie Wyke headed Mark Marshall's cross on to the post from two yards in the first half.
Ashley Hunter and Bobby Grant nodded straight at City keeper Colin Doyle as the hosts struggled to create chances.
Bradford will now face Millwall at Wembley on 20 May after the Lions won 3-2 at Scunthorpe.
Marshall, Bradford's player of the season, almost scored with a fortuitous first-half ricochet as he chased down a long ball through the middle. He was beaten to the ball by Fleetwood keeper Cairns but his clearance catapulted off Marshall and grazed the bar.
Fleetwood showed more urgency after the break but City centre-backs Rory McArdle and Nathaniel Knight-Percival dealt with everything thrown at them.
Billy Clarke screwed one shot high and one wide while Marshall tested home keeper Alex Cairns with a near-post effort as Bradford enjoyed the majority of possession and comfortably held on.
Bradford City boss Stuart McCall told Sky Sports:
"I'm proud of that bunch in there. I'm proud that the supporters have another trip to Wembley to look forward to too.
"They've been a credit and, over the two games, I think we deserved to go through.
"At the beginning of the season when we started I think people were expecting lower half of the table.
"We've had a couple of tasty battles with Millwall this season and we'll look forward to another."
Fleetwood boss Uwe Rosler told Sky Sports:
"Congratulations to Stuart and Bradford City, they have been a bit better than us. I think it was just two games too many for us.
"The disappointment of this should not take away the achievements of this season.
"We had a lot of injuries at the end of the season and we couldn't rotate so we had to play basically the same team in every game and you could see that today.
"We move on but I think this was a great experience for the players and the football club. We will be better for this I am sure."
