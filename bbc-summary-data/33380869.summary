[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children have been warned of dangers of playing in weirs after some were spotted putting themselves in danger.

They had been seen at weirs mostly in the past 10 days, West Midlands Search and Rescue (WMSAR) said.
It issued the warning about weirs at Shrewsbury, Powick in Worcestershire and Gullet Quarry near Ledbury, Herefordshire, where two people died in a week in 2013.
The voluntary rescue team put out a photo from Shrewsbury as a warning.
Playing in weirs "might seem like good fun but it's dangerous", it stated.
Water incident manager and rescue boat operator Ben Allen said: "It's not necessarily related to the hot weather, but children are out now it's the summer.
"The problem is going to get worse over the summer holidays."
Mr Allen described the bottom of any weir as "a bit like a washing machine".
He said: "If you go into that [Shrewsbury] weir, it will keep tumbling you around. You will get completely disorientated, you will be trapped and unfortunately it's not usually a good outcome when somebody does get trapped on those weirs.
"You've got lots of dangers where you've got a stopping wall. Basically the idea of it is to stop debris, so if you fall in that, it's going to do exactly the same to you."
The rescue team serves Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
