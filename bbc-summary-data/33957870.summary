John Puttick Associates was picked as the winning bid from an anonymous shortlist of five entries.
Lancashire County Council wanted a design for a "vibrant public space" and new youth zone while preserving its unique "brutalist" architecture.
The site, which was under threat from demolition, was given Grade II listed status in 2013.
Jennifer Mein (Labour), leader of Lancashire County Council, said: "We always knew that the bus station had a global appeal, and the fact that the winning firm comes from New York reinforces this.
"We're delighted that a strong design has been chosen for the new Youth Zone Plus and we'll now be working hard to get it built."
The design competition was run by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), on behalf of Lancashire County Council and Preston Youth Zone.
Mr Puttick said his company was delighted at winning the bid, adding: "We hope to play a game of football on the roof once the project is complete."
He also said: "The three components of the project - the revitalisation of the modernist bus station, the new OnSide Youth Zone, and a large outdoor public space - offer a rich mixture of uses and the challenge of sensitively introducing contemporary design to the existing setting."
Previously, Mr Puttick has overseen a number of major schemes in China,  major office development in London and also worked on Barcelona's City of Justice.
