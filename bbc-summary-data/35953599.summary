World Men's Curling: Scotland round off failed bid with a win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland rounded off their round-robin matches at the World Men's Curling Championship in Basel with a 6-4 win over Sweden.

However, Tom Brewster's rink had already had their slim hopes of reaching the play-offs dashed with an extra-end 7-6 defeat by Denmark.
Brewster, Hammy McMillan, Ross Paterson and Glen Muirhead won five matches and lost six, finishing seventh.
Hosts Canada, Denmark, Japan and the USA progress to the play-offs.
Brewster said after the win over Sweden: "It's always great to beat a world champion.
"However, we went in there not even thinking about them being world champions but thinking about them being the great team that they are, and knowing that it's always a tough game against them."
