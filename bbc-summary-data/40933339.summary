Chris Froome eyes Vuelta a Espana win: Stage-by-stage guide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome is aiming to become only the third man to win the Vuelta a Espana in the same year as the Tour de France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The four-time Tour winner has finished runner-up three times at the Vuelta and says he has "unfinished business".
Only French greats Jacques Anquetil (1963) and Bernard Hinault (1978) have won both races in the same year.
This year's Vuelta covers more than 3,300km (2,050 miles) over 21 stages and features nine summit finishes, including the feared Angliru.
The 72nd edition of the race started in Nimes - just the third time it has begun outside of Spain.
Winner: BMC Racing
Report: Team Sky finish fourth on first stage
Chris Froome makes a solid start to his quest to become the first rider in almost 40 years to complete the Tour de France-Vuelta a Espana double. The Briton's Team Sky squad finish fourth but crucially he beats all his rivals for the overall victory. BMC Racing's Rohan Dennis will wear the race leader's red jersey after crossing the line first in the winning team.
Winner: Yves Lampaert (Bel/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Lampaert wins stage two to take Vuelta lead
A flat stage that looked on paper set to end in a bunch sprint had a surprise winner as Yves Lampaert capitalised on expert work from his Quick-Step team in the crosswinds late on to break away, win the stage and take the leader's red jersey. The race largely stayed together until the high winds in the final 10km, with the decisive splits occurring 2km from the finish. Chris Froome missed the first split, losing eight seconds to rival Vincenzo Nibali, but gained five more seconds on Alberto Contador and Romain Bardet.
Winner: Vincenzo Nibali (Ita/Bahrain-Merida)
Report: Froome takes Vuelta lead after stage three
Chris Froome became the new leader of the Vuelta a Espana on Monday after finishing third in the mountainous stage three as Italian Vincenzo Nibali snatched the stage win in the final 400m of the race in the Pyrenees in Andorra.
Winner: Matteo Trentin (Ita/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Trentin wins stage four as Froome retains lead
The peloton left Andorra on a largely flat route, ending in the first stage finish in Spain of this year's race. Stephane Rossetto and Diego Rubio attacked the early break with 70km remaining but were caught inside the final 10km. Matteo Trentin won the bunch sprint - he has now won a stage in all three Grand Tours - while Britain's Chris Froome retained the leader's red jersey.
Winner: Alexey Lutsenko (Kaz/Astana)
Report: Froome extends lead as Lutsenko wins
Leader Chris Froome says he learned "a lot about his rivals" as he improved his advantage over the rest of the field. Lutsenko's biggest victory of his career came after he went off the front of a breakaway group and kept the chasers at bay.
Winner: Tomasz Marczynski (Pol/Lotto-Soudal)
Report: Froome extends overall lead by one second
Another day for the breakaway and Poland's Tomasz Marczynski claims his first Grand Tour stage winning the three-man sprint for the line. Tejan van Garderen, Chris Froome's nearest rival before the stage, crashes twice to lose time as Esteban Chaves moves up to second overall.
Winner: Matej Mohoric (Slo/UAE Team Emirates)
Report: Froome maintains 11-second lead
Matej Mohoric, 22, produced a stunning finish, breaking clear 10km from the finish line to win his first Grand Tour stage. There was little change in the general classification with Chris Froome finishing safely in the bunch alongside his rivals to maintain his slender advantage.
Winner: Julian Alaphilippe (Fra/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Froome attacks rivals to extend lead
Chris Froome attacks his rivals late in the day on a testing climb prior to a steep descent to the finish line to extend his lead to 28 seconds over Esteban Chaves. France's Julian Alaphilippe took victory on the 199km stage eight.
Winner: Chris Froome (Team Sky/GB)
Report: Froome wins stage to further extend race lead
Chris Froome attacks 500m from the finish on an uphill drag to take his first stage win of this year's race and move a few more seconds clear of his general classification rivals. The Briton now leads Colombia's Esteban Chaves by 36 seconds after delivering another psychological blow to those chasing the overall victory.
Monday, 28 August - rest day, Provincia de Alicante
Winner: Matteo Trentin (Quick-Step Floors/Ita)
Report: Froome retains Vuelta lead as Trentin wins stage
Italian rider Matteo Trentin pulls clear of a 15-man breakaway to beat Jose Joaquin Rojas and Jaime Roson Garcia to the line and claim his second stage victory of the race. Britain's Chris Froome retains his overall lead, with Ireland's Nicolas Roche moving into a share of second place with Colombian Esteban Chaves.
The stage: While the breakaway riders will no doubt be excited about the possibility of an attack going all the way to the finish, expect those chasing overall victory to reel them in on the final climb. The race has reached its midway point and those hoping to stand on the top step in Madrid will need to start clawing back any time they may have lost so far.
Rider to watch: Esteban Chaves- he cannot afford to lose any more time to Chris Froome and knows he needs to get ahead of him, particularly with an individual time trial to come, when he will lose more time to the Briton.
The stage: Another day with the potential for a breakaway to succeed. Neither climb is serious enough to create gaps in the general classification but both are well placed for attacks to stick.
Rider to watch: Adam Hansen - the Australian is riding in a record 19th successive Grand Tour - he has finished each of the previous 18. The Lotto-Soudal rider was not in his team's initial squad but was drafted in after an injury to Rafael Valls. He is a breakaway specialist and may fancy repaying his team's faith.
The stage: A break. A catch. A sprint. On paper. The general classification riders will be hoping the day is that simple as they try to shelter in the peloton, preserving energy, for the bigger battles to come.
Rider to watch: Sacha Modolo - the Italian comes into the race in decent form, having won stage two at the Tour of Poland in late July.
The stage: The first hors categorie climb of this year's Vuelta could shake up the general classification but will those riders also be fighting it out for the stage win? Much will depend on the state of the race and the time gaps of the leading contenders.
Rider to watch: Fabio Aru - the Italian won the Vuelta in 2015 and if he harbours hopes of repeating that win he will need a strong showing in the Sierra mountains.
The stage: The biggest day in the mountains so far as the Vuelta reaches its roof. The final two climbs basically morph into one monster of around 30km. Who will show their hand first? A rest day follows so there are no excuses for not leaving everything out on the road.
Rider to watch: Romain Bardet - according to Strava, the Frenchman holds the record for the quickest ascent at a little over 96 minutes. However, the AG2R rider, who finished third at the Tour de France, is tackling a second Grand Tour in the same year for the first time. With a 40km individual time trial coming up after the rest day - his weak spot - he knows he needs to be ahead after today if he hopes to win the title.
Monday, 4 September - rest day, Logrono
The stage: Following an 800km rest-day transfer from the south of Spain to the north, the riders must tackle the only individual race against the clock in the Vuelta. There's nothing too tricky here but the time gaps could well be significant between those that can time trial and those that cannot.
Rider to watch: Ilnur Zakarin - the Russian time trial champion is making his Vuelta debut. He was fifth at the Giro d'Italia in May and could claw back time on the better climbers. Today's stage will also give Chris Froome an excellent chance to either catch up if he's lagging, or extend his advantage if leading.
The stage: After a relatively quiet first half, the stage explodes into life on the descent from Portillo de Lunada. The final ascent is the shortest of the day but deserving of its hors categorie status with gradients of 31% near the bottom, 15% in the middle and 12.5% at the top. The concrete-paved road has gaps every foot or so to help cars gain traction in wet or icy conditions. They are not likely to help cyclists though. Any rider having an off day will lose significant amounts of time.
Rider to watch: Adam Yates - he has a best Grand Tour finish of fourth at the 2016 Tour de France, in the process becoming the first British rider to win the best young rider jersey (a feat matched by his twin brother Simon this year). He is an expert climber and will need to be on a good day if hopes to make the podium in Madrid.
The stage: After the exertions of the previous day, the general classification riders may well take it easy and allow the breakaway specialists their fun. That's not to say they won't be keeping tabs on each other on another punchy finish. Crucial seconds could still be won or lost on the final 3.2km ascent.
Rider to watch: David de la Cruz - the Spaniard won a similar finish on stage nine to take the race lead last year, on his way to seventh overall. That victory will have earned him respect within the peloton though and he may not be allowed the freedom again.
The stage: The general classification riders will undoubtedly have one eye on the stage that follows this and that will mean another day where the breakaway could stay clear. However, they will be watching each other on the final climb and descent to make sure nobody tries to sneak clear.
Rider to watch: Thomas de Gendt - chances are the Belgian will already have been on the attack several times during the race but this stage looks tailor-made for his aggressive style of riding.
The stage: The finishing ascent of the Angliru has only featured in the Vuelta six previous times but has already reached legendary status. It is where Bradley Wiggins lost the race leader's red jersey in 2011 to Juan Jose Cobo, who would go on to win the race - Wiggins would finish third overall, behind then Team Sky team-mate Chris Froome who recorded the first of his three runners-up spots. In 2002, fellow Briton David Millar's protest led to his disqualification from the race.
The 13.2km climb has an average gradient of around 10% with sections at 24%. Alberto Contador won here in 2008 on his way to overall victory. The race could well be won, or lost, on the penultimate stage of the race.
Rider to watch: Chris Froome - will the Briton become the third rider to win the Tour-Vuelta double in the same year? Jacques Anquetil (1963) and Bernard Hinault (1978) are the only others to accomplish the feat, although before 1995, the Vuelta preceded the Tour. We will know by the end of the stage with Sunday's finish in Madrid largely processional.
The stage: Tradition dictates the leader of the race will not be challenged as the peloton reaches Madrid for nine circuits of the Spanish capital and a bunch sprint finish.
Rider to watch: Alberto Contador - the seven-time Grand Tour winner is retiring after the race. He is one of only six riders to win all three Grand Tours and he is sure to be given a warm welcome as the race reaches its conclusion.
