[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ebbw Vale Sports Centre has been forced to close as the building flooded following the incident at about 11:00 GMT on Saturday.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had dealt with "severe flooding", which had affected half of the building. Nobody was injured.
It follows a Met Office yellow "be aware" warning for rain and wind.
The warning, issued on Friday, remains in place until 22:00 on Saturday.
Natural Resources Wales has  issued two flood warnings - for the River Ely at Peterston-Super-Ely and Ebbw Fawr at Cwm - while 15 flood alerts are in place.
The heavy rain and strong winds have also led to disruption on rail services, and restrictions on the M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire.
Arriva Trains Wales services between Newport and Hereford were suspended for a time due to track flooding at Abergavenny, with one hour delays still being experienced on Saturday afternoon.
There have also been delays and cancellations on Valley Lines services between Mountain Ash and Aberdare in the Cynon Valley.
The Severn Bridge was closed eastbound, and closed to high-sided vehicles westbound. Speed restrictions are also in place on the Britannia Bridge from Anglesey in north Wales.
Irish Ferries have also cancelled fast-ferry services from Holyhead to Dublin.
