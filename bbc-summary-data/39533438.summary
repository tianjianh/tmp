The Brazil international, 24, had to be replaced during last Sunday's 4-1 La Liga win at Granada.
It is a setback for Barca, who are aiming for a Spanish league, Champions League and Copa del Rey treble.
Rafinha has made 28 appearances for the Nou Camp side this season, including 18 in La Liga where he has scored six goals.
"Rafinha has had an arthroscopy in the right knee to solve an injury in the internal meniscus," a Barca statement said.
"The player will be out for around four months."
Rafinha, who came through Barcelona's academy, has won two La Liga titles and the Champions League with the club.
