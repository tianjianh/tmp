[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the Old Bailey, Junior Henry, of Weltje Road, Hammersmith, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years youth detention.
The incident took place on Ladbroke Grove, at its junction with Oxford Gardens, on 29 August.
The victim, aged 20, was stabbed in the abdomen and hand during the attack on Ladbroke Grove.
The Old Bailey heard how Henry had been given a chance to turn his life around when he was given a community order following a gang fight when he was 12 in which a man was murdered.
The Recorder of London Judge Peter Beaumont said: "You left this court with my warning ringing in your ears that your behaviour was challenging the boundaries of the order, as well as testing the patience and understanding of the court.
"You did not heed the warning. You took up a knife in circumstances where you, of all people, did not have to use it and you knew the consequences of doing so."
The judge lifted an order banning publication of Henry's identity.
