[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are hunting a woman after the "frightening" attempted abduction of an eight-year-old girl in Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl was riding her bike in Owen Road, Newbury, when she was "grabbed" on the arm by a woman from a car that had pulled up beside her at 17:00 BST on Tuesday, police said.
The woman told the victim to get into the vehicle but she managed to escape and cycle off.
She is thought to be in her 40s or 50s, and of medium build.
She was wearing a white knitted jumper and skinny light blue jeans, and was driving a black, four-door vehicle with blacked-out windows.
Det Insp Jonathan Groenen said: "This was a frightening experience for the victim, who has understandably been left shaken by the incident."
He also described it as "extremely rare" and said extra police patrols were being carried out in the area.
