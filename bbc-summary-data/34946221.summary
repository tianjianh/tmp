Confidence among shoppers in Germany has dipped according to a survey, amid worries over Europe's largest economy.

The forward-looking GfK consumer sentiment indicator fell to 9.3 points for December from 9.4 points in the previous month.
The score is the lowest since February, but was above analysts' predictions.
Confidence in the economy among German consumers dropped for the sixth consecutive month, although the pace reduced.
Concern about the labour market led the way, according to the survey of 2,000 shoppers, with 69% of all those surveyed expecting an increase in unemployment due to the influx of asylum seekers this year.
This month's survey was conducted before the attacks in Paris on 13 November.
In contrast to general sentiment, optimism for making a big purchase improved, with the sub-index for willingness to buy climbing by three points to 48.9.
GfK analyst Rolf Buerkl said he was optimistic for this year's Christmas sales, as customers might be tempted to shop online if they are concerned for public safety.
"It is possible that a few people here and there will avoid going to the Christmas market or visiting a shopping mall," Mr Buerkl said.
