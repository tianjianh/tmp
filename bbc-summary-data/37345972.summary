[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 0-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe moved two points clear at the top of League One following a goalless draw with Charlton at Glanford Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a quiet opening, Iron's leading scorer Josh Morris was not too far away with an effort that fizzed just wide, and minutes later he brought a low save out of Declan Rudd.
The Addicks finally created an opening just shy of the half-hour mark when Chris Solly's cross was met by a diving Fredrik Ulvestad, but the Norwegian's header spun narrowly wide.
After the break, Ademola Lookman should have done better when he ran at the retreating Scunthorpe backline only to shoot tamely off target when getting a sight of goal.
Kevin van Veen, a virtual spectator for 80 minutes, crashed a shot just wide for the hosts as he managed to get a toe to a loose ball in the box.
Charlton brought on substitute Jordan Botaka for the last seven minutes and he should have scored, but he thumped Lookman's cross well over.
Addicks defender Jason Pearce made a terrific block to deny Iron sub Hakeeb Adelakun, before Morris hit a shot straight at Rudd.
And right at the death, Johnnie Jackson struck a terrific free-kick, only to see the ball crash off Luke Daniels' left-hand post and go behind.
