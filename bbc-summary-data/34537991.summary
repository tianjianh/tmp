Middlewich land to be set aside for new station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Land for a new railway station in Cheshire is being earmarked by a council following a campaign.

Middlewich station closed 55 years ago, leaving the Sandbach to Northwich line as freight only.
Campaigners claim reopening the passenger service would "link communities in Cheshire back together".
Cheshire East Council will begin consulting on which area to allocate a new station. Network Rail said a "solid business case" was needed.
Middlewich railway station closed to passengers in 1960 and was subsequently demolished.
The 8.5 mile (16.7 km) line remained open for freight services.
In 1999, a council-backed feasibility study estimated 750 passengers per day would use the route and claimed the cost of reopening it could range from Â£970,000 to Â£2.2m.
Samantha Moss, from the Middlewich Rail Link Campaign, said: "Our train line is there, it's a viable train line.
"If people all over Cheshire got to use it, the benefits it would see to the education of our children and the economic community would be huge."
Cheshire East Council said it "supports the aspiration" of reopening the line but warned "as the line is a freight line, a new station is not straight forward".
The Department for Transport said: "We are aware of the aspirations to open up the Middlewich freight line to regular passenger services and build a station at Middlewich.
"We would look to local authorities in Cheshire and the rail industry to judge whether there is a business case for reopening the route."
The council is launching the consultation as part of its future Local Plan so the area can be protected from planning applications for other developments.
