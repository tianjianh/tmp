The horse, named Honey, had its ear cut off in the attack in a field in Potters Lane, Syston, Leicestershire, on 7 September.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said it was "imperative" those responsible were caught.
The animal rights organisation is offering a Â£2,000 reward.
Peta spokesperson Elisa Allen said: "Animal abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on whoever is available to them, human or non-human, and must be caught before they act again."
Honey's owner Claire Watts described the attack on her two-year-old horse as "horrific" and is warning other owners to be vigilant.
The RSPCA said: "This is a particularly distressing incident where a horse has been killed after enduring a vicious attack."
Three other horses in the same field were unhurt.
