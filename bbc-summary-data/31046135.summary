More than 30 staff will lose their jobs when the Mount Murray Hotel and Country Club in Santon closes after 20 years on 6 February.
Managing Director David Lyons said all staff were informed on Thursday.
The Mount Murray was developed by island-based tycoon Albert Gubay in the 1990s.
According to Mr Lyons the golf club will remain open for business but the hotel and leisure club will close.
A hotel spokeswoman said anyone with gym memberships will be refunded and those who have booked wedding functions will be contacted to discuss "alternative arrangements".
The November 2013 fire caused millions of pounds worth of damage.
A witness living on the Mount Murray estate said: "It went up like an inferno."
Mr Lyons said "given the protracted negotiations with insurers lasting over a year and the prospect of a further year at Arbitration the company was forced to agree a settlement."
He said increasing energy costs were a further nail in the coffin - which proved "crippling" for the business.
