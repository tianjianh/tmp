The crash happened just after 19:00 BST on Thursday in Christchurch, Dorset, and involved a grey Volkswagen Polo.
The cyclist, a local man, was taken to Royal Bournemouth Hospital where he died from his injuries.
The driver of the car, a 53-year-old Christchurch woman, was uninjured. The scene of the crash in Barrack Road was closed for several hours while police investigated.
Christchurch cycling campaigner Adrian Bowden has called for a lane to segregate cyclists from traffic following the crash.
Mr Bowden had previously launched a petition for segregated cycle lanes in Barrack Road.
He said: "Obviously, it's an incredibly sad situation. There's a family somewhere coming to terms with the loss of a loved one.
"This is one of the busiest roads in Christchurch, in fact it's one of the busiest roads in Dorset with one of the highest accident rates in Dorset."
Councillor Peter Finney, Dorset County Council cabinet member for environment, infrastructure and highways, said the authority was "deeply saddened" by the cyclist's death but added: "It would not be appropriate for us to comment on this specific case while we await the outcome of an investigation."
"The county council is committed to supporting improvements to all modes of transport that promote people's safety, health, independence and prosperity across Dorset," he added.
