Introverts: These emojis have been designed just for you

It's important for introverts to have time to themselves to unwind and recharge.

But friends of introverts, especially if they are extroverts, can find it difficult to understand the need for this "me time" which is often spent alone or at home.
So designer Rebecca Evie Lynch has come up with a new range of emojis to help introverts communicate their feelings.
Called "introjis", the images include actions such as reading and gaming.
They also describe some social activities or situations, such as a person feeling anxious in a group or feeling out of sync with other people.
Rebecca has told Co Create that she first came up with the idea after a relationship ended.
"My boyfriend of three years broke up with me, citing the need for more time alone," she said.
"I was surprised, as I've always considered myself an introvert, too, but I realized that my enthusiasm about being in a relationship sometimes overshadows my ability to read others' signals."
Some of the emojis are also designed to be used by extroverts who want to talk with an introverted person.
"Introverts tend to find the company of others draining," explained Rebecca.
The system is designed so that the "activity" emojis - which are green and blue in colour - can be combined with a "no company" one - coloured red and yellow.
Rebecca says this will hopefully make it a bit easier to answer the question "Can I come and be social with you now?"
Some people can mistake introversion for signs of mental health problems, such as depression.
"While introversion and depression are entirely different thingsâ€”introversion is decidedly not a disorderâ€”the need to be alone can often be mistaken for depression by others. Having these complex, distinctive emotional states represented in the toolkit can hopefully help clarify the difference," Lynch said.
The designer is hoping to make her emojis into a free app and is currently working through prototypes on her Facebook page, where she is also asking for people to submit ideas.
