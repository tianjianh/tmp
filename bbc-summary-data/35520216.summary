[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champions Juventus moved top of Serie A for the first time this season as Simone Zaza's late strike saw off previous leaders Napoli in Turin.

Napoli looked set to maintain their two-point lead until substitute Zaza's deflected 18-yard shot flew past away keeper Pepe Reina.
Juve, who are bidding for a fifth straight Scudetto, have now won 15 successive league games.
Napoli barely tested Gianluigi Buffon as their eight-match winning run ended.
Relive Juve's dramatic win over their Serie A title rivals
The visitors came closest to threatening when Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci's vital interception stopped Serie A's top scorer Gonzalo Higuain from making contact with a dangerous right-wing cross.
Argentina international Higuain had scored 24 goals in his previous 24 league matches, helping Napoli become the league's most prolific attack.
But, despite playing confidently and refusing to sit back, the visitors could not break down a Juventus defence that has only conceded 15 goals this season.
Zaza was introduced for Spain striker Alvaro Morata shortly before the hour mark, eventually making the decisive impact to spark joyous celebrations among the home players and supporters.
"I hope it's a decisive goal as far as the title race is concerned," said 24-year-old Italy international Zaza. "The good thing is it's now in our hands."
