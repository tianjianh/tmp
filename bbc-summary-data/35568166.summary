"We were certainly punished. They were very dangerous on the break and I think we had more of the ball, but then give it away in some bad areas.
"The first two goals were an inability to defend a set piece and a ball in the box. They were pretty lethal in their attacks.
"In the end, what happens in both boxes determines games of football and certainly Halifax were very clinical and we were perhaps a bit toothless.
"We did have our opportunities to score and when you're behind in the game you need to take them."
