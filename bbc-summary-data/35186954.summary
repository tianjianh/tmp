Geraint Rowland, 26, of Morriston, was struck by a Ford Transit van on the A4067 near the Wychtree roundabout, at about 03:00 GMT on Saturday.
He and his partner Cara Gregory became parents to a baby boy, Gunnarr, a month ago.
In a tribute, Ms Gregory said the call centre worker's death would leave a huge void.
A statement from her read: "Geraint was a much respected, cherished and fun loving partner and new father.
"I cannot believe this has happened and it will leave a huge void in the lives of me and our baby son."
