Brussels will stay on the highest level of terror alert because of the "serious and imminent" threat of Paris-style attacks, Belgium's prime minister says.

Charles Michel added that universities, schools and the metro would remain closed on Monday.
Brussels has been on lockdown all weekend, amid a manhunt for suspected Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam.
Islamic State militants, some of whom were from Brussels, killed 130 people in Paris on 13 November.

Police in France have issued a fresh appeal to identify one of the Paris attackers, who was killed at the national stadium.
Mr Michel told reporters in Brussels on Sunday that the authorities fear "an attack similar to the one in Paris, with several individuals who could also possibly launch several attacks at the same time in multiple locations."
Earlier, Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said the danger to Belgium was not tied to Abdeslam alone.
"The threat is broader than the one suspected terrorist," he told Flemish broadcaster VRT.
Soldiers joined police officers on patrols in Brussels over the weekend. Many public spaces in the usually bustling capital were deserted, as people heeded official warnings to avoid crowds.
