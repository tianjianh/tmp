Humberside Police hunt fugitive Pocklington tyre slasher

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted slashing 190 car tyres in a three-day vandalism spree in North Yorkshire has gone on the run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julian Glew, 45, has not been seen since he failed to turn up for sentencing at Beverley Magistrates' Court on 14 October.
Humberside Police believe Glew, of Princes Avenue, Hull, may be sleeping rough in the woods near Pocklington and have appealed for help to trace him.
Glew admitted three counts of criminal damage in Pocklington last month.
A force representative said: "He is not thought to pose a threat but we are seeking help from members of the public in locating him."
Glew is described as white, 5ft 7in (173cm) tall, of slim build with receding hairline and usually has a beard and moustache.
