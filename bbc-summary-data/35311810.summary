House builder Barratt has announced plans to create 1,420 homes at 14 new sites across Scotland this year.

They include developments in Edinburgh, Haddington, Strathaven, Glasgow, Linwood, Aberdeen and Newmachar.
Last year, Barratt built 1,390 new homes in Scotland, nearly half of which were constructed on brownfield land.
The company said its building programme reflected "a continued recovery in Scotland's economy" and the health of the new-build housing market.
Barratt said the new sites would "underpin" more than 300 extra local jobs.
Douglas McLeod, regional director for Barratt Developments in Scotland, said: "We have seen demand for new homes across Scotland remain high and our new sites will provide more choice for buyers looking to purchase in some of Scotland's most sought-after residential locations.
"It's also good news for the Scottish economy not just in terms of supporting local construction jobs, but also through the generation of local revenue from new residents spending in local shops and on local services.
"We know the positive social and economic impacts that our developments can make and we'll be working closely with all the communities in which we're building, to make sure we maximise those impacts as we progress."
