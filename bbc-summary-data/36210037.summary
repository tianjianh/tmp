Grzegorz Beyer, 40, was assaulted by "a number of people" near the water fountain in the early hours of Monday.
He died on Wednesday evening at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, Wiltshire Police said.
His family described him as a "loving husband, father and son" and said they were "completely devastated".
Family members were "struggling to come to terms with the void Grzesiek's passing has left in our lives," they said.
Officers are analysing CCTV and have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
Det Chief Insp Jeremy Carter said: "This was a Bank Holiday Monday, therefore, the area would have been busier than usual.
"I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the area of Bridge Street, Canal Walk, The Parade or Regent Street to please call police."
