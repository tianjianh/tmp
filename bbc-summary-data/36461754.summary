[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen abductor detained without time limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who abducted a woman at knifepoint in Aberdeen after acting on hallucinations about an imaginary twin brother has been detained in the State Hospital without limit of time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phillip Andrew - who who was jailed for 10 years in 1997 for attempted murder - carried out the assault and abduction at his flat last year.
He pleaded not guilty in respect of his mental health.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Boyd ordered him to be detained.
Consultant psychiatrist Dr Robert Gibb, giving evidence, said: "Mr Andrew suffers from hallucinations. He has an imaginary twin brother Victor who speaks to him and he acts on his instructions."
The court heard that the assault took place after Andrew, a paranoid schizophrenic, stopped taking his medication and began drinking.
The court was told both of offences - 1997 and 2015 - involved knives and prostitutes.
