Two-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome is set to miss the World Road Cycling Championships after breaking a foot racing in the Vuelta a Espana.

The 30-year-old crashed on stage 11 of the race and Team Sky principal Sir David Brailsford confirmed he will be off the bike "for a couple of weeks".
The championships take place from 19-27 September in Virginia, USA.
"It looks unlikely," said Brailsford when asked if Froome would race. "The fracture will take a while to heal."
Froome, winner of the Tour de France in 2013 and 2015, had been on the British squad long list for both the road race and time trial events at the championships.
He had been hoping to become only the third man to win both the Tour de France and Vuelta in the same year before he hit a barrier in the Pyrenees on 2 September.
