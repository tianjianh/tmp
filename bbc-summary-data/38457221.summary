Nicola Urquhart's question and answer session on Facebook Live was viewed by more than 33,000 people.
Her son has been missing since disappearing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September.
Mrs Urquhart said she wanted a man seen walking along Cornhill Walk in the town at 03:35 BST to be identified.

During the 90-minute live broadcast, Mrs Urquhart answered questions about her 23-year-old son and the police investigation.
She explained how four vehicles had entered the "horseshoe" area where Mr Mckeague was last seen and that she believes one of them did not have a legitimate reason for being there.
Mrs Urquhart, who was speaking from her home in Dunfermline, Fife, also said it was "imperative" for six more people who have been spotted on CCTV to be identified.
The mother-of-three, who is a serving police officer, raised questions about the police investigation, saying "basic door-to-door inquiries" were not made and the opposite side from where Mr Mckeague was last seen had still not been searched.
Mr Mckeague, a gunner at RAF Honington, was last seen on security camera walking alone at about 03:25 BST.
Describing her son, who is one of three brothers, Mrs Urquhart said: "He's not so much a social butterfly, more a social hand grenade who absolutely lives for the moment.
"He will make choices and decisions that are sometimes reckless that other people might not.
"Would he get into a stranger's car? Yes. Would he go to a stranger's house that he's never met before that he's met on a social dating site? Yes.
"He would put himself at risk because Corrie believed he could handle himself."
Suffolk Police have said they are treating the case as a missing person inquiry but the level of resources has been on par with a murder investigation.
