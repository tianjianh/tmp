The England Under-23 international scored 14 goals last season as Doncaster finished second in WSL 2 and were promoted back to the top flight.
England, 21, said: "I feel I am at the stage in my career to test myself at a higher level.
"There is no doubt that will happen at Chelsea, not just during games but in every training session."
Her arrival is Chelsea's fourth signing of the close season. They have also brought in midfielders Karen Carney and Jade Bailey and goalkeeper Becky Spencer.
England will be reunited with Chelsea assistant manager Paul Green, who signed her during his time at Doncaster.
"Beth is a great character and a young player who is hungry to develop and improve her game," said Green.
