Both goals came in the final 10 minutes, with Lily Agg cancelling out Katie Zelem's opener for the Reds, who also had Kate Longhurst sent off.
Earlier on Saturday, Louise Quinn scored twice as Arsenal beat FA Cup runners-up Birmingham City 4-2 to move up to second in the table.
And Everton clinched the WSL 2 Spring Series title by beating London Bees.
Needing just a point to clinch top spot, in what was their final game of the campaign, Everton ran out easy 4-0 winners.
Mollie Green's deflected strike put Andy Spence's side ahead after 28 minutes, before captain Michelle Hinnigan's guided header made it 2-0 six minutes later and Claudia Walker's second-half penalty and curling strike completed victory.
In winning WSL 2, Everton ensured their best league placing since their relegation from the top flight in 2014 - after finishing third in the full summer seasons of 2015 and 2016.
In WSL 1, Liverpool are now five points clear of second-placed Arsenal - but have played one game more than the Gunners, and three games more than Chelsea in third and Manchester City in fourth.
