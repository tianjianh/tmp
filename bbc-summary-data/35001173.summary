He said the government and industry funding would help UK aerospace grow.
Wing manufacturing technology and fuel systems will be examined in the two projects, led from Filton but with research carried out across the UK.
Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier said he was pleased to get "long-term commitment at least until 2026" from the UK.
The announcement was made at plane maker Airbus's Filton HQ, which employs 4,000 people, on Thursday.
The investment comes from the Aerospace Technology Institute, half government and half industry funding.
One project will look at how to speed up production, reduce weight and costs for the next generation of advanced aircraft wings, while the other will look to reduce maintenance on new aircraft fuel systems.
Mr Javid said the "highly skilled" aerospace was a "real success story" for the UK and government and industry working together could "produce results".
He added: "We can help boost productivity, we can help the industry grow and hire more people."
Over the next ten years he said the government would commit £900m to aerospace research and development - match funded by industry.
He said: "It will help keep our aviation industry, not just in Filton but nationally, at the top."
Mr Brégier said the UK was a world leader in aircraft wing and fuel system development and the investment would "help secure this position for decades to come".
Asked why his business needed government money, Mr Bregier told BBC Points West: "It's very long term research and technology we need to structure the supply chain, we need to make sure that we have a long-term vision.
"And there is a competition among countries. I can get support in France, in Germany and I'm very pleased to get a long-term commitment, at least until 2026, from the UK."
