Raymond McCord calls for public inquiry into son's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of Raymond McCord junior has called for a public inquiry to be heard into his son's death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old was murdered by the UVF in Belfast in 1997.
A preliminary inquest hearing into the murder heard that it may take up to four years for an inquest to be ready to proceed.
The court was told that the delay was because of ongoing criminal proceedings which may or may not be linked to the murder.
It is believed those proceedings relate to Gary Haggarty, the former leader of the UVF in north Belfast, who turned supergrass six years ago.
It is understood he has offered to give evidence against those involved in Raymond McCord's murder.
The court was told the inquest into Raymond McCord's death would not be able to go ahead until the case involving Gary Haggarty is completed.
Lord Justice Weir said: "The case is slightly unusual as somebody has provided the police and the ombudsman with information which might lead to action being taken against people who acted directly or indirectly into the death of Mr McCord."
Raymond McCord junior was beaten to death before his body was dumped in a quarry near north Belfast in 1997.
No one has ever been convicted of the former RAF man's murder.
