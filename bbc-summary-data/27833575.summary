The crash between the car and a lorry happened at 11:20 BST on the southbound carriageway, just before junction nine.
Police said the baby was believed to be uninjured in the collision but remains in hospital as a precaution.
Emergency services remain at the scene and motorists are being advised to avoid the area if possible.
The collision was between a green Peugeot 406 estate and a red articulated lorry.
The driver of the Peugeot was pronounced dead at the scene and the baby, believed to be only a few weeks old, was in the rear of the vehicle.
Two lanes of the southbound carriageway have now been reopened, but police said there were still lengthy tailbacks.
Many arterial routes have also been affected.
The baby was taken by air ambulance to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.
Another person was assessed at the scene but not taken to hospital.
