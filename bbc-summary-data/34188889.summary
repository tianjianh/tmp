Northampton Town fans are planning a peaceful protest before Saturday's League Two match against Oxford United over chairman David Cardoza's running of the club.

Cobblers chairman Cardoza has been in the process of selling the club to an Indian consortium since June.
The consortium's identity has still yet to be revealed, and the work to Sixfields' East Stand has stalled.
"It's badly timed - let's hope it doesn't have an impact," said Cardoza.
"The reason people are having their protest, the prospective owners are here to sort all these problems out. The fact they are protesting could work against us."
The London-based consortium are looking to buy both the football club and land around the Sixfields ground.
In 2013, Northampton Borough Council agreed to loan the club up to Â£12m to allow them to redevelop the stadium, including the addition of a housing scheme and local retail development.
However, Cardoza, who had been "unbelievably" supportive during his tenure, revealed that the reason the East Stand's redevelopment has stalled is because of issues surrounding the contractors.
"People want to know why we're in this position - it's because the contractors went bust and there's bits and pieces swirling around that, that's it really," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"My father and I have spent an enormous amount of money making sure when these problems happen, that the football club would be protected, the loan gets paid back and the stand will get built - it will happen. Unfortunately it's taking longer than we hoped."
And Cardoza tried to allay fears over the takeover, having already released a statement saying that the takeover's due diligence process was close to completion.
"The takeover is still going ahead," he said. "I'm scratching my head a little bit about why people are asking for more information on that. I did say a month ago it may take another month.
"We're very close to the deal happening or not, whatever the case may be."
But Andy Clarke from the Supporters' Trust says Cardoza needs to do more for the fans, some of whom are using #wewantanswers on Twitter.
"There is a problem with the absolutely getting no answers to any questions," said Clarke.
"Clearly, contractual issues with the East Stand are very difficult, but there are other questions that have emerged that aren't so difficult that could really help.
"One of the problems we've got is that David Cardoza says, and I quite believe him, that he's in a difficult position as he doesn't know where it is, but he's the only one that knows anything.
"Deep down it's a fact that Chris Wilder, the club, the staff and the fans need to have a bit of a clearer view of the future. If David Cardoza can't give us those answers, I think it's down to him to give us some comfort and give us a feeling that he's the guy in charge and that he's still taking the project forward."
