[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-0 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil and Exeter played out an uninspiring goalless draw at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game of few chances, Yeovil were denied what would have been the winning goal in the second half when Tom Eaves' header hit the crossbar.
Exeter went close in the first half when Reuben Reid was put through on goal, with Artur Krysiak forced to rush out and clear the danger.
Ollie Watkins also threatened for the visitors when his fierce drive from 25 yards only just passed the crossbar.
There were bizarre scenes at the end of the opening period as a whistle from the crowd was mistaken by everyone for the half-time signal. It resulted in mass confusion around Huish Park as referee Tim Robinson was forced to bring the players back onto the pitch before playing the remaining few seconds of the half.
Yeovil had a penalty claim turned down early in the second after the ball appeared to strike the arm of Exeter's Jordan Moore-Taylor in the box.
There then followed a golden chance for Yeovil when Ryan Dickson found Eaves with a peach of a cross, but the header looped past the helpless Christy Pym and cannoned off the bar.
Substitute Liam McAlinden went close for the visitors in the closing stages but Krysiak was equal to his shot.
