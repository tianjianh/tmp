Prince Fahd al-Saud is said to have booked entire areas of the park over the 22-24 May period, to celebrate getting his degree.
Euro Disney, which runs the theme park, confirmed that a prince had spent three days there with a number of guests.
The company says it regularly organises private events for firms or people.
The festivities included tailor-made events involving "rare Disney characters",  a source told the AFP news agency.
Special security was put in place for the prince, one of the park's top customers, AFP said.
The theme park attracted 16 million visitors last year, but Euro Disney says it has not made any profits since it was set up in 1992.
Last year, it lost 120.9m euros in the first half of its financial year compared with a net loss of 99.5m euros in the same period a year earlier.
