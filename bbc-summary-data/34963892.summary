Mark Bailey, director at Armagh Observatory, said it could be seen from Letterkenny and Longford in the Republic as well as Scotland and Northern Ireland.
A fireball is a fragment of an asteroid or comet which emits a light as it burns up in the earth's atmosphere.
Mr Bailey said that the observatory received more than 30 submissions from the public detailing the sightings.
"It's very interesting to see what people do report," he said. "It's mostly people who have never seen such a bright object in the sky."
Mr Bailey said the reports from the public help the observatory to pinpoint the trajectory of the fireball.
