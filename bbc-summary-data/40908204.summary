[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motherwell 2-0 Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell pounced on Ross County's second-half errors to register their first Premiership points of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Tait steered home after poor play from County captain Andrew Davies.
Motherwell's second came from the penalty spot as Louis Moult picked himself up to convert following Kenny van der Weg's foul, for which the Dutchman was sent off.
The Dingwall side will be frustrated as they dominated the first half without making their possession count.
Well boss Stephen Robinson's frustration at the three red cards his team received last weekend was well documented, and there were only three minutes on the clock here when stand-in captain Ben Heneghan was shown a yellow for taking out Craig Curran.
Andy Rose and County's Tim Chow would join him in referee Alan Muir's book later in a first half that the visitors edged in terms of possession and chances.
At times the Dingwall men's passing was crisp and clever, despite losing Jim O'Brien early to injury. His replacement - Chris Routis - tested Russell Griffiths with an overhead kick but the Motherwell goalkeeper was perfectly placed to catch it with ease.
Michael Gardyne had County's other best chance of the opening 45 minutes, the Dundonian running on to Jason Naismith's low cut-back from the right and sending a shot towards the corner of the home side's net. Yet again, though, former Everton youth goalkeeper Griffiths was well placed to push it round the post.
Ross County played three at the back, with deep-lying midfielder Jamie Lindsay - on loan from Celtic - looking competent when he had to drop back and help out his defenders.
Motherwell's creative players such as Chris Cadden and Craig Tanner were largely stifled in the first half. The exception was when Moult released Cadden down the right and his teasing cross was nearly headed in by Alex Fisher.
The same theme of County dominance seemed to be developing after the break until the visitors hit the self-destruct button.
Davies took a fresh air kick at a relatively routine low delivery from Cadden that then rolled into the path of Tait, who turned in his second goal of the season from 12 yards.
The Staggies went on to lose two defenders through injury and a red card. Davies limped off with what looked like a hamstring strain before Van der Weg's foul prevented Moult from latching on to a through ball.
Referee Muir flashed the red card at the Dutchman and Moult buried the penalty in the bottom right corner - his third of the campaign.
The home side's second-half display merited the three points, with a tactical change to 3-5-2 helping turn the game in their favour.
