[SN]TITLE[SN]
World reaction to the ousting of Egypt's Mohammed Morsi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World leaders respond to the dramatic events in Egypt following the army's overthrow of the first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, after days of anti-government unrest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"We are deeply concerned by the decision of the Egyptian Armed Forces to remove President Morsi and suspend the Egyptian constitution.
"I now call on the Egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process, and to avoid any arbitrary arrests of President Morsi and his supporters.
"Given today's developments, I have also directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under US law for our assistance to the Government of Egypt.
"The voices of all those who have protested peacefully must be heard - including those who welcomed today's developments and those who have supported President Morsi."
President Barack Obama
"We never support in countries the intervention by the military, but what needs to happen now in Egypt is for democracy to flourish and for a genuine democratic transition to take place.
"All parties need to be involved in that, and that's what Britain and our allies will be saying very clearly to the Egyptians."
Prime Minister David Cameron
"I want to call upon all parties involved not to use any violence. There is no question that despite Egypt's variety of opinions human rights apply to all its citizens.
"The country's problems can only be solved if Egypt enters a political process as quickly as possible and democratic and rule of law will be established as soon as possible."
Chancellor Angela Merkel
"The democratic process has stopped and must return. What is happening in Egypt is obviously a fail. It's not only people who gathered but also a president who was toppled after democratic election. So the challenge, now, is to do everything in order to start the process again.
"What really matters is to organise irreproachable elections as soon as possible, as the army took the responsibility of toppling the president and asked the constitutional court president to fulfil this function."
President Francois Hollande
"We consider it important for all political forces in Egypt to exercise restraint... to consider the broad national interests of their actions, and to prove that they strive to solve the brewing political and socio-economic problems in a democratic framework, without violence, and accounting for the interests of all social groups and religious confessions."
Foreign ministry statement
"At this moment of continued high tension and uncertainty in the country, the secretary-general reiterates his appeals for calm, non-violence, dialogue and restraint.
"An inclusive approach is essential to addressing the needs and concerns of all Egyptians. Preservation of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and assembly remain of vital importance.
"In their protests many Egyptians have voiced deep frustrations and legitimate concerns.
"At the same time, military interference in the affairs of any state is of concern. Therefore it will be crucial to quickly reinforce civilian rule in accordance with principles of democracy."
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
The AU is likely to suspend Egypt from all its activities, according to Reuters.
"Suffice it to say that the AU has a very clear position on coups d'etat. Secondly, it did have an elected government elected through a due democratic process so what is happening currently in Egypt is indeed a matter of grave concern, not just to us in Africa but should be a matter of grave concern to any true believer of a democratic process."
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta
"I urge all sides to rapidly return to the democratic process, including the holding of free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections and the approval of a constitution, to be done in a fully inclusive manner, so as to permit the country to resume and complete its democratic transition.
"I hope that the new administration will be fully inclusive and reiterate the importance of ensuring full respect for fundamental rights, freedoms and the rule of law, and will hold the authorities to account for this.
"I strongly condemn all violent acts, offer my condolences to the families of the victims, and urge the security forces to do everything in their power to protect the lives and well-being of Egyptian citizens. I call on all sides to exercise maximum restraint."
Foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton
"It is unacceptable for a government, which has come to power through democratic elections, to be toppled through illicit means and, even more, a military coup."
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu
"What is happening in Egypt is the fall of so-called political Islam. This is the fate of anyone in the world who tries to use religion for political or factional interests."
President Bashar al-Assad
"Certainly the resistant nation of Egypt will protect its independence and greatness from foreign and enemy opportunism during the difficult conditions that follow.
"With respect for the political origins of its (Egypt's) discerning, civilised and historic people, the Islamic Republic emphasises the need to fulfil their legitimate demands and is hopeful that... developments will provide an atmosphere to meet their needs."
Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Araqchi, quoted by Fars news agency.
"In the name of the Palestinian people and its leaders, I am honoured to congratulate you (Mr Mansour) on assuming the leadership of the Arab Republic of Egypt in this transitory phase in its history."

"Ennahda rejects what happened and believes legitimacy is represented by President Mohammed Morsi, and no one else."
Ennahda, Tunisia's ruling Islamist party
"In the name of the people of Saudi Arabia and on my behalf, we congratulate your leadership of Egypt in this critical period of its history.
"We pray for God to help you bear the responsibility laid upon you to achieve the ambitions of our brotherly people of Egypt."
King Abdullah
"His Highness Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the Foreign Minister of the UAE, expressed his full confidence that the great people of Egypt are able to cross these difficult moments that Egypt is going through.
"Sheikh Abdullah said that the great Egyptian army was able to prove again that they are the fence of Egypt and that they are the protector and strong shield that guarantee Egypt will remain a state of institutions and law."
"Qatar will continue to respect the will of Egypt and its people across the spectrum,"
Foreign ministry official quoted by Al Jazeera
King Abdullah II congratulated Adly Mansour. In a cable sent to the interim president, the king stressed his absolute keenness to continue to work to enhance the bilateral ties in various fields in the common interest of both peoples.
"Jordan supports the will and choice of the great Egyptian people," he said.
"The [Hamas] movement does not interfere in Egyptian affairs [and has] no comment on the Egyptian army's decision to isolate President Morsi."
