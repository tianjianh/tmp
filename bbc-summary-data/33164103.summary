[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sex accused head teacher Anne Lakey 'devastated' by claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher accused of having underage sex with two boys said she was "devastated" when she learned of the allegations in an email, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anne Lakey, 55, from Stanley, County Durham, denies 13 counts of indecent assault on two teenagers, aged 15 and 13 or 14, in the 1980s.
The younger complainant said she had sex with him after he watched her bathe, Teesside Crown Court heard.
When asked if the claims were true, she replied "absolutely not".
Ms Lakey told the court she learned of the accusations when one of the complainants emailed her school in December 2012, branding her a "disgusting sexual monster".
She was then suspended from her role as chief executive of the Durham Federation, in charge of two secondary schools.
The court heard the younger teenager played a dare game with her and exposed her breasts during a visit to her home in the late 1980s, before they repeatedly had sex.
Ms Lakey's voice cracked with emotion when Tim Roberts QC, defending, put the claims to her.
"Did anything like that ever occur between you and [the complainant]?" he asked her.
"It did not," she replied.
The older complainant said Lakey took his virginity in a tent.
Giving evidence, she denied the claim and said (he) "did not visit me in the night" and the boy "certainly did not" get in her sleeping bag, "did not kiss and cuddle" her or have sex with her.
The head teacher admitted she developed a sexual relationship with the older complainant when he was 18.
In 2012, Ms Lakey said she rang her ex-lover after the first complainant's email dropped at her school because he had been named in it.
She said: "I hadn't seen (him) for nearly 20 years. I said 'I'm really sorry, I'm having some problems at school. There is a malicious email at school, you have been named in it'."
Lakey denied she asked him not to talk to police.
"I suppose I just felt awkward and embarrassed that he was being dragged into this and that he had been named in an email," she said.
She said she wanted to "give him the heads up".
The second complainant told the court she used "A Level psychology 101" on him when she rang him up after the allegations emerged, and she told him about her sick father and her mother who had died.
Ms Lakey cried and said: "That is probably the most rotten thing of everything that he said."
She said it was "not out of emotional blackmail" and what he said "beggared belief".
The teacher said she did not know why the pair were making the "false" allegations against her.
The trial continues.
