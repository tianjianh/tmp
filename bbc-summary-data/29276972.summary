[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new headquarters for Northumbria Police has opened its doors to the public in Newcastle city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£38m complex on Forth Bank includes 50 custody cells and involved restoring the existing Kings House building.
It replaces the 1930s Pilgrim Street and 1960s Market Street complex, which will now be put up for sale.
Northumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird and Chief Constable Sue Sim took part in the official opening ceremony.
To mark its completion, a time capsule put together by local schoolchildren was buried on the site.
Children from St Paul's Church of England Primary School in Newcastle and St Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary School in Gateshead added photos and letters with their future predictions for what life might be like in years to come.
