Neil Fox trial: DJ made 'saucy, cheeky comments' at work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox has told a court he engaged in "saucy" behaviour at work, but complaints made against him in 2014 were the first in his 29-year career.

Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.
He said there was often "horseplay" with colleagues, involving "piggybacks, tickling and squeezing".
But he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.
Mr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.
He joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.
Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with "hundreds" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.
Under questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.
"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that."
He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a "full performance" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.
Mr Caplan asked: "Could those comments become edgy or sexual?"
Mr Fox replied: "Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top."
Referring to the "horseplay" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, "otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio".
Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: "I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?
"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed."
He added: "But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then."
One former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: "That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do."
The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.
Addressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a "play-acting high jinks thing", he said.
Mr Fox told the court he had seen it "many times", but agreed that out of context, the "Benny Hill-style" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.
Prosecutor John Price QC said: "She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?"
Mr Fox replied: "I can't get in (her) head."
Mr Price continued: "Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?" to which the defendant replied: "No."
Mr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.
"It never happened," he said, although he did acknowledge he "could have easily taken her for a tour".
Mr Fox agreed it would be "quite wrong" for an adult man to "stick his tongue" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.
If a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with "a social kiss" on the cheek, he said.
The girl in question had, he added, "become a little bit obsessed with me".
Asked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: "I don't have an explanation at all."
Mr Price said: "Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?"
The DJ replied: "I can't explain those coincidences."
The trial continues.
