More than 30 bald men in Japan are holding their annual get-together which includes an unusual variant of the tug-of-war rope pulling game.

Competing "follicly challenged" individuals strived to pull a suction cup, connected by a single red rope, off their opponent's head.
The Bald Men Club has attracted about 65 members from all over the country since it was formed in 1989.
It aims to encourage people to view baldness in a more positive manner.
"My head still hurts," Toshiyuki Ogasawara, 43, was said after taking part in the tug-of-war. "I think I need to ice it!"
Another participant, Masatomo Sasaki, 64, is making a first appearance at the tournament north of Tokyo.  He said that he used to feel concerned about his lack of hair but is now more positive.
Our weird lack of hair may be the key to our success
"I feel proud. Or maybe I should say, I feel good about being a bald man," he said, "And that is thanks to this bald men's club."
Bald Men Club Chairman Teijiro Sugo, 70, said the hope was that the club would attract more members and become much bigger.
"I want all the bald men all over the world to gather here so we can organise a bald men's Olympic tournament," he said.
