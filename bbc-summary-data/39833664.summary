Raith 4-4 Brechin (agg: 3-3, 3-4 pen)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Raith Rovers were relegated to Scottish League One as Brechin City progressed to the Championship play-off final on penalties after a thrilling second leg.

Andy Jackson scored the decisive spot-kick after City goalkeeper Graeme Smith made three shoot-out saves.
A pulsating second encounter finished 3-3 after extra time, with Liam Watt's 115th-minute strike forcing penalties.
Manager John Hughes and his assistant Kevin McBride parted company with Raith after the match.
Brechin will face Alloa Athletic, who saw off Airdrieonians, over two legs for a place in the Championship.
The semi-final was all-square following a 1-1 draw at Glebe Park on Wednesday evening and after a start to the game in which both teams appeared more content not to concede than to create, it came to life in the second half.
Brechin had rarely been seen as an attacking force prior to Ross Caldwell's opener six minutes after the break and, even then, they were not the architects of their breakthrough.
Jean-Yves M'voto - so often the cornerstone of the Raith defence - attempted to pass-back to goalkeeper Conor Brennan from wide on the right.
The centre-back did not see Caldwell stealing in to intercept and the former Hibs striker calmly slid the ball home.
M'voto himself powerfully headed in Declan McManus' free-kick to draw Rovers level, and his day in the spotlight was far from over.
After 80 minutes, the Frenchman was well-placed to score a second when Jason Thomson found him six yards out, but he lifted the ball over the bar.
And four minutes later, M'voto miscued an attempted clearance, allowing substitute Alan Trouten to race in on goal, and finish emphatically past Brennan.
Rovers looked bound for League One at that stage, but Declan McManus sent Stark's Park wild with a stoppage-time equaliser, as Brechin failed to clear their lines.
The tie swung the way of John Hughes' men in the first period of extra time, as Ryan Hardie found the net, but Watt's stunning free-kick nestled in the top corner from 30 yards out to haul City level again.
Smith denied three Rovers penalty-takers, giving Andy Jackson the opportunity to win the tie. Brechin's top goalscorer took his chance to condemn Rovers to Scotland's third tier, and keep his side's promotion hopes alive.
Raith Rovers manager John Hughes (speaking prior to leaving his position): "There was effort and commitment but we cannot concede the goals that we conceded.
"We just keep shooting ourselves in the foot, which is unfortunate.
"You have to give Brechin credit. They fought us all the way. I really feel for the supporters. This club, with the supporters, needs to come back strong.
"I feel for everyone involved with Raith Rovers. There will be repercussions, that's for sure, but I'm hoping that the club can stay full-time. This club will get back to where it should be.
"I've really enjoyed working with them. There are a lot of guys hurting in there."
Brechin City manager Darren Dods: "It was an unbelievable effort to come back and draw three-all.
"We've never scored a goal from a free-kick since I've been in charge. Liam Watt has hit a few this season but I don't think he'll hit one sweeter than that.
"I think our goalie is the best in League One and he showed it in the penalty shoot-out. We managed to get there in sudden death.
"The squad is stretched as it is but we need to find the final effort for the two last games.
"It's a shame somebody has to go down. I think Raith will bounce back, they are a big club.
"We'll enjoy tonight, train Monday and play on Wednesday. Hopefully a few of their bosses will give them a half day so they can get up to Brechin sharp!"
