The 39-year-old Romanian national was detained in Lurgan on Wednesday by Gangmaster Licensing Authority officers assisted by the PSNI.
The arrest is part of ongoing investigations into unlicensed labour provision on fruit farms in the county.
He has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
In a statement, the authority said: "He is suspected of supplying workers to pick apples and other fruit without a licence at various locations in the area - activities that require a GLA licence.
"Providing workers for roles in agriculture, horticulture and food processing and packaging without a GLA licence is a criminal offence that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison," the statement added.
