Over 500 complaints have been made to the Environment Agency about the site in Cormongers Lane, Redhill, Surrey.
The agency said it would consider taking action against operator Biffa if it found it had breached its permit.
Biffa said it was working in accordance with its permit and claimed improvement work to tackle the smell had been hampered by the wet weather.
The managing director of Biffa's landfill division, Mick Davies, said: "We want to get ourselves so we're a good neighbour so we don't create a problem in the area and that's what our focus is.
"We're obviously aware of the odour complaints and we are apologetic to the public."
Residents have been complaining about the smell emanating from the site for several weeks.
Green Party councillor Sarah Finch said the stench seemed to be at its worst earlier in the month.
Environment Agency officers are sending data about gas emissions to Public Health England, which will rule on whether there is a health risk.
Biffa has said it does not believe the levels of hydrogen sulphide at the site pose a threat to human health.
As a temporary measure the company has installed a flare stack, a type of combustion device, to burn off the excess gas.
