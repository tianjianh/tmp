The 19-year-old from Scotland finished 14th in the 3m preliminaries to reach the semi-finals and claim British Diving's 11th Olympic berth.
China are the only other nation to claim places in all 11 events so far.
On Tuesday, Matty Lee and James Denny will bid for the one remaining place - in the men's individual 10m platform.
Former British diver Yona Knight-Wisdom, who switched to Jamaican nationality in time to compete at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, claimed a historic silver in the men's individual 3m springboard final.
It was his new nation's first-ever World Cup medal and Leeds-based Knight-Wisdom, 20, is set to become Jamaica's first-ever male Olympic diver this summer.
His score of 459.25 was a new lifetime best and was only bettered by Mexico's Rommel Pacheco Marrufo (504.40), with American Kristian Ipsen (457.60) taking bronze.
World champion He Choa of China was sixth, whilst GB's Freddie Woodward exited at the semi-final stages, having already secured GB an Olympic berth on Sunday.
