Dundee Stars head coach Marc LeFebvre hailed his team after picking up four Elite League points this weekend, but will worry about negatives later on.

An overtime win over Fife Flyers on Saturday was followed by a penalty-shots victory over Belfast Giants as the Stars went the distance and claimed all points available.
And after edging past title challengers Belfast, who clawed a 4-1 deficit to 4-4 to take the game into overtime, LeFebvre was understandably delighted.
"It's a huge four-point weekend and that's three wins in a row for us now after getting past the hell of a hockey team in Belfast," a jubilant LeFebvre said.
"We knew it was going to be a full 60-minute game against them, but full credit to our guys.  We found a way to win in overtime against Fife and we did it in a shootout against Belfast.
"It's two big wins and four points in a weekend and while Belfast put us under pressure late on, I'll look at that and any other negatives, when get back to work on Tuesday.  I just want to enjoy this."
Stars travelled to Fife Flyers looking for a top-eight spot and ended up going the distance with their Kirkcaldy rivals before taking both points in a 4-3 overtime win.
Felix Poulin's first was an equaliser from Justin Fox, before the Fife man added a second, which was then cancelled out by Vinny Scarsella as the teams were tied at 2-2 after the first period.
Joey Sides fired Stars in front in the second and the leveller from Brendan Brooks sent the game into overtime, where Poulin struck to clinch the two points.
Stars hosted Belfast Giants on Sunday, a team in the thick of the Elite League title race and did it again, taking victory in penalty shots after a 4-4 draw.
Mikael Lidhammar and Kevin Bruijsten put the Stars two up, with Jim Vandermeer pulling one back for the Giants before Bruijsten adding his second shortly after.
The night got better for the home team when Scarsella fired home a penalty shot to make it 4-1, but Giants' Derrick Walser clawed one back shorthanded in the final minute of the second.
The visitors got to within one of their hosts in the first minute of the third as Blair Riley scored with Belfast's second shorthanded goal to make it a nervy final period.
Riley struck again with a couple of minutes to go to tie the game at 4-4, with Dundee hanging on as the game moved into overtime then penalty shots, where Lidhammar was the only success.
Fife went to Edinburgh Capitals on Sunday and got back to winning ways as they completed a three point weekend to move to fifth in the Elite League table after winning 4-3.
Matt Sisca and Justin Fox put them two up before Ian Schultz pulled one back for Edinburgh.  Chase Schaber added a third, but Yevgeni Fyodorov pulled Caps to within one again.
Carlo Finucci's late finish effectively sealed the points, although a late one from Fyodorov for his second made the scoreline most respectable for the Caps.
The Capitals had two points in the bag from the weekend after visiting Braehead Clan on Saturday night, winning 3-2 as they looked to start clawing their way into the play-off reckoning.
Mason Wilgosh opened the scoring for the Caps, but Corey Cowick was on hand to poke home the equaliser for Braehead.
A bullet shot from Michal Dobron restored Edinburgh's lead, only for Matt Beca to restore parity for the home side.  However Yevgeni Fyodorov's winner in the second period proved enough.
Clan made their way to Manchester Storm on Sunday and it turned into a weekend to forget for Ryan Finnerty's men, who lost 6-3 after an early collapse in the third period.
Matt Beca and Scott Pitt put Braehead two up before Darian Dzuirzynski pulled one by the end of the first.
Storm blitzed their visitors in the third with a hat-trick from Jack Prince and two from Matt Bissonnette and although Mike Hammond got one back for the Clan, the game was lost.

Braehead Clan 2-3 Edinburgh Capitals
