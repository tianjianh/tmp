Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes hailed the attacking threat of his side as they beat Ventspils 3-0 in the Europa League second qualifying round.

Jayden Stockley, Adam Rooney and Wes Burns all scored in the last 20 minutes.
"You see the goal threats we have and we've got Miles Storey to add to that," McInnes told BBC Scotland.
"Tonight I thought we were so industrious, tenacious, and played the game how it needed to be played."
Stockley's header broke the deadlock, and was his first goal for the club since signing in the summer.
Burns had sealed a loan switch from English Championship side Bristol City hours before the game, and the Welshman scored just a minute after coming off the bench.
"It was always my intention to get another striker on next to Rooney for the second period of the game," said McInnes.
"Jayden's goal is magnificent. Rooney is typical Rooney."
McInnes also hailed his defence as they kept a clean sheet for the first time in Europe this season.
"Defensively they deserves a lot of plaudits," he said. "They've taken a kicking recently with mistakes and lack of concentration.
"It was important we didn't chase the game willy nilly. We drew 0-0 here with Groningen and Shkendija and that was enough or us.
"The goal we conceded to Fola Esch, that was the goal that nearly put us out of the tournament. Although the performance was poor over there, that was the goal that gave the opposition the hope and incentive.
"It's very important to keep clean sheets at home in Europe, and I think we're capable of scoring over there which makes it more difficult for them. They have to play with that concern while they try and chase the game."
He added: "We're confident going on the road. Last week was not like us. In Europe we've picked up some good results, we've always been quite compact and disciplined and been able to counter.
"We did nothing last week apart from give the opposition hope that they could win. But tonight there was some good performances and it was a good night's work for us."
