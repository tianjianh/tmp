She will address 120 chief executives at Irish business organisation Ibec and is expected to emphasise that "Scotland is open for business".
Ms Sturgeon will also visit the Scottish government's investment and innovation hub in the city.
She said she wanted to strengthen Scotland's Irish links "even further".
"Scottish exports to Ireland are worth Â£1.125bn and Irish investment into Scotland currently supports more than 6,000 jobs," she said.
"It's important to get across to our European partners, such as Ireland, that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and that we are doing everything we can to protect our relationship with Europe.
"I want companies in Ireland to know that Scotland remains open for business and will continue to be an attractive place to invest.
"I will be asking the delegates at Ibec to work with the hub and to come to Scotland to see what we have to offer.
"A number of new Scottish investment wins have been landed this year and through the strong network the hub continues to develop with Irish-based investors - further projects are in the pipeline."
Ms Sturgeon said "Ireland has always been and will continue to be a key economic partner for Scotland".
"It is even more important than ever that our two countries work together for the benefit of both our nations," she said.
On Friday, Ms Sturgeon told a summit of the British-Irish Council that remaining in the single market was the UK's "least worst" Brexit option.
She said staying inside the common market after leaving the EU would be best for every part of the UK.
