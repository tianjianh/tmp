Cuts make policing Cardiff's pubs and bars 'more difficult'

Budget cuts have made policing Cardiff's night spots "more difficult", a senior officer has said after a summit into alleged sex assaults.

South Wales Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Sophie Howe said Cardiff has reached "saturation point" in terms of pubs and clubs.
The force met with figures from Cardiff council, the city's universities and businesses on Thursday.
The summit followed three alleged sex attacks in the city last month.
Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis told the BBC "Cardiff is a very safe city", but added it is "very hard" to police its concentration of pubs and bars.
There are 299 licensed premises within its central square mile.
The job has "become more difficult" with fewer officers due to reduced police budgets, he added, after the meeting at Cardiff Central police station.
Ms Howe said there is no room for any more clubs in the city centre.
"It is the highest concentration of licensed premises anywhere in the UK," she added.
Ms Howe said there are "far too many", with some having been given licences by the council that the force "haven't necessarily agreed with".
South Wales Police said the council had agreed to look at ways to fund management of the night-time economy, with a late night levy among mooted options.
Police are currently investigating three unconnected attacks alleged to have taken place near Cardiff  University Students' Union during freshers' fortnight.
The force said it had started developing a programme with Cardiff University to support students by training staff to recognise and respond to all forms of domestic abuse and sexual violence.
Staff working in licensed premises will also receive additional training, such as how to spot when someone is intoxicated and conflict-management skills.
"We will also work with the council to enhance their licensing policy to ensure it further promotes responsible drinking and addresses vulnerability within the night-time economy," Ms Howe and ACC Lewis said in a joint statement.
In the wake of the alleged attacks, the city's taxi association rejected claims some drivers have previously refused short-distance fares.
Dan De'Ath, cabinet member for safety, said the local authority has contacted taxi firms to ensure the trade does everything it can to safeguard vulnerable people.
