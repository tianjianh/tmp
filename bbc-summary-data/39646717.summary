The 24-year-old was charged with committing "an act of simulation" to earn his side a penalty in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Celtic.
The fixed suspension was two games and Ross County have chosen not to challenge the decision.
Schalk will miss the Premiership games against Inverness CT and Motherwell.
In August, Hearts' Jamie Walker was also charged with breaching disciplinary rule 201 for diving in a game against Celtic and his appeal against the two-game suspension was dismissed.
Former SFA compliance officer Vincent Lunny does not regard simulation as a common feature of the Scottish game.
"It was one of the rarest matters reported, one or two a year," he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"I think one of the years in my three years, there were no cases, which was quite pleasing.
"It's obviously a talking point. It brings up a lot of discussion, it causes a lot of angst but it is thankfully relatively rare."
Schalk's indiscretion came in the 88th minute at Dingwall, with Celtic leading 2-1, and Liam Boyce scored from the spot to earn County a draw.
The visitors' captain, Scott Brown, was later dismissed for a foul on Boyce, which Celtic have appealed against.
The hearing for that will be held on Thursday 27 April, allowing Brown to take part in Sunday's Old Firm Scottish Cup semi-final.
