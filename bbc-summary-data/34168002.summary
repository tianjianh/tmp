Forty one people were hurt, four seriously, in Friday's incident on a motorway, 25 miles (40 km) from Zurich.
The vehicle was from Edwards coach operators, based near Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
Edwards confirmed 34 of the holidaymakers are now back in south Wales.
Earlier, a spokesman for the operator said those returning had left Switzerland by coach at about 11:00 BST on Sunday with the rest returning "within a week".
The coach which crashed had been returning to south Wales from Italy.
Jason Edwards, director of Edwards coaches, said five people remain in hospital but none of the injuries are life-threatening.
"One of the worst is one of our drivers who's going in for his third operation today on his stomach - damage was caused from the steering wheel," he told BBC Radio Wales.
He added other passengers received broken bones and bruises.
"It's been a nasty experience for all," said Mr Edwards, who confirmed the stationary bus was hit from behind by a postal delivery lorry.
"I'm quite convinced that the coach they were travelling on was one of our new Mercedes Turismo coaches we bought this year and if it was anything less than that, we would have been dealing with a catastrophe - I'm pretty certain there would have been fatalities."
Denise Wilkie, from Caerphilly, whose brother Philip Bullock was one of the coach's drivers, said he had to be cut free from the wreckage and is due to have a skin graft to treat a cut on his leg.
Police said 20 ambulances and three helicopters were used to ferry the injured to hospital.
According to Lucerne Police and Mr Edwards, the incident took place while the coach was at construction works on the A2 motorway at Eich.
Police said four lorries in total were involved in the incident, two from Switzerland, one from Poland and one from Slovakia.
Investigations are ongoing.
