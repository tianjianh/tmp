The forward, 25, has caught the eye since his Â£7m move to the Hammers last September, scoring six league goals.
He has been overlooked by England for this month's friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands.
But he told BBC Sport: "Jamaica called but if I keep doing what I'm doing hopefully I can get an England call."
Antonio, a former non-league player with Tooting & Mitcham United, has flourished on the right flank for the FA Cup quarter-finalists this season.
He was a Championship player with Nottingham Forest until his transfer to West Ham, and he said he is taking inspiration from fellow former lower league players, such as Tottenham's Dele Alli and Leicester's Jamie Vardy, both of whom have been named in Roy Hodgson's recent squad.
"You can see it with Dele Alli, he's come from League One and he's already in the England squad," Antonio told Football Focus. "You see it with Vardy. Hopefully I can get the call-up as well."
Watch Football Focus at 12:10 GMT on BBC One on Saturday, 19 March.
