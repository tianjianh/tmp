[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stonehaven flood protection hearing to be held in March

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public hearing into objections to the Stonehaven flood protection scheme is to be held in March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stonehaven has been badly affected by severe flooding for many years, leading to the evacuation of homes several times between 1988 and 2012.
Design work on the Â£16.5m project is under way.
A three-day hearing, presided over by an independent Scottish government reporter, will be held at St James Church Hall from 28 March.
It was earlier ruled the plans for the flood protection scheme would not go to a public inquiry.
