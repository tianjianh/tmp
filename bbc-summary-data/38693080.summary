[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cyclist flasher 'may have struck before'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police believe a man who indecently exposed himself to two women in Grangemouth before cycling away may have carried out similar acts before.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The women were walking in Zetland Park, Drummond Place, at 18:45 on Thursday when they saw the man exposing himself.
The suspect then left on a bicycle before the women contacted police.
Officers said they believed the incident was linked to other indecent exposures in Tummel Place, Bowhouse Road, Wood Street and Myreton Road.
The man was described as white, aged 18 to 30, wearing dark clothing with his face obscured.
Det Insp. Jim Thomson said: "Over a number of months we have received similar reports of public indecencies within Grangemouth, where the suspect is seen to be in possession of a bike.
"As such, we are treating these incidents as linked and would urge anyone with information that can help us trace this male to come forward.
"None of the witnesses have ever been threatened or spoken to by the suspect, but these are upsetting experiences for them and we are keen to ensure he is apprehended as soon as possible."
