Champions League: Celtic 'not just making up numbers' - Brendan Rodgers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic are not in the Champions League to "make up the numbers", says manager Brendan Rodgers despite describing their opponents as the world's elite.

The Scottish champions are in Group C with Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach.
"We know the teams we are up against are huge teams, but it doesn't stop us trying to fight and seeing where it takes us," said Rodgers.
"We are not in it just to make up the numbers."
Rodgers has already lost to Barcelona as Celtic manager - 3-1 in a pre-season friendly in Dublin.
"They are the best in the world and, for us, these are really tough games, but the home games are going to be exciting because of the level of support we have," he said.
"The pre-season game was a pre-season fitness exercise for both teams, but we know their level and it is up there with the best in the world.
"Manchester City have taken on a new identity with Pep Guardiola going in and you will see early stages of what he is trying to do, which will be the Barcelona game model.
"Borussia Monchengladbach are like a lot of German teams. Young players, work very hard and very good on the counter attack.
"You are playing against the elite players in the world, which obviously pose you different problems, but our aim is to have a go and we will look to be super competitive."
Celtic missed out on the group stage twice under predecessor Ronny Deila and, having come through the qualifiers, went into Thursday's draw among the bottom pot of teams.
"It is a great milestone that we have been able to qualify after a difficult couple of years," said Rodgers.
"I think everyone recognises it is an extremely tough group. You have maybe got the top teams from each of the different pots all in one group."
Rodgers confirmed that qualification for the group stage would mean extra funds to further strengthen his side.
"It allows us hopefully to add to our squad before the window shuts," he said.
"That was always going to be the case, but of course, once qualification is done, it opens up some more funds in order to do that.
"If we can get the right one or two players in, that is what we will look to do. We've got a few ideas of players that we want, but nothing imminent at this time."
Rodgers added that "it is great for Celtic and Patrick Roberts" that Manchester City had given permission to the 19-year-old on-loan winger to face his parent club as it would be a good "part of his learning".
Summer signing Scott Sinclair was previously on the books at City, and is relishing returning to his former club on Champions League duty. He says, however, he does not feel he has a point to prove to his old employers having failed to make a significant impact during his spell at the Etihad.
"Not really a point to prove," Sinclair said.
"Going back to City, on a personal level, that will be fantastic. Being in the Champions League and being involved in it is much better for me than when I was at City, not really involved some weeks. But here I'm feeling at home, feel proper involved and I can't wait to get started.
"I think it will be nice to go just back and see some old faces and some friends.
"I don't think any group is easy. You get the big teams in the Champions League and the group stage is going to be difficult. To have Barcelona and Man City is going to be difficult, but I don't think we've got that much pressure on us. We just need to play our game and enjoy it."
