Soni Sori said men on a motorcycle had thrown liquid on her face on Saturday night. Doctors said it was not acid.
Ms Sori is a member of Delhi's governing Aam Aadmi Party.
She is a critic of police violence towards tribespeople in Chhattisgarh, which is facing a Maoist insurgency.
Ms Sori told the BBC that men on a motorcycle had stopped her car, forced her to get out and thrown liquid on her face.
She told reporters on Sunday that she was worried about her children's security and the attack was an attempt to intimidate her further.
"There is a danger to me and my children. I got a [telephone] call on Saturday evening and was told that some people may attack me," she was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.
"But I never thought that something like this would actually happen".
The police said an investigation had been launched into the incident.
"But you cannot call it an attack - her face has been blackened by some grease," a senior police official said.
Ms Sori was arrested in 2011 on charges of being a courier for the Maoists and has alleged she was tortured and sexually assaulted by Chhattisgarh police during her imprisonment.
More recently she has alleged harassment by government officials in the area.
