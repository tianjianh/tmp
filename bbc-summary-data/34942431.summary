[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Radicalisation risk' pupils in Waltham Forest named

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The names of seven primary school pupils feared to be at risk of radicalisation have been inadvertently revealed, the BBC has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pupil's first names were mistakenly revealed by Greenleaf Primary School in east London after correspondence with Waltham Forest Council was released in response to a Freedom of Information request by a parent.
It came after classes at the school took part in a social cohesion survey. The council said it had "taken legal steps" to recall the information.
The students named were involved in a programme known as Brit - Building Resilience through Integration and Trust.
Targeted at nine to 11-year-olds, it involved lesson plans and workbooks about identity and belonging.
Pupils were asked if they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements.
They included:
Some parents complained they had not been consulted and others said it was racist and unfairly targeted Muslim children.
Parent Haras Ahmed submitted the FoI request referring to one class at the school, asking if certain children had been targeted.
BBC Local Live has more on this and other London stories.
The response to him from the school and council included the line: "Our project will combine a universal teaching module with a range of tools designed to ensure early intervention for any children who are felt to be vulnerable to radicalisation."
Mr Ahmed said: "It's been a disaster from start to finish.
"Firstly we're told it's a social cohesion policy and then after various questioning they accept it's a de-radicalisation process and then to release the names of the children in such a insensitive way.
"Any parent in any school - whether they are of a Muslim faith or non-Muslim or no faith - would be appalled by their children's data, such sensitive data, are released to a member of the public."
Waltham Forest Council said: "The school has informed the families affected of the action that the council is taking on its behalf, and that the council has launched a full investigation."
