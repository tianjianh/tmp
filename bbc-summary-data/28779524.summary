Galileo: What does a more accurate sat-nav system mean?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With the planned launch of two satellites aboard a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana later this month, Europe is pushing ahead with its own satellite-navigation system, known as Galileo.

It promises much great accuracy in locating where we or objects are on the planet and could have a profound effect on how we live our lives.
So far we've used the US GPS (Global Positioning System) which is accurate up to a few metres. Galileo has the potential to offer accuracy up to a few centimetres.
The potential practical benefits of more accurate navigation include driverless cars,  more flexible charging systems on toll motorways, more efficient air traffic control, more accurate navigation for ships, and even helping blind people get around cities.
It will allow you to know where you are not just in a street - but even in a building.
"Galileo promises to be much more accurate than the US-owned GPS," says Steve Smart, head of the space programme at CGI, the Canadian tech company that has been developing some of Galileo's commercial applications.
It could also help improve capacity on Europe's rail networks.
As many rail signalling systems are still relatively unsophisticated, it means that for safety reasons trains have to be well-separated.
Galileo will give much more accurate real-time read-outs of trains' locations, which should allow operators to run more trains on a particular stretch of track - welcome news for many commuters if that means less overcrowding in the rush hour.

"The commercial service has the potential to improve the performance of existing location services for all user communities," says Carlo des Dorides, executive director of GSA, Europe's satellite navigation agency.
Indeed, driverless cars are being allowed on UK public roads from next year. Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable said the technology has "very, very large" potential.
Much of this is due to the prospects of more accurate satellite-derived location data.
The real challenge when it comes to accuracy is built-up areas. Here, in "urban canyons" a user can effectively be hidden from satellites. In such cases, what's known as signal attenuation - or weakening - and signal refraction off surrounding tall buildings, can reduce accuracy.
But in tests, when Galileo has been used alongside GPS and Glonass, it is providing a much more accurate location signal even in urban areas, and is also shortening Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF) - the time it takes for your device to lock on to signals from the satellites.
However, the project is hugely expensive, and Galileo has been plagued by delays and cost over-runs.
Setting up the system and deploying the satellites is costing about 5bn euros (Â£3.9bn; $6.6bn), a significant sum when budgets across Europe are under pressure.
Yet the bill could rise still further. With annual operating expenditure of 750m euros over 20 years, Galileo's total costs could be more than 20bn euros, says the eurosceptic think-tank, Open Europe.
