[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 1-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gavin Massey scored late on to break Leyton Orient's run of six consecutive losses as they earned a point away at Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Francois Zoko's strike in first-half stoppage time gave the Glovers the lead but Massey smashed home for his relegation-threatened team late on to seal a point and leave them three shy of safety.
A poor first period from both sides produced few chances, with Sandro Semedo wasting a two-on-one counter attack for Orient and Liam Shephard slicing Yeovil's best chance wide after being played in behind.
Yet just as a half-time stalemate looked inevitable, the hosts took the lead in the first minute of stoppage time. Sam Sargeant did well to parry a Tom Eaves shot from distance, but Zoko was quickest to react and turn in the rebound.
There were cards aplenty as tempers flared after the break and the visitors threw everything at it and committed more men forward.
It was a tactic that finally paid off when Massey capitalised on poor Yeovil defending to rifle the ball into the roof of the net on 88 minutes.
