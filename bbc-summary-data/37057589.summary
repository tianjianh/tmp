Labour leadership: Party wins appeal against voting rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has won an appeal against a High Court ruling that allowed new members a vote in its leadership contest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party challenged the verdict blocking its plans to prevent members who joined after 12 January from voting unless they paid Â£25 extra.
It said its ruling NEC, not courts, was the "ultimate arbiter" of the rules.
The Court of Appeal upheld the challenge.
