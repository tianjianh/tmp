The device was stolen during the band's concert at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on 25 May.
Northumbria Police found the phones at a house in Whitley Bay hours later after using a GPS locator app to find it.
A 25-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of theft.
Det Insp Dave Swinburn said the force advised concert goers to be "extra vigilant" and recommended smartphone owners install tracking software on their devices.
