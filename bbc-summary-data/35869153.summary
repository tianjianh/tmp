Sam Burgess: South Sydney Rabbitohs forward cleared of serious injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England forward Sam Burgess has been released from hospital after being cleared of serious injury during South Sydney's loss to St George Illawarra.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burgess, 27, spent two nights in hospital after Sunday's clash of heads with fellow Englishman Mike Cooper.
He lay prone on the pitch for several minutes, while receiving medical care, before being taken off on a stretcher.
MRI and CT scans showed no damage to the vertebrae or spinal cord and Burgess is expected to recover fully.
The Rabbitohs say they will continue to monitor the former Bradford prop for any muscle or neurological issues but he will miss Good Friday's NRL game against Canterbury Bulldogs.
Burgess returned to Australia in November after nine months with rugby union Premiership side Bath.
