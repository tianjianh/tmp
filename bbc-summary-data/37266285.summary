The man in his 30s suffered multiple stab wounds at about 07:00 BST.
West Midlands Police have cordoned off the scene of the killing at Carter Road in the Whitmore Reans area.
Det Insp Jim Munro said there was no risk to the public, and officers were "working at pace to close-in on the person thought to be responsible". Police appealed for witnesses.
They want to speak to anyone who saw a grey Audi A3 speeding away from the scene.
The victim, who was found in the street, was pronounced dead in hospital after medical crews tried to save him, police added.
