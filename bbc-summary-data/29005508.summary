The Bluebirds agreed a fee in excess of Â£5m with the Ligue 1 side for the 26-year-old.
Gabon international Ecuele Manga underwent a medical in the Welsh capital ahead of his move to the Championship club.
Cardiff also signed Wales defender Danny Gabbidon on transfer deadline day as a player-coach.
Mehmet Dalman, the Cardiff chairman, admitted the signing of Ecuele Manga had been a drawn-out affair.
"This has probably been one of the most difficult transactions I've ever done, negotiations were not easy," Dalman said.
"He wasn't a done deal until the very end because he's a player that other clubs were interested in and that's an indication that he is an important player for us."
Following his side's 1-1 draw at Fulham on Saturday, Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he was looking to make one more addition to his squad before the end of the transfer window.
The former Manchester United striker has been looking to strengthen his defensive options following the departure of last season's captain Steven Caulker who has joined Queens Park Rangers and an injury to Ben Turner (ankle).
Sean Morrison was signed from Reading on 15 August to bolster the defence, which has only kept one clean sheet in the club's seven league and cup matches this season - in the 1-0 home win against Wigan.
Cardiff have made a steady start to their Championship campaign as they aim to return to the Premier League at the first attempt.
They are ninth with eight points from their five league matches so far, having lost just once 1-0 away against Wolves.
The Welsh club's next two league matches are at home - where they have a 100% record so far this season - against Norwich and Middlesbrough on 13 and 16 September.
