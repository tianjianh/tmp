Headteachers have warned parents that primary schools in parts of County Down are facing "financial disaster".

Fifteen principals from schools in Comber and Newtownards have written a joint letter urging parents to contact the authorities over school budgets.
The letter said spending cuts will mean fewer teachers and resources, larger classes and worse education outcomes.
It urged parents to contact MLAs, the Department of Education and the Education Authority about the issue.
"We all strongly believe that parents and guardians should know of the current and future financial difficulties that face all schools in the area," they wrote.
However, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said that "providing financial assistance to schools" had been one of the Education Minister Peter Weir's priorities.
The principals' letter said that each school represented was facing a "crisis, no matter how strong the enrolment or how big or small the school".
"In the past five years the money given to school per child has only risen by 0.9% whilst costs have risen by approximately 14.5%," it said.
"This dire financial situation is not being addressed by either the Department of Education or the Education Authority.
"The impact is real, urgent and disastrous."
In response, a DE spokesperson said Mr Weir had taken measures to ease financial pressures on schools.
"The minister proactively reviewed the overall education budget and reallocated over Â£7m of new funding to the 2016-17 schools budget," they said.
"2017-18 budgets have not yet been agreed.
"The 2017-18 budget outcome for all departments, including education, will depend on the decisions taken by an incoming administration."
In January, Mr Weir told the Northern Ireland Assembly that schools needed an extra Â£240m over the next three years just to maintain spending at 2015/16 levels.
