Visitors have been leaving vehicles illegally in passing places on roads or parking badly on verges near the Fairy Pools and the Quiraing.
Officers from Police Scotland's Lochaber and Skye division have posted messages on Twitter about the problems.
In one police warned: "If your car causes an obstruction it may be towed away."
"Park safe," officers said in another of their tweets.
The Fairy Pools are a series of waterfalls and pools that give views of Skye's famous Cuillin hills.
The Quiraing is part of the Trotternish Ridge which was formed by a series of massive ancient landslips.
The Quiraing was the largest of the slips.
