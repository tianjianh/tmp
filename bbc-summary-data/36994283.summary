[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second-half equaliser from Yeovil Town striker Tom Eaves saw the Glovers earn a point at Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward rose highest to meet a deep cross from Kevin Dawson, sending his header beyond keeper Christian Walton in the 78th minute.
Earlier, visiting stopper Artur Krysiak made a stunning save to deny Glen Rea the opening goal on 18 minutes, wonderfully sticking a hand out to turn his header over the bar.
Luton had the lead on 26 minutes with a wonderful long range shot by Stephen O'Donnell, the defender hammering in from 25 yards.
Yeovil's Otis Khan fired straight at goalkeeper Christian Walton, while the hosts went close to a second, with Jack Marriott denied by Krysiak, Danny Hylton failing to turn in O'Donnell's cross and then Marriott's angled attempt flews wide.
However, with 13 minutes to go, the visitors had the equaliser their play deserved through Eaves' towering header.
Luton almost won it in the closing stages, O'Donnell trying his luck again, but this time swerved narrowly over.
