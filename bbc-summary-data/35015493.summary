Worcestershire batsman Tom Fell has been given the all-clear to fly to Australia to play grade cricket following testicular cancer surgery.

The 22-year-old revealed last month that he had an operation in October.
Fell saw a specialist earlier this week and will fly out to Perth on Monday to play for Mount Lawley.
"The results were all fine. I'm looking forward to playing some cricket again and it's great news that I can go away until the end of February," he said.
Fell has decided not to have chemotherapy, but instead have regular check-ups and he will be seen by doctors every month while he is in Western Australia.
He scored 1,084 Championship runs in 2015, making him the youngest batsman in county cricket to pass 1,000 runs for the season last summer, and subsequently signed a new three-year contract with Worcestershire.
