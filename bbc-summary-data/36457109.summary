Manager Roy Hodgson says England will not cheat in order to gain an advantage at Euro 2016.

Midfielder Eric Dier has previously said England need to be more streetwise to compete with other nations and suffered from being too honest.
But Hodgson, whose side start Euro 2016 against Russia on 11 June, said: "I won't be spending time teaching players to stay down or feign injury.
"I want to teach players how to defend better and attack better."
Hodgson added: "That's what I've been trying to do for four years and will continue to do so."
Striker Harry Kane barely reacted after being kicked in the head by Portugal's Bruno Alves in England's 1-0 friendly win on Thursday, a challenge for which the visiting defender was shown a straight red card.
Tottenham's Kane said it was not in his nature to over-act, an approach which Hodgson agrees with.
"Harry's first instinct when he got kicked severely was to carry on and to try and do something with the ball," he said.
"Some people might say that's very laudable, others might say you've got to go down, you've got to be cynical. I find the cynicism quite a hard thing to coach.
"Unfortunately that's a very hard thing to teach. I think it has to be taught - if it's going to be taught - at a very early age and be part of your culture; I've said many times I don't think it is part of our culture."
