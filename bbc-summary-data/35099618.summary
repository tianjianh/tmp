Sam Burgess: February rugby league comeback date set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Burgess will return to rugby league in an All-Stars game on 13 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burgess, 27, rejoined South Sydney Rabbitohs after cutting short his time in rugby union following England's ill-fated World Cup campaign.
Burgess, whose move has not yet been sanctioned by the National Rugby League, has been named in a World XIII to play an Indigenous Australian side.
England trio James Graham, Gareth Widdop and Tom Burgess, Sam's younger brother, have also been picked.
All three were members of the squad that defeated New Zealand in the recent Test series.
