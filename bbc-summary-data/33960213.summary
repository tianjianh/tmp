Essex head coach Paul Grayson has left the county by mutual consent after eight years in charge.

The 44-year-old's departure follows quarter-final defeat in both the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast.
He was promoted from second-team coach in July 2007 and guided them to Friends Provident Trophy victory in 2008.
Essex have since failed to win any silverware, and are sixth in County Championship Division Two with four games left to play this season.
Assistant head coach Chris Silverwood, a former England pace bowler, will take temporary charge until the end of the season.
"I have had 19 wonderful years at Essex, both as a player and as a coach, but I now feel the time is right for a new challenge," Grayson told the club website.
"I have always been a strong supporter of the club's policy of developing our own players into first-class cricketers and it is a pleasure to see so many doing well in the game.
"I would like to thank the players for their hard work and dedication, particularly the three captains I have worked with; Mark Pettini, James Foster and Ryan ten Doeschate."
