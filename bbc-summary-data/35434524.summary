In response to claims that the MoD could not resource legacy cases, Lord Justice Weir said the MoD was not short of money as it was fighting wars across the world.
The judge was examining a case of an alleged shoot to kill policy - and also the shooting dead of a father of six by a covert army unit in the early 1970s.
Ita Dungan was in court.
