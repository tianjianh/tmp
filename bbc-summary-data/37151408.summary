[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chester's Ryan Lloyd cancelled out Kieran Murtagh's first-half opener, but Joey Jones gave Woking an interval lead and Chigozie Ugwu added a third in the second half.
Visiting goalkeeper Jon Worsnop was forced to push Woking right-back Jake Caprice's dangerous low cross on to the post in the ninth minute before Murtagh fired the home side ahead with a 25-yard drive into the bottom corner.
The visitors were back on level terms within eight minutes when midfielder Lloyd glanced home Johnny Hunt's cross, but Woking went in at the break 2-1 ahead as Max Kretzschmar's ball was headed in by Jones in the 28th minute.
Worsnop parried Kretzschmar's header and Woking substitute Zak Ansah fired into the side netting before the Cards went 3-1 ahead in the 75th minute through Ugwu's powerful drive.
