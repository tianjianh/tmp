Former Scottish Conservative MP Sir Albert McQuarrie dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former Scottish Conservative MP Sir Albert McQuarrie has died at the age of 98.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Albert was MP for East Aberdeenshire and then Banff and Buchan from 1979 until 1987.
He was beaten in the general election by the SNP's Alex Salmond.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she was "saddened" by news of Sir Albert's death, and highlighted his "Buchan Bulldog" spirit.
Sir Albert - who lived in Mintlaw - turned 98 on 1 January, and died in his sleep on Wednesday.
Mr Salmond said: "He revelled in his title of the 'Buchan Bulldog' and we enjoyed some fierce political debates, as worthy opponents should.
"He will be much missed, obviously friends and family, but also the wider political and public life in Scotland."
