Swansea's victory at Arsenal will raise the spirits of boss Francesco Guidolin as he recovers from a chest infection, says first-team coach Alan Curtis.

Head coach Guidolin, 60, was taken to hospital hours before the Swans won 2-1 to move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.
"I have had a voicemail from him and he is obviously delighted," Curtis said.
"I'm sure it'll give him a little bit of a lift. He should be released on Friday."
Curtis added: "It will depend how he is feeling, whether he will be at the game on Saturday against Norwich City."
Swansea are now unbeaten in their last four league visits to Arsenal, after victory in 2015, a 2-2 draw in March 2014 and victory in December 2012.
"We've come and won at this place before - it's actually a very good ground for us," Curtis added.
"But I think it has extra significance today because we desperately needed to pick up the three points.
"It's a huge three points for us."
Curtis confirmed that Guidolin made the decision to make six changes to the Swansea starting XI, including a Premier League debut for left-back Stephen Kingsley.
"I thought he (Kingsley), was outstanding. He put a couple of great crosses in and defended really well," said Curtis.
"To be fair to the boys who played tonight, they all put their hand up to play at the weekend.
"It's just a little reminder that we are a good footballing team when we play well.
"I thought we were excellent, especially in the second half."
Swansea host Norwich on Saturday before a trip to Bournemouth on 12 March and then bottom club Aston Villa visit the Liberty Stadium on 19 March.
