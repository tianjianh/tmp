Kenneth McRae, 87, from Bathgate, sustained serious head injuries when his Nissan Micra left the road at the Dechmont Roundabout, Livingston, on Sunday 22 January.
He was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where he passed away on Thursday 2 February.
His family said he would be "sadly missed".
Mr McRae's family said: "Originally from Portobello, Edinburgh, Kenneth moved to Bathgate to be closer to family. The accident which caused this sudden and unexpected loss of our father, grandfather and great grandfather has been difficult to take.
"He was a good man who was always willing to help people and give advice.
"As a retired tree surgeon, Ken was local to Bathgate and known for attending the 50+ choir, writing groups such as the Quill and Scottish writers. He also enjoyed painting and writing poetry.
"He was involved in many of the local community groups in and around West Lothian. He will be always loved and sadly missed."
