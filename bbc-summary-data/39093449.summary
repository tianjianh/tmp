Belfast remain seven points behind Elite League leaders Cardiff Devils after Steve Saviano's four goals helped the Giants beat Fife 7-2 on Saturday.

Two of Saviano's goals came in the first period with Mike Forney also on target as Sebastian Thinel replied for the Flyers.
Carlo Finucci's strike cut Belfast's lead before two more Saviano goals and a double from Jerome Leduc.
Cardiff, second-placed Sheffield and Belfast all have eight games left.
The leaders hammered Coventry Blaze 8-0 on Saturday night while Sheffield remain a point ahead of the Giants after defeating Nottingham Panthers 4-2.
While Belfast's title hopes now look a long shot, player-coach Derrick Walser is unlikely to give up on the chase just yet with his side still to face Cardiff twice and also having a contest with Sheffield.
All three title contenders are back in action on Sunday with the Giants facing Nottingham away (16:00 GMT), Cardiff taking on Edinburgh Capital away and Sheffield also on the road as they play Fife.
