Italian coffee maker Lavazza buys Carte Noire 'for €800m'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italian coffee firm Lavazza has offered to buy French brand Carte Noire from Douwe Egberts, the firm has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It did not disclose how much it was paying but sources said the deal was worth around €800m (£550m).
France would become Lavazza's second biggest market, and the deal would almost treble the Italian company's turnover in the country.
The agreement is subject to approval from the European Commission and French authorities.
Under the terms of the offer, Lavazza will take control of the Carte Noire business within much of Europe, with exceptions including Carte Noire instant coffee.
The deal will include Carte Noire in-home roast and ground coffee, filter pads and its Nespresso-compatible capsules business.
Lavazza would also acquire Carte Noire's Laverune factory in Languedoc-Roussillon.
JP Morgan advised Lavazza on the deal.
