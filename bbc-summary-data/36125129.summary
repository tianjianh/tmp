Francesco Totti urged Roma fans not to be divided over his uncertain future, while Juventus moved a step closer to clinching the Serie A title.
And Bayern Munich won again at the top in Germany.
But what else happened in Europe this weekend? BBC Sport rounds up the stories you might have missed.
Feyenoord might be well off the pace in the Dutch title race, but that did not stop fans and players celebrating in style as they won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.
Six years after captaining the Rotterdam club to Cup success, former Rangers, Arsenal and Barcelona star Giovanni van Bronckhorst was a winner again as Feyenoord coach as they beat Utrecht 2-1 with a 75th-minute own-goal sealing victory.
Fans hit the streets of Rotterdam to celebrate with some supporters leaping into a fountain in the centre of the city.
Meanwhile the players, including former Liverpool favourite Dirk Kuyt, upheld the club tradition of collecting the trophy wearing team dressing gowns.
Less than a week after getting under the skin of football fans with an apparent dive to win Bayern Munich a penalty, Arturo Vidal stripped down in an effort to repair his damaged reputation.
The Chilean midfielder angered Werder Bremen fans and neutrals alike with the way he went down to win his side a penalty in their German Cup semi-final in midweek.
But, having opened the scoring for his side in a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday that left them on the brink of another Bundesliga title, Vidal set about showing he is a nice guy after all.
He left the field at the Olympic Stadium in just his boots, socks and pants after handing his shirt and shorts to a pair of Bayern fans at full-time.
Anderlecht suffered a heavy defeat in their latest game in Belgian football's complicated play-off phase, and their fans were not happy.
The Brussels club were beaten 4-2 at KV Oostende to leave them trailing leaders Club Brugge by three points at the top of the six-club play-off table that decides the title and European qualification.
But the game was halted for five minutes near the end when, after former West Brom winger Yassine El Ghanassy scored his second goal to put the home side 4-1 ahead, Anderlecht fans invaded the field to show their anger and the referee took the players from the field on safety grounds.
The game did eventually restart after Anderlecht captain Silvio Proto appealed to the fans for calm, and Idrissa Sylla scored a late consolation goal.
Fenerbahce were leading 4-0 when their top-flight match was abandoned as Trabzonspor fans attacked an official and ran onto the pitch.
One of their supporters tackled, kicked and punched an assistant referee until security stepped in.
"Trabzonspor fans stormed the pitch and attacked the referee... The game will be ruled 4-0 in favour of Fenerbahce," the Istanbul club said on Twitter.
Nani and Robin van Persie were among the scorers before the mayhem.
Steven Fletcher hoped a move across the Channel would kick-start his career after a frustrating spell battling relegation with Sunderland.
Yet instead of finding some respite after joining Marseille, the Scotland international has suffered another difficult spell in France with the club yet to win a league game with him in the team.
The 29-year-old has scored just once in Ligue 1 and once in the French Cup since his loan move at the end of the January transfer window, and Marseille have dropped from ninth to 16th in the table.
They drew 1-1 at home to Nantes on Sunday, with the former Wolves and Burnley forward substituted after 69 minutes.
Levante are favourites for relegation from Spain's top division, but on Sunday La Liga's bottom side looked poised to give their survival hopes a huge boost until a morale-sapping late collapse.
They led Athletic Bilbao 2-0 with two minutes of normal time remaining when the Europa League-chasing side staged a remarkable comeback to claim a point.
Markel Susaeta scored on 88 minutes to give Bilbao hope before Mikel San Jose broke Levante hearts by scoring in stoppage time to make it 2-2.
Victory would have taken Levante within a point of second-bottom Getafe and within four points of all four of the sides above them.
