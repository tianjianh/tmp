[SN]TITLE[SN]
National League: New date for Macclesfield Town v Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macclesfield Town will host Wrexham in the National League on Tuesday, 27 September, with kick off at 19:45 BST.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuesday's match between the two sides was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch at Moss Rose.
A torrential downpour just over an hour before the scheduled 19:45 BST kick-off time left large sections of the pitch under water.
Referee Steve Rushton waited until 18:45 BST before deciding there was no chance of any play.
