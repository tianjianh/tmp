St Helens' squad this year is better than the Grand Final winners in 2014, says head coach Keiron Cunningham.

Saints have lost two of their opening three games so far this season.
Cunningham, 39, worked as assistant coach under Nathan Brown two years ago as they won the League Leaders' Shield, as well as the title at Old Trafford.
"It's stronger than the squad that won the trophy in 2014, a lot stronger - I'm more than convinced," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"People look back and talk about the old Saints sides, you're not going to see that side.
"Nowadays, if a St Helens side was around, when you've had Sean Long, Keiron Cunningham, Paul Sculthorpe, Paul Wellens, then you'd have a bunch of stocking fillers around them because of the salary cap.
"The value of those players now would be immense and you'd spend a lot of money to bring it in.
"We do our best within the remit of what we can do with the money that we have to spend."
