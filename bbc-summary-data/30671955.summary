The Commonweal School won the instrument in a public vote on the musician's website and he gave it to them on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1.
Pupils made a video for the song and beat competition from 150 entries.
Cullum, who is from Wiltshire, said he was "thrilled" they had won the piano.
He said: "It's going to a great home. They're an amazing school."
The song was written by the school's music technician, Nick Weaver.
Mr Weaver described the experience of winning the piano and meeting Cullum as "surreal".
Fellow teacher Ali Sutcliffe said it was "like a school trip that had gone a little bit crazy".
The Yamaha piano has been used by the singer-songwriter for the past 10 years.
He said: "I have written songs on it. I have recorded albums with it. I have toured the world with it."
He said people "would think the competition had been fixed" because of his links to Wiltshire where he grew up, "but it came down to a public vote".
"I watched it [Commonweal School's video] and I was singing the song straight after. It was so much fun to watch and listen to."
