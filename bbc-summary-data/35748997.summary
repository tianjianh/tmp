The world number one will miss this weekend's Dutch Open with a knee injury, but hopes to return for April's President's Cup in Germany.
Jones, 22, is all but qualified for Rio and is prepared to miss competitions to be ready for Brazil.
"It's frustrating when you get little niggles but it's better to be safe than sorry," she told BBC Radio Wales.
"The pinnacle is the Olympics, so it's do or die for me. I'll put every single thing I can into it and I really want to win.
"I want to be Olympic champion again and to be double Olympic champion would be amazing."
Jones, from Flint, was 19 when she beat China's Yuzhuo Hou to win the women's -57kg title at London 2012.
She also won gold at the 2015 European Games in Baku with victory over Ana Zaninovic of Croatia.
