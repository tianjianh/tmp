She was left with "possible life-threatening head injuries" when she was struck by a force vehicle with its blue lights flashing in Bristol city centre.
Police said the 33-year-old woman was hit at the junction of Stokes Croft and Ninetree Hill at 22:00 GMT on Saturday.
A man was arrested on suspicion of assault and a knife seized, police say.
The woman is being treated at Southmead Hospital.
