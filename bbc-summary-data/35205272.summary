Tens of thousands of people are expected in Edinburgh city centre where Biffy Clyro will headline this year's sold-out Concert in the Gardens.
The city's celebrations got under way on Wednesday with a torchlight procession.
It saw 10,000 torchbearers travel from George IV Bridge to Calton Hill for the fireworks finale.
This year's street party in Edinburgh will also feature a message from British astronaut Tim Peake being beamed onto screens just before midnight.
Pete Irvine, director of Unique Events which produces Edinburgh's Hogmanay on behalf of the city council, said: "The Torchlight Procession is just the start of a fabulous three days of events for Edinburgh's Hogmanay.
"It was great to see many thousands of residents and visitors to the city not only participating in the procession, but lining the streets of the city to enjoy the spectacle."
As many as 75,000 revellers, from more than 80 countries, are expected to attend the street party, enjoying entertainment across four stages and seven screens along the length of Princes Street.
Mr Irvine said: "This is a truly global event with revellers joining us from around the world. This year we've gone one better and will be visited from space."
Elsewhere, a firework display will be held in Aberdeen where about 3,000 people are expected to join in the celebrations in the city centre.
Other major events in the north east include Stonehaven's Open Air in the Square, the Aberdeenshire town's fireballs ceremony and the Gig at the Brig in Ellon.
Ch Insp Richard Craig, of Police Scotland, said: "The festive season is a fantastic period of the year and Hogmanay is a traditional time of celebration.
"We want to encourage people to enjoy themselves, have fun with their friends and family members but to be safe and responsible.
"Following a few simple tips can help to make the most of your evening out; arrive in plenty of time, plan your journey to and from the event and make sure you are dressed for the weather conditions.
"Being aware of your alcohol consumption, staying together with friends and looking after your valuables can help keep you safe at the busiest time of the year."
