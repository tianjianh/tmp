A huge gorse fire which caused the evacuation of a north-east caravan park has been brought under control.
Fire crews were called to an area of wild land near Lossiemouth's Covesea lighthouse about 11:00 on Tuesday.
A cloud of thick grey smoke covered the area and several minor roads in the area were closed.
Firefighters remain at the scene damping it down.
