The structure linking the village of Staveley, near Kendal, with the A591 has been closed since late last year.
Cumbria County Council said the construction of a permanent bridge would now be finished by April 2017.
It follows talks with the Environment Agency.
Preparatory works are due to get under way in the next few weeks, the council added.
David Brockbank, owner of Staveley Mill Yard, welcomed the new timeframe and said it would "be of enormous benefit to the community and businesses in the village".
