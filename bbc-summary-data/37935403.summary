Arthur Heeler-Frood, 15, has been missing from his family home in Axminster, Devon, for more than two months.
As he left for school on his bike on 6 September, he said "don't worry mum, I've got my fluorescent [vest]".
His mother Caroline Heeler-Frood said: "That was the last word I heard from him."

A letter from Arthur arrived through the post for his parents the next day which said he would be back within a year.
The letter said: "I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please don't try to find me or make me come home."
There have been no positive sightings of Arthur and he has not tried to make contact, Mrs Heeler-Frood told BBC Radio 5Live.
She said: "We had absolutely no idea that he had anything in mind at all. You rake over all the conversations you have and there was nothing that suggested he was thinking about this.
"In some way its consoling he had planned this initial stage. But there is nothing to indicate what his intentions were."
To Mum and Dad,
I have run away because I am bored of my life. Please don't try to find me or make me come home.
I don't know how long I will be away for but it won't be longer than a year. You will find my school uniform in a bin bag in a small barn in the field on the green, down the road near Membury Church.
My bike is chained to the fence and there is a spare key to the lock on the window. Please apologise to the restaurant and tell them that I will no longer be able to work there.
I know you will be upset but understand that I have to do this,
From Arthur.
Arthur's mother appealed to "any employee at Facebook" to help Devon and Cornwall Police gain access to the 15-year-old's account which they have not been able to access.
Arthur took Â£350 in cash with him, but did not take his phone, passport or many belongings with him.
Mrs Heeler-Frood said: "Arthur, please just make contact with us, call us, phone us, text us, write. We're absolutely desperate to know that you're safe."
Supt Sam de Reya said: "We are appealing to business owners, likely to be restaurateurs, hoteliers and cafe owners who may have had a young man work for them in the last few months or anyone who may have provided accommodation to him in that time period."
Arthur is described as white, 5ft 4in (1.6m) tall, of slight build with short and light brown hair. Arthur may now have considerably shorter hair, possibly shaven, as he took hair clippers with him.
