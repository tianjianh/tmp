Edinburgh: Injured Sean Kennedy to miss remainder of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh scrum-half Sean Kennedy has been ruled out for the rest of the season through injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old has had surgery for what the Pro12 club describe as "an ongoing shoulder complaint".
Edinburgh estimate that the former Scotland Under-20 and Scotland Sevens player will be sidelined for up to six months.
Kennedy, who had loan spells with Glasgow Warriors and London Irish, is under contract until summer 2016.
His last appearance for Edinburgh came as a replacement during the 38-20 European Challenge Cup win over Bordeaux-Begles on 23 January.
