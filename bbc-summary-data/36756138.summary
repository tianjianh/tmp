Keating fisted into the net in the third minute after Mackey had played the ball in.
Gearoid McKiernan (3), Dara McVeety, Mackey and Killian Clarke pointed to give Cavan a 1-6 to 0-5 interval lead.
Mackey finished a good move for the second goal for Cavan who went down to 14 men when McVeety was sent-off.
After the break, Cavan added points through Keating, Seanie Johnston (3), Tom Hayes and McKiernan.
Carlow's second-half points were scored by Robbie Molloy, Darragh O'Brien, Chris Blake, Daniel St Ledger and John Murphy.
Cavan, beaten in the Ulster Championship semi-final replay by Tyrone last weekend, always looked in control and go into the hat for Monday morning's third round draw.
