"He is more than ready," Mourinho said of the current Sunderland manager. "He is a good motivator and can create a good team spirit."
Ex-Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp told the BBC: "I was so bored watching the Euros. He'll get the players playing at a Premier League style and pace."
Allardyce's appointment is expected to be confirmed later this week.
The Football Association's three-man selection panel of Martin Glenn, David Gill and Dan Ashworth told Thursday's full FA board meeting of their decision, which was approved.
Negotiations are continuing on the 61-year-old's backroom staff, salary and a compensation package for Sunderland - where Allardyce has one year remaining on his contract.
Mourinho, speaking on United's pre-season tour of China, added: "I wish him the best. I promise to try and supply him players and try to make sure the English players are always available in good condition."
Redknapp, who was a contender for the England job before the appointment of Roy Hodgson in 2012, also spoke about Allardyce's style.
"He will get the ball in the box, he'll get crosses in, he'll get shots in. People get carried away with this image of Sam," said the 69-year-old.
Allardyce is second only to Redknapp as the most experienced English manager in the Premier League, in terms of games managed - Allardyce has overseen 467 matches to Redknapp's 641.
However, Redknapp, who last managed at club level with QPR in 2015, warned that the experience of being the national team boss would pose different challenges.
"You don't get much time with players. It doesn't give him a huge amount of time to get the lads playing the style he wants, so of course he'll have to do it quicker than he's done at club level," he added.
Meanwhile, Sven-Goran Eriksson, who led England to the quarter-finals of three major tournaments between 2001 and 2006, said: "Sam's been in English football for a long time. He's always been doing very well."
Allardyce was interviewed for the England job by the Football Association (FA) when Eriksson left after the 2006 World Cup.
"If the FA want an Englishman, he is one of several good names," said Eriksson. "I wish him the best of luck. I know he is very organised. He knows all the players and he wants the job."
Eriksson said that a result like England's Euro 2016 last-16 defeat by Iceland, which led to Roy Hodgson's resignation, "should not happen".
"What is successful for England? Is it quarter-final or semi-final? Winning?" asked the 68-year-old Swede, who now manages Shanghai SIPG in the Chinese Super League.
"I know the fans and the FA are dreaming about reaching semi-finals and finals and winning a big tournament," he said, adding that England's World Cup triumph in 1966 was "a long time ago".
