[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UKIP mayoral candidate says immigration is causing a "chronic housing shortage" in London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Launching the party's manifesto, Peter Whittle said the housing crisis could not be solved by setting "arbitrary targets" but by addressing both demand and supply.
He also promised establish a London-wide homelessness register.
Conservative Zac Goldsmith has pledged to boost house-building to 50,000 a year.
Liberal Democrat candidate Caroline Pidgeon has promised to fund 50,000 council homes, while Labour's Sadiq Khan has vowed to "name and shame" poor landlords.
Mr Whittle said: "The chronic housing shortage and  the huge strain on our infrastructure in the capital are not being addressed by the other candidates and in this manifesto UKIP outlines the only real way to provide a credible solution - and that is dealing with the rise in immigration."
Other plans in the manifesto include:
Mr Whittle said UKIP would take a zero-tolerance approach to "cultural crimes", including female genital mutilation.
He also wants to give borough commanders more responsibility for local policing.
He added: "Only UKIP are advocating a 'leave' vote in the upcoming European Union referendum as we know this is the only way we can regain control of our borders.
"We are giving the people of London a new voice to fight their corner."
