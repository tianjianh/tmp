Six Nations 2016: Dunbar relishes Scotland return in time for France

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland centre Alex Dunbar intends to train hard and "enjoy" being back with the national squad after almost a year out through injury.

Dunbar, 25, has not played in a dark blue jersey since tearing knee ligaments 12 months ago during the build-up to facing England.
The injury ruled him out of last year's World Cup and he has more recently been recovering from a thigh strain.
"It's been frustrating," Dunbar told BBC Scotland.
"You do all the hard work to come to fitness, play a game and feel good then go on to the next game and you pick up something that means you can't lace the boots up for two weeks.
"But I feel good now. Hopefully it lasts."
Dunbar played the first half of Glasgow's victory over Cardiff Blues on Sunday but was withdrawn at half-time by head coach Gregor Townsend, who told the media it was a decision made after discussions with the Scotland coaching team.
Vern Cotter called Dunbar into the national squad the following day and he is now in contention to face France.

"You never know," a smiling Dunbar said. "I don't pick the team. I'd be in if I did!
"The games I've been back playing for Glasgow I've done all right. I feel good just now and fresh so if I get the chance then I'd jump on it."
Dunbar, who has 14 senior caps, has been analysing matches during his recuperation and hopes to add elements he has watched to his own game.
"You see bits and pieces from games and how certain teams play," he explained. "Some teams want to go out and attack and score tries while others are a bit more physical and the games are more of a tactical affair.
"Some bits you think you could add to your game. You've just got to go out in training and work on it.

"There's a great buzz around the squad. Boys are laughing and joking and it's all pretty positive. Things are just a bit more relaxed and it takes the pressure off."
Assistant coach Nathan Hines says Scotland are focussed on their own game rather than developing a game-plan to combat the physicality of Sunday's visitors.
"We're obviously looking at what they do and what they've got the potential to do," he said.
"But most of the focus is on us and improving on what we did against Italy."
