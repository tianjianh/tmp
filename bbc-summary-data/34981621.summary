The Kard Bar, on Cross Street, went up in flames shortly before 09:00 GMT on Tuesday.
It took firefighters more than five hours to bring under control.
Nearby flats were evacuated and more than 80 students spent the night in temporary accommodation.

The cause has not yet been determined.
It is believed someone may have been trapped on the upper floors of the poster and print shop.
John Baines, of Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Our operations are continuing. Until we get into the building and do a full analysis as part of our investigation we are unable to conform whether all persons are accounted for."
The alarm was raised by a member of a nearby taxi company.
More than 50 firefighters were at the scene at the height of the blaze and thick smoke caused the closure of Westgate Road, Clayton Road and Cross Street.
Westgate Road reopened on Tuesday, but Charlotte Square, Cross Street, Low Friars part of Fenkall Street with the junction of Clayton Street remained shut on Wednesday morning.
