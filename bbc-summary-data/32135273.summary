A local TV channel has apologised after a presenter used a swearword to describe a colleague on air.

Helen McDermott, a former Anglia News and BBC Radio Norfolk presenter, used the sexually explicit term to describe Darren Eadie, her Mustard TV co-host.
The derogatory term was broadcast on the Norwich-based channel's The Mustard Show during a pre-recorded link.
Managing director Fiona Ryder said: "Helen and Mustard TV apologise for this lapse and any offence caused."
Eadie, a former Premiership footballer, began a link by saying the magazine show was "big on history" and joked about McDermott being a "relic".
McDermott responded by using the swearword to introduce a package that former Norwich City and Leicester City player Eadie had recorded about fossils in Happisburgh, on the Norfolk coast.
Ms Ryder said: "In a recent pre-recorded segment of a Mustard TV show, presenter Helen McDermott used inappropriate language in an exchange with a colleague.
"The segment was subsequently re-recorded, but the wrong edit of the segment was broadcast."
A version of last Wednesday's show on the Mustard TV website shows a different take, with McDermott leaving a gap where the swearword had been.
Mustard TV, which launched last March, said McDermott had since apologised on air.
"Internal disciplinary action has been taken with the presenter concerned," Ms Ryder said.
Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had not received any complaints about the broadcast.
