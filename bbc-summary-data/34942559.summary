[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Apperley Bridge, between Leeds and Bradford, will start running on Sunday 13 December, subject to final approval by the Office of Rail and Road.
The original station was shut down 50 years ago and its replacement has cost about Â£8m to complete.
Two trains between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square or Skipton will run per hour Monday to Saturday.
Councillor Val Slater, Bradford Council deputy leader, said the station would make a "vital contribution to the economy of the region and improvements to the environment".
It is one of three new stations in the region with stations in Kirkstall Forge and Low Moor set to open next year.
