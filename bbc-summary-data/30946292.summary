Now Pharrell is to make a cameo appearance as himself in The Simpsons, according to Entertainment Weekly.
The rapper is set to appear in an episode of the Fox comedy called: Walking Big & Tall.
The plot is based on a true story about a US TV station hiring a composer to write a city-pride song in the 1980s who then ended up copying the same track in other cities.
According to one of The Simpsons producers, Al Jean, Springfield learns that its official song is "actually a carbon copy of many other cities".
It's then that Pharrell "offers to write a new anthem for the town," he says.
The episode will be broadcast on Sunday 8 February.
The Simpsons, which began in 1989, is the longest-running animated comedy show of all time, with more than 500 episodes broadcast.
