Hornsea, Withernsea and Driffield could lose minor injuries units

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three towns in East Yorkshire could lose their minor injuries units under plans being considered by the area's Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Units in Hornsea, Withernsea and Driffield could close with patients going to either two or three centres in Beverley, Bridlington or Goole.
Jane Hawkard , of the East Riding CCG, said it had a "limited budget" and the move was aimed at improving services.
Jean Barton, from Hornsea, said she was "absolutely appalled and disgusted".

She added that the unit was "going to be so missed in such a rural area".
Bridlington - for example - is about 15 miles (24km) from Hornsea and 32 miles (51km) from Withernsea.
Graham Stuart, Conservative MP for Beverley and Holderness, said, "We will not put up with these proposals.
"I believe that the right thing is for Hornsea and Withernsea to have a local minor injuries unit."
The CCG said about 13,500 patients a year - which it described as "small numbers" - attended the three units earmarked for closure.
The other three minor injuries units at Beverley, Bridlington and Goole received about 48,000 attendances annually, it added.
The proposed Urgent Care units would be open 16 hours a day, 365 days a year, and there are no plans to close any hospitals, it added.
Minor injuries units deal with patients who do not need to go to A&E and the proposed changes are part of the CCG's larger review of services.
The CCG covers about 1,000 sq miles (2,600 sq km) had has about 310,000 residents, according to a 2012 estimate.
A 12-week consultation on the plans is to start from 25 October and a decision is expected in March 2017.
