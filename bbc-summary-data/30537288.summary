Council cuts: Who will lose out most?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councils in England will see their overall spending power fall by an average of 1.8% from next year, the government says. However, some local authorities will see it drop by up to 6.4%.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Most local authority funding comes from central government, with about a quarter raised through council tax.
English councils say this central funding is being cut by 8.8%. However, government ministers say the amount local authorities can spend - taking into account other resources, including business rates - will fall on average by 1.8%.
The map below shows how the latest reduction in spending power will affect local district and unitary authorities in 2015-16.
It does not include the shire counties - or county councils - in two-tier authority areas, which also face cuts in government money.
The table below shows the change in spending power of all local authorities, including shire counties.
