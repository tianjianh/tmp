The child was taken to Furness General Hospital from Old Park Wood in Grange-over-Sands on Monday afternoon.
He was transferred to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool but died earlier.
Cumbria Police said an investigation was under way into the youngster's death, but it was not being treated as suspicious.
In a statement, the force said: "Police can confirm that the four-year-old boy involved in this incident has sadly died.
"Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."
It is believed the boy was staying with his family at the site, described on its website as "a luxury, private holiday park", set within the grounds of the Holker Estate.
