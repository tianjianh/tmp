The planned opening date for Bristol's long-awaited arena has slipped from late 2017 into early 2018.

A report due to be presented to Bristol City Council also notes the project will cost more - up to Â£92.5m, an increase of 2.5%.
John Sharkey, from SMG which will be involved with running the venue, said a big project like this "would be expected to take its time".
Mayor George Ferguson described the project as "remarkably on time".
"What I'm absolutely determined is that we open the arena early 2018," the independent said.
"What Bristol's going to get if people don't mess around with it [the planning process] will be absolutely fantastic."
Mr Sharkey said since the buildings would be up for "many many long years" it is important they are fit for purpose".
"You want to be able to deliver an asset to the city that's right and ready to operate from day one."
Two planning applications for the Bristol Arena, a 12,000-seat venue near Temple Meads, are due to be submitted.
People living nearby raised concerns about parking but the council said city centre car parks had "spare capacity, within a 20 minute walk of the arena".
A consultation closes on 13 October.
