[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old, who had a loan spell at Mansfield last season, is a left-back who can also play in midfield.
Dublin-born Kavanagh has been at Fulham since 2011 and made his debut in a 1-0 defeat by Wolves in August 2014.
Meanwhile, Pools goalkeeper Trevor Carson is set to miss the rest of this campaign as he requires surgery on a shoulder injury in two weeks' time.
Former Bury and Cheltenham stopper Carson, 28, has made 23 appearances in all competitions for the League Two club this term.
