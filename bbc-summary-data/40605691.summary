Northern Irishman woman Meadow's one-over-par 73 left her on 150 and four shots outside the cut mark.
World number one amateur Maguire was three further adrift after a second round 78.
Meadow, 25, double bogeyed the fourth and dropped a further shot at the sixth and birdies on the eighth and 11th didn't prove enough to survive.
Jordanstown woman Meadow came through qualifying for the event last month.
She finished a brilliant third in the US Open at Pinehurst in 2014 when making her professional debut.
Cavan woman Maguire's round included three double bogeys and three bogeys.
China's Shanshan Feng, who won the LPGA Championship in 2012, remained in the lead after adding a 70 to her opening 66.
The Chinese player has a two-stroke lead over compatriot Jeongeun Lee plus Korean trio Amy Yang, Hye Jin Choi and Jeong Eun Lee.
Those who joined the Irish duo in missing the cut included American stars Paula Creamer and Morgan Pressel.
