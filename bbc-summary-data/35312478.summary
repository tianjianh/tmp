Life sentence over Glasgow 'dog row' murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for life after he admitted murdering his neighbour near their homes in Glasgow following a row relating to a dog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Carroll, 28, stabbed 36-year-old Stephen Gannon in the neck near their tenement block in the city's Springburn area on 14 August 2015.
Carroll later told his grandmother: "I've done something stupid."
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Carroll was told that he would serve a minimum of 14 years in prison.
An earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow was told that Mr Gannon lived downstairs from Carroll at the flats in St Monance Street.
Carroll once had a disagreement with another neighbour about her dog misbehaving.
On 14 August, Mr Gannon was chatting inside the tenement to the neighbour who had the dog, when Carroll walked by.
The court heard that Carroll was already wanted by police at the time after failing to turn up for a court hearing in connection with an attack on his mother.
Mr Gannon followed him and shouted: "Don't you be giving abuse to the woman in my close."
Carroll initially ignored the comment - but then turned and confronted his neighbour.
Prosecutor Ross McFarlane said: "In a sudden movement, Carroll produced a large knife and struck out a number of times.
"He stabbed Mr Gannon in the neck area...blood started to spurt from the wound and he tried to run back towards his flat."
The victim died after the fatal wound cut through his carotid artery and jugular vein.
An apparently-upset Carroll then appeared at his grandmother's home and said: "Something's happened. I've done something stupid."
He later admitted to a friend he had stabbed Mr Gannon "a couple of times", but that he did not think it was "that bad".
Carroll went on to state: "I'll take responsibility for what I have done."
It was three days later when he was finally held in connection with the outstanding warrant.
Police later questioned him about the stabbing, but he denied being involved.
Carroll pleaded guilty to murder, however, when the case went to trial.
Following his guilty plea, it emerged that Carroll, who has a 666 tattoo, already had a violent past including convictions for assault and possessing a knife.
He was jailed for 60 days in September last year for the assault on his mother.
After Carroll was jailed for murder, Det Ch Insp Allan Burton said: "This was a particularly vicious attack by a violent individual on a man who was a neighbour and friend to many where he lived.
"To lash out with such ferocity and without any apparent regard for the consequences of his violent actions is absolutely senseless and underlines the devastation that knife crime can have in our communities."
