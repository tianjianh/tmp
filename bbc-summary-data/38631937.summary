The 25-year-old had signed for the Hammers on a £4.3m season-long deal last summer but only played 11 times and failed to score.
According to reports, had Zaza played 14 games the Premier League club would have had to buy him outright for £20m.
The Italy forward was signed by Juve from Sassuolo for £12.75m in 2015.
He scored eight goals in 24 appearances for the Italian Serie A champions before joining West Ham last August.
Valencia are struggling in La Liga and are currently in 17th position.
