Bracknell Urgent Care Centre at Brant's Bridge is being privately run by One Medicare and expects to treat 30,000 people a year.
It will treat patients with minor illnesses and injuries, and will be open 365 days a year.
In 2012, NHS bosses confirmed plans to redevelop Heatherwood Hospital.
The Ascot site had previously been threatened with closure.
As well as relocating the minor injuries unit to Bracknell, the Clinical Commissioning Group also announced the closure of the hospital's stroke rehabilitation ward and birthing centre.
The birthing centre has been shut since 2011 due to staffing issues.
One Medicare's Christian Ellwood, said the new facility at the Royal Berkshire Bracknell Healthspace would be equipped with the "latest in medical technology".
"We just want to encourage people that come in, that they're not going to be waiting a long time and those sort of things," he added.
"So we've made it as friendly as possible, and as bright and as vibrant as we can."
