[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leading cycling team could face a suspension after one of its riders failed a test for a banned substance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Team Katusha's Eduard Vorganov tested positive for meldonium in an out-of-competition test last month.
Meldonium is used in Latvia and other eastern European countries to treat serious heart problems and aid the circulation of oxygen.
The 33-year-old joined the team in 2010 and was the Russian road race champion in 2012.
He finished 19th at the Tour de France in the same year.
Vorganov's Italian team-mate Luca Paolini failed a test for cocaine at last year's Tour and under UCI rules Katusha could now be banned from competition for 15-45 days.
Under the guidelines, if two riders and/or staff within a team commit a breach of the rules within a period of 12 months, the team shall be suspended from participation in any international event.
The team issued a statement regarding Vorganov in which it insisted: "This substance has never been used by the team in any form and was not provided to the rider by the team.
"Eduard Vorganov has been suspended from all team activities, effective immediately.
"In the event that Eduard Vorganov took this product on his own initiative we will conduct an investigation, as such conduct is in breach of the team's strict medical and anti-doping internal rules."
