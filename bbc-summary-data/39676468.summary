The pair suffered hamstring problems in training on Tuesday and could also miss the trip to Burnley next weekend.
Leicester are hopeful that captain Wes Morgan will return from the hamstring injury that kept him out of the midweek defeat by Arsenal.
Club record signing Islam Slimani is expected to be available after three matches out with a groin injury.
John Motson: "Both clubs would refute the notion there is little importance attached to this game.
"West Brom are chasing a club record Premier League points tally despite three straight defeats. They need six more points and, looking at their tough remaining fixtures, surely need to win this one.
"Leicester aren't safe yet, having taken just one point from three games.
"Leicester's Champions League exploits appear to have disrupted their domestic momentum. If their season tails off, you wonder whether the future of a few players might be up for debate.
"Saturday's fixture is also notable for probably being the last Premier League outing for referee Mark Clattenburg. He was entrusted with the FA Cup, Champions League and Euro 2016 finals last year, and his departure will deprive English football of arguably its top official."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis on Leicester's former Albion player and coach Craig Shakespeare: "He's from this area, he played for Walsall as well. He's a good football man, been in football for a long time.
"He's got his first opportunity and he's done a good job since taking over."
Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: "There are 15 points available and we want them all.
"I spent a large part of my career there [at West Brom] as a player and coach, so I have fond memories. But we're desperate to get a result.
"They've progressed a lot as a club, both on and off the field. I think they can play both ways - they can mix it and be direct but they have flair players like (Matty) Phillips and (Nacer) Chadli and can counter-attack quickly and play."
The Baggies are at home, and have not played since 16 April, while Leicester were in action against Arsenal on Wednesday night.
I think that will make a difference, although I could not really tell you where the Baggies' goals are going to come from.
