Centre Sene Naoupu and lock Sophie Spence crossed as the hosts led 15-3 at the break.
Two more penalties from home captain Niamh Briggs, who scored 11 points, were the only second-half scores.
Wales defended bravely for long periods, but could not add to Robyn Wilkins' early penalty.
Ireland benefitted from a string of penalties in the first half with Wales prop Megan York sin-binned.
Naoupu's run from 30 metres marked the stand-out moment before half-time.
But with heavy rain affecting the second half, Wales kept their line intact in the face of intense Irish pressure.
Ireland take on France in Perpignan on Saturday, 13 February, while the following day in Neath, Wales host Scotland, who lost 32-0 to England on Friday.
