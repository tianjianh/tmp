Rochdale Council: Three-weekly bin collections approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bins in Rochdale will only be emptied once every three weeks instead of fortnightly, the council has decided.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nearly 300 people responded to a consultation about how the collection changes should be carried out, and the council agreed to more communication.
However the local authority also said "smelly" food waste would be collected weekly from special food waste bins.
The new rubbish collecting schedule, which covers general waste and recycling bins, will launch in October.
The leader of the Labour-run council, Richard Farnell, said financial pressures were partly behind the change.
And he pointed out that Rochdale had the lowest recycling rate of Greater Manchester's 10 boroughs.
Bury Council became the first local authority in England last October to only collect household rubbish once every three weeks.
