The pair died after being struck on the A4119 at Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, on 6 December.
Mrs Bates described the two as "vivacious and funny".
More than 300 people gathered in a park near Watkins Square in Cardiff to release orange and blue balloons to celebrate the lives of the pair, who lived in the Llanishen area of Cardiff.
Mrs Bates said: "They were the most vivacious, funny, entertaining and inspirational two boys that anyone could ever dream of meeting, let alone being part of your family."
Mr Bates and his son were hit while crossing the carriageway near Arthur Llewellyn Jenkins furniture store near Llantrisant.
The driver of the car was arrested and bailed.
Mr Bates, an IT programme manager for PHS in Caerphilly, died at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital shortly after the crash.
