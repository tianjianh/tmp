[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stirling Albion 1-2 Clyde

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two second-half penalties from Scott Linton saw 10-man Clyde come from behind to beat Stirling at Forthbank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Doris slotted into the bottom corner just after the half-hour mark for the home side.
Linton made no mistake from the spot after Ross Smith was punished for handball.
And he made it 2-1, again from the penalty spot, when Philip Johnston was the culprit, before Mark McLaughlin saw red for a second yellow card.
