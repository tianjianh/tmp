Nicola Sturgeon tells UN 'Scotland wants bigger role'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has told the United Nations that Scotland wants to play its part.

She said an independent Scotland could play a bigger role at the world body to help promote human rights, gender equality and peace.
Ms Sturgeon was addressing diplomats at UN headquarters in New York.
"We are a relatively small country, but a country that potentially can have a big, positive and powerful voice," she said.
The first minister is on a five-day tour of the US.
Ms Sturgeon has insisted her visit is focused on trade rather than pushing for independence.
The Scottish Conservatives have accused the SNP leader of using "her taxpayer-funded trip to America to promote independence, and an unwanted referendum".
Last week, the Scottish government asked UK Prime Minister Theresa May for a second referendum on independence after Britain launched the process of leaving the European Union.
But the UK government has already declined Ms Sturgeon's request to be given the powers to hold a legally-binding independence referendum before the Brexit process is complete.
Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland's Glenn Campbell that she had "no plans to go to court" to challenge the UK government's decision.
She said: "It is absolutely essential that if the will of the Scottish Parliament is for a referendum then that should be respected.
"I don't think there is any need, nor is there any intention, to see a matter that should be settled politically end up in the courts."

Ms Sturgeon used her address to the UN to raise her international profile and draw attention to Scotland's credentials as a "good global citizen."
The first minister said she wanted to "explore ways in which the Scottish government can further support the UN and its various different forums," in particular in the area of human rights and gender equality.
Scotland is working with the United Nations to offer training to women in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and other conflict areas in the Middle East to help them play a larger role in promoting peace.
Last year, 50 women took part in the Scottish programme and the same number will take part in the initiative every year until 2021, said Sturgeon.
"My country will take a lead in trying to drive forward progress both within Scotland, but also where possible by helping to promote gender equality," she said.
"Women's rights have to be the concern of everybody, not just women."
"In order to advance women's rights, we need to make sure that women are in key areas and key positions of influence," she said.
Earlier this week, Sturgeon spoke to US investors in California.
She is scheduled to address the Women in the World summit in New York on Thursday.
