Waiting lists: Numbers waiting for outpatient appointments rise by almost 50%

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people waiting for a first outpatient appointment in Northern Ireland has increased by nearly 50% in a year.

The latest figures from the Department of Health show that at the end of September 230,625 people where waiting.
That is compared to 155,558 in September 2014.
Department targets suggest no-one should wait for more than 18 weeks for a first appointment, but 110,000 people have been waiting longer than that.
The statistics, which are published quarterly, also show that 90,643 were waiting for diagnostic tests and 62,697 are waiting for inpatient treatment.
Last week, Health Minister Simon Hamilton said he planned to use £40m given to his department in the latest reallocation of funds to tackle waiting lists.
He said the money should provide 40,000 more assessments and up to 15,000 extra operations.
Ulster Unionist MLA Michael McGimpsey, a former health minister, described the situation as "outrageous".
"Some [people] afford to wait, but for those people with serious illnesses or those having to endure unimaginable pain - they are badly being let down," he said.
Mr McGimpsey said he welcomed the allocation of £40m.
But he added that Mr Hamilton's "premature and exaggerated claims of kick-starting the local health service" needed to be "tempered".
"In the previous financial year, [Mr Hamilton's] department received over £80m additional funding and the situation only continued to get worse."
Mr Hamilton said the extra money is already making a difference but added that more will need to be done to address the current problems.
"Already, patients are being contacted to attend appointments for hip and knee operations, spinal procedures and urology, for example," he said.
"It is the start of a long journey to get waiting times back to an acceptable position and will need further additional funding to ensure success, but we are beginning to head in the right direction."
