Partick Thistle 1-2 Aberdeen: Dons character delights McInnes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derek McInnes praised his Aberdeen players for their determination against Partick Thistle and the "golden minute" that turned the score around.

The Dons fell behind to Steven Lawless's excellent strike but scored in quick succession through Andrew Considine and Simon Church to win 2-1.
McInnes's side climbed to within a point of Premiership leaders Celtic.
And the Pittodrie boss insists it was important his side kept the "doubters" at bay.
"It's ridiculous to even question my team's bottle and character," said McInnes after the match at Firhill.
"For nearly three seasons now we've had enough big games that we've won when the pressure's been on.
"We were up against it [at 1-0 down] and we had to show quality, determination.
"[Andrew] Considine being up there for the equaliser just shows you, his determination to get on the end of it, and then the quality of [Barry] Robson's corner kick, and [Simon] Church getting across his man giving us another goal.
"Everybody played their part and it was a big performance, a big win. Everyone would have been doubting us at 1-0 down and it was important we didn't doubt ourselves.
"That's why I love this team, it's a pleasure to manage them when you see the determination they showed.
"It delights me to see Shay Logan sprint by Andrew Considine to get the ball out of the net to start the game again.
"We know the importance of winning, but it's important the players keep the wherewithal to stay calm, focused and be confident to get the job done."
McInnes lauded Partick Thistle's performance, insisting they will finish in the top six this season.
Their next game is against Celtic, who now have a game in hand over Aberdeen, and McInnes believes the Jags can trouble the league leaders.
Alan Archibald is more concerned about securing Partick Thistle's safety than the outcome of the title race, and he felt his side played well enough to not lose against the Dons.
"That was very sore, we merited at least a point," Archibald said.
"The boys are in a bit of shock, because after we scored we were fine, we didn't look under any pressure. I didn't see a goal coming.
"We've been strong all season defensively, but we didn't stop the cross into the box and the set play is disappointing, you expect the boys to do their job. We put so much into the second half, but the difference is taking your chances.
"We did the hard bit, we got the goal, a wonder goal, but we'll need to build on it.
"We've got the champions on Saturday and that's the pick-me-up. If we play like that again we'll give them a game."
