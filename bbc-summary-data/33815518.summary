Fresh talks on Monday in bid to avert third tube strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fresh talks will begin on Monday morning at the conciliation service Acas in a bid to resolve the dispute over the Night Tube.

Four unions held a second 24-hour strike this week after rejecting the latest offer from London Underground.
They are unhappy about conditions offered to drivers who will be working on the new service.
The London Mayor plans to write directly to Tube staff urging them to accept the offer.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), Unite and the train drivers' union Aslef took part in the action.
The unions turned down a new offer from London Underground (LU), which included a 2% salary increase this year, an extra Â£200 per night shift for drivers for a limited time and a Â£500 bonus for Night Tube staff when the service is introduced in September.
The RMT union said rotas drawn up for the new Night Tube were "rosters from hell" that would disrupt the work-life balance of staff.
Boris Johnson accused the unions of "holding a gun" to Londoners' heads.
Questions have been raised over whether the dispute will be resolved in time for the night service to begin on its planned date.
Mr Johnson has said he is "not fussed" about the night service starting on 12 September as planned, as long as it started in the autumn.
