The 20-year-old made his first-class debut against the touring Pakistan side in July and featured in all three formats for the Hove side this year.
Wales-born Salt, who came through Sussex's academy, will remain at the club until the end of the 2017 season.
"With a good winter under his belt, he could develop into a dynamic match-winner for Sussex," head coach Mark Davis said.
