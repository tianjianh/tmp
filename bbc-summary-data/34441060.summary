The typhoon landed in Guangdong province on Sunday but moved later to neighbouring Guanxi. Deaths and injuries were reported in both areas.
Officials said the typhoon, as well as the tornadoes that came with it, were to blame for widespread power outages.
Mujigae also swept through Taiwan and the Philippines on Saturday.
The typhoon, whose name means "rainbow" in Korean, had prompted the evacuations of thousands of people in southern China prior to its arrival.
It landed in Zhanjiang on Sunday afternoon with winds of 180 km/h (112 mph) at its centre and rain.
It caused widespread blackouts and a cut-off in water supply in some areas in Zhanjiang, according to Xinhua.
It grounded flights and prompted suspensions of rail service in some cities along China's southern coast, including places popular with tourists such as Hainan and Sanya.
Another tourist spot, Fangji Island, also saw more than 500 tourists stranded during the typhoon.
The Guangxi civil affairs department said the typhoon had affected more than 1.44 million people by early afternoon Monday.
Mujigae landed amid China's week-long National Day holiday, disrupting plans for many holidaymakers.
