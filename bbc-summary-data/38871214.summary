[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bologna 1-7 Napoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marek Hamsik and Dries Mertens scored hat-tricks against Bologna in what was Napoli's biggest-ever Serie A away win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hamsik and Lorenzo Insigne made it 2-0, before the visitors' keeper Pepe Reina saved a Mattia Destro penalty.
Napoli's Jose Callejon and Bologna's Adam Masina were sent off in quick succession, with Mertens scoring twice before half-time, either side of a Vasilis Torosidis goal for Bologna.
Two second-half goals from Hamsik followed, before Mertens struck again.
Hamsik's hat-trick, which began with a beautifully placed header in the fourth minute, was rounded off with a spectacular 25-yard curler. It took him above Attila Sallustro into second place on Napoli's all-time scoring list, on 109 goals, behind only Argentine great Diego Maradona, with 115.
Mertens, meanwhile, began his treble with a free-kick awarded after he was brought down by Masina, who was harshly sent off for a professional foul.
Two clinical finishes completed the Belgium international's third Serie A hat-trick of the season.
His previous two came in successive games against Cagliari and Torino in December - when he made history as the first player to score three or more goals in consecutive Serie A fixtures since 1974.
Napoli's win moves them up to second place, three points behind leaders Juventus, who host Inter Milan on Sunday (19:45 GMT), and one ahead of Roma, who are at home to Fiorentina on Tuesday.
