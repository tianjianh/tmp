The 28-year-old had come under pressure to take on British rival Kell Brook but said he was already deep in negotiations to fight someone else.
Khan, who announced the fight on his wife's YouTube channel, said the bout was likely to take place in New York in the 147lbs (welterweight) division.
The Bolton fighter said: "You can class him as an A-class opponent."
Algieri, 31, has been defeated in only one of his 21 fights, a loss on points to Manny Pacquiao in November during which he was knocked down six times.
"This is another fight which is going to bring a different style," added Khan, who is hoping for a meeting with the winner of Pacquiao's eagerly-awaited showdown with Floyd Mayweather.
"He knows how to box, he knows how to move well. He takes a decent amount of shots and he's got a decent amount of power.
"Hopefully this can lead me onto the bigger fights in the future, which we're all looking at."
Khan has also vowed to fight unbeaten IBF champion Brook, 28, at Wembley "within the next 12 months".
