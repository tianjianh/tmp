Vauxhall: The household names of the motoring world made in Luton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The one millionth Vauxhall Vivaro van rolled off the production line in Luton this week. It is the latest big-selling model to be made at the Bedfordshire plant. But how have they changed over the years?

The earliest models had wind down windows, ashtrays and no seatbelts. These days they are altogether more hi-tech, with air conditioning, docking stations and onboard computers.
Now in its 110th year, the Luton plant has been a flag-bearer for UK van manufacturing since Ford shut its Transit factory in Southampton.
The site was on the verge of shutting its doors four years ago but the continuing demand for the Vivaro meant last year workers began a 10-year contract building the new model, securing 1,500 jobs.
It is the latest model to go into mass production from the Luton base, which has become famous as the birthplace of household names in the motoring world, including the Cavalier car and the Luton and Bedford vans, over the years.
