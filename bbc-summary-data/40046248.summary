The 23-year-old, who joined from Hartlepool in January 2014, has also been named as Posh's new club captain.
Baldwin scored once in 29 appearances in 2016-17 as Peterborough finished 11th in the third tier.
"Jack is a leader, he is determined, has a will to win and I think he will prove to be an excellent skipper," said manager Grant McCann.
