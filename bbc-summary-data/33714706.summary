The family of an 18-year-old who died after reportedly inhaling so-called laughing gas have said his death was not caused by the drug.

Ally Calvert collapsed in Abbey Wood, south-east London, on Saturday, and died in hospital two hours later.
Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for nitrous oxide to be made illegal in the wake of Mr Calvert's death.
But his family have said an underlying heart condition was to blame.
The force said Mr Calvert was believed to have taken nitrous oxide and drank alcohol at a party, but a post-mortem examination had proved "inconclusive".
Further toxicology tests are being carried out, but Mr Calvert's family have said they do not believe the gas was responsible for his death.
In a post shared on social media, one relative wrote: "As a family, we would like to express how overwhelmed we have been with the support for the recent loss of Ally.
"We can now confirm, that the use of balloons/nitrous oxide did not cause the death of our baby, as we originally knew anyway."
They said the underlying heart condition which led to his passing, which was "inevitable" and happened regardless of "where he was, or who he was with at the time".
Friends of the teenager, who described Mr Calvert as "the nicest guy you will ever meet", started a social media campaign titled #AllysBigHeart, in memory of him.
Speaking after Mr Calvert's death, but before the post-mortem result was revealed, Sir Bernard said nitrous oxide use had resulted in a "terrible outcome".
He told BBC London it was "clear" the drug is becoming more popular and called for it to be outlawed.
He said: "When I used to go to Notting Hill Carnival, the canisters were everywhere," he said.
"There's a law going through Parliament about psycho-active substances.
"I suspect it may be one of the substances to be banned."
