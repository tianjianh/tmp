GB's Zoe Smith won an individual bronze medal at the European weightlifting championships in Norway but described her performance as "disappointingly lacklustre".

Smith, 21, secured her medal in the clean-and-jerk with a best of 119kg.
Her subsequent 96kg snatch and total of 215kg gave her fourth place overall.
Smith said her efforts were "nowhere near where I thought I'd be" and cited injuries as a factor in her below-par performance.
"A couple of weeks ago I had a bit of a knee problem and before coming here I picked up a back niggle," she said. "I've got two bulging discs, so at one point I didn't actually think I'd be able to compete.
"I guess in the grand scheme it's not too bad," she added. "I think if I was on form, I could've achieved a lot more."
Smith beat fellow Briton Emily Godley, who was sixth overall at the event in Forde.
Performances at the Norway event count towards Olympic qualification, with a maximum of one men's and one women's berth possible for Team GB. Final Olympic qualifying places will be confirmed in mid-June.
Earlier on Wednesday, British weightlifter Jack Oliver had to withdraw from his event with a suspected dislocated elbow.
The 25-year-old was hurt attempting to lift 178kgs in the 77kg event.
Oliver is the British record holder but now faces an anxious wait to see whether the injury will rule him out of the Rio Games.
