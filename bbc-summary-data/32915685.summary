He was discovered at about 04:50 BST at Emerson Court in Horden, near Peterlee, and taken to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton.
The baby, who was less than 12 hours old, was named Jack by hospital staff. He is "fit and well", Durham Police said.
At a press conference, officers confirmed his mother had come forward.
She has been medically examined and will be interviewed.
Police are working with the county council's children's services unit.
The baby was found by a pet dog who was being taken for a walk.
Mary Cartwright, mayor of Peterlee, saw what happened as she was returning from Newcastle Airport.
She said: "I saw the policeman with a bundle in his arms and I could see the baby's head and it was in a blanket.
"He ran across the road and round to the side of the ambulance and the crew took the baby.
"There was nobody around and then there was this baby and I knew something wasn't quite right," she said
Initial reports said the child had been found on nearby Fourth Street.
