The metal plaques have been put in place to mark the 220th anniversary of Robert Burns death, on 21 July 1796.
They are engraved with names and messages of supporters from around the world.
The installation is part of a campaign to raise funds for the restoration of the Victorian monument.
After being exposed to the elements for 200 years, it needs repairs to its masonry and its original decorative finish restored.
More than £80,000 has been raised by members of the public and organisations and the National Trust for Scotland USA Foundation has donated almost £100,000.
But the National Trust for Scotland, which owns the monument, said a further £15,000 is needed before work can begin.
David Hopes, director of Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway, said: "The interest and support for Burns Monument has been amazing - and perhaps no different to public feelings 200 years ago when the monument was first commissioned.
"We still need support though so that we can start work conserving the Burns Monument and, in the spirit of its creation, making it a fitting celebration of the lasting legacy Robert Burns and his place in our heritage."
