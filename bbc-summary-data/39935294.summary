[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League Magic Weekend: Widnes Vikings 12-34 Wakefield Trinity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield Trinity produced a strong display to brush aside Super League's bottom side Widnes Vikings in Magic Weekend's opening game in Newcastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Grix crossed either side of Reece Lyne's try to give Wakefield a 16-0 half-time lead at St James' Park.
Ben Jones-Bishop touched down twice after the break, while Matty Ashurst also scored as Wakefield dominated.
Ryan Ince and Hep Cahill scored consolation tries for Widnes, who gave a debut to Rangi Chase.
The 31-year-old half-back joined Widnes until the end of the season on Monday after being told he did not feature in Castleford's plans for the rest of 2017.
But the former England playmaker was unable to make a serious impact in his first match - and was at fault for the sixth Trinity try, throwing a wayward pass to allow Ashurst a free run under the posts.
Vikings remain bottom of the table having won just two of their 14 matches in Super League this season.
Wakefield, who are also in the Challenge Cup quarter-finals, move above Wigan to fifth in the table.
Widnes Vikings: Hanbury, Ince, Chamberlain, Runciman, Johnson, Johnstone, Chase, Buchanan, Heremaia, Dudson, Houston, Wilde, Cahill.
Replacements: O'Carroll, White, Gerrard, Manuokafoa.

Referee: Chris Kendall (RFL)
