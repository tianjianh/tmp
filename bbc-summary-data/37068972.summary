New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez said he would not be "defined by his mistakes" as he retired from Major League Baseball after a 6-3 win over Tampa Bay Rays in his final game.

The 41-year-old hit 696 home runs - fourth on the all-time list - but was given a 162-game doping ban in 2014.
"I've given these fans a lot of headaches over the years. I disappointed a lot of people, but this feels good," he said.
'A-Rod' will now become a club advisor.
Rodriguez helped the Yankees win the World Series in 2009 and was voted the American League's Most Valuable Player in 2003, 2005 and 2007.
A sell-out 46,459 Yankee Stadium crowd chanted "We want A-Rod" as he was brought on to the field by coach Joe Giradi.
"I have a huge heart. This is the last time he plays. I wanted it to be something," Giradi said.
With the game won, Rodriguez was given the ball, hugged his team-mates, grabbed a handful of dirt, raised his cap and walked to the dugout, before covering his face with a towel.
He told a news conference: "With all that I've been through, and for them to show up on a night like tonight and show me that type love is something that I'll never forget.
"It was overwhelming."
