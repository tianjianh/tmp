[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 5-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Shakes scored a hat-trick as Boreham Wood claimed their first win in nine games with a 5-0 rout of National League play-off chasing Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wood had the first chance of the game when Jai Reason curled wide but Dover hit back with Joe Healy unleashing a shot from the edge of the box which hit the underside of the bar.
Those chances in the first 15 minutes were the best of the first half but Boreham Wood found another gear after the break.
Bruno Andrade grabbed his first 11 minutes after the break as he got ahead of Jamie Grimes to lob Steven Arnold and Shakes made it 2-0 11 minutes later in controversial fashion. He took the ball off Arnold with the goalkeeper claiming he had it in both hands and tucked away.
Shakes was involved in the next goal in the 73rd minute as he beat Arnold to a long ball to set up Andrade and 10 minutes later he too had his second, bursting clear and applying a calm finish.
The 32-year-old then once again found himself clear on goal with four minutes remaining and made no mistake.
