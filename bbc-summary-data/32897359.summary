[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council changes Hawick ward view to include Hornshole site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council is to "tweak" its submission to the boundary commission to include the famous battle site at Hornshole in a Hawick ward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There had been local opposition and a petition launched to oppose the loss of the area as part of wider changes.
The local authority had initially accepted the historic site would move outside Hawick ward boundaries.
However, it has now decided to oppose the move in its submission to the Local Government Boundary Commission.
Last week councillors agreed with proposals that would see their numbers reduced from 34 to 32.
They also accepted a change that would see Hawick's two three-member wards replaced with one four-member ward.
But the authority has now decided to alter its response to allow the inclusion of what has been described as a "sacred and cherished site" for the town.
In 1514 a group of Hawick youths defeated an English raiding party and captured their standard at Hornshole.
Two statues in the town celebrate that historic event.
