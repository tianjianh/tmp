Will Grigg poked in Stephen Warnock's low cross to put the Latics in front just before half-time.
And Warnock was once again the provider as he cut the ball back for Yanic Wildschut to fire in a low finish.
Eric Lichaj's late penalty for Forest was saved by Jakob Haugaard after Lica had been fouled in the area.
An FA Cup classic had looked unlikely, with both sides in miserable form, and it is Forest who have now gone seven games without a win in all competitions.
The visitors made few chances and saw little of the ball - and they have now lost six of their past seven matches.
Wigan - inside the Championship relegation zone in 23rd place - had been on an equally disappointing run, but they were superior to a side who sit three places above them in their division.
The Latics recovered from the early blow of losing Nick Powell to injury and could have added to their tally if Michael Jacobs and Jordi Gomez had done better with good chances.
Wigan boss Warren Joyce: "Whether it's the cup or the league, it's just nice to win games.
"I was pleased with the performance and I thought we thoroughly deserved to win.
"I would have been very disappointed had we let them back in - and it was sloppy play that resulted in the penalty."
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier: "It was a poor game. We were bad in every area, both with and without the ball, and we cannot keep accepting this situation.
"We're on a terrible run and confidence is really low but that should not be an excuse. We need to show more when we've got the ball and do more when we haven't.
"We looked weak in every part of the pitch and, even with a lot of players out injured, it should have been a much better performance."
