Police are investigating a "significant number" of deliberate fires in North Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows multiple fires in Millcroft Road, Cumbernauld, since November.
In the latest incident, a car was set alight at 03:30 on Sunday, minutes after a man wearing a black mask with a white skull was seen trying to gain access to nearby vehicles.
Another car was also set on fire on Friday, while incidents have also been reported in neighbouring streets.
It is understood the number of incidents police are investigating runs into double figures.
Det Con Kim Faulds, of Coatbridge CID, said the suspect was spotted wearing the distinctive mask and dark clothing.
She added: "There have been a significant number of wilful fire-raising incidents in the area and we believe that they may be linked.
"This type of reckless behaviour will not be tolerated and extensive inquiries are under way to establish who is responsible.
"I'm appealing to anyone who may have information regarding this incident, or any other similar incidents in the area, to contact us.
"The offender may have been seen either prior to, or after, the incident took place wearing the clothing described."
