It was reported that a 24-year-old man called Callum MacDonald from Fort William was in hospital after being hurt at the Bataclan concert venue.
Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons on Monday consular assistance would be offered to his family.
Social media accounts belonging to a woman who claimed to be his cousin have now been deleted.
The French authorities have also confirmed that they have no one by the name of Hamish Callum MacDonald, reported to have also been known as Callum MacDonald, on their records, raising further doubts about his existence.
A series of shootings and bombings took place in Paris on Friday night in which 129 died and hundreds were injured.
Tweets posted after events in Paris on Friday night, from an account which appeared to belong to someone named Serlina Reynolds from Inverness, urged people to help trace her cousin.
"MY COUSIN IS MISSING. Callum "Hamish" MacDonald, 24, 6'4, Fort William Born, a father of a 2 yr old MISSING. Last seen at #Bataclan, Paris," she tweeted.
She later posted: "Thank you thank you thank you thank you so much people. It was the longest 10 hour of my life. Calum is ALIVE."
She then posted updates on his condition, claiming he was in hospital, having been placed in a medically-induced coma.
The story was picked up by the media and the case was then raised in the House of Commons on Monday by the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, Ian Blackford.
In response to his comments about Mr MacDonald, Home Secretary Mrs May said: "Our thoughts are with him and his family and friends."
"There is consular support available to the families who wish to be supporting members of their family who are in hospital in France."
It appeared that Foreign Office officials attempted to get in touch with Ms Reynolds on Twitter.
They messaged her saying "we would like to offer support to him/family while he is still in hospital".
The Foreign Office has now advised that it has no record of any British national by the name of Hamish Callum MacDonald being injured in Paris.
A spokesman said they had also been told by the French authorities they do not have anyone of that name as among the injured.
Mr Blackford commented: "It is extremely regrettable that valuable police and security service time has been wasted in the wake of this tragedy.
"The focus of our thoughts and our solidarity remains with the people of France."
Twitter and Facebook accounts which appeared to belong to Ms Reynolds have now been deleted.
