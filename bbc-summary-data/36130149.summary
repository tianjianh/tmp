Organisers have tested a 100m (328ft) flume ride down one of the steepest hills in Lincoln to see if it is safe to be used by members of the public.

Last year, about 400 people were picked from a lottery draw to ride a flume in Flaxengate in the city centre.
After testing on Sunday morning, officials said the flume planned for Steep Hill was "much faster".
The Rotary Club of Lincoln Colonia event will take place on 17 July.

Duncan Gerrard, from the Rotary Club, said: "We thought it best to keep testing under wraps until we were sure we could handle it safely."
He said: "The boffins tell me that twice the slope, which this is compared to Flaxengate, will go about four times quicker.
"We've no need for Fairy Liquid this year."
He added they would be using bales to help stop the riders at the bottom of the slope.
Riders will have the chance to buy Â£3 lottery tickets to secure a place at the event, which is aiming to accommodate about 700 people.
