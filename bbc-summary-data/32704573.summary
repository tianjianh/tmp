Complaints against the UK's largest mobile operator related to topics ranging from line faults, service and provision issues to bill problems.
Virgin Media had the lowest number of complaints, followed by Sky.
PlusNet, TalkTalk, BT and Post Office HomePhone generated an above average number of complaints, according to Ofcom.
The report, which covers April to December 2014, shows the volumes of consumer complaints about the UK's biggest providers of telecoms and pay-TV services.
EE generated 0.42 broadband complaints for every 1,000 customers, the report found.
Issues cited included faults, service and provision problems as well as how it handled complaints and swapping providers.
EE was also named as the most complained-about provider of pay-monthly mobile services for the first three quarters, although in the last quarter of 2014 it was overtaken by Vodafone.
Tesco was the least complained-about mobile firm.
EE is the UK's biggest mobile phone operator and is due to be acquired by BT as soon as the Â£12.5bn deal receives regulatory approval.
In response to the survey, the EE said: "We have a comprehensive programme in place to improve service and reduce complaints - and this is borne out by the Ofcom data from last year.
"We know there is more work to do. Through our ongoing, significant investment we want to continue improving, allowing us to deliver the best customer service in the industry."
The highest number of complaints about pay-TV services came from BT TV customers, whose average of 0.15 per 1,000 subscribers was five times the industry average, according to Ofcom.
Sky had the lowest volume of pay TV complaints - 0.01 for every 1,000 customers.
Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's director of content and consumer group, said: "Complaints figures help inform consumers' choices of telecoms and pay-TV services.
"There are now more providers included in our report, so people can compare complaints figures for all the biggest companies."
"While operators still have room to improve their performance, it's encouraging to see a continuing decline in the total volume of complaints."
Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said of the report: "Naming and shaming will encourage telecoms providers to strive to deliver a better service, but it's clear from this report that industry-wide changes could also make a big difference.
"Problems with changing provider is mentioned several times as a customer complaint, which shows it's about time telecoms fell in line with other sectors, where the provider you're moving to handles the switch, rather than the provider you're leaving," he added.
