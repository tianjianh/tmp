The National Memorial Arboretum installation recognises the contribution of the Brixmis - the British Commanders-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany.
The work was dangerous and many of those who took part were injured.
Former members of the mission and their families attended the unveiling on Saturday.
Tony Matthews, a volunteer at the arboretum, said: "The arboretum is not just about the dead, it's about remembering the people who gave service to their country.
"These men found out about Soviet tactics, different equipment. They slept in their cars for days on end.
"It's important their work is remembered."
Brixmis officers worked with their American and French counterparts throughout the Cold War.
They gathered military intelligence behind the Iron Curtain, stealing Soviet military hardware and searching East German rubbish dumps for classified information.
Donations helped fund the memorial.
