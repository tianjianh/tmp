Fletcher, 42, who is from the town, was made a Doctor of Letters in a ceremony at the university's Great Hall.
The actor, best known as clumsy clown Mr Tumble on the CBeebies channel, said: "I'm thrilled to be honoured and enjoyed the day immensely."
In 2008 Fletcher was appointed MBE for his services to children's television and the charity sector.
Fletcher added: "The London Road campus is a hidden gem and the Great Hall is magnificent.
"To be presented with the honorary degree from Professor Andy Kempe, who was my drama teacher at Theale Green School in Reading, was extra special as he really encouraged and supported me when I was 15."
Fletcher has been a children's television presenter and voice-over artist for the past 15 years.
"I'm a big lover of slapstick comedy and I like to try and make my slapstick minimalist in speech so any child in the world can enjoy it," he said.
"When I'm presenting I always think of the children and imagine them sitting at home and really try to engage them and get them believing in my performance and the show."
Nearly 3,500 students will graduate from the university this week in 18 ceremonies held over three days on the campus.
