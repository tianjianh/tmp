Two of those injured were construction workers while the others were drivers of passing cars and pedestrians.
"Thank God, this incident occurred at an hour of the day on a weekend when there were not too many people around," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
The incident occurred just before 14:45 GMT at 261 Madison Avenue.
Police officers attending the scene found that the crane's payload had broken free as it was heading to the top of the building, shearing the side of the office block and plunging to the street below, the Associated Press news agency reported.
An investigation is under way.
