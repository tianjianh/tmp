[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-3 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United claimed their third straight win in League One as they held out for victory at AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Duffy opened the scoring for the Blades in the 20th minute after he beat a defender and then the goalkeeper with a dummy before finding the net.
Captain Billy Sharp doubled his side's lead six minutes later with a well-placed header after a cross from Matt Done, but Dom Poleon pulled one back in the 37th minute with a low header from an Andy Barcham cross.
Duffy and Done both missed chances for the visitors before Done found the net from a clever John Fleck through-ball just before the hour mark.
Substitute Tom Elliott made a quick impact and gave the Dons renewed hope in the 73rd minute from Dean Parrett's free-kick, but United held on.
