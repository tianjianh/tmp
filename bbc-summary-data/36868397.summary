Durham Cathedral Lego model's final brick added

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 300,000 brick Lego model of Durham Cathedral has been completed, three years after work on it began.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The creation stands 5ft 6in (1.7m) high, is 12ft 6in (3.84m) long and 5ft (1.53m) wide.
It was built following donations by visitors, who paid Â£1 for each brick.
The model raised funds for a new Â£10.9m permanent exhibition of cathedral artefacts called Open Treasure, which is expected to attract 120,000 people a year.
See a 360 degree view of the model here.
Work started on the replica on 11 July 2013, which tells the story of Durham Cathedral and its place in the development of Christianity in the North East.
The cathedral said it is the first large-scale Lego model to have been built by the public, with visitors from as far as Alaska taking part.
