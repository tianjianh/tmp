"Not many people can say their office is the side of a wall that's higher than the Tower of London," he said.
"Even I found it a bit surreal, but it's been great fun installing the holds and I literally can't wait to properly tackle it when completed."
The Â£75,000 project is a partnership between the climbing centre and Calderdale Council.
