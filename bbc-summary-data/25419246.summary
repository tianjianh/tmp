Climbers say Corrour's toilet is most remote loo on UK mainland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hillwalkers and mountaineers have disputed a claim that a double award-winning loo is the most remote public toilet on the UK mainland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Loo at the Light in Sutherland won two accolades at the 2013 Loo of the Year Awards.
People who look after the facility at Stoer Head Lighthouse said it was a great achievement for mainland UK's "remotest public toilet".
However, climbers say Corrour Bothy's toilet is more remote.
The historic bothy is at the foot of Cairn Toul and the Devil's Point in the Lairig Ghru in the Cairngorms.
Corrour Bothy is looked after by volunteers.
Walkers and climbers, and their representative body the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, have posted messages on Twitter in support of the Lairig Ghru loo.
They argue that it is remoter because the long trek to get to it has to be made on foot, rather than by car.
But Leigh Sedgley, who is involved in the running of Loo at the Light, said she hoped the fact that the Sutherland site was maintained and cleaned daily strengthened its claim to the title.
She added: "The Loo at the Light is now without doubt the remotest award winning loo on the mainland UK, and 'probably' the remotest public loo on the mainland UK too."
Whichever site is rightful holder of the claim, both share the aim of encouraging responsible toileting in the outdoors.
"Wild toileting" near Stoer Head had become an unpleasant and unhygienic problem. The public toilets were opened in August and paid for by money raised following a public appeal.
The site was named best Scottish eco-friendly and best car park toilet at the annual Loo of the Year Awards.
Stoer Head Lighthouse gets up to 10,000 visitors a year but the nearest toilet was about six miles (9km) away along a single track road at Clachtoll.
