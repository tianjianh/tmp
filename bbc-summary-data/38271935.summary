[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 4-0 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dominic Poleon grabbed his 12th goal of the season as AFC Wimbledon thumped Port Vale to earn their first win in four games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an inspired performance from Vale goalkeeper Jak Alnwick kept the game goalless at half-time, strikes from Poleon and Tom Elliot, early in the second half set Wimbledon on their way.
And late goals from Tyrone Barnett and Chris Robertson earned a first league win since thrashing Bury 5-1 in November
Vale's defensive concerns remain and they have now won just once in 10 matches.
The home side dominated for much of the first half but Alnwick made four exceptional saves to keep it goalless.
In the 53rd minute the home side broke the deadlock when Sean Kelly made an excellent run down the flank and crossed for Poleon to bundle in from close range.
Elliot headed home from a corner in the 58th minute to make it 2-0.
Soon afterwards Wimbledon keeper James Shea turned Nathan Smith's effort onto the crossbar, before Barnett and Robertson netted in the final five minutes.
