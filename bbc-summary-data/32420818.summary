[SN]TITLE[SN]
RWE win appeal on up to 20 turbines south of Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a wind farm which were rejected by Highland councillors have been approved following a Scottish government planning appeals process.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RWE Innogy UK has proposed erecting up to 20 turbines at Glen Kyllachy near Tomatin south of Inverness.
Highland Council's south planning applications committee unanimously rejected the application last year.
Members of the committee said the development would have "a significant detrimental visual impact".
