[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Reds had former Gillingham man Morris to thank for keeping them in the match before half-time as they ended a run of three successive home defeats.
Rovers' leading scorer John Marquis, with 20 goals already this season, wasted a perfect opportunity to give his side the lead when he had a 25th-minute penalty saved.
Defender Mark Connolly gave away the spot-kick for bringing down Tommy Rowe and Marquis' tame penalty was saved to his left by Morris, who then kept out the rebound from Alfie May.
Rovers, with only one defeat in their previous 14 league games, were again denied by Morris after James Coppinger connected with a cross from Marquis.
A one-sided opening half also saw Marquis have a close-range shot saved by Morris after a strong run by May.
Crawley came to life shortly after the break when, from a free-kick by Dean Cox, defender Joe McNerney forced goalkeeper Tom Lawlor to parry his effort before James Collins put the rebound over.
Morris came to Crawley's rescue again when diving to keep out a low drive from Coppinger after a header from defender Andy Butler was cleared off the line.
Substitute Andy Williams almost snatched Rovers victory late on when his header was cleared off the line by Reds skipper Jimmy Smith.
