[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chelsea v Crystal Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eden Hazard is fit for Chelsea after missing their last game, and Belgium's subsequent two matches, with a calf injury.

Thibaut Courtois may also be available despite sitting out Belgium's draw in Russia with a hip problem, while Diego Costa and Victor Moses are also doubts.
Crystal Palace remain without Patrick van Aanholt because of an ankle injury.
Fraizer Campbell and James McArthur are doubtful with respective hamstring and back problems.
Chelsea loanee Loic Remy is ineligible to face his parent club but Mathieu Flamini is back in training after a muscle injury and could come into contention.
Jonathan Pearce: "On paper this looks like a 17th home win in 18 games under the irrepressible Antonio Conte for Chelsea.
"The champions elect have only ever lost at the Bridge once against Crystal Palace in top-flight football. They shouldn't lose this.
"But it might be tighter than critics expect.
"A few key Chelsea players picked up knocks on international duty. Palace haven't conceded a league goal in nearly five hours, and if Wilfred Zaha can replicate his wonder goal for Ivory Coast in Russia during the international break then anything could happen.
"Chelsea should still have enough though."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "I remember very well the last game against Crystal Palace. We deserved to win but we also suffered.
"They have a lot of great players - (Christian) Benteke is a top player, the same with (Wilfried) Zaha. (Andros) Townsend is another player I like a lot, (Yohan) Cabaye, (Jason) Puncheon, a lot of great players.
"If you ask me why they are in this position, I don't know. It's very strange. When you have this team with these great players it can happen, like with Chelsea last season."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "Wilfried Zaha's in a very, very good place, and that's all I'm concerned about. Not 'should it be England?'.
"It's the Ivory Coast, it's not going to change. He's at Crystal Palace, playing particularly well for us, playing particularly well for the Ivory Coast, scoring goals as well as making them.
"So the international side has no relevance for me whatsoever.
"Zaha is improving his game, maturing in his game, because of his experience over the years, but also the experience he'll gain at playing international football as well as playing for Palace."
Antonio Conte's side are getting so close to the finish line of the title race now, and they can win without playing well.
They saw off Stoke in their last match without ever looking that convincing and I think they will find a way to beat Palace too.
