Jamie Allen put the hosts in front from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute, sending Elliot Justham the wrong way, but the lead was short-lived as three goals in eight minutes from the visitors turned the match around.
Jordan Maguire-Drew scored with a fine free-kick, Robbie Cundy diverted Fejiri Okenabirhie's cross into his own net three minutes later, before Okenabirhie got on the scoresheet.
Corey Whitely's penalty made the result even more emphatic in the 77th minute after Cundy handled the ball in the box , and was sent off, as Dagenham stretched their winning run to five games.
