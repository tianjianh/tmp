Sandro, 25, has agreed a three-year deal to link up again with manager Harry Redknapp, who signed him for Spurs from Internacional in 2010.
Kranjcar, 30, returns to Loftus Road for a second successive season on loan.
Redknapp described Sandro as a "top-class professional", adding he was a "huge fan" of Kranjcar and was "really pleased" to have him back.
Sandro - capped 17 times - made 106 appearances for Tottenham but has not played under new boss Mauricio Pochettino.
Redknapp told his club's website: "Tottenham fans loved him and I'm sure the QPR fans will too. He's been a massive target of mine all summer."
Sandro said: "I like new challenges and this is one I'm really looking forward to. Working with Harry, who I share a great relationship with, is very special to me."
Redknapp described Sandro's signing as a "real statement", adding: "He brings energy, aggression, power and quality. He'll lead by example for us."
Kranjcar, who also played for Redknapp at Spurs, said it was a "great feeling" to be back at Loftus Road.
He added: "The fans were phenomenal last season. I had a great relationship with them and hopefully it's only going to get better.
"I really feel happy here, at a club where I really want to play, and I play with all my heart."
