Christopher Tester, 37, from Torquay, has arrived back in Devon after a campaign raised more than Â£103,000 to get him home for treatment.
He was wounded on Christmas Day while trying to shield his mother.
Friend Charlotte Williams said: "Never in a million years thought we would raise enough to get him home. It really has saved Chris's life."

He arrived at Exeter Airport on Monday night, accompanied by his father Tony.
Mr Tester, who grew up in Brentwood, Essex, is now being assessed by doctors at Derriford Hospital, in Plymouth.
Ms Williams said: "There has been a huge amount of people involved in this. It has been a mammoth effort and we're delighted we had the generous support from everybody and we could get Chris home.
"His injuries were so critical at the time and there was only so much the doctors could do in Antigua, it was common sense to get him back to the UK as quickly as we possibly could."
Ms Williams said it was not yet clear what the long-term implications of Mr Tester's injuries could be.
"He landed back safely, but was very tired," she said.
"He's stable and was transferred to Derriford with no problems.
"We are all so relieved - it's the conclusion we were all wishing for."
