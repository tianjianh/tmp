A fire that burned for more than 10 days at a former cigarette factory in Nottingham is now completely out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze broke out at the former John Player building in Player's Street, Radford on 30 March.  It was being renovated into student flats.
Half of the building had to be demolished to allow fire crews access to "pockets of fire".
Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue said the site had now been handed over to the owner and demolition company.
The fire, at the privately owned Student Lodge, saw hundreds of students in an already developed part of the building and nearby residents evacuated from their homes.
Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue said it hoped they would be allowed to return on Monday.
The service tweeted: "Our thanks to all other agencies and neighbouring services who have assisted with this incident."
