Brazil's chief prosecutor has requested the arrest of a football player released from jail after serving only part of a lengthy murder sentence.

Bruno Fernandes played as goalkeeper for Brazil's most popular football club, Flamengo, until 2010.
He was sentenced in 2013 to 22 years in jail for ordering the murder of  his former girlfriend, Eliza Samudio.
The Supreme Court will meet on Tuesday to rule on prosecutor Rodrigo Janot's request.
The court ordered his temporary release in February on the grounds that he was appealing against the murder sentence.
Fernandes, 32, signed a contract with second division club Boa Esporte last month and has since played several matches. He has served less than a third of his sentence, taking into the account the time he spend in prison before his trial.
His early release has angered many in Brazil, including campaigners to end violence against women.
Ms Samudio had been demanding maintenance for their new-born child, known as Bruninho, which Fernandes refused to pay.
Friends of Fernandes confessed to abducting Ms Samudio, strangling her, cutting her body into pieces and feeding it to dogs.
Fernandes said his friends told him of the murder, but he denied ordering her killing.
In an interview with Globo Television last month, he said he was determined to rebuild his life.
"Even if there was life imprisonment in Brazil, that wouldn't bring the victim back," he said.
Fernandes said he would request a DNA test to confirm whether he was Bruninho's biological father.
The child is being brought up by Eliza Samudio's mother, Sonia de Moura.
