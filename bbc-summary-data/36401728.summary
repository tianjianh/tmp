The band headlined a show at Cornwall's Eden Project, opening with Paper Gods, the title track of their latest album.
They followed it up with a brace of 80s hits - Wild Boys, Hungry Like The Wolf and A View To A Kill.
Will Young, Laura Mvula and Shaun The Sheep have also taken part in the UK-wide celebration of music.
Choristers Only Men Aloud launched events at 06:50, singing with Amy Wadge - who was singing on a platform atop of the Severn Bridge.
The singer, who won a Grammy for co-writing Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud, penned a song specially for BBC Music Day. Called The Bridge, it also marks the 50th anniversary of the Severn Bridge bridge being built.
Nile Rodgers, who co-founded Chic and has worked with Prince and David Bowie, is an ambassador for BBC Music Day, and said music had the power to change lives.
"I've had some really rough years as of late," said the star, who is currently in remission from cancer, "but the music keeps us going".
"When I have my worst times, I just pick up my guitar and I start practicing in my room. And people wonder, 'well, do those songs become hits?'.
"And I go, 'I don't care, I just do it because it makes me feel good'. I love to play."
Almost 400 events took place across the UK on Friday, including a children's "vegetable orchestra", led by Shaun The Sheep at Bristol's Colston Hall.
Rock band Travis played a unique, one-off show with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow's Barrowlands.
Birmingham's New Street Station saw a flashmob by singer Ruby Turner and the Town Hall Gospel Choir, who opened their set with gospel classic This Train (Is Bound For Glory).
Meanwhile, the Ulster Orchestra performed in the grounds of the Stormont Parliament Buildings in Belfast.
Their programme included the theme to TV show Game Of Thrones, much of which is filmed in Northern Ireland.
A UK-wide bell-ringing event took place at 19:00 BST, with more than 180 church towers ringing simultaneously, including Bristol and Manchester cathedral and smaller parish churches such as Saint Francis Xavier's in Liverpool and St Mary's in Turville, Buckinghamshire.
BBC Radio 2 honoured five "unsung heroes" of music, including Dr Jane Bentley, who runs music groups for people with mental health difficulties, alzheimers and dementia.
And children's choirs from around the UK joined forces together to perform a specially-written song for BBC Music Day.
Our Song was composed by Sasha Johnson Manning using words provided by listeners to CBeebies radio.
At lunchtime, pop star Will Young serenaded workers at Bristol's Pukka Herbs tea factory, marking the 75th anniversary of Workers Playtime - a BBC radio programme which was started to boost morale among workers during the Second World War.
Dressed in hygienic scrubs, the singer said he was taking part because music "crosses boundaries" and brings communities together.
"I get as much joy singing in the shower as I will singing here today," he added.
Under the banner Take It To The Bridge, live music was staged on more than 40 bridges around the UK.
A Borders piper and a Northumbrian piper played on opposite sides of the Union Chain Bridge, which unites England and Scotland over the River Tweed, before meeting in the middle.
Singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti battled vertigo on London's Tower Bridge - playing his set on a glass-bottomed walkway 42 metres above the River Thames.
"I was clenching my eyes together," he admitted after the performance.
The Military Wives Choir sang Sailing - as made famous by Rod Stewart - on the bridge of HMS Victory in Portsmouth; while Middlesbrough's Tees Transporter Bridge featured live music throughout the day.
In Yorkshire, Rebecca Newman played Bridge over Troubled Waters on a temporary crossing over the River Wharfe. The footbridge was constructed after Tadcaster Bridge crumbled during floods last Christmas.
Full details of events around the UK can be found on the BBC Music Day website.
Duran Duran's concert will be broadcast live from 21:00 BST on Radio 2, while highlights will be shown on BBC One on Sunday, 5 June.
"Can I say thank you to the BBC for Music Day?" said singer Simon LeBon, four songs into their set.
"I think it's an amazing thing to bring people together over music."
