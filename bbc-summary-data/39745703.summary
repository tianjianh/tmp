One-Day Cup: Moeen Ali leads Worcestershire to win over Leicestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moeen Ali hit 90 as Worcestershire made it back-to-back One-Day Cup wins with a 42-run victory over Leicestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England all-rounder struck two sixes and 12 fours as he laid the foundation for Worcestershire's 361-8 after they were put into bat.
Leicestershire, who chased 311 to beat Lancashire on Friday, made a valiant attempt as Mark Cosgrove hit 67 and Aadil Ali struck 88 to give them hope.
But they lost their last four wickets for 16 runs, with Ali the last man out.
Despite Ali's highest List A score, it was a total that proved beyond their hosts, who were dismissed for 319 with 16 balls to spare.
The Foxes had lost wickets at regular intervals, most notably Jack Shantry's sharp one-handed return catch to dismiss main dangerman Cosgrove.
And the alert Ben Cox pulled off a remarkable stumping when, seeing Cameron Delport had stepped out of his ground after missing an attempt to thrash Worcestershire captain Joe Leach through the off-side, he threw down the stumps.
Moeen, part of England's squad for the forthcoming One-Day International series against Ireland and South Africa, and June's Champions Trophy, opened the batting for Worcestershire, scoring at more than a run a ball before edging Zak Chappell to wicket-keeper Lewis Hill when 10 short of his century.
Tom Fell (39), Joe Clarke (42) and Ben Cox (44) all made valuable contributions as Worcestershire, who beat Nottinghamshire in their opening game, piled up their highest 50-over score against first-class opposition, beating the 320-8 they made against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl in 2009.
Leicestershire batsman Aadil Ali:
"It's nice to do well but the most important thing is winning the game for your team, and we fell short - it was my job to see it through and bat the overs, so I'm disappointed.
"The ground-staff have done a great job. The wicket was flat and the outfield lightning fast, so we felt we could chase any total. We were pretty sure we could be there or thereabouts, and on another day we might have done it.
(On the Delport dismissal): "Some keepers throw the ball at the stumps in those circumstances, others don't. It depends on how they feel about it. It's a personal thing. I don't think I would, but it's in the rules, so you have to be aware.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes:
"We're delighted to win, but that was a great game of cricket and Leicestershire should take a lot of heart from the way they went about the chase.
"Our batting was outstanding. We had some really good partnerships, with people chipping in all the way. Having John Hastings and Ed Barnard at 9 and 10 shows the depth we have now. Then Brett D'Oliveira bowled really well, better than his figures suggest, and Ross Whiteley's fielding was outstanding.
"Now we go to Northants, a very, very dangerous team, as we've seen over the last couple of seasons. We want to qualify in this competition, and if we can go there and win it will have been the perfect start."
Worcestershire teenagers Ollie Westbury and George Scrimshaw, who signed their first professional deals last summer, have both signed new undisclosed-length contracts with the county.
Opening batsman Westbury, 19, has represented England at Under-19 level, scoring 196 against Sri Lanka at Fenner's last July.
Fast bowler Scrimshaw, also 19, was also called up by England Under-19s last summer, only to withdraw with a toe injury. He is currently recovering from a stress fracture of the back.
