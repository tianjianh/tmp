The 44-year-old was with a group of friends making his way to the railway station to return to Hemel Hempstead after a match at Molineux stadium.
They were attacked in Littles Lane at about 17:00 GMT, West Midlands Police said.
Det Sgt Adam Keen said the group was "completely outnumbered" and the man was left with a severe head injury.
He is currently in hospital with what the force described as "life-threatening injuries".
"His family have been informed and we are in the process of taking statements from witnesses and locating any CCTV which might have captured those responsible for the attack," Det Sgt Keen said.
He appealed for anyone with information on the attack to come forward.
The Championship match between Wolves and Watford finished in a 2-2 draw.
Wolves Chief Executive Jez Moxey said the club were "deeply saddened" to hear about the attack and their thoughts were with the supporter and his family.
"As a club we deplore any violence in or around football matches, and we will work closely with the relevant authorities to help bring the perpetrator, or perpetrators, to justice," he said.
