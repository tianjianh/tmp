Versatile back Tait, 31, has played more than 100 games for Tigers, with 19 appearances this season.
"Tigers is a massive club and playing in big games is one of the main reasons you want to be here. I'm very glad to be doing that," Tait said.
Rizzo, 34, has played seven times for Leicester this season since returning from injury at the end of January.
He said: "It is a privilege for me to play for the Tigers and from the moment I joined Leicester felt like home."
Second-row Harry Wells and versatile forward Harry Thacker, both 23, have also agreed deals but, in keeping with club policy, the length of contracts have not been revealed.
