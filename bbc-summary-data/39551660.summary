Jupiter like you've never seen it before

A stunning new image of Jupiter, showing the giant planet in glorious detail, has been captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

At a distance of 415 million miles, Jupiter is now closer to the Earth than at any other time during the year.
Jupiter is best known for the Great Red Spot, which is a storm larger than the Earth that has raged for at least 150 years.
The photograph views the gas giant at "opposition" - in a position directly opposite the Sun and the Earth.
The images are part of the American space agency Nasa's Opal programme that provides Hubble images every year of the outer planets to look for changes in their storms, winds and clouds.
