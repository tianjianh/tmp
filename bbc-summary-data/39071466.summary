Emergency services were called to the scene following the incident.
The plane, with 59 passengers on board, ended up leaning on one side with its wing touching the runway.
Flybe said no-one had been injured in the incident which happened at about 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT).
Schiphol Airport tweeted: "The landing gear of a Flybe airplane collapsed during touchdown.
"All passengers are brought to the terminal by bus at the moment.
"No people are injured. Flight operation is up and running again."
Flybe said in a statement: ""Flybe can confirm that there has been an incident involving one of our aircraft, flight no BE1284...We can confirm there are no injuries and all passengers have been bussed to the airport terminal.
"Our primary concern is for the welfare of passengers and crews."
The airline's chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener added: "Our highest priority is the safety and well-being of our passengers and crew.
"Our pilots regularly train for situations such as this in simulators at our training academy in Exeter. Our cabin crew are also fully trained to deal with these situations professionally.
"We have sent a specialist team to offer assistance to the investigation and we will now do all we can to understand the cause of this incident"
It was the second incident of the day involving a Flybe aircraft.
Earlier, a Flybe flight from Glasgow to Birmingham was forced to return to Glasgow Airport after a technical fault meant the pilot had to shut down one engine.
A spokesman for Flybe said: "Flybe can confirm that BE783 - Glasgow to Birmingham returned to Glasgow Airport following a technical fault that resulted in the captain electing to shut down the number one engine as a safety precaution.
"The pilot followed all required procedures and the aircraft landed safely without incident."
The plane was met by emergency vehicles when it landed. No-one was injured in the incident.
