[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City have signed young striker Charles Vernam on loan from Derby County for the rest of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vernam becomes the second 20-year-old Rams player to sign for League One Sky Blues following last week's arrival of defender Farrend Rawson.
He has played three times in the EFL Trophy for Championship side Derby's under-23s this season.
He also came on as a late substitute in the 2-1 FA Cup win at West Bromwich Albion earlier this month.
"He has an extremely impressive scoring record at under-23 level," said City manager Russell Slade. "He's been on the verge of Derby's first-team set-up for a while now.
"A number of clubs were monitoring him so we're especially pleased to have bought him to Coventry. Charles is clever and intelligent with his movement, and is also a clinical finisher."
Vernam is League One bottom club Coventry's third January loan signing following the arrival of Rawson and Burton Albion midfielder Callum Reilly, while City have also signed striker Stuart Beavon on an 18-month deal.
