EU referendum: Britons abroad lose vote legal bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Britons living abroad have lost a High Court battle over the right to vote in June's EU referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The legal challenge was brought by World War Two veteran Harry Shindler, 94, who lives in Italy, and lawyer and Belgian resident Jacquelyn MacLennan.
Under law, UK citizens who have lived elsewhere in Europe for more than 15 years are barred from voting.
But the pair argued the in-out vote on EU membership directly affected them and called for a judicial review.
They asked the two judges to declare that section Two of the EU Referendum Act 2015, which established "the 15-year rule", unlawfully restricted their right to freedom of movement under EU law.
But the judges ruled that the section did not restrict their rights and rejected their application for judicial review.
Lawyers representing the pair say they will seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment.
Earlier this month, the court heard up to two million expats were being denied the right to take part in the referendum.
Mr Shindler - who has lived in Italy since 1982 - and other campaigners argue the 15-year cut-off is arbitrary and that rules governing UK general elections, the basis for the referendum franchise, are not being applied evenly.
His lawyers say the EU Referendum Act authorising the vote extends the right to vote to peers, and Gibraltar residents who would not normally be able to take part in general elections, but not long-term expats.
The government says the franchise was agreed by both Houses of Parliament.
