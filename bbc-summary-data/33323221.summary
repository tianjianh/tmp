Caron Smyth and Finbar McGrillen murders: Killers jailed without remission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who murdered a couple in a Belfast flat have been told by a judge that they will serve every day of their prison sentences without remission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caron Smyth, 40 and Finbar McGrillen, 42, were beaten to death at Ravenhill Court in December 2013.
Shaun Hegarty, formerly of Grainne House in the New Lodge area of Belfast, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years.
Ciaran Nugent, formerly of the Simon Community on the Falls Road, will serve at least 14 years in prison.
The double murder was described in court as a savage and sustained attack during which the victims were punched, kicked, stamped on and cut.
Hegarty and Nugent, who are both 35, had initially denied the murders and were due to stand trial, but they later pleaded guilty.
Ms Smyth was a former girlfriend of Hegarty and their relationship ended just days before the murders.
The judge at Belfast Crown Court said the killings were cruel and utterly senseless and had been initiated by Hegarty's jealously and anger.
He said the men would served every day of their minimum jail terms before before they would be considered for parole.
The judge said that the murders took place while Hegarty was on bail, and it was part of his bail conditions that he stayed away from Ms Smyth.
Nugent was given a lesser minimum term than his co-accused after he pleaded guilty to the double murder on the grounds of joint enterprise.
He had admitted that he anticipated Hegarty was going to carry out a serious assault and that he assisted in efforts to clean the scene of the attack, but that he did not inflict any injuries.
The judge told the pair they had carried out a "truly shocking" crime that had a devastating impact on the victims' relatives.
"The lives of their close families have been permanently blighted by these dreadful crimes so casually committed," he said.
