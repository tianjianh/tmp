Scottish Cup final 2016: Hibernian & Rangers to face SFA hearings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian and Rangers have been issued with notices of complaint by the Scottish FA's compliance officer in relation to the Scottish Cup final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A pitch invasion took place after Hibs beat Rangers 3-2 on 21 May.
The clubs are alleged to have breached disciplinary rule 311, which states "damage was sustained to Hampden... as a consequence of misbehaviour by supporters".
They have until 6 September to respond to the notices of complaint.
Principal hearing dates have been set for Hibs on 4 October and Rangers on 5 October.
The compliance officer looked at the cup final incidents after the publication of Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen's independent report into the day's events.
The SFA requested that report following the pitch invasion which occurred after the match. The report, published earlier this month, concluded that the Scottish government should consider making it a criminal offence to run on to a football pitch.
Fans entered the pitch at Hampden after Hibernian won their first Scottish Cup in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans jumped the barriers at the final whistle and a number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour by Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their cup final medals.
