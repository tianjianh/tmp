[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has started on a Â£1.4m road resurfacing scheme on the A64 near Tadcaster, North Yorkshire.

More than 3.5 miles of the westbound carriageway will be repaired, with 3,000 reflective road studs replaced and the road markings repainted.
The affected area runs from the A162 at Tadcaster to the A1 at Bramham.
Highways England said the work would be carried out overnight between 20:00 and 06:00 and is expected to be completed by January.
Steven Wright, the project manager for Highways England, said: "It's essential that this work takes place so that drivers can benefit from smoother and safer journeys, and a well-maintained road network.
"We'll be resurfacing an area of road equivalent to nearly eight football pitches as well as replacing thousands of reflective road studs, so drivers really will notice a difference when the work is completed."
