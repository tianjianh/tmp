Chris Hazzard said the he was mindful that many badge holders have "conditions which are unlikely to change."
The consultation process will take place over the coming months.
It will consider the renewal process and fees.
The minister said he had asked officials to undertake a review through a consultative process that will begin early in 2017.
"The outcomes of that consultation will direct both the legislative and operational requirements to make the changes necessary to the renewal process.
"The review, I hope, will produce a simpler, more accessible application process for those applicants with life-long mobility issues," he said.
