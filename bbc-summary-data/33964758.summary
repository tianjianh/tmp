'Hooded man' Kevin Hannaway released on bail by Dublin court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A member of the group known as the 'hooded men' has been released on bail by Dublin's Special Criminal Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Hannaway and four others were arrested on 8 August as part of an operation targeting dissident republican activity in Dublin.
Mr Hannaway, 67, from Colin Mill in Belfast was charged on 10 August with assisting the IRA.
Edward O'Brien, 41, of Finglas, Dublin and Eva Shannon, 59, from Oakman Street, Belfast face the same charge.
David Nooney , 52, from Coultry Green, Ballymun, Dublin, and SeÃ¡n Hannaway, 47, from Linden Gardens, Belfast are each charged with membership of the IRA.
Mr Hannaway is a member of the group known as the 'hooded men' who  were detained by security forces during the Troubles.
They are seeking revision of a 1978 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which said their treatment was "inhuman and degrading" but not torture.
Mr Hannaway, along with his co-accused, were each granted bail at the non-jury court, on a number of conditions.
A book of evidence is expected to be served on 3 November.
