Barcelona have reported La Liga president Javier Tebas to Spain's highest sports court after he questioned their players' conduct during a heated 3-2 win at Valencia.

The hosts were fined 1,500 euros (Â£1,340) after a water bottle was thrown from the stands at players.
But the disciplinary committee also criticised the "reproachable behaviour" of the celebrating Barcelona players.
The Catalan club said these declarations were "irresponsible".
"The most serious thing is the thrown bottle, but some players acted in a way we don't like," Tebas said after the incident, also suggesting Barcelona players provoked Valencia fans.
Barcelona said they have requested the Administrative Court of Sport open disciplinary proceedings against Tebas and members of the federation's competition committee.
The club's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, added: "Making statements regarding the actions of the players adds even more tension to a situation that must be de-escalated.
"The declarations made by Tebas are irresponsible and unbecoming of a sports executive."
