The 21-year-old made two appearances for the Tykes this season in the Football League Trophy.
He went on loan to Kidderminster last month and scored three goals in seven games after making his debut against the Wood.
"Harry really impressed me with his work ethic, strength and commitment," manager Luke Garrard said.
"We all know we need goals, we all know our defence is not a problem and with the strike force I now have fit and at my disposal, I'm hoping that they will get the goals that will fire us too survival."
Boreham Wood are one place and one point above the National League relegation zone, having been promoted last season.
