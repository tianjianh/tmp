Plans for new stone plaque to mark Battle of Hornshole

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new stone plaque could be erected at a famous Borders battle site, under plans submitted to the local council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors will be asked to approve proposals to erect the stone commemorating the Battle of Hornshole in 1514.
The 1514 Club, which protects the Hawick Common Riding, want to place it at the site of an existing memorial, to the north-east of Hawick.
Despite 11 objections, council officers have recommended approval.
The stone structure would mark the battle between an English raiding party and youths from Hawick.
The young Scots defeated the invaders and captured their standard at Hornshole.
Planners have received representations from people concerned that it will detract from, and dominate, the existing Hornshole monument, which was refurbished last year.
Concerns have also been raised that the plaque is unnecessary as there is already a small commemorative plate in place.
The council's archaeology officer also warned that excavations below 20cm (8in) may reveal evidence of the skirmish, such as fire pits used by the English.
Councillors will decide whether to allow the plaque at a meeting of the planning and building standards committee on Monday.
