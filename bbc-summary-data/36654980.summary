[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have signed left-back Dan Butler on a two-year deal five days after he left National League side Torquay United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Butler began his career with Portsmouth and made 48 appearances before moving to Torquay in July 2015.
The 21-year-old started all but one of Torquay's league games last season but turned down an offer of a new deal.
"I'm happy to have signed and I'm looking forward to the future and the start of pre-season," he said.
Butler continued, "I've had a taste of League football with Portsmouth and last season I had to drop down to the Conference.
"I've benefited from that and played a lot of games and I'm ready to get back into League Two and hopefully play well for Newport."
