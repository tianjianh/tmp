Wire fell behind to Greg Burke's try but responded through Ryan Atkins and Kevin Brown for a 12-6 half-time lead.
Jay Chapelhow's try and a penalty from Patrick Ah Van gave Widnes a two-point lead after the break.
Matty Russell and Chris Hill went over after Brown's second and third tries, with Ah Van crossing for the Vikings.
England stand-off Brown moved to Warrington for an undisclosed fee at the start of the season after three years at Widnes and was booed by visiting fans throughout, but produced an excellent display for last year's losing finalists.
After a stuttering start to their Super League season, Warrington's win was their fifth straight victory at home and their seventh in a row at the Halliwell Jones Stadium against their neighbours.
They last won the Challenge Cup in 2012, and were losing finalists at Wembley last year when they were beaten 12-10 by Hull FC.
Vikings' injury problems meant they had a number of teenagers in their matchday squad, and Lloyd Roby made his debut.
Denis Betts' side have lost six of their last seven games, and have not won at Warrington since August 2013.
Warrington: Ratchford; Russell, Hughes, Atkins, Lineham; Brown, Patton; Hull, Gidley, Sims, Jullien, Westwood, Cooper.

Widnes: Hanbury; Roby, Runciman, Walsh, Ah Van; Mellor, Johnstone; Dudson, Heremaia, Buchanan, Cahill, Olbison, Burke.
