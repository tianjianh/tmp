[SN]TITLE[SN]
Women's Super League One: Birmingham City Ladies 1-0 Sunderland Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Wellings' dramatic goal gave Birmingham City Ladies a victory over Sunderland Ladies that lifted them into fourth in Women's Super League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mel Lawley's late cross was parried by keeper Rachael Laws into the path of Wellings and she finished.
Birmingham went close to taking the lead within seven minutes as Chloe Peplow fired over after finding space on the edge of the box.
Sunderland defended well but were unable to keep the hosts out.
The Lady Black Cats remain in seventh on six points, having won just once this season.
Birmingham City Ladies manager David Parker:
"I'm not really relieved, it's more a feeling of satisfaction and justification because we fully deserved the result and now we can put Arsenal and Chelsea under high pressure.
"I said to the girls before the game that if we have aspirations to get into the Champions League, no disrespect to Sunderland, but we need to be winning these games.
"We were able to get to the ball into the final third all throughout the game today and for some reason we struggled to make that final ball count and it looked like it we wouldn't be able to make the breakthrough.
"But full credit to the girls, they absolutely deserved it. And I'm absolutely delighted for Charlie because her persistence today has paid dividends."
Sunderland Ladies manager Carlton Fairweather:
"Massively frustrating in the manner of the defeat, especially how cheaply we've given the goal away in the last few minutes because the girls, by and large, defended heroically.
"Birmingham are a good side and although they had a lot of the ball they didn't really cause us any major issues throughout, it's something that we'll hopefully learn from.
"Games are coming thick and fast now and we need to make sure we can defend well and see the job through to the final minutes.
"On balance it was really one piece of individual play that has caused us to come unstuck today, with Mel Lawley's cross."
