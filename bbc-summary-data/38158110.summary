The vehicle is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and a battery pack.
The Ballymena company hopes that London may in future place an order for the buses.
Wrightbus previously delivered 1,000 Routemaster vehicles to London when Boris Johnson was Mayor.
However, his successor Sadiq Khan has pledged to stop buying pure diesel double deckers from 2018.
Wrigthbus launched its new bus at London City Hall and it will be trialled next year.
William Wright, director of Wrights Group, said: "Innovation and technology is at the core of everything we do.
"This vehicle brings an interesting new dimension to bus technology, offering transport operators a choice to help address the world's environmental challenges."
Wrightbus makes buses for customers around the world and employs more than 1,900 people.
