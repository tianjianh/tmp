[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clifford Warde, from Clackmannanshire, was caught after the mother of the second victim intercepted messages he sent to her 14-year-old daughter.
Police discovered videos on Warde's phone of the 50-year-old having sex with the younger girl.
Warde will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on 7 December.
He committed the offences between November 2014 and March 2016.
Prosecutor Mark McGuire told judge Lord Boyd that the messages sent to the 14-year-old girl were "too graphic" to read in open court.
Warde targeted his other victim when she turned 13 when he began by texting graphic sexual messages to her.
The court was told that on a number of occasions Warde recorded himself having sex with the girl and sexually abusing her.
Mr McGuire added: "At no time during this abuse did the accused ever use contraception."
The girl told police she had felt embarrassed about the video recordings being made.
Warde admitted making arrangements for the 14-year-old girl to travel to meet him with the intention of taking part in unlawful sexual activity.
He also pleaded guilty to having sex with the other girl and sending her sexually explicit messages.
