Three members of a group who sold sick puppies to the public in Greater Manchester have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 39 animals were seized during raids in Oldham in 2013 after concerns were raised to the RSPCA about sick dogs being offered online.
The charity said "glossy brochures and health check cards" were created by the group, but two-thirds of the seized dogs had congenital defects.
At Oldham Magistrates Court, six people were banned from owning dogs for life.
During the raids, officers found chihuahuas, pomeranians, spaniels, shih tzus and Yorkshire terriers kept in purpose-built pods.
Six of the seized puppies had to be put down due to their health.
A cockapoo puppy sold by the group, called Crumpet, was so sick that it died less than two weeks after the sale, said an RSPCA spokesman.
RSPCA staff also discovered about Â£3,500 in cash and a step-by-step guide to selling puppies.
The group is thought have made more than Â£8,000 a week with sellers gaining Â£50 commission on each sale.
Ch Insp Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, called it "animal suffering on an almost industrial scale".
He said: "They rent houses and put a smattering of furniture in them to make it look like a family home, from which they peddle these sick puppies.
"On some occasions that we have been told about, adult dogs would be presented under the false pretence that they were the parents of the puppies being sold."
The RSPCA believe the dogs had been imported from across Europe and then sold as part of an organised business.
