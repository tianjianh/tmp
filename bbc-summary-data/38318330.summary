The 16-year-old said she was "so excited" to be performing at the ceremony on 20 January. She finished second on the TV talent show in 2010.
Boris Epshteyn, director of communications for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, said she was "an inspiration for all Americans".
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and rapper Kanye West have also been rumoured.
West met the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, but there has been no confirmation on whether the pair discussed the inauguration.
