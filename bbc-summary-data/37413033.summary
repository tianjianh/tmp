Ben Flower: Wigan prop charged after sending-off against Warrington

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan prop Ben Flower has been charged with recklessly using an elbow after being sent off against Warrington in Super League on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flower, 28, was dismissed for a late tackle on Warrington's Declan Patton in the 57th minute.
Wigan went on to win the game 35-28 despite Flower's dismissal.
If found guilty, Flower could miss the remainder of the season as the Grade C offence carries a maximum punishment of a three-week suspension.
His hearing will be held on Tuesday.
Flower saw red in the match at Halliwell Jones Stadium for the first time since his dismissal in the 2014 Grand Final against St Helens.
His punch on Lance Hohaia in the second minute at Old Trafford led to him being banned for six months - the longest in Super League history.
