Meanwhile, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was named model of the year.
She said: "I would say since, very early on in my modelling career everyone always told me, 'By the time you're 27 it's going to be over, so make sure you plan something else'.
"And I'm 27 now and I think for me it was always really important that I'd built something for myself afterwards, and I hope that's what I'm doing and we'll see."
