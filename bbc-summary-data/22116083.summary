Touch Bionics said its "i-limb ultra revolution" product could be controlled by a new "biosim" app.
The application, which is compatible with the latest Apple products, is designed to give i-limb wearers quick access to up to 24 different grip patterns.
The latest product also offers powered thumb rotation to enhance dexterity.
Touch Bionics described it as a "significant advance" in its i-limb technology.
Chief executive Ian Stevens said: "We believe that the i-limb ultra revolution, with powered thumb rotation and the ability to quickly access multiple grip patterns, offers unparalleled dexterity and control, enabling wearers to more easily perform activities of daily living and thus increase their quality of life."
The powered rotation of the thumb can be either controlled directly by the wearer's muscle signals, or can move automatically into position as part of a pre-set grip pattern or gesture.
The new "quick grips" option from the biosim mobile control app allows the user to automatically activate 24 different grip patterns and gestures on their prosthesis with a single tap of the screen.
In January Touch announced it had achieved Â£10m in annual sales for the first time.
It reported revenues grew by 17% in 2012 after expanding its product lines.
They included the launch of its "i-limb ultra" prosthetic hand and an upgrade to its digits solution for people with missing fingers.
