Judicial review for Penzance helicopter link

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A High Court judge will review the decision to grant planning permission for a new heliport in Penzance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cornwall Council granted permission in February but the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company (IoS) has been given the go-ahead for a judicial review.
IoS said any helicopter service to Scilly would be better based out of its airport at Land's End.
Penzance Heliport, the company behind the scheme, said it was disappointed by the decision.

Tourism bosses say trade on the Isles of Scilly has suffered since the old helicopter service ended in 2012.
Since then, the link has been covered by a seasonal ferry and fixed wing planes, operated by IoS.
It said it supported the return of a helicopter service but believed Land's End Airport would be a better location, and was calling for an independent and evidence-based debate about the potential impact of a new heliport.
Penzance Heliport said: "We remain disappointed that the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company has taken this move, but are absolutely convinced that Cornwall Council's decision was the right one and that this will be reflected in the outcome of the case."
Andrew May, chairman of IoS said: "The judge's decision to grant leave to pursue a judicial review is recognition that the original planning decision is worthy of further scrutiny."
Cornwall Council said it would "now be considering what action to take in the light of the decision to grant permission for the judicial review to proceed".
A petition started by an islander calling on the company to stop its action against the heliport has gained more than 7,000 signatures.
