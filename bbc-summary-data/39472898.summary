Premier League statistics: Can Chelsea be overhauled?

Is the title race really back on? Are visiting teams to the Theatre of Dreams just trying to send fans to sleep? And who is the Premier League's unluckiest omen?

BBC Sport takes a look at the quirkiest and more interesting statistics from the weekend.
Heading into the final 10 games of the season, Tottenham were 10 points behind leaders Chelsea.
A win at Burnley and a shock defeat for the Blues at home to Crystal Palace later, Mauricio Pochettino's side now have nine games to overhaul a seven-point gap.
Unlikely? Yes. Unprecedented? No.
In fact, two recent examples perhaps offer hope of an exciting run-in.
In the most dramatic conclusion to a season in Premier League history, Manchester City made up an eight-point deficit to rivals Manchester United in just six games to claim the 2011-12 title on goal difference.
It all, of course, came down to Sergio Aguero's thrilling extra-time winner against QPR, but City crucially beat United along the way, while the Red Devils also suffered a shock defeat to Wigan and let a two-goal lead slip in a 4-4 draw with Everton.
Spurs have already played Chelsea twice this season, but could City, United and Everton help them out by taking points off Antonio Conte's side over the next two months?
City also pulled off another dramatic late show to win the 2013-14 title, coming from nine points down on leaders Liverpool on 20 April 2014.
This time they were helped by having two games in hand on the Reds but again won all of their remaining games, suggesting Spurs will need to execute a similarly flawless finish.
Saturday's goalless encounter with West Brom was Manchester United's eighth draw at Old Trafford in a season that seen the Theatre of Dreams take on a nightmarish quality for home fans hoping to see their side win.
Following Manchester City's draw with Arsenal on Sunday, Jose Mourinho's fifth-placed side trail their city rivals by five points in the race for the top four and Champions League football next season.
United do have a game in hand and will go to City on 27 April, but the damage could already have been done by those home draws.
Arsenal are the only side in Premier League history to finish in the top four with eight or more draws at home - but that was in a 42-game season in 1993-94.
United have four home games remaining this season, hosting Everton, Chelsea, Swansea and Crystal Palace during the run-in.
It's looking like nothing less than 12 points from those games will do if they want to be the first Premier League side with eight or more home draws in a 38-game season to break the top four.

If you managed to wince your way through the first part of Mourinho's testy post-match interview with BBC Sport's Conor McNamara, you'll have heard the Portuguese manager complain about the way West Brom approached the game.
"We've had a lot of this, this season - teams that have come here just to defend," said Mourinho.
So does he have a point? Do visiting teams just sit back and let Manchester United have the ball at Old Trafford?
Possession is only one measure of where the balance of a game lies, but so far this season Manchester United's opponents at Old Trafford have the third-lowest average possession compared to at other grounds.
Manchester City have seen most of the ball of all home teams, with six draws at the Etihad this season, while Liverpool are second, having had three draws at Anfield.
Interestingly, when teams do secure a draw at Old Trafford, the hosts' share of the ball tends to rise.
Manchester United's average possession at Old Trafford rises from 60% in all results this season to 65% across the eight home draws.
Perhaps Mourinho's men should try to give their opponents more of the ball - although not too much.
United's average possession in their six home victories this campaign is 56.1%, but they saw just 39.9% of the ball in their only home defeat to Manchester City in September.
While Sunderland's Jack Rodwell finally ended a run of Premier League starts without a victory at 39 this season, another player at a relegation-threatened North East club has been amassing a similarly unwanted record.
Middlesbrough's drab goalless draw with Swansea on Sunday means Rudy Gestede has not won in 39 Premier League appearances, whether as a starter or a substitute - extending his own record.
Gestede's last victory came when he scored the winner on his competitive debut for Aston Villa against Bournemouth on the first day of Villa's ill-fated 2015-16 season, while Boro have yet to register a league win since the Benin striker joined in January.
That poor year for Villa also helped account for the winless runs of right-back Alan Hutton (30) and goalkeeper Brad Guzan (27).
Meanwhile, Derby County's record lowest points haul of 11 in the 2007-08 season sees centre-back Darren Moore (31) and Kenny Miller (29) make the list, while defender George McCartney (28) can put his inclusion down to Sunderland's relegation in 2005-06.
By now it's safe to file Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser under the 'tricky winger' category.
The 23-year-old Scot won his fifth penalty of the season against Southampton on Saturday - more than any other player in the Premier League.
Not that Fraser's fast feet resulted in much joy for the Cherries as Harry Arter belted his spot-kick somewhere between rows M and Z of the south stand at St Mary's.
The previous four penalties won by Fraser were all converted, but only one resulted in a win for Bournemouth - a 4-3 thriller against Liverpool in December.
Fraser has also not taken any of the penalties he's won but after Arter's effort, it may only be a matter of time before he steps up.
