Joe McMahon and Kyle Coney among Tyrone squad departures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe McMahon and Kyle Coney are among six players who are reported to have departed from the Tyrone football squad following Saturday's McKenna Cup final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McMahon, 31, has opted out because of time constraints and fitness issues.
Dermot Carlin is thought to have pulled out for similar reasons but the duo could return later in the season.
Coney is understood to have quit the squad while Mark Donnelly, Plunkett Kane and Kevin Gallagher are thought to have been dropped from the panel.
Manager Mickey Harte was expected to reduce his extended squad following the McKenna Cup campaign and Donnelly, Kane and Gallagher appear to be the principal casualties.
Coney was substituted at half-time in Saturday's McKenna Cup final win over Cavan as was Coalisland man Kane.
McMahon, who won All-Ireland medals with Tyrone in 2005 and 2008, was also replaced at the interval in the McKenna Cup final after making his first appearance of the season in the semi-final win over Armagh.
Omagh St Enda's player McMahon recently became a father for the second time and he is also currently undertaking a teacher training qualification at the University of Ulster, Coleraine.
McMahon was severely affected by injury in 2014 but it is thought there could be a road back for him and Carlin into the Red Hand squad later in the year.
Carrickmore player Donnelly started the McKenna Cup decider but was replaced in the second half by Peter Harte.
After a tremendous underage career, Coney spent a short stint Down Under playing Australian Rules before opting to return home.
However, the Ardboe player has struggled for consistency in the Red Hand senior jersey.
Defender Carlin's 2014 campaign was badly hindered by injury and he did not figure in this month's McKenna Cup.
Tyrone face Monaghan in their Football League Division 1 opener against Monaghan on Saturday night [19:00 GMT].
