[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 2-1 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere won their fifth National League fixture to start the season, this time 2-1 at home to Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last season's 24-goal man, Andy Cook, put the hosts ahead with his second of this campaign after battling past two defenders on the left and slamming home.
Though the score was close, Tranmere in truth should have won by more. James Norwood headed Steven Jennings' corner against the post and Cook was denied by a clearance off the line.
Alex Flisher levelled midway through the second half, squeezing the ball under Scott Davies.
However Steve McNulty bundled home a deserved winner 10 minutes from time, as another Jennings corner caused trouble in the Maidstone box.
