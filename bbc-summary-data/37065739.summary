The 24-year-old, who claimed silver in the keirin on Sunday, lost the first two races in the best-of-three final as Germany's Kristina Vogel won gold.
"I really wanted gold but Vogel is an incredible rider," said James.
Fellow Briton Katy Marchant beat Elis Ligtlee to bronze, winning the first race by more than a bike length and the second by a fraction.

"All the hard work, sweat and tears has paid off. I cannot believe it," said Marchant who started as a heptathlete and represented Great Britain at the 2012 World Junior Championships but switched to cycling on the advice of Toni Minichiello, who coaches Jessica Ennis-Hill.
"It shows how hard myself and Becky have worked. So surreal."
The two medals came shortly after Laura Trott became the first British woman to win four Olympic gold medals by retaining her omnium title.
It has been an impressive Games for James, who missed London 2012, won two world titles in 2013 but then overcame a cancer scare and career-threatening injuries to secure her place in Rio.
