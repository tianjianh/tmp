The number 31 Lothian Bus was hit on Nicolson Street at about 09:44 as it was heading out of the city.
Police Scotland said the upper window on the kerb side was smashed and the man had cuts and bruises to his hand.
The road was closed in both directions at the section outside the Festival Theatre and Surgeons' Hall until 15:40.
Traffic was diverted via Chambers Street and Buccleuch Street.
A Lothian Buses spokeswoman said the bus was hit while it was moving as it headed to Cameron Toll.
She said: "One of our passengers has been hurt due to falling masonry but thankfully has received only minor injuries."
The bus has now been removed and a chimney inspection was carried out by firefighters in the area.
Insp Norman Towler, of Police Scotland, said: "The road has now completely re-opened after all the relevant checks to buildings have been completed.
"We would like to thank the public for their patience."
