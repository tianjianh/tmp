The 56-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, and former wife Yvonne, 54, married in 1988 and had four children before splitting more than two years ago.
Judge Mark Rogers, sitting at a family court in Nottingham, also said the pair should share several properties.
Mr Taylor's wealth is said to be in the region of £3.4m, the court heard.
In a written ruling, Judge Rogers described the 16-times world champion as "charming and engaging", noting the couple "started out with nothing" and the demands of professional life on Mr Taylor.
"His public persona is larger than life with a swagger. In reality he is a thoughtful realistic man," he said.
"He spoke convincingly of the demands of the work he does, the relentless travel on the tour, the training, the tiredness and the draining effect of being away from home."
