The Dark Blues defeated the Staggies 5-2 in a frenetic Dens Park affair.
"I was really pleased today," Hartley told BBC Scotland. "I felt it was a very important game in terms of the top six.
"We've given ourselves a chance, a platform for the next two games. It's where we want to be, but there was some great play today."
Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart scored twice for Hartley's side, with fellow attacker Rory Loy also netting. The trio's manager said the scoreline did not come as a surprise.
"We're a team that plays on the front foot; we like to entertain," said Hartley. "Some weeks you don't know what you're going to get from us, but the majority of the weeks we have been good, we're good to watch, and the front three can cause anyone problems."
On speculation over the future of Stewart, Hartley replied: "I don't know [if we can keep him]. With performances like that he's going to attract attention. We can't stop speculation, we want to keep him here, he's got a year left on his contract and it's something we want to try and discuss with him."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre, meanwhile, said it would be extremely painful were his side to fall short of the top six, having held a position in the Premiership's top half for much of the season.
Defeat leaves County seventh, trailing Dundee on goal difference having played a game more.
"We're relying on favours from other people now," said McIntyre. "We've been in the top six from day one, and it's been progress, but if we're to fall out it like we have this weekend and we don't make it it'd be gut-wrenching.
"It'd be a real, real sore one for us, but you've got to say, if we don't get enough points then we don't deserve it."
