The 27-year-old woman was attacked as she walked near the Jelly Bear cafe on Ingram Street at about 03:20 on Saturday.
She managed to break free and was helped home by a group of men who were across the road at the time.
The suspect is described as black, in his 20s, about 5ft 6in tall, of stocky build with short black hair.
He was wearing a dark-coloured jumper and jeans.
Det Con Vhairi MacDonald, of Police Scotland, said: "We are looking at CCTV footage from in and around Merchant City and the city centre in order to gain additional information.
"From our inquiries so far, we know that the young woman was assisted by a group of perhaps five men and it's important we speak to these men as I'm sure they have information which could assist our investigation.
"I am appealing directly to them to get in touch with us as a matter of urgency so that we can trace the man responsible for this crime."
