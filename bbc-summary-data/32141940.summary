The latest Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1, up from February's 49.9 and higher than market forecasts.
A reading above 50 points shows an expansion in activity in the sector, while one below indicates contraction.
The Shanghai Composite index closed up 1.7% at 3,810.29, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.7% to 25,082.75.
However, while the official PMI survey suggested activity had expanded, a private survey indicated it had contracted, in line with preliminary figures released earlier this month.
The final HSBC/Markit PMI came in at 49.6, slightly higher than a "flash" reading of 49.2.
China has cut interest rates twice since November, among other measures, to try to boost activity.

The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan showed that big firms plan to cut spending by 1.2% in the fiscal year that starts in April - a worrying sign for the economy.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.9% at 19,034.84.
A survey also suggested that Japanese manufacturing activity expanded more slowly in March than in the previous month as domestic orders contracted for the first time in nearly a year.
The final Markit/JMMA PMI was 50.3, just below the preliminary reading of 50.4 and below 51.6 in February.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 closed down 0.5% at 5,860.8, with shares hit by persistently weak commodity prices.
