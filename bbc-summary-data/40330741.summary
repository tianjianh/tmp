The victims, both in their 30s, were found in Welley Road on Saturday evening, with deep cuts and lacerations, police said.
One has recovered sufficiently to be discharged from hospital, and the other is out of danger, police said.
Four men are being held on suspicion of attempted murder.
They include male suspects from Slough, aged 24, 25 and 28.
Detectives said it was an "isolated incident", and said there would be an increased police presence while the inquiry was ongoing.
