Sean McConville curled in an opener from outside the penalty area for Stanley in first-half stoppage time.
Jake Gray equalised for Luton early in the second half after keeper Aaron Chapman had saved from Jake Marriott.
Accrington went back in front as Beckles headed in from eight yards - before Luton's Glen Rea was sent off.
The defender, who had already been booked, was dismissed in stoppage time as he received a second yellow card for a late challenge.
The original Accrington went out of business in 1962, reforming six years later - and reached the fourth round for the first time since then in 2010, when they were knocked out by Premier League side Fulham.
Accrington manager John Coleman: "We've got to use this as a springboard now. Our first target is to get into the top half of the table, and we've got the players to do that.
"I was delighted for Omar to get his first goal for us, and then we managed to see it out without too much harem scarem. To be honest, if anyone was going to score in the last 10 minutes, it was going to be us. On the balance of play, I think we deserved to win the game."
