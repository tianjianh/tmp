The number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has risen to 6,928, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.

The toll has increased by over 1,000 since the WHO's last report on Wednesday, but it includes unreported deaths from earlier in the outbreak.
Experts say the infection rate is more significant that the death toll, as it reflects how the virus is spreading.
Infection rates are decreasing in Liberia, but are high in Sierra Leone.
There have been over 16,000 reported cases in Guinea, Sierra and Liberia.
Liberia: 7,244 cases, 4,181 deaths
Sierra Leone: 6,802 cases, 1,463 deaths
Guinea: 2,123 cases, 1,284 deaths

Are we asking the wrong questions about Ebola?
Who was the outbreak's patient zero?
Mali has reported seven deaths from Ebola and 10 confirmed cases.
More than 4,181 people have died of Ebola in Liberia but while the country has recorded the highest number of cases, the rate of infection is slowing.
The outbreak was also now "stable" in Guinea, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week.
The disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone, with 6,802 cases reported in total.
Nigeria and Senegal are both clear of the quarantine period and no new cases or deaths have been reported.
Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person showing symptoms, such as fever or vomiting.
People caring for the sick or handling the bodies of people infected Ebola are therefore especially vulnerable.
