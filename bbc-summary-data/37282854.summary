[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 1-4 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Byron Harrison continued his impressive form in front of goal as Barrow thumped lowly Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harrison struck twice in the opening half, the second from the penalty spot, to improve his tally to five goals in five games.
Barrow have been unbeaten during the 29-year-old striker's rich run of form - taking 11 points from a possible 15 - and are now on the brink of the play-off places.
Richie Bennett and Liam Hughes added their names to the scoresheet before second-from-bottom Southport got a late consolation through James Caton.
