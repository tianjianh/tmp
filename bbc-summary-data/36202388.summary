Northampton Town defender Brendan Moloney will have minor knee surgery in the hope he will be fit for pre-season.

The 27-year-old has played 29 times for the League Two title winners this term, but has not appeared since 16 April.
That means Josh Lelan will continue at right-back for their final game of the season on Saturday, against Portsmouth.
"The advantage of us having won the title a few weeks ago means we can get any operations that are needed done now," said Cobblers boss Chris Wilder.
