[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Veterans Fund helps projects provide services in areas such as employment, housing, and wellbeing.
Veterans Secretary Keith Brown said the Scottish government had pledged £360,000 - its largest contribution yet.
The fund will open for applications this autumn.
The boost includes a three-year £240,000 contribution from Edinburgh-based investment company Standard Life for employment schemes.
Mr Brown said: "For the past eight years, the Scottish government's Scottish Veterans Fund has been a source of help for projects that make a vital difference to people's lives.
"I am delighted to announce our largest contribution yet, with the fund to be supported by £360,000 of Scottish government money over three years.
"This will ensure it continues to help small, one-year projects - while, for the first time, applicants can bid for two or three-year funding for more strategic projects.
"I'm particularly grateful to Standard Life for their commitment, bringing the total available to £600,000 over three years.
"This investment will enable charities and other organisations to provide even more support to veterans leaving the armed forces and settling in Scotland each year."
Since 2008, The Scottish Veterans Fund has invested more than £830,000 and supported 125 projects that provide support to veterans.
