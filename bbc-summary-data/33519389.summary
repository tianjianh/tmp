BBC launches iPlayer radio downloads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC radio listeners will soon be able to download programmes to their smart phones or tablets for the first time using the iPlayer Radio app.

Programmes from Radio 1's Essential Mix to The Archers will be available to store for 30 days, allowing users to listen without an internet connection.
The iPlayer Radio app on iOS, Android or Kindle will be updated this week.
The upgrade will be completed in time for the start of the BBC Proms on Radio 3 on Friday.
Until now, television programmes have been available to download on the iPlayer app, but radio programmes have not.
The downloads have been made possible after an overhaul of the technology that supports the BBC's online audio content.
