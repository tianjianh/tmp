[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster set up a home Pro12 semi-final against Ulster as they finished top and ended Treviso's hopes of playing in next season's European Champions Cup.

Tries from Johnny Sexton and Richardt Strauss put Leinster in control and another score by the hooker helped extend the lead to 17-0 by the break.
Jack McGrath, Isa Nacewa, Mick Kearney, Noel Reid and Garry Ringrose added second-half tries for Leinster.
Marco Lazzaroni, Matteo Muccignat and Enrico Bacchin replied for Treviso.
Despite Treviso's late rally, Zebre's 47-22 win over the Dragons means that they clinch the European Champions Cup spot available to the leading Italian club.
Leinster, chasing a third Pro 12 title in four years and a fifth overall, will renew acquaintances with Ulster in the play-offs, having beaten the Belfast outfit in the semi-finals in 2011 and 2014, and the final in 2013.
Nacewa's quick feet helped set up Sexton's opening ninth-minute try as the veteran's quick feet helped open up the Treviso midfield.
Forward power yielded both of Strauss' first-half tries with Sexton finally landing a conversion at the third attempt to leave Leinster 17-0 ahead at the break.
Nacewa was again the provider for McGrath's bonus-point clinching 45th-minute try and the wing added the first of his four second-half conversion with Sexton having departed the fray.
The New Zealand-born Fiji international notched a try of his own in the 50th minute after starting the attack with a clever cross-kick before Mick Kearney quickly added Leinster's sixth touchdown.
After Leinster coach Leo Cullen emptied his bench, the home side's performance became somewhat ragged as Lazzaroni, Muccignat and Bacchin notched Treviso tries.
But Leinster continued to look dangerous in attack themselves as Reid and Ringrose were able to bring their try-count up to eight.
