Tyler Walker unfazed by following Des at Nottingham Forest

Tyler Walker insists he is not fazed by the pressure of following his legendary father Des at Nottingham Forest.

Walker senior won 59 England caps and played 408 matches for the Reds during two spells totalling nearly 12 years.
Striker Tyler, 18, has made just seven first-team substitute appearances but has just signed a four-year contract and has already scored a goal - as many as his dad managed in 858 senior games.
"I don't really think about what my dad did," Walker told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"That comparison is not as big as if I was playing centre-back; that takes a bit of the pressure off.
"I just try to play my game. I just want to score goals."
Walker made his debut as an injury-time replacement in the home win over Rotherham in March and scored his first goal against Brentford in his fourth match.
"It was unreal," Walker said of his goal in the 3-3 draw. "It's hard to put in to words the feeling I had felt when the ball went in and celebrated in front of the fans. I was unbelievably excited."
And he is equally as excited by his new deal.
"It's the club I love so I wanted to be here," Walker added.
"It definitely gives you security and allows you to play your football without anything else on your mind. I cannot wait for next season.
"I want to get more pitch time. I want to be playing first-team football."
