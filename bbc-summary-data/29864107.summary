Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew says he is ready to show his face in the city centre again after the club's return to form.

Pardew accused fans of "mass hysteria" in September after his side's poor start to the Premier League season.
But the Magpies overcame Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park on Saturday to make it four league and cup wins in a row.

"It'll be fantastic in the town tonight - I might even go in myself, the first time for a while," said Pardew.
"That is what this city is about. It breathes and loves football."
Newcastle were bottom of the Premier League after a 4-0 defeat at Pardew's former club Southampton on 13 September, with fans calling for him to be sacked.
Since then they have taken 11 points from six top-flight matches.
The win over Liverpool, courtesy of substitute Ayoze Perez's goal, was their third in a row in the league, and lifted them to 11th.
In addition, the Magpies have advanced to the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup.
Pardew, who celebrates four years in the job next month, added: "I always knew, and I kept saying it, that we have good spirit and good talent.
"I am not saying I saw the wins coming, but I knew there was talent.
"When it does not go well, they let you know, and when it is going well, they let you know.
"You take the good with the bad."
The win over Liverpool came at a cost, however.
Midfielder Gabriel Obertan was forced off with a thigh injury and Pardew said the outlook was bleak for the Frenchman.
"Losing Obertan was real blow because he has been outstanding," he said. "It looks like he's got a bad injury so we're all really disappointed for him."
