England boss Roy Hodgson has confirmed Frank Lampard will earn his 100th cap against Ukraine on Tuesday.

The Chelsea midfielder, 35, will become only the eighth Three Lions player to reach the milestone, joining team-mates Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole.
125: Peter Shilton (1970-1990)
115: David Beckham (1996-2009)
108: Bobby Moore (1962-1973)
106: Bobby Charlton (1958-1970)
105: Billy Wright (1946-1959)
104: Ashley Cole (2001-present)
104: Steven Gerrard (2000-present)
Hodgson said he would make one change to the side that beat Moldova 4-0, with midfielder James Milner likely to replace banned striker Danny Welbeck.
England lead Group H but will be overtaken by Ukraine if they lose.
Hodgson said: "Frank will play so that's quite a first. I've been very lucky to have three players who have reached [100 caps in the same side] and all things being equal Frank will start and get his 100th cap.
"Basically, there will only be one change in the team, that will be the person who replaces Welbeck. I will leave it to you to make your assumptions."
Manchester City midfielder Milner gained a glowing report from Hodgson in the aftermath of the victory over Moldova on Friday.
Hodgson's declaration means right-back Kyle Walker will continue in the side despite pictures being published of the 23-year-old Tottenham player inhaling nitrous oxide.
The England manager said: "I am happy, he has made his apologies and admitted a mistake. It was a long time ago, he'd forgotten it. It would have been much worse had it happened this weekend."
Lampard made his England debut in October 1999 under previous boss Kevin Keegan in a 2-1 friendly win over Belgium at Sunderland's Stadium of Light.

He has gone on to score 29 times for his country and has captained them five times.
Captain Gerrard, who along with Cole will equal Billy Wright's 105 caps, said: "It's going to be a fantastic occasion for Frank and I'm delighted for him.
"Me and Ashley did that recently and will move on to be level with the legend in Billy Wright, and we all want to remember it for the right result. I lost on my 100th cap but hopefully it will be different for Frank."
Despite being top of the group, England's place in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil is far from assured and they will face Ukraine without Welbeck and his fellow strikers Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge, both of whom are injured.
Hodgson's side are level on points with Montenegro but have a game in hand, while Ukraine are a point behind the leading two teams.
Only the group's top team will qualify automatically for next year's tournament, with the second-placed team facing a two-legged play-off.
