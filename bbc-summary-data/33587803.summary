Police said the body of the 21-year-old man - whose name has not been released - was discovered floating in the pool on Sunday morning.
Demi Moore, 52, and her three children are thought to have been away at the time of the incident.
Police are investigating. One officer told the LA Times he believed the victim to be a member of staff.
Police were called to the house in the city's Beverly Crest neighbourhood at 05:20 local time (12:20 GMT), the LA Times said.
They found paramedics treating the man by the poolside, but he was pronounced dead soon after.
The celebrity website TMZ quoted sources as saying a party had been taking place at the home, and it appeared the man may have fallen into the pool and not been able to swim.
Demi Moore bought the house together with her former husband Ashton Kutcher.
She was once the highest paid actress in Hollywood.
Before Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore was married to film star Bruce Willis.
