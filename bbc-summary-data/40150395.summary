Top seed Murray, 30, is trying to reach the last eight in Paris for the sixth time in the past seven years.
Khachanov, 21, is ranked 53rd and plays his first Grand Slam last-16 match after beating American John Isner.
"Mentally I feel pretty good just now," Briton Murray said after beating Juan Martin del Potro in round three.
Having struggled with fitness and form during much of the year, the Scot played superbly to see off the Argentine in straight sets on Saturday.
"After each round, I'm not thinking about winning," he said.
"I didn't come here with the mindset that I'm definitely going to go a long way.
"I was going to try and just get through the first round and hopefully feel better each day. That's been the case so far."
Khachanov poses a new challenge for the Wimbledon champion, and it will be the Russian's first match against any of the very top names in the sport.
He said: "That is what we are looking for, to play on the big arenas like here, centre court, and to play against world number one. I'm really looking forward for it."

Khachanov was born in Moscow but has trained in Barcelona for the past three years, during which time he has risen from outside the world's top 400 to become a fixture around the top 50.
The 6ft 6in right-hander has plenty of power, as he showed in seeing off big-serving Isner in the third round.
That followed his best win to date over 13th seed Tomas Berdych.
"I practised with him before he got on to the tour when he was like 350, and he was really good," said Murray.
"Big, strong guy. Generates a lot of power. He's also got a big serve."
Khachanov has hit 29 aces to Murray's 16 in the tournament, and has spent an hour less on court at just under the eight-hour mark.
Murray will head into the match with a very different mindset, however, following his impressive performance against Del Potro.
"I believe in myself, so even when things aren't going well, I believe I can turn it around," said Murray.
"The five-set format has definitely helped that, so I have maybe not been as anxious going into some of the matches, because I know there is some time to turn it around."
