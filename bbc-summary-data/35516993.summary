Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie says he is keen to learn from new signing Emmanuel Adebayor in a bid to add more goals to his game.

Bolasie's impressive start to the season was cut short when he picked up a calf injury in December, with Palace tailing off in his absence.
But the DR Congo international, with eight goals in 50 appearances in the Premier League, is hoping to learn lessons from Togo's Adebayor, citing the striker's 96 goals in England's top flight - as a remarkable feat.
"I am looking forward to learning from Adebayor, I believe he will guide myself and our other players into goal scoring positions to best help Palace score goals and win games, " Bolasie told BBC Sport.
"When you have a proven striker like him who knows the league very well and with a remarkable scoring record then you have a dangerous asset who can hurt your opponents and grab the goals.
"Players like him are the ones I've got to look at and if I can add more goals to my game then it will only improve me and the team" Bolasie added.
At 26, Bolasie knows he still has plenty to learn about the game and hopes any time he spends with Adebayor, on the pitch or off it, can be productive.
The Togo international, who turns 32 later this month, has scored 96 top flight goals during stints at Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham, and Bolasie cannot wait to link-up with his new team-mate on the pitch.
"He's lit up the dressing room and we remain optimistic that he will be a great presence on the pitch," Bolasie said.
"Ade will provide us with a variety of attacking styles due to his ability to hold up the ball as a target man whilst having the ability to link up with myself, Zaha, Puncheon, Cabaye and other attacking players."
Alan Pardew's team have dropped from fifth to 12th place after losing five league games on the spin before holding Swansea City to a 1-1 draw on Saturday - for their first league point in 2016.
Yet Bolasie, who is determined to add an end product to his scintillating individual displays on a more consistent basis, is looking forward to returning from injury and help re-energise the Eagles front line.
"We've been very unlucky with the list of injuries but I'm looking forward to getting back on the pitch again."
Crystal Palace next play Watford at home on Saturday.
