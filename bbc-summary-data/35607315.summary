[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charles and Camilla in royal bake off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were in competition to prove who was star baker during a visit to Betty's cookery school in Harrogate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The royal couple teased each other about their culinary skills as they made pastry and hand-iced Easter eggs.
The duchess appeared to come out on top with Prince Charles conceding: "I've got a lot to learn."
They also disagreed on their taste in tea as they sampled blends at Taylor's of Harrogate.
After slurping samples in the traditional way, Prince Charles said he preferred more body to his brew while the duchess opted for a light blend.
When Camilla was offered a chance to pipe the decoration onto some Easter eggs, Prince Charles insisted on joining in.
But he feigned irritation with his wife as she tried to show him how to do it, repeatedly complaining, "I know", as she intervened.
