The sitcom returned to screens last month after a 13-year break.
The opening episode of the latest series was watched by an average of 5.8 million viewers on the evening it was broadcast and received warm reviews from critics.
Screenwriter Mike Bullen tweeted: "Yay! We get to do this all again! Thanks to all our fans for making this possible."
Production on the new eight-part series will begin in Manchester in March.
Bullen said of the series he created: "We all said we only wanted to bring Cold Feet back if we could maintain the standard previously set.
"I've been blown away by the show's reception among viewers and critics alike. It has exceeded even my hopes.
"This recommission confirms that we didn't screw it up. I shall take a moment to bask in the warm glow... OK, done that. Now the hard graft resumes."
ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said: "It's with some trepidation that you return to much-loved shows, but Mike Bullen's contemporary take on the five friends and their lives has been a wonderful thing.
"We were obviously delighted that the audience agreed, and we're pleased to be able to confirm that Cold Feet will return again for a further series."
The channel said the programme had been their most successful drama launch so far this year.
In August, actress Fay Ripley told the BBC returning to the programme after more than a decade felt like "putting on an old jumper".
Referring to her character Jen and husband Pete, played by John Thomson, Ripley tweeted: "It's official. New #ColdFeet series in pipeline. Don't know about u but I recs @_mikebullen should send Pete @ Jen to the Maldives?"
