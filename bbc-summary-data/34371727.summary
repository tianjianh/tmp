[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales overcame a 10-point deficit to clinch a remarkable 28-25 win over England in World Cup Group A at Twickenham on Saturday.

It puts Wales top of the so-called pool of death on nine points - three ahead of their hosts who have six after receiving a bonus point in defeat.
Scott Williams, Hallam Amos and Liam Williams were all injured - five days before Wales face Fiji in Cardiff.
Fly-half Dan Biggar kicked 23 points - including the winning penalty from the halfway line and the conversion to scrum-half Gareth Davies' second-half try.
Wales greats Martyn Williams and Jonathan Davies give their verdicts:
"It's an incredible result, I just cannot believe it.
"When the injuries happened Wales were behind and I thought that was it.
"But momentum is massive in sport and when they had the momentum they kept it and they scored that wonderful try.
"Their backs were against the wall - it was incredible. They can be so proud of the performance.
"But we have to back it up on Thursday [against Fiji] otherwise this win is worthless.
"Fiji is a huge banana skin. They were strong in the scrum against England, they'll throw the ball about and our injuries are a major worry.
"They'll have to keep it tight, have a good kicking game, good carrying in the centre, but when it's on go wide and hopefully come out on top."
"We've seen that type of performance from this team time and time again over the past three or four years.
"They hang on in there and sometimes when the chips are really down, you've got nothing to lose and you just go out and play. The shackles are off.
"We still had world-class players out there and they found the energy from somewhere.
"England's backline were all at sea in defence and to pull that off is just incredible.
"To be 25-18 down and lose three of your backs I thought it was game over - they've got no chance of coming back.
"But they did, they kept on in there and what an unbelievable win.
"Looking ahead to Fiji it will be difficult, but we're back in the Millennium Stadium.
"I don't think they [Wales] should train at all, get as many as possible fit.
"Win against Fiji and then fingers crossed and give it your best shot against Australia."
Wales face Australia at Twickenham on Saturday, 10 October.
