[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old, who played in the Premier League in the 2010-11 season while at Blackpool, joins the League Two club after impressing on trial.
Boss Danny Cowley told the club website: "Technically and tactically you can see he's played in the Premier League and will be a good role model.
"He's one of those that makes everyone around him 5% better."
Eardley, who won the last of his 16 Wales caps in 2011, left League One side Northampton Town at the end of last season.
