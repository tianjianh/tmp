A passenger train has derailed near New York, injuring dozens of people, US officials say.

The incident occurred at New Hyde Park in Nassau County. The injuries are not said to be life-threatening.
The 12-carriage Long Island Rail Road train carrying some 600 passengers derailed at about 21:00 local time on Saturday (01:00 GMT Sunday).
Reports say it hit a work train about 20 miles (32km) east of New York's Manhattan borough.
Twenty-nine people were taken to hospital with injuries such as broken bones and concussion, officials said, with scores more treated at the scene for more minor injuries.
"Thankfully, early reports indicate that injuries are minimal," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
Passengers told local media they saw sparks at the windows after the train began shaking before striking something and coming to a halt.
The rail line - one of the busiest in the New York area - was closed after the crash.
Last month, a woman was killed and 108 other people were injured after a commuter train crashed into a railway station in New Jersey.
