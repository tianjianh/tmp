Winstone, who will play the EastEnders and Carry On actress in her 20s, said: "I... am so excited to step into her national treasure shoes!"
The biopic will also feature two child actors as the younger Dame Barbara.
After portraying Windsor in the 1998 stage play Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick and in TV's Cor Blimey!, Spiro reprises the role of Babs in her 50s.
Spiro said: "It's absolutely thrilling to be playing Barbara again. Tony Jordan has written a beautiful celebration of her life, but it's not your usual biopic, lots of surprises. She is so adored, so I hope we get it right and that Barbara herself loves it."
Babs follows the East End star over a 50-year period from 1943 to 1993, covering her lonely childhood and World War Two evacuation, her complicated relationship with her father, her marriages and her successful career.
Dame Barbara, who will be making a cameo in the drama, added: "I am truly thrilled to know that the BBC have secured two such talented and established actresses to portray me in their new biopic of my life. Sam Spiro has already proved herself playing me on stage and TV to great acclaim, as well as, having her own incredible career.
"Sam will now be playing me at a later time in my life which will be a new challenge for her and one she will undoubtedly achieve. And then to be lucky enough to have one of today's current dynamic actresses playing the younger me fills me with such excitement, especially knowing that it is Jaime Winstone. Boy, am I a lucky lady!"
The one-off 90-minute drama will be broadcast sometime next year.
