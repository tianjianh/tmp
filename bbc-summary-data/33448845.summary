[SN]TITLE[SN]
Budapest to bid for 2024 Olympics & Paralympic Games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Budapest has announced its intention to bid to host the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hungarian capital joins Rome, Boston, Hamburg and Paris as cities expected to submit bids to host the Games.
Hungary is the only one of the 10 most successful medal-winning countries at the Summer Olympics never to have hosted the event.
The deadline for cities to apply to host the Games is 15 September.
The IOC will then choose, in April or May 2016, which cities are eligible for the final vote, set to take place on 15 September 2017.
Budapest will also host the 2017 World Aquatics Championships after Guadalajara in Mexico pulled out, citing financial problems.
