[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has gone on trial in northern France accused of killing eight of her newborn babies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominique Cottrez confessed in 2010 to suffocating her children after giving birth secretly at home in Villers-au-Tertre near Lille.
The jury must decide if she is guilty of multiple infanticide or if her troubled mental state is reason to acquit.
The trial in Douai is expected to last a week.
Mrs Cottrez, 51, was in tears as she took her place in the courtroom.
The former nursing assistant has previously said she had a long incestuous relationship with her father and that she feared each baby might be his.
However, she did not talk about the relationship as she gave testimony on the opening day of her trial.
Mrs Cottrez, who is obese, said that from a young age she had battled with her weight and was mocked by other children at school.
She said she had tried several times to lose weight but failed.
One of the judges asked why she had not sought professional help, to which she replied: "I didn't know how to ask."
Mrs Cottrez apparently managed to conceal her pregnancies from everyone, including her doctor and her husband, because of her obesity.
She suffocated the eight babies, born between 1989 and 2006, and then secreted their bodies in the garden of her parents' home and in her own home nearby in Villers-au-Tertre.
"She was held prisoner by incest. She was convinced she was going to have monsters and that these monsters had no identity, no reality," said one of her lawyers, Frank Berton.
Correspondents say the trial is expected to delve into whether Mrs Cottrez was fully conscious of her crimes and may also reveal what suspicions, if any, her family had.
She has previously said that if someone had noticed, that might have broken the spiral of killing and led her to seek help.
