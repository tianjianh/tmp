Ferrari produced its first car, the 125 S, in 1947. The symbol of the firm, a prancing horse - "Cavallino Rampante" - was adopted by Ferrari after being used by an Italian World War 1 pilot, Francesco Baracca, who had it painted on the fuselage of his aircraft.
"Ferrari red" was the colour assigned by the International Automobile Federation to all Italian Grand Prix cars early in the 20th Century.
In 1969, Mr Ferrari sold the Fiat Group a 50% stake in the company, which was increased to a 90% stake in 1988.
