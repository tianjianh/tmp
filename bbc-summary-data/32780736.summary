Photographer Doug Chalk came across the crack, 60cm (2ft) wide and 45m (50yds) long, east of West Bay on Friday.
Mr Chalk said it looked "pretty awful" and predicted part of the cliff would fall on to the beach below.
Jurassic Coast earth science manager Richard Edmonds, who has examined the crack, said it was unlikely to be a fresh break, but could be related to heavy winter rainfall in 2012-13.
"It's clearly going to fall off - I just can't tell you when," he said.
"It's quite concerning but it's part of the nature of this coastline."
Mr Chalk said he posted the picture, taken with a zoom lens, on social media to warn visitors ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend and had been "astounded" by how widely it had been shared.
"It's going to be a major fall when it goes," he said.
Mr Edmonds said the crack was at the top of the vertical cliff, but there was nothing apparent to anyone looking up from the beach below.
He urged visitors to pay attention to warning signs along the Jurassic Coast.
