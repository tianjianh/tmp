Glasgow City Council's proposals for Byres Road include improvements for pedestrians, safe cycle routes and spaces for community events.
Architects Benton Scott-Simmons have been appointed to prepare designs, which also aim to improve connections to the University of Glasgow's campus.
Construction work is expected to begin in late 2018.
Funding for the improvements are to come from the £1.13bn Glasgow City Region City Deal.
The project will aim to complement Glasgow University proposals to expand its campus onto the site of the former Western Infirmary.
The university said its campus expansion had the potential to create 2,500 new jobs and contribute an additional £130m to the economy each year.
The council met on Monday to discuss the findings of the Byres Road public consultation, which included:
Council leader Frank McAveety said: "Byres Road is a jewel in the crown of Glasgow's economic and social life, attracting visitors from Glasgow and beyond to its attractions during the day and at night.
"This consultation process will help to ensure that it remains in this position by informing how best to shape the Byres Road that everyone with an interest in the area wants, and I would urge all stakeholders to participate."
The next stage of consultation involves a series of public events, with the first at Hillhead Library on 23 February.
