A driver has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a girl, 3, in an eight-vehicle crash in which her pregnant mother suffered a miscarriage.

Thomas Hunter, 59, of Mansfield Road, Mansfield, caused the crash on the A34 at Hinksey Hill, Oxford, on 25 August.
Isla Wiggin, of Fleet, Hampshire, died two days later. Her mother Collette's unborn son also died in the crash.
At Oxford Crown Court, Hunter admitted causing death by dangerous driving and serious injury by dangerous driving.
Collette Wiggin also suffered a broken neck in the crash, involving seven cars, that happened when Hunter drove his Volvo lorry into the back of a stationary queue of traffic.
It forced the closure of the northbound carriageway of the road for almost 10 hours.
Michael Roques, prosecuting, said there must have been a "gross avoidable distraction" for Hunter to have missed the clear queue of traffic.
Appearing before Judge Zoe Smith, the defendant was disqualified from driving before being bailed ahead of a sentencing hearing scheduled for 17 July.
Following the crash Isla's family said she was "as perfect a daughter as you could ever wish for".
"Beautiful and witty, yet cheeky and mischievous, she was a character that you couldn't help but love with all your heart," the statement continued.
"Her loving and caring nature would have made her an amazing big sister and she was so excited at the prospect.
"We were extremely proud to find out that we were going to have a son, who would have completed our family.
"He had big hands and strong arms and no doubt would've grown into a strapping young man who would have loved and protected Isla."
