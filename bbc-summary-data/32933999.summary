[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jailed armed robber was a regular at Kirkcaldy petrol station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An armed robber who held up a petrol station in Fife was caught because he was a regular customer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Geddes, 30, was armed with a knife when he stole cash from the BP garage in Kirkcaldy in February.
Before fleeing, Geddes told shop manager Ayaz Mahmood: "If you call police, I will come back and hurt you."
But Mr Mahmood recognised him and he was later arrested. Geddes pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow and was jailed for four and a half years.
The court heard debt-ridden Geddes, who lived half a mile from the petrol station, initially denied being the robber.
But he later told police: "I would be better off in jail anyway with the amount I owe."
Jailing Geddes for the assault and robbery, judge Lord Bannatyne said people working in shops "deserved protection" from criminals like him.
