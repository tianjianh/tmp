[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Acourt, 39, from Bexley, is wanted by officers for drugs offences.
A Met Police spokesperson confirmed Mr Acourt was wanted "in connection with an investigation, namely, conspiracy to supply drugs".
It is alleged that Mr Acourt is part of a gang, with links to London and the North East, accused of supplying large amounts of cannabis worth millions.
Mr Acourt has always denied involvement in the killing of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in 1993, in Eltham, south-east London.
In 2012 Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of Stephen's murder and given life sentences.
