A 20-year-old games designer has said it's "an insanely huge privilege" to be named a Bafta Breakthrough Brit.

William Pugh is the youngest of four people named from the gaming industry, with the others being 38, 29 and 39.
Now in its second year, Breakthrough Brits selects on and off-screen talent across games, film and TV to take part in a year-long mentoring programme.
The jury, including IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade and Broadchurch's Olivia Colman, selected a final list of 17 names.
The list is made up of two writers, four directors/producers, four game developers/designers, one composer, a presenter, two actresses and an actor.
Applicants had to be UK nationals and within their first year of starting their performing arts career to be legible for the award.
William, from West Yorkshire, already has three Bafta nominations to his name.
Earlier this year The Stanley Parable, a game which William co-created, was Bafta-nominated for Debut Game, Game Innovation and Story.
He said: "It's a very humbling and overwhelming experience to have this support behind me while I'm still in a formative space creatively.
"I suppose to simplify it all; with Bafta's support I'll be able to make things smarter and meet people faster!"
He added: "I've had the privilege and scariness of not going to university - [making] The Stanley Parable was my university - so I'm still finding my path."
Television presenter Ashley Kendall, 19, who is deaf, was the only name on the list younger than William.
She said it was "a huge privilege" to be officially recognised by the mainstream industry.
Ashley added: "It means I can show disabled people everywhere that they too can achieve their professional dreams."
Actress Stacy Martin and actor Callum Turner, both 24, complete the four Breakthrough Brits under the age of 25.
