[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 2-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge took their League Two play-off challenge to the final day of the season with victory over Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Scott Wharton gave the U's the lead against the run of play 10 minutes before half-time, glancing Harrison Dunk's corner across Glenn Morris and into the net.
Cambridge had previously been saved by the post when Andre Blackman's effort from distance bounced back off the inside of Will Norris' upright, before Norris produced a superb stop to keep out Jimmy Smith's effort from the edge of the box.
After the interval, Leon Legge nearly doubled the lead with another header from a corner, only for substitute keeper Yusuf Mersin to turn his effort over the bar.
With a minute to play, United sub Gerry McDonagh ran through on goal and was brought down by Josh Payne, who was sent off, with Luke Berry sealing the win from the subsequent penalty.
Shaun Derry's side must win at Wycombe next weekend to have any chance of making the top seven, while hoping for favourable results elsewhere.
