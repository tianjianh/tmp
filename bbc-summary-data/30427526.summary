BAE jobs fear in Bristol research centre closure plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aerospace giant BAE Systems is to close a research facility in Bristol, affecting about 130 members of staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Advanced Technology Centre in Filton specialises in areas such as situational awareness systems and high-powered computer modelling.
The company said it was "disbanding" the centre to "embed the skills and capability in our business areas where it can be best utilised".
It is to consult with employees over potential redeployment or redundancies.
The company's other research facilities at Filton, specialising in maritime and combat vehicles, are unaffected by the closure.
Labour councillor Ian Boulton said it was important the local manufacturing economy was "resilient" to the changes to ensure the area remained a "world centre of excellence" for the aerospace industry.
Ian Waddell, from the Unite union, said it will be "pressing BAE" to ensure "vital skills and knowledge are not lost" and people are deployed to "secure jobs" elsewhere within company.
BAE Systems shut down Filton airfield in 2012.
