David Byrne murder: Irish police continue to question three men

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in the Republic of Ireland are continuing to question three men arrested in connection with the murder of a man at a boxing weigh-in in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Byrne was shot at the Regency Hotel on 5 February.
The men, including a father and son in their 50s and 30s, were arrested by police on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Another man, Patrick Hutch, 24, has been charged with the murder of Mr Byrne.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) believe at least six people were involved in the attack which left two others wounded.
Three days after David Byrne's murder, Eddie Hutch Sr, 59, was also shot dead in his north Dublin flat in what looked like a revenge attack.
Both killings have been linked to a gangland feud in the city.
