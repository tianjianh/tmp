The man was stopped by officers on the A92 between Dundee and Arbroath, near Hatton, at about 20:00 on Saturday.
The 23-year-old has been charged with dangerous driving and a report has been submitted to the procurator fiscal.
Insp Ray Cuthill said the driver had placed himself and other road users in danger.
He said: "There is no excuse for travelling on our roads in such a reckless and irresponsible manner.
"I am relieved that this incident did not result in a collision where the risk of death or serious injury to an innocent member of the public or to the driver themselves would have been significant'.
"Despite our repeated message, driving in this way is not a minor offence but serious and dangerous.
"It is disappointing that someone placed themselves and others in danger by travelling at a completely inappropriate speed."
