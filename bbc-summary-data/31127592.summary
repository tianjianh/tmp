[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A project to restore all World War One memorials in Powys has been boosted by a £350,000 grant  from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys County Council's War Memorials Project aims to maintain 276 memorials - including 13 listed buildings.
Communities will be given "toolkits" to allow them to take responsibility for, and maintain, their landmarks.
Jennifer Stewart, head of HLF in Wales, said: "We see this project as a way to uncover the forgotten past."
The toolkits include background information and resources about the World War One as well as guides on how to research your local history and basic guidance on looking after war memorials.
