The Belgian, who was taken off during Saturday's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace with concussion, has ligament damage.
Kompany, 30, has been assessed by Dr Ramon Cugat in Barcelona, as well as Manchester City's medical staff.
"Dr Cugat confirmed what the doctors here said. He will be four to six weeks out," said Guardiola.
Kompany, who has started two league matches this season, has already had calf, groin and thigh injuries in 2016.
His latest setback is his 35th separate injury since joining City from German club Hamburg in 2008.
