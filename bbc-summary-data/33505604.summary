Speaking at the start of the Reds' pre-season tour, Rodgers confirmed the move will go through subject to a medical.
"Contrary to what has been written, Raheem and I have always remained strong in our relationship. There is no issue there," said Rodgers.
Sterling rejected a £100,000-a-week contract offer to remain at Anfield.
And it was reported last week that his relationship with Rodgers had broken down over the protracted transfer negotiations.
Sterling's medical is likely to take place on Tuesday and the fee will include up to £5m in add-ons over the course of the deal.
Rodgers, who says he spoke to Sterling "at length" on Sunday, would not be drawn on any more new signings.

But when asked if the club could fill the void left by Sterling's sale, he highlighted the addition of Brazil forward Roberto Firmino, signed for £29m from German club Hoffenheim.
"Roberto Firmino is a top-class player," he said.
"He will come into the Premier League and it takes a bit of time to adapt. But he has all the traits we want from a player. He works very hard.
"Transfers is not really something I want to go into in a press conference. I spent a lot of last season talking about transfers and don't intend to this year.
"Any business done will be done behind the scenes at the club."
But Rodgers did add that he is pleased with his dealings so far, saying: "Our aim is to be stronger and more competitive next season."
