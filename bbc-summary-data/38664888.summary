The mound of soil, stone bricks and kerbs, discovered at about 07:45 GMT on Wednesday, has completely blocked Back Lane in Tibberton, Shropshire.
Telford and Wrekin Council says it appears to have been fly-tipped and it is now clearing up the mess. An emergency road closure is in place and police are on the scene.
The driver of the car was left shocked but uninjured.

Angela McClements, the council's cabinet member for transport, customer and neighbourhood services, said it was a "disgraceful environmental crime" as she asked people with information to get in touch.
"Whoever has done it has acted with a complete lack of responsibility, blocking a road and resulting in significant clear up costs for the council," she said.
Back Lane in Tibberton remains closed while the road is cleared. Diversions are in place.
