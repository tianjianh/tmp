Dundee International Book Prize 2017 opens for submissions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year's Dundee International Book Prize has opened for submissions from authors bidding to win its Â£5,000 prize and publishing deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The competition, which launched in 2000, is open to unpublished authors from the UK and overseas.
Last year's competition was won by American author Jessica Thummel.
The prize also offers a week of protected writing time in Dundee in addition to the contract and cash prize.
The competition's organisers said they were looking for a "spellbinding, unpublished" novel.
The book prize is a joint venture between the 'Dundee - One City, Many Discoveries' campaign and Literary Dundee, which is part of Dundee University.
Literary Dundee's Peggy Hughes said: "Our calendar year gets started in earnest when submissions open for the Dundee International Book Prize.
Reading new, unpublished fiction by authors from all over the world is a privilege and I can't wait to see what people send to us this year."
The closing date for entries is 13 March and the winner will be announced during the Dundee Literary Festival in October.
