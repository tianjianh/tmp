Crichlow, who can also play as a forward, has yet to make his first-team debut for the R's.
The 18-year-old is in the third year of a scholarship deal at Loftus Road, and is out of contract in the summer.
"He is a quick, explosive player who likes to get at his man and deliver crosses," player-manager Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
