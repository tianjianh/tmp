'Unpleasant smell' warning in Barry over gas works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A warning about an "unpleasant smell" that could be similar to rotten cabbages or eggs has been issued to people in the Vale of Glamorgan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Monday, a tank containing mercaptan, which has been described as a pungent chemical, will be decommissioned at Zeon Chemicals in Barry.
The local authority said that while most smells will be destroyed, some may be noticeable to nearby residents.
These will not be harmful and could also be mistaken for a gas leak.
