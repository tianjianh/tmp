The hosts were well beaten over the series, with Australia winning 58-52 in Liverpool and 60-44 in Friday's first game in London.
England went in level after the first quarter on Sunday, but Tracey Neville's side could not contain the world and Commonwealth champions.
Roses captain Sara Bayman was sent off late on in a physical contest.
Neville, whose side are ranked third in the world, told Sky Sports her team have "improved so much", adding "it's so frustrating that they can't reward themselves".
"The aim of this series was to expose players and see where they are at, and I think everyone did what they could," she added.
"It's really good experience for me as a coach. It's hard to step away from the winning mentality to look at the long-term aim.
"I now have to look at how I keep the energy up when they go back to their respective clubs."
The England players will now prepare for the domestic Superleague season, which starts on Saturday and runs for four months.
