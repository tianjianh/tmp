Kevin Spacey has quashed rumours that he could feature as a villain in the next James Bond film, due for release in 2015.

"I don't know why people keep writing about this," said Spacey.
"I've been offered no role, I've never read a script, no, I am not doing the next James Bond movie."
Director Sam Mendes is returning to take charge of the 24th Bond film, following the enormous success of 2012's Skyfall.
"I don't know who started the rumour but stop it," Spacey told BBC News.
Skyfall became the highest grossing film of all time at the UK box office, and took more than $1bn globally.
Spacey worked with British director Mendes on the 1999 Oscar-winning film American Beauty and the pair reunited for the Bridge Project's 2011 staging of Shakespeare's Richard III.
"Obviously if he (Mendes) wanted me he would've offered me the role," Spacey continued.
"I don't even know if there is a role frankly."
Spacey's recent Shakespearean role, under the direction of Mendes, can currently be seen in the documentary Now: In the Wings on a World Stage.
The film tracks the cast of players of Richard III starting in London, taking in Doha, Singapore, Sydney, Naples and moving to other cities around the world before ending in New York.
The decision to make a cinematic documentary rather than film the stage play was a simple one, according to Spacey - who is currently on stage in the one-man show Clarence Darrow, which marks the end of his 10-year tenure as artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre.
"Well, it's not that we didn't want to film the play," he explained.
"We just couldn't raise the money. That's the honest answer to that."
The political drama House of Cards is also returning for a third series on Netflix, with Spacey in the lead role of Frank Underwood.
He has admitted to having "no idea" how long that series will continue but added he is "enjoying it very much".
"It seems that audiences are as well, so you know, I see no reason why it can't go on for a while."
Now: In the Wings on a World Stage is in cinemas from 9 June and available to download from 10 June via nowthefilm.com
