[SN]TITLE[SN]
Writing, drawing, 240-year-old robots go on display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
These may not look like your typical robots but these figures, which are more than two hundred years old, were programmed to carry out complex tasks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clockwork figures known as automata were made between 1768 and 1774 and still work today.
They can write, draw pictures and even play music.
They were made from parts used in watches at the time by Swiss watchmaker Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz and his family.
Originally they were created to show off the skill of the watchmakers.
They are made to be very lifelike so they appear to breathe, their eyes look at what they're doing and the woman robot moves in time to music she is playing.
Now they are on display at the Museum of Art History in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland.
