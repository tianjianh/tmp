Alex Goodwin, from Leicestershire, has a bone cancer only found in children and will undergo treatment he could not have on the NHS.
More than £50,000 was donated via Just Giving with the rest from a benefactor who wanted to remain unknown.
Alex is due to fly to the US with his family next week.

The family wanted to raise the money for proton beam therapy - a different type of radiotherapy - to help treat his condition, Ewing Sarcoma.
The Just Giving Page will be closed following the benefactor's donation.
The family, a lawyer and an accountancy firm is helping oversee the management of the money to ensure transparency, the family said.
Alex's treatment in the US includes the resection of his right femur, hip replacement surgery and replacing his femur with a prosthesis that can be lengthened as he grows.
He will also have appropriate radiotherapy if required.
"None of this would have been possible had it not been for the generosity and support of each and everyone one of you," his family said.
Emergency services staff recently helped make a music video to help raise funds.
Alex's father, a police officer with the Warwickshire force, asked colleagues to be part of the video for Horizon on My Mind, which he wrote and recorded.
