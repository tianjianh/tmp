The 69-year-old man, who has not been identified, died at Lincoln County Hospital on Monday.
The cause of his death is being determined at a post-mortem examination.
On Friday, the NHS announced it was closing Long Leys Court temporarily due to "serious incidents".
Lincolnshire Police said it was investigating the patient's death and would also look "very closely" at all other incidents at Long Leys Court.
"We are currently working very closely with the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (LPFT) and the Lincolnshire Adults Safeguarding Board around all of the incidents at Long Leys Court," a police statement said.
An LPFT spokesman said: "The patient was not related to current police investigations. However, as necessary in such unfortunate circumstances, we must now await the outcome of any investigations surrounding their illness and death."
The health watchdog the Care Quality Commission said it is aware of the situation.
A spokesman said: "We are liaising with Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Lincolnshire County Council with regard to the service and continue to monitor the situation."
The 16-bed facility, located in Lincoln, is for adults with learning disabilities and other complex needs, including mental illness.
Four patients remain at Long Leys Court while the trust tries to find them alternative placements, a trust spokesman said.
The trust said earlier that is was closing the facility because "despite intensive action... [we] do not feel that the unit can currently provide sufficiently high quality care for patients."
