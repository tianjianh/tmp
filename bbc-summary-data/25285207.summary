Karim Benzema had a penalty saved but Mathieu Valbuena added a third for the 1998 World Cup winners.
Goals by Benzema and Moussa Sissoko made it 5-0 before Blerim Dzemaili and Granit Xhaka reduced the arrears.
France's dominance at Arena Fonte Nova was every bit as emphatic as the scoreline suggests.
Les Bleus, seeking to reach a third final in five World Cups, now have six points, with a match against Ecuador on 25 June to come.
Having self-destructed in South Africa four years ago, the French have scored eight goals in their first two games in Brazil.
The Swiss were not helped by the ninth-minute loss of defender Steve Von Bergen to injury, but Ottmar Hitzfeld's men, who had beaten Ecuador 2-1 in their first game, were no match for France.
Giroud's goal, the 100th France have scored in World Cup finals, set his team on their way, the Arsenal forward leaping high above the Swiss defence to direct an unstoppable header into the net.
They doubled that lead 66 seconds later when Matuidi fired home after Velon Behrami conceded possession carelessly soon after the restart.
This was the third 2014 World Cup group game staged in Salvador, and already the Arena Fonte Nova has seen 17 goals. It was the scene of Spain's 5-1 humiliation by Netherlands on 13 June, while Germany beat Portugal 4-0 at the same ground three days later.
It looked all over when referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed to the spot after Benzema was brought down by Johan Djourou, but goalkeeper Diego Benaglio kept out the penalty and Yohan Cabaye smashed the rebound against the woodwork.
Switzerland's reprieve was brief, though, with Valbuena converting Giroud's cross to make it 3-0 five minutes before the interval.
Benzema did manage to score his third of the tournament with a clinical finish after good work by substitute Paul Pogba midway through the second half.
Sissoko then made it 5-0 in the 73rd minute after more shambolic defending, before the Swiss scored two late consolation goals.
First Dzemaili beat Hugo Lloris from 40 yards with a low free-kick, before Xhaka beat the French offside trap before finding the net.
Switzerland manager Ottmar Hitzfeld:
"It was truly a very bleak day for us. There will be a lot of criticism, quite appropriately, but the team will come together.
"France are one of the teams that certainly can go very far in this tournament. They were much superior to England or Italy."
France manager Didier Deschamps:
"I don't want to put a brake on the enthusiasm. It's a huge satisfaction within the team, but we're not going to get carried away. We shouldn't think we're prettier than we are.
"Karim Benzema is confirming that he's in very, very good form. His happiness is a joy to behold, he's one of the best players in the world and having such an efficient player is very important in a competition like this.''
