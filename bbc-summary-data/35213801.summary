A man has escaped injury in a petrol bomb attack on a house in Banbridge, County Down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Minor scorch damage was caused to the rear bathroom window of the property in Golf Terrace at about 19:30 GMT on Saturday.
The male occupant had only recently moved into the house.
The police have said they are still working to establish a motive and have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd said it was a worrying development following a series of attacks in Banbridge.
"There is growing concern in the community that there is a level of coordination behind these attacks," he said.
"Those behind them don't care that they seriously injure or kill the intended target or someone in the vicinity."
