Bempton Cliffs at Flamborough Head has the UK's largest mainland seabird colony, according to the RSPB.
It said the new facilities would bring more visitors and improve their access to the thousands of nesting birds.
Keith Clarkson, site manager, said: "It's absolutely fantastic. It's been 10 years in the making."
The centre, which attracts about 76,000 people a year, has been closed since September for redevelopment.
It now has a bigger reception, a sheltered place for education and space for community groups and family activities.
The footpaths have been made more accessible and extra spaces provided in the car park.
Its reopening coincides with the BBC's Springwatch programme, which is based at the nature reserve for its Easter show.
Springwatch will be on BBC Two at 21:00 BST.
