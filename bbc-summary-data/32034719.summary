The 13-year-old girl was attacked at about 15:20 GMT in Lisle Lane, Ely on 18 December. Police were only made aware of the incident on 23 February.
A man, from Sutton, has been arrested on suspicion of rape and released on conditional bail.
The attack may be linked to another incident where a woman was followed by a man, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The second incident happened in The Gallery, Ely, when a 17-year-old girl reported being followed by a man at about 20:15 GMT on 16 March.
She was chased by the man but escaped when he stopped to pick up his hat.
On both occasions, the assailant was described as wearing a long black coat.
Insp Marcia Nichols said: "Given the close proximity of where these incidents took place and the similarity in the descriptions given by the girls of the offenders, we are not ruling out that these incidents could be linked.
"High visibility foot patrols have been put in place in the city centre, however I would urge members of the public to be cautious when alone in the area."
The arrested man was released on bail until 27 April on condition he does not to return to Ely.
