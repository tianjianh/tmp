Northern Ireland's transport minister has announced that work could begin on part of the A5 between Newbuildings to Strabane in 2017.

Michelle McIlveen said there will be a new public consultation on the £150m project which will see part of the road upgraded to a dual carriageway.
The planned upgrade of the A5 between Ballygawley and the Irish border will not go ahead at this stage.
The new A5 would lessen journey times by 20 minutes.
Martin McGuinness issued an ultimatum in October saying he would not agree a programme for government after the assembly election if work on the A5 did not commence in 2016.
Almost £500m has been allocated to upgrade the Londonderry to Belfast and Londonderry to Dublin roads.
The Irish government said in November, after the Fresh Start deal, that it was willing to provide £75m towards modernising the A5.
Transport Minister Michelle McIlveen said on Thursday: "Today's announcement will begin a consultation process which, subject to successful completion of statutory procedures, will see construction start next year.
"This important project will not only have positive benefits for the local economy and construction industry but will also significantly improve safety and journey times for all road users."
Once the consultation period has concluded "a decision will be made on the need for a public inquiry on the scheme," said Ms McIlveen.
"I am currently seeking accelerated passage for the land acquisition and compensation bill. This would bring compensation levels for landowners in Northern Ireland affected by compulsory land purchase on a par with England and Wales."
