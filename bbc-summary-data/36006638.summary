The Magpies are six points from safety with six games remaining after losing 3-1 at Southampton on Saturday.
"We have four more games at home and we will need everyone's support there," Benitez told BBC Sport.
"It important that everybody continues to believe. If we can control these things then things will change. It's not the time to criticise."
Newcastle have lost six of the last seven games to leave their six-season stay in the Premier League in peril.
"The anxiety is killing us sometimes," Benitez added.
"At home we have the fans behind us and we need them. We have six games to play and each one is important."
They were 3-0 behind at Southampton before Andros Townsend scored.
Their remaining games include home matches against Manchester City and title-chasing Tottenham, while Newcastle also face an away game at Benitez's former club Liverpool.
