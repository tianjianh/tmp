A woman who lost control of her car on a motorway causing a fatal eight-car pile-up has been found guilty of causing a man's death.

Christy George, 38, of Nottingham, hit a lorry which crashed into the central reservation between junctions 21a and 22 of the M1 in Leicestershire.
Leicester Crown Court heard she deleted a record of phone calls made during her journey in November 2014.
George, a nurse, will be sentenced on 15 July.
The court has heard George's Skoda hit a lorry which crashed through to the northbound carriageway, spilling its load of beer barrels and hitting a BMW travelling in the opposite direction.
The collision closed the road for 18 hours, a jury was told.
The BMW driver, Murray Simpson, from London, died in the crash, while another driver - Liese Bowers-Straw - broke her neck in two places and suffered brain and head injuries.
George, who was driving to a Coventry hospital to work a night shift, had denied causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice, but was found guilty of all charges after a trial.
Leicestershire Police said during her journey, George made phone calls to a friend and her husband.
The court heard the calls George made involved unlocking and pressing icons on her iPhone to connect the calls, but she said she spoke and listened through a hands-free speaker system.
She said the use of her phone was a "one-off incident" which does not represent her usual driving habits.
"We're pleased that the jury has found Christy George guilty and we hope it acts as a deterrent to other road users," Det Con Pete Davies said.
"Murray Simpson's partner and family have lost a loved one and while no amount of punishment will help them move on...we hope the fact that someone has been prosecuted for their actions will show them that justice has been done."
