Finch captains his country's Twenty20 side, but will be available to play in all competitions for Surrey.
The 29-year-old, who has previously played for Yorkshire, is expected to make his debut in the Championship game against Warwickshire on 2 July.
Sangakkara, 38, could be absent for up to six weeks from the end of June.
"Securing a player of Aaron's quality for such a busy period of red and white ball cricket is excellent news for the club," Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart said.
"I'm confident we will see his qualities in all formats of the game."
Finch has played 57 one-day internationals and 24 Twenty20 matches for Australia since making his international debut in January 2011.
