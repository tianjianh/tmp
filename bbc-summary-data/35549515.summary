Investigation over First Minister's Questions 'liar' jibe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Holyrood's presiding officer is investigating after Nicola Sturgeon was called a "liar" during a heated session of First Minister's Questions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Scottish Labour backbencher was heard using "unparliamentary language" during the weekly question session.
Tricia Marwick said she would review the official report and would "take action" if the member responsible did not admit it and withdraw the remark.
Nicola Sturgeon said the "insults" showed how "desperate" Labour were.
The remark was made as Labour leader Kezia Dugdale questioned Ms Sturgeon about council cuts she said were imposed by the government's tax policy.
During a heated exchange, punctuated by Ms Marwick telling members to "stop heckling the first minister", the word "liar" was called out from the back benches, prompting an angry response from SNP members.
Calling for a "grown up debate", Ms Sturgeon said: "We know how desperate Labour are by the volume of the insults they have to sling across the chamber."
Following the exchange, Ms Marwick said she "didn't quite hear" the comment in question, but warned members against use of "clearly unparliamentary" language.
She said: "I will review the official report afterwards. If the member who used that word wished to admit it and withdraw it now that would be helpful, but if not I will take action this afternoon."
