She sails to the four corners of the globe. Yet, she calls Belfast her "home".
The floating hospital docked in Belfast on Saturday, a familiar port. She was originally built as a container ship in Italy before being  converted by Harland & Wolff in the 1980s.
She was accepted into the Royal Fleet Auxiliary service in 1988.
She left the County Antrim harbour and she has been a battlefield casualty receiving ship since then. She served in both Gulf Wars, the Falklands and, most recently, sailed to Sierra Leone to assist the Ebola effort.
The sheer size of the ship, standing 40m tall above water and 7m beneath, is described as "unique" by its captain, Karl Woodfield.
Speaking on BBC's Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, Captain Woodfield said: "We are designed to take the casualties off the battlefield, and we operate on the front line."
Repeatedly upgraded with state-of-the-art hospital facilities, there is an intensive care unit, an A&E  area and bunk-bed wards. Three casualties can undergo surgery in the same operating theatre and a fourth operation can take place in the dentist's room if required.
It may appear similar to a hospital you see on land, but features have been added to guard against rough seas.  Ward beds are chained to the floors and only the "walking wounded" are allocated a top bunk.
Alongside her legacy in war efforts and humanitarian contributions, her history and birthplace have a resonance.
Captain Woodfield said the crew was "very proud" to have Belfast as the ship's port of registry.
"As we go around the world, this generates a lot of enthusiasm and questions about why we have Belfast inscribed on the back of this ship," he said.
During its berth in Belfast at the weekend, the Ministry of Defence paid tribute to Harland & Wolff and the handiwork that "has stood the test of time and stormy seas".
RFA Argus departed from Belfast's shores on Tuesday morning.
