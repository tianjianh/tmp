It follows the death of a woman on Bridge Street, Guildford, on Saturday when a 4x4 vehicle mounted the pavement, hitting pedestrians.
Two other pedestrians and the Land Rover Defender driver were injured.
Raising the pavement, installing speed cameras and setting a 20mph limit are among the measures demanded.
The petition calls on Guildford Borough Council and Surrey County Council to "forget about the financial cost and think about the human cost".
Bridge Street is described as a main pedestrian thoroughfare between the university/train station and town centre.
The petition was started by Joe Hudson, who tweeted: "Bridge Street is dangerous. The pavement is far too narrow for a road with that much pedestrian traffic. Widen it @GuildfordBC!!"
The pedestrian who died was a woman in her 30s. Her next of kin has been informed but she has yet to be formally identified.
On Monday, the leader of Guildford Borough Council, Paul Spooner, said the accident was "tragic and saddening".
"Although we don't know if the road layout contributed, the Town Centre Masterplan includes options for improving transport and pedestrian movements around the station area and Bridge Street," he said.
