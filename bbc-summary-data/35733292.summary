Harrold grabbed the match-winner on 12 minutes with an instinctive finish into the bottom corner.
The hosts could have broken the deadlock early on but midfielder Jonathan Smith's 20-yard effort struck the outside of the post.
Luton missed further chances as Stephen O'Donnell had efforts blocked and saved, while Paul Benson hit the bar.
The Hatters drop to 13th in the table, six points off a play-off place, while Crawley stay in 16th.

Crawley manager Mark Yates told BBC Surrey: "I am really pleased with the group at the moment.
"I have been leaving players off the bench and I'm leaving some quality out of the team, and that's what we've needed all season.
"Once we scored it just makes you defend a yard or two deeper and we did, but they didn't cause us too many threats."
