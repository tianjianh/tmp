Rugby star Danny Cipriani fails to have drink-drive trial thrown out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attempt by England rugby star Danny Cipriani to have a drink-driving trial thrown out of court has been dismissed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old, whose Mercedes was involved in a crash with a taxi in London, was allegedly so drunk that his eyes were "glazed" and he was slurring.
A breath test allegedly found him to be twice the legal alcohol limit, but the players's lawyer had questioned whether the test was working properly.
A judge at Westminster Magistrates Court said the trial would proceed.
Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Mr Cipriani did have a case to answer, pointing out that Sgt Marc Pullen insisted the breath test device was "working correctly".
The Sale Sharks fly-half's car was involved in the collision in Imperial Road, South West London, at about 05:15 BST on 1 June last year.
The court heard he was found to have 67 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit in England and Wales is 35 micrograms.
The player's defence lawyer Philip Lucas suggested there was not "sufficient" evidence that the test, carried out in a police station, was calibrated properly.
However, prosecutor Katie Weiss, contested the application, insisting the court did have enough evidence to continue the case.
Mr Cipriani, who has 14 caps for England, has pleaded not guilty to drinking and driving.
He was bailed until a further hearing, which has been scheduled for 26 May.
