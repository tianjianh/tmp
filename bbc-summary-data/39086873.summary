[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McGinn came closest to scoring for Hibs, his 25-yard shot coming back off the post.
Grant Holt and his replacement Brian Graham headed off target for the hosts.
Morton's Kudus Oyenuga and Hibs' Darren McGregor were sent off in added time and managers Neil Lennon and Jim Duffy were sent to the stand.
Substitute Oyenuga was dismissed for serious foul play following his tackle on Jordan Forster and McGregor was red-carded for violent conduct.
Lennon's Hibs have six more league games to play while Morton move above Falkirk into second. Duffy's side and fourth-placed Dundee United each have a game in hand, the Tangerines currently a point behind Falkirk.
McGinn, recalled after returning from Scotland duty, sent a terrific left-foot effort on to the base of goalkeeper Derek Gaston's right-hand post and the midfielder was at the heart of the home side's best attacking moves.
Gaston clawed away McGregor's header and also blocked an effort by Jason Cummings while Holt sent a glancing header inches wide of the upright.
Morton were dangerous on the break and both Andy Murdoch and Jamie Lindsay warmed the palms of Hibs keeper Ofir Marciano.
In the second half, Hibs' top scorer Cummings was given an opportunity to show off his dead ball skills after being brought down just outside the box by Thomas O'Ware. On this occasion, though, his effort drifted well over.
Graham came on for Holt and the former Ross County forward almost broke the deadlock with a header that was narrowly wide.
Deep into stoppage time the game erupted when Ross Forbes' replacement Oyenuga clattered Forster right in front of the home dugout.
McGregor was quick to let Oyenuga know what he thought of the challenge.
A melee ensued with both managers involved and, after consulting with his assistant, referee Nick Walsh quickly showed red to Oyenuga and McGregor and then dismissed Lennon and Duffy.
It was a frantic end to what had been an otherwise calm and quiet affair as the sides had to settle for a point apiece.
