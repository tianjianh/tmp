Former Swansea City defender Sam Ricketts says ex-boss Brendan Rodgers should return as manager to the Liberty Stadium in the summer.

Head coach Francesco Guidolin has guided Swansea to Premier League safety after taking over in January.
But the Italian is unsure if he has a future at the club with his contract expiring at the end of the season.
Ricketts says Rodgers should replace him: "I think he's the man who can come in. He's got a point to prove."
The Northern Irishman, who led Swansea into the Premier League in 2011, is currently out of work and has been heavily linked with a return this summer, with defender Neil Taylor admitting Rodgers would be welcomed back.
Rodgers, 43, left the Welsh side for Liverpool in 2012, before being sacked by them in October 2015.
He has said he wants to return to management in the summer and previously admitted he held talks with Swans chairman Huw Jenkins about returning to the club as Garry Monk's successor.
Swansea have been without a permanent manager since a poor run of form led to Monk's departure in December 2015.
The team have hovered above the Premier League relegation zone for long periods of the campaign, but the 3-1 win against Liverpool on Sunday ensured a sixth season in the top flight.
Swansea are hoping for new investment with American businessmen Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan leading a consortium that is in talks to buy a 60% stake in the club.
Coventry City player Ricketts says while Rodgers would be a good choice to take over, Swansea must buck their historic trend and spend big sums in the transfer market if they are to push on next season.
"I think Rodgers still regards himself as a top manager, but he needs to prove that again," said Ricketts of the man who first took charge there in 2010.
"And I think that's probably what Swansea need.
"They need not only a manager, but players who have got something to prove, something to aim for and I think Brendan can hopefully not only keep Swansea where they are, but also lift them to the next level again."
Ricketts added: "It goes against their philosophy a bit, but they need to go and spend between £15-20m on a forward and then probably another £10m or so on two or three other players just to give the squad a lift as much as lift the quality as well."
