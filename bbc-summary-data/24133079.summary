Nearly 100,000 people have sight loss issues and the figure is expected to rise as the aging population grows.
The Welsh government said its eye care delivery plan was pioneering.
The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said it hoped it would ensure fewer people suffered with preventable problems in the future.
RNIB Cymru director Ceri Jackson said: "Sadly, we do hear of people who do lose their sight who are registered blind or partially sighted because they have not been seen in the time they when should be seen.
"What I hope this plan will do is place more emphasis and priority around joining up those services across primary and secondary care so we do make sure people don't lose their sight unnecessarily."
