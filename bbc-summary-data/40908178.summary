[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Richard Duffy opened the scoring for the Magpies on his 50th appearance for the club, heading home from Dan Jones' free-kick on 14 minutes.
The visitors promptly doubled their advantage in comical fashion, as Luke O'Nien's clearance hit Wycombe captain Adam El-Abd and cannoned past goalkeeper Scott Brown.
Kevin Nolan's side had earlier threatened through Shaun Brisley, whose far-post header was cleared off the line by Michael Harriman.
Gareth Ainsworth's side pulled themselves back into the game in sensational style, however, as half-time substitute Nick Freeman scored his first league goal for Wanderers with a powerful half-volley into the top corner four minutes after coming on.
Debutant Craig Mackail-Smith headed straight at Adam Collin from Harriman's cross, before Joe Jacobson sensationally curled home a free-kick from 25-yards to level the scores.
County, unbeaten at Adams Park since October 2007, retook the lead when Jonathan Forte headed home six yards out from another Jones free-kick for his first goal since 28 January.
And former Hartlepool man Alessandra sealed the victory when he fired home in the 90th minute after Forte's close-range effort rebounded off the post.
