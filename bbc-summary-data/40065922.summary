The ex-Manchester United trainee, 23, played in every game last season as he made 49 appearances in total.
"He is a player on the up, and after a tough few seasons I think we helped him find his confidence and his game," said player-manager Kevin Nicholson.
The club have also announced midfielders Aman Verma and Dan Sparkes have left after turning down new deals.
