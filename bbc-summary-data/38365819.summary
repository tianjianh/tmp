Heavy rain and winds are predicted to arrive across the west and north of the country from about 15:00.
There are likely to be gales and severe gales into the evening, with storm force winds possible in the Outer Hebrides.
The Met Office has issued a yellow "be aware" warning of high winds for northern and western parts of Scotland.
Gales are likely at times along the west coast and the Northern Isles, the Met Office has said.
The warning covers 6:00 on Wednesday to 18:00 on Thursday.
Further spells of unsettled and very windy weather could also arrive in Scotland later in the week.
BBC forecaster Carol Kirkwood said: "The wind is going to be a feature of the weather later on tomorrow [Tuesday] because it's going to continue to strengthen - in fact strengthening to the point of touching gales or severe gales across northern and western Scotland, parts of Northern Ireland as well.
"With exposure, we could have locally storm force winds across the Outer Hebrides."
The weather in the UK is being influenced by the jet stream over the Atlantic, which the forecaster said was "unusually strong" at the moment.
Sub-zero temperatures across Canada and northern parts of the United States are clashing with much warmer temperatures in the southern states.
This clash is causing a thermal gradient which is pumping energy into the jet stream, giving the UK wet and windy conditions.
Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has warned of possible disruption to its services this week and into weekend.
Operations director Drew Collier said: "Weather forecasts for the west of Scotland are predicting a stormy week for many especially as we near the weekend when people will be travelling for Christmas.
"We will review sailings on a case by case basis but would advise anyone planning to travel by ferry to take this into account when planning journeys in the next few days."
South Devon-based Magicseaweed.com produces swell charts which are used by surfers around the world.
Its chart for this week shows swell of up to 50ft in the North Atlantic during the forecasted high winds.
The organisation's Ben Freeston said the conditions were expected to create big waves for an international competition taking place in Portugal.
He said the winter had so far been good for surfers.
"We've seen a run of intense storms in the Atlantic producing large or giant swell and these look to continue for the Christmas period," he said.
"The first World Surf League big wave event will be held in huge surf in Portugal this week on the waves produced by one of these storms.
"For the Christmas weekend it still looks likely that we could see a deep low pressure system moving to the north of the UK bringing strong winds, rain and generally unsettled and stormy conditions."
