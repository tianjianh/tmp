Middlesbrough's England Under-20s midfielder Bryn Morris has left the Premier League club to join League One side Shrewsbury Town on a short-term deal for the rest of the season.

After previously making four loan moves away from Boro, Morris, 20, becomes Town manager Paul Hurst's fifth signing of the transfer window.
"We've managed to secure him on a permanent deal," said Hurst.
"It gives us competition in the middle of the park, which we've been lacking."
Morris follows the arrival of Hartlepool United defender Aristote Nsiala on a two-and-a-half-year deal, for an undisclosed fee, Notts County winger Alex Rodman on an 18-month deal and two loan strikers from Premier League clubs, Crystal Palace's Freddie Ladapo and West Bromwich Albion's Wales Under-19 striker Tyler Roberts.
Shrewsbury, who are expected to allow midfielder Ian Black out on loan, are 21st in the League One table.
