Taxi firm owner Nasser Rezaie, 63, ran down fellow cabbie and mechanic Allan Frampton, 60, with his Mercedes S Class in a cul-de-sac in Chelmsford on 9 May.
The city's crown court heard the killing was premeditated and the new couple had faced threats for months.
Mr Rezaie admits he was driving the car but denies murder.
He claims "loss of control" due to the emotional turmoil, which he argues makes him guilty of manslaughter.
The court heard Mr Rezaie had warned he would cut both their throats and decapitate them.
Jurors heard tracking devices fitted to a car belonging to Mr Rezaie's wife, Jane, sent location alerts to the defendant's mobile phone so he could follow her.
Peter Gair, prosecuting, said: "The defendant was not willing to accept the marriage was over, despite being told a number of times by family and friends."
Mrs Rezaie began a relationship with Mr Frampton, from Hatfield Peverel, who maintained some of the family firm's taxis, in 2012.
He died from multiple injuries after being hit several times by the car in Osea Way in May. The attack was caught on private CCTV cameras in the street.
Before the killing, Mr Rezaie wrote on Facebook he believed Mr Frampton was only interested in Mrs Rezaie's money.
In other posts he wrote "jail is free" and "I believe justice will be done".
A violent attack on Mrs Rezaie was recorded in a voicemail message, on another occasion, jurors were told.
Before the killing Mr Rezaie told her he had earlier considered running Mr Frampton over but did not as he was standing close to somebody else, the court heard.
In another voicemail, he told his wife: "Don't walk to close to him when you walk together."
The trial continues.
