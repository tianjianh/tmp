The bus was carrying at least 50 people, most of them members of Argentina's border police, when it came off the road and fell about 20m (65ft) into a riverbed.
Emergency workers are trying to free a number of trapped passengers.
They said that so far, six passengers had been rescued from the wreck.
The bus came off the road at about 02:00 local time (05:00 GMT) near the town of Rosario de la Frontera in Salta province, police officials said.
It was one of three police buses travelling on national highway 34.
A local police statement said there were indications that one of the bus's tyres had burst and caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle.
Speaking at a public event, President Mauricio Macri, expressed his condolences.
