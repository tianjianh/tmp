[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guardian Systems Ltd, which was based in the Springkerse Industrial Estate, had a turnover of Â£1.5m, but saw a fall in orders during the summer.
The company said this had led to "major cash flow problems and unsustainable losses".
An associate company, Guardian Soft Furnishings Ltd, has also been placed into liquidation.
Guardian Systems Ltd, which supplied the residential and commercial market, was founded in 1993.
Accountants Campbell Dallas said it would provide "every possible support" to employees affected by the closure.
Derek Forsyth, head of restructuring and insolvency, said: "It is unfortunate that a number of factors created significant problems that ultimately caused both businesses to be placed in liquidation."
