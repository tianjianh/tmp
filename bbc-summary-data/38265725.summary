Dozens of off-road motorcycles, quad bikes and scooters brought Kirkstall Road, a major route into Leeds, to a standstill.
Riders were also filmed driving on some of the city's busiest shopping streets in scenes likened to the Mad Max films.
West Yorkshire Police has released images of ten men believed to have been involved.
Six men, aged between 22 and 26, and a 29-year-old woman were held on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance after early morning raids across Leeds.
Four motorbikes were seized, with items of equipment also taken.
Videos posted online show bikers riding in convoy, with some pulling wheelies. Others can be seen riding on the pavement during the event, which was organised on social media.
The force said it wanted to identify ten males pictured on security cameras, with inquiries also identifying about 80 registration plates of vehicles involved in the ride.
Leeds City Council has gained an injunction at the County Court which bans anyone from "participating in anti-social driving of motor vehicles" in a group of two or more in a public place in Leeds.
The interim order, which grants power of arrest, also forbids people promoting or organising the anti-social driving of motor vehicles, officers said.
Ch Supt Paul Money, Leeds district commander, said: "The behaviour that was witnessed in the city that night put people's safety at risk, caused unnecessary fear to the public and created an image of lawlessness that we simply cannot allow to go unchecked.
"We hope today's operation and our continuing investigation will send out a very clear message to anyone who is considering arranging or taking part in any such event in the future."
