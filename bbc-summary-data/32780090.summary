Jim Clark: 'The man to beat' in motor racing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Jackie Stewart has recalled how Jim Clark was "the man to beat" when he started his own Formula One career 50 years ago.

He was in the Borders at the weekend at an event celebrating the Berwickshire farmer's achievements.
Sir Jackie said Clark had been a "very good friend" and would have been his second son's godfather but for the crash which claimed his life in 1968.
Fellow motor racer Allan McNish was also in Duns for the event.
They were helping to mark the 50th anniversary of the season in which Jim Clark became the only man to win both the F1 and Indy 500 titles in the same year.
It was the same season as Sir Jackie made his F1 debut.
"He was a very, very good friend," he said.
"We shared an apartment in London together - two fellow Scots - in 1965, my first year in Formula One.
"I was on the podium with Jimmy three times, I think, the Belgian, the French and the Dutch grand prix.
"We were, in those days, called Batman and Robin and there was no doubt who was Batman and who was Robin.
"It was a great period in my life."
Former Team Lotus chief mechanic Bob Dance said Clark was a gifted but down-to-earth individual.
"He was exceptionally talented, naturally talented," he explained.
"He was sympathetic to the car and just a high quality driver - quite calm and collected and easy to get on with.
"He just used to get on with the job."
More modern-day racer McNish said he thought it would be hard to repeat Clark's feats.
"Those times have definitely changed - the world of motorsport has definitely changed and that is probably what makes so many people here today remember him," he said.
"He was a Borders farmer that went on and dominated the world of motorsport.
"I think it would be very difficult for someone to be able to do it again - however, I don't think anything is impossible.
"You never know, there might be somebody here today that will just be inspired by it and want to take up carting and go on."
The event in the Borders was also designed to raise the profile of plans for a new Jim Clark Museum in Duns by 2018.
Sir Jackie was keen to back that project too.
"It would be a good thing for Scotland, a great thing for the Borders and fantastic for Duns," he said.
"We don't have that many great Scots but Jim Clark was a great Scot."
