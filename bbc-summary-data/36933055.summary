Leading Jari-Matti Latvala by 18.1 seconds overnight, Dungannon man Meeke steadily increased his advantage over the Finn in Saturday's eight stages.
Ireland's Craig Breen has remained in third spot and is now one minute and 45 seconds behind Meeke.
Meeke earned his second World Rally series win in Portugal in May.
The Northern Irishman, racing a reduced schedule for Citroen this year as the team concentrates on developing a new car for next season, described his Saturday performance as "exceptional".
"Yesterday was one of my best days in rally car and today has surpassed it," added the 37-year-old.
"With 41 seconds I can play it really safe and try and bring it home."
There are four more stages on Sunday, with Meeke aiming to secure his third win at a World Championship rally.
Tyrone native Meeke's first World Rally series win came in Argentina last year.
