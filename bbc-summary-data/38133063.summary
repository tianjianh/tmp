[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public has been warned about restricted access to a south of Scotland forest as efforts to tackle a killer tree disease continue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Felling operations are taking place at Mabie Forest near Dumfries from December until February.
The action will remove trees infected with Phytophthora ramorum as well as some unaffected by the disease.
The main entrance to the forest will be shut on weekdays in December but should be reopened by Christmas.
Visitors have been asked to follow diversion signs.
Public information notices, details of works and trail closures will also be regularly updated and posted on site and online.
Sallie Bailey, Forest Enterprise Scotland's district manager for Dumfries and the Borders, said: "Mabie is one of our most popular recreation sites in the region - with 7stanes mountain bike trails as well as walking trails.
"Regrettably, felling is unavoidable because it is one of the crucial steps we can take to try and minimise the progress of this disease, which has badly affected larch, particularly in parts of south-west Scotland.
"These works will change the look of the forest for a short time, but also present opportunities for future replanting."
Similar operations planned for Heathhall Forest are likely to begin in the New Year and be completed by the beginning of March.
