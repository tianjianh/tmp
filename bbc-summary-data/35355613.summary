[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport MP Paul Flynn called Labour leader by US TV

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An American television network gave a Welsh MP a promotion when it incorrectly captioned him as the leader of the Labour Party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newport West MP Paul Flynn, who has not replaced Jeremy Corbyn, was captioned 'Leader, U.K. Labor Party' by WNBC.
It happened during its coverage of the debate on whether Donald Trump should be banned from the UK.
The error was spotted by writer and journalist Rosa Prince who tweeted it with the comment "Wait, what?".
