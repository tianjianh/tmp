West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis believes their good start to the season will help attract new players to the club in January.

Albion are seventh in the Premier League after beating Watford 3-1 at the Hawthorns on Saturday.
They are also unbeaten in their last four league matches.
"It gives us a chance now to hopefully get a couple [of players] in the window," Pulis told BBC WM 95.6, when asked about Albion's impressive form.
"I think the Chinese [investors] understand that, the owners and [leader] Mr [Guochuan] Lai, and we are going to try and do that if we can."
Pulis, who signed a new contract until 2018 in October, has guided the Baggies to 13th and 14th-place finishes in the Premier League since arriving at the club in January 2015.
The 58-year-old insisted he would be looking for the right deals in January, not bringing in players for the sake of it.
"We will have to box clever and I have to say this - if they are not there, we don't buy," he told the club website.
"We have to try to get quality players and that is going to be difficult and will be more pressure on me."
West Brom travel to Chelsea on Sunday with the Premier League leaders in search of a ninth successive league win.
