Money probe at Aberdeen students' association

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has started into alleged financial discrepancies at Aberdeen University Students' Association (AUSA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood concerns were raised about a former AUSA employee.
The students' association said it would be inappropriate to comment in detail about the matter while police inquiries are being carried out.
The university said it was providing support to AUSA to ensure it can continue to carry out its work.
A statement from AUSA said: "Aberdeen University Students' Association reported concern to Police Scotland relating to a staff member who is no longer employed by the organisation.
"We understand that police inquiries are on-going and will make no further comment on the matter at this time."
A University of Aberdeen spokesman said: "It would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation is ongoing.
"AUSA is an autonomous charity which represents the student community of the University of Aberdeen, and the University is providing ongoing support to ensure it continues its work enhancing the student experience at Aberdeen."
