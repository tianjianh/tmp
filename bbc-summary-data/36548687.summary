Police have released CCTV images of a man wanted in connection with a serious assault in Dundee six months ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 26-year-old man was treated in hospital for a fractured elbow as a result of the attack in Cowgate at about 23:30 on Saturday 5 December.
Officers have now issued two images of the suspect, who is thought to be about 18-years-old.
He was described as being 5ft 8in tall, of slim build and was wearing a long-sleeved grey top.
The man, who has light brown hair with a fringe brushed to the right, is believed to have come from the direction of the Townhouse Inn in the company of two other men.
Det Sgt Mike Ness said: "The male in these images was seen in the area at the time of the assault,
"I would ask him, or anyone who recognises him, to come forward as they may have information to assist with our enquiries."
