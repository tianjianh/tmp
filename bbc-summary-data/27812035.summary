[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ministry of Defence overturns wind turbine decisions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has succeeded in overturning a council's decisions approving three wind turbines in the Western Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MoD challenged Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's decision to grant three crofters permission to build turbines.
The comhairle approved plans for two turbines at Bornish and one at Frobost on South Uist.
The MoD said wind turbines could interfere with air defence radar systems.
It said the machines could produce a false "aircraft-like return" and affect the detection capabilities of radar systems.
The risks arose when a certain level of proliferation of turbines in a localised area was exceeded, it added.
The MoD raised judicial review proceedings at the Court of Session in Edinburgh over the permissions granted by the comhairle.
Following a hearing before judge Lord Doherty the decisions of the comhairle were set aside.
