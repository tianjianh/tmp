Boy, 15, kidnapped after apple thrown at car at Newtown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers have been convicted of kidnapping a 15-year-old boy by bundling him into their car boot for allegedly throwing apples at passing traffic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were alerted after the boy called his mother when he was dumped in an industrial bin last July in Powys.
Declan Cluskey, 24, from Newtown, was jailed for nine months, at Mold Crown Court.
Dalian Cluskey, 21, also from Newtown, was given a suspended sentence.
They punched the boy in the face during the incident after stopping their car when a group had been throwing crab apples.
Judge Peter Rouch QC said: "This is not a typical kidnapping case."
He said it was not pre-meditated, adding it was all over in minutes and the distance the boy was taken was less than 200 metres (656ft).
