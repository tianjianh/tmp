[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Actress Anna Friel has been ordered to remove or rebuild an extension to her Grade II-listed house in Windsor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brookside and Marcella star built a one-storey extension on the back of her home in Kings Road.
But Windsor council said it had not been built in line with the planning permission granted in 2014 and its requests for changes had been ignored.
A building enforcement notice has been issued by the local authority giving Ms Friel three months to comply.
Windsor Urban Development Control Panel chairman Malcolm Alexander said Ms Friel was "very well respected" but the council could not treat her differently from any other resident.
In a statement, the actress said she wanted to apologise to the panel and took their demands seriously.
She added: "[I] want to reassure the necessary authorities that any final cosmetic requirements that need to be undertaken, will be done within the allocated remedy period."
Mr Alexander said: "We have had months and months and months of negotiation and persuasion, that has all just been ignored.
"It is very unfortunate, she is a very well respected and high profile resident. But we have to be consistent, we can't make exceptions."
