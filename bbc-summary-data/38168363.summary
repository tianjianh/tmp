The five-time Olympic gold medallist, 36, had suggested last month's Ghent Six Day event could be his last, but afterwards said he was "not sure yet" what his plans are.
British Cycling said they were giving Wiggins the "flexibility" to "consider the direction of his future".
He has been named as part of the men's track endurance team.
Wiggins teamed up with Mark Cavendish to win the Ghent Six Day event in Belgium. The pair also won madison gold together at the World Track Championships in London in March.
Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France champion, also won team pursuit gold at this year's Olympics in Rio - where British cyclists enjoyed great success winning 12 medals, six of them golds.
"In a year which has seen some fantastic performances from the Great Britain Cycling Team, the bar for programme membership remains high and we have a very strong podium programme squad to lead us into the next Olympic cycle," British Cycling's programmes director Andy Harrison said.
London 2012 Olympic team pursuit champion Dani King has returned to the Great Britain cycling team along with fellow road rider Nikki Brammeier.
Six riders - Alice Barnes (road), Emily Kay (track endurance), Danni Khan (track endurance), Ryan Owens (track sprint), Mark Stewart (track endurance) and Oliver Wood (track endurance) - have stepped up from the senior academy programme.
