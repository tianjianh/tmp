Matt Greenwood, from Walsall, West Midlands, has been given nine months to live after the cancer spread from his hip to his lungs.
Included on the Oxford University engineering student's list is a skydive, road trip around America and a hot air balloon ride with his father.
Matt thanked people for their support.
He said: "The support has been unbelievable from all directions, just an outpouring of love and it's really, really been moving."
