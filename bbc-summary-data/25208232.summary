New Zealand, who set a new record in the professional era by winning all 14 of their Tests in 2013, won team of the year for the seventh time.
And Steven Hansen was named coach of the year for the second time in a row.
"This is fantastic recognition of a very special team," said New Zealand Rugby chairman Mike Eagle.
Kieran Read is the third New Zealander to win the IRB world player of the year award. Dan Carter triumphed in 2005 and 2012, while Richie McCaw won the award in 2006. 2009 and 2010
"We are very proud of what Steve, Kieran and the team have achieved in 2013 as they have worked hard to be the best."
Read, 28, who has played 61 Tests for New Zealand, was chosen ahead of countryman Ben Smith, Wales' Leigh Halfpenny, South Africa's Eben Etzebeth and Italy's Sergio Parisse.
He is the third New Zealander to win the award, following Dan Carter in 2005 and 2012 and Richie McCaw in 2006, 2009 and 2010.
"I'd like to congratulate Kieran on his award as it is well deserved," said Hansen.
"He has been outstanding and has been a major contributor all season. It's been a big year and I'm incredibly proud of what the boys have achieved.
"It's certainly special to have the All Blacks named for all three awards so it's important that we thank and acknowledge all those behind the team."
The winners of the three awards were picked by a panel chaired by Australia's 1999 World-Cup winning captain John Eales and made up of Will Greenwood, Gavin Hastings, Raphael Ibanez, Francois Pienaar, Agustin Pichot, Scott Quinnell, Tana Umaga and Paul Wallace.
New Zealand's 14th win of 2013 came against Ireland late last month as they secured victory with a converted injury-time try to edge the autumn international 24-22.
