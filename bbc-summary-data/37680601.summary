A man accused of stabbing a book dealer to death over a Â£50,000 first edition of Wind in the Willows has denied targeting celebrities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Danaher, 50, from Peterborough, denies murdering Adrian Greenwood, claiming he killed him in self-defence.
The 42-year-old was found dead at his Oxford home in April and was allegedly on a list of rich people entitled "Enterprises" on Mr Danaher's computer.
But he told Oxford Crown Court a visitor had used his laptop.
He claimed the "unknown man" searched the internet for information on the addresses of high-profile people, including Gary Lineker and Louise Redknapp.
The prosecution alleges the motive for the killing was the theft of the valuable book, which was found in the defendant's home.
Oliver Saxby QC said Mr Danaher had a spreadsheet that listed "people of means" such as Kate Moss and Jeffrey Archer, who he intended to steal from or kidnap.
It had details of valuables, weapons and family members of his planned victims, with a stun gun listed in many cases. A stun gun was found in Mr Danaher's flat by police.
The trial continues.
