[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sport NI chief Antoinette McKeown dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of Sport NI, Antoinette McKeown, has been dismissed following her suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms McKeown, the first woman to be Sport NI's chief executive, was suspended on full pay from her role last March.
Investigations were conducted into a number of grievances cases.
Ms McKeown said she and her legal team will be lodging an immediate appeal to what she described as a "shocking decision".
Sport NI said: "Following a disciplinary process, chief executive Antoinette McKeown has been dismissed, subject to appeal."
A spokesperson for the Department of Communities, which is responsible for Sport NI, said it would be inappropriate to comment on a matter involving employees.
Ms McKeown had been appointed as the head of Sport NI - the body charged with encouraging participation in sport - in June 2013.
