Steel beat team-mate Kate Avery in a sprint finish in Bulgaria last year, and repeated that result at the trials in Liverpool last month.
Scotland's Laura Muir switches from success in the 1500m to the under-23 team in Hyeres.
GB have topped the medal table at the last 12 European Cross Country events.
The team won nine medals, including four gold, in Bulgaria 12 months ago.
All the athletes in Hyeres will be invited to carry an 'I Run Clean' message on their bibs to show their commitment to a doping-free sport.
"We want our participating athletes to reassure those watching at the course and at home that they are competing without resorting to doping," said European Athletics President Svein Arne Hansen.
