Violence of Christina Edkins' killer was likely, report says

The violent tendencies of a man who fatally stabbed a schoolgirl were predictable, a report into authorities' handling of the disturbed killer says.

Christina Edkins was 16 when she was killed by Phillip Simelane on a rush-hour bus in Birmingham in 2013.
The report found his history of "escalating" mental health problems and violence pointed to the "significant risk" he posed.
Despite a catalogue of episodes, he was able to lash out and kill.

In 2013, Simelane, from Walsall, West Midlands, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, admitted manslaughter over Ms Edkin's death and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.
The report, published on Wednesday, found on one occasion Simelane's mother made six calls to police in two days saying she was afraid he would kill her.
In 2014, a report found the teenager's death could have been prevented if her killer had been given mental health treatment.
The latest investigation - commissioned by NHS England - echoed the earlier report's conclusion that Ms Edkins' death was not itself predictable, nor was an attack on the public.
But the panel said it was clear Simelane would "continue to deteriorate" and was likely to reoffend - and violently so.
He had served time in prison for the assault and battery of his mother, killing Ms Edkins within three months of release from his second spell in jail.
In a statement, Ms Edkins' family said the report had "reopened old wounds" and rejected the view that death or serious harm to the public was not predictable, saying the facts - his violent history - did not "credibly" support it.
The family said it continued "to believe that failings within the NHS and Prison Service led directly to her death, which was both predictable and preventable".
NHS England has shared multiple episodes that mental health services and police were aware of, listing his "multiple risk factors" as a history of violence, threats to kill, and community release without access to mental health care.
Among those were Simelane throwing an electric fire at his mother's head and threatening to stab her.
Chairman of the investigative panel Koran Bhogal said: "The fact that there remains a risk that these vulnerable prisoners continue to be released from prison without adequate support and supervision leaving, them and the general public at risk, is of extreme concern."
