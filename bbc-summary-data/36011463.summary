McClenaghan, a member of the Rathgael Gymastics club in Bangor, finished behind the Olympic and world medallists in the pommel horse event.
"What the heck just happened?" said McClenaghan on Twitter.
"I just shared the podium with Louis Smith and Max Whitlock."
McClenaghan added:"There's nobody happier than I am now."
The 16-year-old's pommel horse score of 15.175 is one of the highest ever produced by a junior.
McClenaghan's achievement has been described as an "historical moment" for the Rathgael club.
Whitlock pipped his fellow British star Smith to take the gold after earlier clinching the all-round title in Liverpool.
