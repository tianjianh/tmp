The Championship side could face a possible points deduction or relegation following Wednesday's announcement.
The RFL said the move was "normal when a club enters administration".
The four-time Super League Grand Final winners, who entered administration in both 2012 and 2014, finished fifth in the Championship in 2016.
Bradford were relegated from the top flight of rugby league in 2014 after receiving a six-point deduction for entering administration.
Bulls chairman Marc Green said he would not be commenting on the statement.
The RFL's statement said: "As is normal when a club enters administration, the RFL board has terminated Bradford Bulls Northern Limited's' membership of the RFL.
"The RFL is in discussion with the appointed administrators about their plans for the future of the club.
"This is clearly a distressing time for supporters, players and employees of Bradford Bulls. We will aim to keep them updated of any progress as and when we can."
The Bulls are scheduled to start the 2017 season at Hull KR on Sunday, 5 February.
