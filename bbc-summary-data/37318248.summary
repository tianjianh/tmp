A community project in the Highlands has secured almost £1m from the Big Lottery Fund.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Embo Trust will use its £999,999 award to refurbish a former school in Embo, near Dornoch, to create a village hub.
It will be a base for a volunteer-run community shop and post office, a cafe and an all-purpose hall.
Trust chairman Jim McGillivray said the organisation was "overwhelmed" by the award.
