Graves removed for A465 Head of the Valleys Road widening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Remains and gravestones of 62 people have been removed from an old chapel cemetery for a major road widening scheme in Monmouthshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graves dated to the mid 1800s at the former Lion Terrace Chapel, which stood on the A465 Head of the Valleys Road at Gilwern.
Archaeologists had expected to remove about 12 burials due to information found on five remaining head stones.
The road between Gilwern and Brynmawr is due to be completed by 2018.
Experts exhumed the remains by hand before they were taken by private ambulance to a local chapel of rest.
Permission to remove the remains was given by the Ministry of Justice in September under The Disused Burial Grounds (Amendment) Act 1981.
Construction firm Costain said the reburials will take place at the council cemetery adjacent to St Elli Church in Gilwern along with a prayer service when all the remains have been reinterred.
