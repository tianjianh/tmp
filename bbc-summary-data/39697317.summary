[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jedburgh campus could combine three schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for an "intergenerational campus" which would combine three schools have been unveiled in Jedburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A consultation event on the project is being held in the town over the next two days.
Should Scottish Borders Council's proposals come to fruition, they would see Parkside and Howdenburn Primaries and Jedburgh Grammar School closed.
All education for children aged from two to 18 in the area would take place on one site at Hartrigge Park.
The ground was bought for housing by Jedburgh Town Council over 50 years ago but has not been developed.
The local authority said the campus would have state-of-the-art classrooms and learning spaces, the very best IT infrastructure and first-class leisure and dining provision, as well as the very best sporting and PE facilities.
It is aimed at strengthening Jedburgh as a "learning town" and is seen as an investment for learners of all ages in the Jedburgh area.
There will be all-day cafÃ© and recreation facilities for families and access to healthy living classes, gym facilities, relaxation spaces, cycle tracks and play spaces, as well as adult learning classes.
The council said health and wellbeing and lifelong learning would be "embedded within the heartbeat" of the campus at all times.
Adults will be able to undertake vocational and certificated courses in a range of areas such as food technology, hairdressing, construction skills and craft and design.
Plans for the scheme will be on display at drop-in sessions in the Grammar School gym hall on Tuesday and Wednesday 25 and 26 April
They will run from 10:00 to 20:00 on both days, with the last hour seeing a question and answer session.
The project could be approved later this year with the new Jedburgh campus operational by 2020.
