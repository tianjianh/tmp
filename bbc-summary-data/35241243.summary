Fagen, 67, has been accused of pushing Libby Titus into a marble window frame, knocking her to the ground, at their Manhattan apartment.
Ms Titus, 68, is said to have suffered "bruising and swelling to her right arm" and "substantial pain".
Steely Dan are best known for 1970s hits such as Reelin' in the Years and Rikki Don't Lose That Number.
The group, which Fagen launched with guitarist Walter Becker, had their first hits in 1972 and went on to enjoy commercial and critical success,  selling more than 40 million albums.
Fagen was charged with misdemeanour assault and harassment on Tuesday after being arrested by New York police at the couple's home on Monday.
"[Titus] and Fagen were involved in a verbal dispute, at which point he grabbed her by the arm and pushed her. She fell, bruising her arm," a  police department spokesperson  told Rolling Stone.
The New York Post reported that Ms Titus said: "I don't feel good. I'm very tired, and I'm divorcing my husband.''
The musician was released without bail and was ordered to stay away from his wife.
No comment has been issued by Fagen or his representatives.
The couple married in 1993 after meeting at Bard College in Dutchess County, New York, in the mid-1960s.
Steely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974 before retiring from live performances and becoming a studio-only band.
The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.
Fagen and Becker perform live on occasion, recently holding an eight-night residency at New York's Beacon Theatre, but they have not released an album since 2003's Everything Must Go.
Ms Titus is also a musician in her own right and, as well as releasing two solo albums, has collaborated with a variety of artists and producers including Paul Simon, Phil Ramone, Robbie Robertson, Burt Bacharach and Carly Simon.
