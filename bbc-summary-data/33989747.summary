The screening took place at 17:00 BST at a cinema in the West Midlands town and was followed by a question and answer session with Sir Lenny.
The one-off drama, which was written by and stars the comedian, is a "fantasy memoir" of his teenage years.
Half of the tickets were distributed to homes with Dudley postcodes.
Sir Lenny said: "It is about everything that I love about Dudley in the 1970s... it is a story that is heartfelt and funny and moving."
Speaking before the screening, Steve Waltho, Mayor of Dudley, said: "Lenny Henry is one of Dudley's most famous sons and is as proud of his roots as we are of him.
"We have presented him with the freedom of the borough as a celebration of his achievements and I am sure this drama will capture many of the aspects that helped make him synonymous with the town.
"I am very much looking forward to the special screening of Danny and the Human Zoo and finding out more about the early life of our very own Lenny Henry."
