The 22-year-old centre-back has signed a three-year deal with the Trotters after his contract ended in Spain.
He has come through the youth system with the La Liga side and played for Castilla, the Real Madrid B team, under ex-France midfielder Zinedine Zidane.
Although Madrid-born Osede has represented Spain at every youth level, he revealed to BBC Sport his desire to play for the Nigeria senior team.
He joins keeper Ben Amos and striker Gary Madine as Neil Lennon's signings so far this summer.
