[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Crawley Town have signed Dean Cox following the winger's departure from Leyton Orient.

The 29-year-old left the O's at the beginning of the month after six years at Brisbane Road, in which he scored 59 goals in 275 appearances.
He has agreed a contract with the Reds until the end of the 2018-19 season.
However, because Cox left Orient after the transfer window closed, he will not be able to make his debut for Crawley until 2 January 2017.
"Although it's frustrating that we can't play him for a while, we have the option of loaning him out to a National League South club," Reds boss Dermot Drummy told the club website.
"We can also arrange practice matches for Dean and, of course, he'll be training with us as part of the squad."
