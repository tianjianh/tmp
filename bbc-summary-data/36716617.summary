[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Port Vale boss Bruno Ribeiro has taken his tally of new signings to eight in as many days, by bringing in three players from his native Portugal.

Midfielder Paulo Tavares, 30, defender Kiko and striker Carlos Saleiro, also 30, have signed two-year deals.
Left-back Kiko, 23, has the option to stay in the Potteries for a third year.
Kiko and Tavares played for Ribeiro at previous club Vitoria Setubal, while Saleiro joins from Portuguese Division Two side Clube Oriental de Lisboa.
Tavares, born in Massarelos, began his career at Senhora da Hora, before moving on to Leixoes, where he spent eight years, including loan spells with Padroense, Ribeirao and Estoril.
He moved on to Vitoria Setubal in 2012, where made over 100 appearances.
Kiko, capped by Portugal at Under-20 level, will be playing under Ribeiro for a third time, having been signed by him on loan last season at Academico Viseu.
Saleiro, who started at Sporting Clube de Portugal, was the first person in his country to be born following in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment.
After a number of players opted not to renew their deals on reduced terms, Ribeiro had only 10 contracted players for the 2016-17 season when he was appointed on 20 June.
But he signed Dutch defender Kjell Knops from Eerste Divisie side MVV Maastricht, followed by striker Rigino Cicilia from Dutch side Roda JC.
He then added three more players last Friday, another Dutch defender Calvin Mac-Intisch, along with Frenchmen Quentin Pereira and Anthony de Freitas.
