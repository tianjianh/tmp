NBA: London franchise future hard to know - Adam Silver

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NBA commissioner Adam Silver has admitted uncertainty over Brexit and the UK's future outside the European Union makes it hard to predict London's chances of getting a franchise.

Talks have been ongoing for a decade for the capital of Britain to have a team which would play in the NBA.
"Brexit is something we monitor very closely," Silver told BBC Sport.
"I have been following Brexit but what it would mean in terms of placing a franchise in England I do not know."
Thursday's game between the Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers at the O2 Arena will be the seventh regular-season NBA match to take place in the United Kingdom.
It is the first time either side has played overseas during the regular season.
In 2007, previous NBA commissioner David Stern suggested there will "ultimately" be an NBA franchise in London one day.
Last June, Britain voted in a referendum to leave the EU by 52% to 48%.
