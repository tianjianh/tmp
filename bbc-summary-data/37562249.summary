The 22-year-old only made his debut in Super League this year but his form saw him called into the France squad.
Navarrete has previously played for Pia, Limoux and Hemel Stags and joins Joe Burgess and Thomas Leuluai as signings for 2017.
"We're very excited by what we've already seen of Romain," said Warriors head coach Shaun Wane.
"He runs the ball hard and is exactly the type of player that I like to have in our front row."
