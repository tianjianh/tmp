Lady Sasima Srivikorn told BBC Radio Berkshire she is in talks with several different companies to bring more sponsorship money to the club.
It has been called the Madejski Stadium, named after co-chairman Sir John Madejski, since it opened in 1998.
Lady Sasima said selling the name was an easy way to raise income, especially as the club was "moving up".
Reading are currently 13th in the Championship but have had several recent spells in the Premier League.
"I know to have the naming right on the stadium can fetch quite a lot of money," she said.
"There are many companies that would like to have that naming right, so that is one way of making the money come in."
The news provoked mixed reactions from fans.
Peter Metalli tweeted: "Some people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  Some of us weren't happy that it wasn't called New Elm Park!"
Another Twitter user joked the new name could be: "The plastic soulless tin pot stadium?"
But Jonathan Sawyer tweeted: "whatever the official name, it will always be the Mad Stad."
