Golden State Warriors eclipsed a record set by Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls as they became the fastest side in NBA history to 50 wins.

Star point guard Stephen Curry scored 36 points to help the Warriors to a 102-92 victory over Atlanta Hawks.
Monday's win meant they reached 50 victories from only 55 games, one fewer than the 1995-96 Bulls side.
Warriors are now chasing a second Bulls record, the Chicago side being the only team to win 70 games in a season.
Their 72-10 record in 1995-96 was the pinnacle for a side that dominated the sport in the 1990s, winning six titles in eight years.
"Fifty wins is great but we've got to keep plugging away and staying hungry, because nobody wants to talk about that in June," Curry said.
