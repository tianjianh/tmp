The Jordanstown woman carded seven birdies and one bogey in her six-under-par round to lie second on her own.
A number of players were unable to complete their first rounds on Thursday because of adverse weather conditions.
South Korea's Chella Choi leads on seven under, having played the final four rounds of her round on Friday.
Meadow, 24, travelled to Canada to compete in the LPGA Tour event just days after finishing joint 31st in the women's Olympic golf tournament in Rio.
The Northern Ireland woman came third in the US Women's Open in her first season as a professional in 2014 but has struggled over the last 18 months.
