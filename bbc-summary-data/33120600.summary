The identity of the winner is still unknown, and they can choose to remain anonymous if they wish.
The prize is the biggest in the UK this year and the sixth-biggest ever in the country.
The winner could receive their money by Monday, Camelot said.
"We're delighted Friday's ticket-holder has come forward to claim this truly life-changing prize," a National Lottery spokeswoman said.
The winning numbers in Friday's draw were 5, 8, 10, 11 and 37, with Lucky Stars numbers of 7 and 9. The jackpot had not been won since 26 May.
EuroMillions began in 2004 and the biggest prize in UK history was £161m, won by a Scottish couple in 2011.
Chris and Colin Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were "tickled pink" when they realised they had won the record-breaking prize.
The couple gave large donations to several causes, including £1m to the Scottish National Party's campaign for Scottish independence.
There was also a Thunderball draw on Friday, but no-one scooped the £500,000 top prize or the £5,000 second prize - and the biggest prize won was £250.
The unknown winners of the £93m are now in a position to buy everything from private islands to superstar footballers.
