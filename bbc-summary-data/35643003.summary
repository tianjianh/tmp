Powell missed out on the -78kg bronze medal on the final day of the Dusseldorf Grand Prix last weekend.
The 25-year-old won bronze at the Paris Grand Slam earlier in the month and will now head to Rio for a three-week training camp.
"My performances are getting better with every competition," Powell said.
"After a few weeks training I will be in a good place for Georgia."
Powell, who next competes in the Tibilisi Grand Prix in March, is up against 2012 Olympic runner-up Gemma Gibbons for the only Team GB slot available for Rio 2016.
Powell lost out to Anamari Velensek in the bronze medal play-off in Dusseldorf, with the Slovenian winning by ippon.
"The first few rounds went to plan and I felt really good," Powell told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I was really disappointed with my semi-final fight. I started off really good but I made a mistake later on and kind of thrown it away.
"I didn't perform well in the bronze fight either so what started as a really good day didn't end in the way I wanted it to."
