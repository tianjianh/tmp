The online retailer said it would begin recruiting later this year for a range of permanent roles at the Omega site in Warrington, near junction 8 of the M62.
A spokesman for Warrington Borough Council said Amazon had signed a 15-year lease in a Â£30m deal.
Warrington is one of four new so-called "fulfilment centres" that Amazon will open this year, creating 5,000 new jobs in the United Kingdom.
A site in Daventry, Northamptonshire opened in February, while Doncaster, Tilbury in Essex, and Warrington are set to begin operations in the autumn.
The retailer said the posts will include operations managers, engineers, HR and IT specialists.
The Omega business park is owned by Miller Developments, the Homes and Communities Agency and Warrington Borough Council.
Warrington South MP David Mowat said: "Warrington was recently ranked as the number two town in the country in which to do business, so it's no surprise that a major international organisation is keen to do business here and employ local people.
"Our unemployment rate has more than halved since 2010 and this looks set to continue."
Last year Amazon defended its employment practices after a BBC investigation.
