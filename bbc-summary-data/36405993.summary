Andy Murray: Jamie Delgado would welcome main coach role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Delgado would be "over the moon" if he is appointed as world number two Andy Murray's main full-time coach.

The Briton, 29, split from Amelie Mauresmo earlier this month after two years working with the Frenchwoman.
Murray said the presence of Delgado, on his team since February, meant there was "less rush" to find a replacement.
"I'm loving being involved with him, not just as a great player but also as a friend," said Delgado, a former Great Britain Davis Cup player.
"I'd always be watching him and hoping for him to win every match, so to be involved is fantastic.
"As regards a new coach, I'm not quite sure what's going to happen there - but if I were to do the job, I'd be over the moon."
Englishman Delgado's first tournament as sole coach ended with Murray beating world number one Novak Djokovic to win the Rome Masters and the Scot has progressed to the fourth round of the French Open.
"Tactically, on the clay, the past couple of months we've talked about a few things," said 39-year-old Delgado.
"The beginning of the clay is a tricky little moment when you're getting used to that surface again and we went through a few things that worked well for him last year and tried to improve that this year.
"He's quite clear about what he's trying to do on the court and I think that's shown in the past few weeks."
Delgado insists he is not looking to change Murray's often fractious on-court demeanour.
"He's had that side to his game and his competitive spirit all his life - so it's not something that you're looking to change really," he said.
"I understand how stressful it can be on the court in those tight situations when things aren't going well for you and whatever it might be on that day not working.
"But one thing he does do, he keeps fighting and very often finds a way to win so we just keep supporting as much as we can and we're with him all the way."
The two-time Grand Slam winner has been known to berate his coaching team during matches and Delgado is happy to deal with any flak coming his way.
"We take it sort of tongue in cheek as well," he said. "He sometimes says things in the heat of the moment.
"It's been absolutely fine and he's been competing and playing really well recently - so it's been great."
