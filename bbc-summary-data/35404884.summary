SNP MP Gavin Newlands has called for an inquiry after St Johnstone were told they will not be given extra tickets for Saturday's League Cup semi-final.

Tickets that had been promised to Saints in the Main Stand will be released to Hibernian fans instead.
The Scottish Professional Football League said it had taken the decision following advice from police and security staff at Tynecastle Stadium.
"There should be an investigation," Newlands said on Twitter.
"This is shocking by the SPFL. This cannot happen again."

Paisley-born Newlands, who represents Paisley and Renfrewshire North, also said the governing body's "shambolic" handling of the distribution was "grossly unfair" and would be a "dream" for ticket touts.
St Johnstone say they "share the disappointment this outcome will cause ticketless supporters".
Scottish Championship club Hibernian had received the bulk of the tickets when the initial allocation was announced, receiving approximately 11,500 tickets in the 17,529 capacity stadium.
Premiership outfit St Johnstone were allocated the 3,400 capacity Roseburn Stand but were told at the time "it has been agreed that this allocation may increase if there is a demand for tickets. A further allocation would take St Johnstone supporters into the Main Stand Block N Upper".
St Johnstone had supporters in that section of the main stand when they played Aberdeen in the 2014 semi-final.
