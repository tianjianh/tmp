[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Navy chef cleared of secretly filming sex on ship

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Royal Navy chef has been found not guilty of voyeurism after filming himself having sex with a colleague in a shower on a warship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading Logistician Scott Furber, 29, had been accused of filming the encounter on board HMS Diamond without the Wren's knowledge or permission.
Mr Furber was acquitted by a panel of three senior officers after a two-day trial at Portsmouth Naval Base.
The pair could still be punished for breaking the navy's "no touching" rule.
The trial heard that Mr Furber, who is based at HMS Excellent in Portsmouth, agreed to meet the woman for consensual sex in the showers of the Type 45 destroyer while it was alongside in Limassol, Cyprus, in June 2014.
Before the woman arrived, Mr Furber set his mobile phone on a shelf in the shower and made a 10-minute recording of the encounter. He told the court that they had agreed earlier in the day to film the session.
Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett told Mr Furber that he and his colleague could still be disciplined for contravening the "no touching" rule.
He said: "You have been found not guilty by this court of the charge of voyeurism.
"Whether the service prosecuting authority consider a breach of standing orders is not something this court has any view on."
