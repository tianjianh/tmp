The teenager was hit by the large, dark blue car, believed to be a BMW 5 series, on Westerton Drive, Bridge of Allan, at about 21:00 on Friday.
She was treated in hospital for minor injuries.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the incident which happened between the junction with Fountain Road roundabout and the junction with Castleview Drive.
Sgt David McNally, of Police Scotland, said: "Fortunately, the teenager suffered only minor injuries and we are eager to trace both the vehicle and driver involved.
"Anyone with information which can help with our inquiries is asked to come forward, as is anyone who may have seen the collision or a vehicle matching this description in the area around 9pm.
"Likewise, if the driver hears this appeal I would urge them to come forward so we can establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident."
