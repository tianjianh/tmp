Chuks Aneke: MK Dons forward signs one-year contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons forward Chuks Aneke has signed a new contract to stay with the League One club until the end of next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Arsenal trainee Aneke joined the Dons in August following his release by Belgian top-flight club Zulte Waregem.
The 23-year-old has scored four goals in 18 games this season, but has not featured since suffering a hamstring injury against Bradford in February.
"When he's been fit and playing, he's been one of our main players," manager Robbie Neilson told the club website.
"It's been a difficult period for him but he's shown tremendous attitude and he's working hard to be ready for next season."
