Ex-teacher 'accidentally' touched breasts, court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public school teacher accused of sexually assaulting three teenagers touched one girl's breasts by accident, a jury has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter Crown Court heard Chay Roberts-Jones, of Preston Street, "accidentally hit" one girl "somewhere around the chest" during a camping trip.
The 29-year-old denies three counts of sexual assault.
He was suspended from Blundells School in Tiverton in 2014 over the allegations.
The prosecution alleges Mr Roberts-Jones ran his fingers over the 16-year-old girl's breasts during the camping trip.
Frederick Morris told the jury he was on the trip and said the girl was wearing a zip-up onesie, which she opened herself to reveal a t-shirt.
"There was a conversation and Mr Roberts-Jones was telling a story," he said.
"He was in the middle of a circle and as he turned around during the story he accidentally hit the girl.
"It was completely by accident and he apologised straight away."
Mr Morris said Mr Roberts-Jones "hit her somewhere around the chest" and "apologised and nothing was made of it".
The court heard he was living in a cottage in the school grounds and was engaged to a female teaching assistant at the time the alleged offences took place in 2011, 2013 and 2014.
The trial continues.
