Swansea City midfielder Sheehan and Cardiff City striker Rhys Healey - both aged 21 - have impressed at County.
And Westley, whose side entertain Wycombe Wanderers, at Rodney Parade, on Tuesday night, believes both are benefitting from League Two football.
''I'd be surprised if either of them were recalled,'' said Westley.
Newport are on a seven match unbeaten run with Wales Under-21 player Sheehan having scored five goals in the last six games.
Healey has three in the last three matches. It has helped lift the Exiles off the bottom of League Two.
Cardiff manager Neil Warnock has already said he has no plans to recall his front runner.
Westley said: ''I have to say both Josh and Rhys will undoubtedly in the future go on and play at a higher level. How high is in their hands.
''If they keep improving at the rate they are improving they both could play at the very top level.
''Certainly Rhys could expect to go back to Cardiff in the future and play at Championship level and Josh could expect to go back to Swansea and play in the Premier League.''
But Westley said the players need to go to ''another level'' to be ready for their respective home clubs.
''I think a season here will do them both good, but we will see.
"It's not for me to dictate to their parent clubs what is right or wrong for them," he added.
''I think both are enjoying their football, both are improving, both boys are starting to show what they can do.
"I think with a good season under their belts in League Two. hopefully a successful season, I'd be very surprised if both of them aren't back competing for a first team shirt at their parent clubs next season.''
Meanwhile Newport defender Jamie Turley is recovering from knee surgery.
