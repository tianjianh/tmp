The book was compiled by the fleet's senior medical officer as a ninth birthday gift to his son in 1943.
Autographs include Flt Cdr Henry Melvin "Dinghy" Young, second in command of the raid, who was shot down and killed on his return.
The book was sold in Newark, Nottinghamshire.
The seller's father collected the signatures at the RAF base at Scampton, Lincolnshire, where Squadron 617 - better known as the Dambusters - was formed in March 1943.
Bombing raids on three major dams in Germany's industrial Ruhr Valley took place in May using Barnes Wallis' bouncing bomb. Of the 19 planes that went, eight were lost.
Henry Young - known as "Dinghy" because he survived two crashes into the sea in an inflatable boat - flew an Avro Lancaster, codenamed A-Apple, in the first wave, which attacked the Möhne Dam.
There are signatures from members of other squadrons based at Scampton, including Gp Capt Robert McFarlane, who later led a Lancaster Bomber squadron at the height of the Battle of Berlin, and Flying Officer Chas Walker, an Australian professional cricketer who was killed in action in December 1942.
Some added illustrations to their signatures, including a detailed drawing of a Lancaster in flight, a picture of a kangaroo by an Australian airman and a pair of cartoon airmen, captioned, "Jolly good show, what?!!".
James Brown, who sold the album, was also selling a silk map which was rescued from a burnt-out Lancaster bomber and the official warrant appointing his father as flying officer.
