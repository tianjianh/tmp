Scotland and Surbiton forward Alan Forsyth hopes the timing of his Players' Player of the Year award boosts his chances of an Olympic dream.

The 23-year-old was the first Scot to win the English Hockey prize.
"It's nice to get that, especially with it being voted by the players you play against week in, week out," Forsyth told BBC Scotland.
"Individual awards are nice but you play in a team sport and you always look forward to trying to win titles."
Paisley-born Forsyth was also named in the Premier Division's team of the year.
He scored 21 goals this season for Kingston-upon-Thames-based club Surbiton, who suffered play-off semi-final defeat to Reading on Saturday.
It was only an hour or so before that match that Forsyth was made aware of his award.
"I had no idea I'd won it and I wasn't expecting it at all," he said.
"The pre-match programme had the team of the year and told you who the player of the year was.
"I was actually sitting with one of my team-mates, Jonny Gall, in the changing room reading through the programme and we both just noticed it there and then that I'd got it.
"As a forward you obviously want to be scoring goals because you feel that's part of your job.
"Surbiton create a lot of chances and we are a very attacking side. I have been lucky enough that the boys have set me up when I've been in the right position."
Forsyth is also a former Scotland player of the year and was recently capped by Great Britain at the World League Finals in India.
He hopes a place in Team GB at Rio 2016 is within his reach ahead of the squad being selected in the summer.
"That would be a dream come true but to be honest I'll just take it week by week with the training," Forsyth added.
"I am new to the system and I've only been in the centralised programme for six months now. I'm just getting used to being in full-time training Monday to Friday."
