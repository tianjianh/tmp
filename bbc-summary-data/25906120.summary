Nottingham railway station worst for 'overall satisfaction'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham and Birmingham New Street have been named worst railway stations for "overall satisfaction" in a rail watchdog study.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Passenger Focus quizzed 30,000 train users across the UK and found they were the places fewest were happy with the service they were getting.
Both stations are in the middle of multi-million pound revamps.
Liverpool Central and London St Pancras were named as the stations offering best "overall satisfaction".
Nottingham, which is in the middle of a Â£100m upgrade and was largely closed for a five-week period last summer for upgrades to signalling, tracks and platforms, was named the dirtiest train station and the worst for choice of shops. Liverpool Central was named the cleanest.
New Street station is in the middle of a Â£650m revamp, with the first stage opening last April.
David Sidebottom, acting chief executive of the independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: "Stations are the gateways to the rail network and can really affect a passengers' overall journey experience.
"While investment has paid off with good scores in some key stations, others lag behind. What's important is that the industry now looks at things that matter most to passengers, and targets its investment in making sure those are the things it sorts out first."
Correction 28 January 2014: This story was amended after Passenger Focus contacted the BBC to say the results it originally released were incorrect.
