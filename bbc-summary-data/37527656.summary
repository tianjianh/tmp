Aldershot Town 2-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot bounced back from their midweek thrashing with a victory at home against Solihull Moors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shots had enjoyed an eight-match unbeaten run prior to their 4-0 defeat against Forest Green on Tuesday and they got back on track thanks to second-half goals from Shamir Fenelon and Scott Rendell.
The hosts broke the deadlock in the 64th minute when Cheye Alexander played in Fenelon and he found the bottom corner from 15 yards, before Rendell headed in Jim Kellerman's cross from close range to seal the win in the 82nd minute.
Solihull had scored four goals in each of their last two matches but created very little as their five-match unbeaten run was ended.
