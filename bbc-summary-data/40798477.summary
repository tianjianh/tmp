[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 2-3 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lucas Akins scored a late penalty to give Burton Albion victory at Oldham in the EFL Cup first round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron Holloway headed against the post for Oldham in the first half but they fell behind when Ousmane Fane's back pass gifted a goal to Luke Varney.
Paul Green's free-kick brought Oldham level and Craig Davies scored from the spot after Ryan McLaughlin was fouled.
But Matthew Lund equalised for Burton and Akins settled the tie after Damien McCrory was brought down in the box.
Although League One club Oldham were outplayed in the early stages of the game, they were unlucky not to take the match into extra time as Peter Clarke hit the post in the final seconds.
Connor Ripley made his debut in goal for Burton after arriving on loan from Middlesbrough and produced a couple of smart saves, but was caught out when Green's 30-yard dead-ball delivery into the box eluded everyone and found its way into the net.
