Tributes have been made to a "sweet-natured" man whose body was found on a beach in Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Calum Terras' remains were found near Queen's Promenade in Bispham on 16 August.
The 27-year-old went missing from his home in Blackpool in January. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.
He was a former pupil at Highfield School and previously worked as a ward clerk at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.
Extensive forensic tests have confirmed the remains found on the beach in August are those of Calum Terras, police said.
Mr Terras' brother said: "He truly was an amazing and a kind, loving person. He would go out of his way to please anyone who crossed his path and would bend over backwards to make a small difference in people's lives."
His family said he was "a decent, caring, intelligent, considerate, witty man with old school values".
In a statement they thanked the public for helping search for him and added: "We hope that Calum's death will raise awareness of the suffering of lots of young men due to mental illnesses and that people fully realise that depression is like any other illness of the body, it's just that it affects a person's mind."
