More than 1,100 cars turned away from Berkshire waste centres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 1,100 cars were turned away from Berkshire's recycling centres during the first week of changes to visitor access.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new waste permit introduced on 1 July only allows those living in Reading, Wokingham and Bracknell to use waste centres in Reading and Bracknell.
Up to 10,847 visits were recorded in Reading during the first week of change - with 900 vehicles turned away.
In Bracknell, 272 vehicles were refused entry out of 12,343 visits.
Changes to visitor access were made after West Berkshire Council withdrew Â£97,000 from its funding for waste disposal in the towns in March.
The authority decided the costs to cover the 75,000 visits to the tip each year, made by people crossing the border into Reading, were "too high".
This led to the establishment of Re3 - the recycling company which provides waste services to Bracknell, Wokingham and Reading councils - to bar West Berkshire residents from using the tips from July.
Reading Borough Council's lead councillor for neighbourhoods, Liz Terry said: "We have been encouraged by the numbers of residents using the permits when visiting the Bracknell and Reading recycling centres.
"We understand the frustration sometimes experienced by those we have had to turn away, but we will always allow access to re3 area residents on receipt of a permit or valid ID, and visitors from other local authority areas can still use their own council's facilities to dispose of their household waste."
