A new drop-off charge at Glasgow Airport has come into force.

Drivers dropping passengers off at the airport will now have to pay £2 for a stay of up to 10 minutes.
A new pick-up and drop-off point opposite the main terminal building has been opened with the old area at Caledonian Way West closing.
The airport said the new facility was the final stage of a wider scheme of works to reduce congestion around the airport's road network.
A Glasgow Airport spokesman said there had been a minor problem a few hours after it opened at 03:00.
"The facility has been working well, although we did experience a minor problem with a set of traffic lights just before 6am which caused a build-up of traffic on approach to the airport.
"This lasted around 20 minutes and the issue with the traffic lights has now been resolved.
"We have additional staff on hand providing support and guidance, and would encourage customers to check our website for details on the new arrangements."
A pick-up fee has been in place at the airport since 2010.
Blue badge holders will be exempt from the new drop-off charges.
Drivers who use the drop-off area for longer than 10 minutes will have to pay more, with a £30 charge for a 60-minute wait.
The airport said the high charges were to discourage drivers from using the area for extended periods.
A free pick-up and drop-off area located in the long stay car park, with a shuttle bus to and from the main terminal, will still be available.
A petition against the new charges has been signed by more than 7,500 people.
