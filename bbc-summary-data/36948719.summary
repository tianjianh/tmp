[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 3-2 Portsmouth (AET)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Rose netted in the second period of extra time to hand Coventry victory over Portsmouth in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Portsmouth took the lead when Vladimir Gadzhev brought down Kyle Bennett and Curtis Main scored from the spot.
Ryan Haynes volleyed in to level and, with eight minutes remaining, Gadzhev scored from close range and that looked to be enough for a Sky Blues victory.
But Kal Naismith's free-kick sent the tie into extra time before Rose side-footed home two minutes from time.
Match ends, Coventry City 3, Portsmouth 2.
