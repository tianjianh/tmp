[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire claimed the final five Lancashire wickets for just 12 runs as they went joint top of the County Championship with only their second Roses match victory in 25 years.

Chasing 349 to win, Lancashire lost four morning wickets to slump to 98-5.
Karl Brown and Liam Livingstone offered hope of a rescue in a 63-run sixth-wicket stand either side of lunch.
But Adil Rashid (4-17), and Tim Bresnan (4-36) swept aside the tail to lift the Tykes level on points with the leaders.
From 121-5 at lunch, once Rashid had removed Livingstone for 24, the end was rapid.
The visitors collapsed from 161-5 to 173 all out, Brown being ninth out for 51.
England all-rounder Rashid enhanced his hopes of a Test call by ending up with a match haul of 7-54, to add to his first-innings 88 and equally important 34 in the second innings.
The fit-again Bresnan took six wickets on his first Championship appearance of the season, as well as getting runs in both innings (69 and 29), in a game won by the batting of the Yorkshire lower order.
Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale:
"Conditions were a worry because I feared there could be a little bit of rain and the light didn't get any better.
"Brown and Livingstone batted very well but I felt that if we could take a wicket before the new ball we could open an end up.
"We have looked a lot more balanced with Tim Bresnan back. He has been a massive miss for us because he gives us control.
"It was our best performance of the season. Our top five batsmen are not firing as we'd like and our form doesn't warrant being top of the league but we are finding ways to win."
Lancashire cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles:
"It was a tough challenge to chase the runs. Conditions in the morning didn't help when it was dark and overcast.
"Brown and Livingstone batted very well but, over the four days, we have to hold our hands up and admit Yorkshire were the better team.
"We knew this would be our biggest challenge so far this season and we opened the door on the first morning but didn't quite get through it. Bresnan and Rashid batted very well and Yorkshire's tail wagged in both innings.
"We can learn from this defeat because, if we are to be champions, we have to win against sides like this on their own turf. We're still top but need to be more consistent away from Old Trafford."
