The relationship between the rivals is very frosty at the moment and they didn't even shake hands at the start of the TV debate, which is very unusual.
They argued over several different issues, including Mr Trump's comments about women.
At the end, they were asked to say one positive thing about each other.
Mrs Clinton said she admired Donald Trump's children, while he said he respected the fact she never gives up.
