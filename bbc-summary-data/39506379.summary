The Blues are seven points ahead of nearest rivals Tottenham after a 2-1 win over Manchester City on Wednesday.
"Tottenham could win eight games. For this reason to win the title we need 18 points," said Conte.
Meanwhile Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said his side are capable of winning all their remaining games and will fight to the end.
Tottenham scored three late goals to come from behind and win 3-1 at Swansea.
"If you compare Chelsea and Tottenham over the last 10 years, it is true Chelsea won more titles," Pochettino said.
"We believe and never give up, we always try and we were always pushing. I believe that we can win every game if we play like today - and then we'll see."
Tottenham have not won the league since 1961.
Their remaining eight games include a north London derby at home to Arsenal on 30 April and a visit from Manchester United on 13 May.
Chelsea still have to go to United on 16 April and Everton on 30 April.
Conte, in his first season as Chelsea boss, added: "We must be focused and try to win six games and take three points. If we are able to do this, we will win the title.
"Otherwise it will be a good season, but not a great season. We will remember this season if we win."
