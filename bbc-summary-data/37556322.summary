Scottish Championship club St Mirren have appointed Jack Ross as their new manager.

The 40-year-old, who is leaving League One outfit Alloa Athletic, will be introduced to the media on Wednesday.
Ross, who had a two-year spell in the Buddies defence, was appointed manager by Alloa in December 2015.
He told St Mirren's website: "I have fond memories of my time in Paisley as a player and can't wait to get started."
The Buddies, who sit bottom of their table, sacked former Rangers midfielder Alex Rae last month.
St Mirren chairman Gordon Scott, who bought the club in July in association with a fans group, said: "I was very impressed with Jack when we got a chance to meet and am delighted to have him on board as our new manager.
"One of the big plus points for me was Jack being with Hearts at a time when their supporters got involved in the ownership of their club."
Although he was unable to prevent Alloa being relegated from the Championship last season, Ross signed a new one-year contract this summer and they presently sit in third place.
Ross, whose Alloa side won their first 10 games of the season, was a full-back with Clyde, Hartlepool United, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He started his coaching career as assistant manager at Dumbarton before taking over the development team at Hearts.
Alloa have yet to comment other than a website statement thanking Jack for his services and wishing him luck in his new job.
