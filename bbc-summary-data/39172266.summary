Scotland's Paul Craig fell to his first defeat in the UFC after he was stopped by Tyson Pedro in Las Vegas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The referee brought a halt after four minutes of the first round with Craig unable to defend himself from a series of elbows from the Australian.
Pedro dominated from the first bell, trapping Craig against the cage and connecting several times with his knee.
Craig had some success with a few uppercuts but was hurt by a right hand before Pedro finished it on the floor.
Light-heavyweight Craig had defeated Henrique da Silva in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in December.
