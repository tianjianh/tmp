[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the stars of reality TV series Storage Hunters stalked a market trader for three years and bombarded him with explicit messages, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Boudicca Scherazade, 47, allegedly became obsessed with Laurence Roche after spotting him on his furniture stall in Wimbledon, London.
She sent photos of underwear and messages saying she was in love with him, and followed him around markets, it was claimed.
Ms Scherazade denies stalking.
St Albans magistrates were told how Ms Scherazade, from Middlesex, obtained Mr Roche's contact details from business cards left on his stall.
Her stalking campaign started after she gave him a bunch of flowers in 2013 and it continued until May 2016, it was said.
Prosecutor Clinton Hadgill read samples of the messages allegedly sent.
One included a photo of a pair of knickers on a rug with the caption "I've taken them off just for you".
In other messages, she is said to have told him: "I need your love so bad, can't live without you..."
It was claimed Ms Scherazade followed Mr Roche, who had a partner and child, to various markets and car boot sales, "continually" walked past his stalls, took photos of him and "caused him embarrassment" by shouting at him.
In the TV series Storage Hunters, Ms Scherazade, of Garrick Villa, Hampton, travelled the country with other dealers hoping to find a bargain. She appeared in the show in 2015.
She pleaded not guilty to a charge of stalking without fear, alarm or distress.
The case continues.
