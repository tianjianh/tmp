But the home side made no mention of a stomach bug affecting up to 20 squad members in their team announcement.
Defending champions Glasgow, three points better off than the hosts, are seeking an eighth consecutive victory.
Finn Russell takes over at fly-half amid seven Warriors starting changes.
Williams has played only once for the Llanelli-based team this season, a 60-minute outing against Connacht ahead of the Six Nations.
Steven Shingler returns at fly-half after a knee problem.
Following two comfortable victories in Italy, Glasgow press their claim for a home play-off by reintroducing scrum-half Henry Pyrgos and full-back Stuart Hogg.
Flanker Josh Strauss also returns, while winger Lee Jones and prop Sila Puafisi have recovered from recent knocks.
"We've got three tough games left to play of the regular season, starting with the Scarlets," said head coach Gregor Townsend.
"They've already beaten us this season and they're only three points behind us in the league, so we're well aware of the challenge we face."
Scarlets were 16-10 winners in Glasgow on the opening weekend of the season but Warriors won both matches of the Champions Cup double-header in December, including a 43-6 thumping at Scotstoun.
For the hosts, Williams has been sidelined since Wales' 64-17 win over Italy in the 2016 Six Nations.
"Liam's on track. He's trained very, very well," said Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac.
"We'd give him probably a better than 50/50 chance [of playing against Glasgow]. It's looking positive."
Pivac said Williams' presence in training has boosted his team-mates.
"He's a real competitor - he lifts the guys around him and it's a joy to have him in the team," said the New Zealander.
"It's a shame he's not been available for large parts of the season, so it's certainly good to see him running around."
Prior to news of the bug affecting the squad, Scarlets had been handed a boost, with flanker Lewis Rawlins, fly-half Steven Shingler and wingers Michael Tagicakibau and Harry Robinson also set to return.
