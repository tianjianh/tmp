[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Calls have been made for South Yorkshire Police's chief constable to be fired after it emerged he was not facing dismissal for misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Crompton was suspended after the Hillsborough Inquests due to "eroding trust and confidence" in the force.
Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Dr Alan Billings said Mr Crompton would be required to either retire or resign.
But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Scriven said he should be sacked and accused the PCC of lacking "backbone".

He said: "I was saying 18 months ago that David Crompton was not part of the solution he was part of the problem and he should have been sacked.
"I'm still of the view that the door should not be opened for him to walk through and get his pension.
"I believe he should be sacked for poor management, for not dealing with the problems of South Yorkshire Police and for bringing it in to disrepute.
"It's clear that [Dr] Billings does not have the backbone to take the strong action that's needed."
Mr Crompton, who is due to retire in November, was suspended in April, the day after of a jury concluded 96 football fans were unlawfully killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and there were police failings.
Following his suspension, a legal process began to decide on whether Mr Crompton will be made to retire or resign.
Asked on Wednesday why Mr Crompton cannot be sacked, Dr Billings told BBC Radio Sheffield: "Because that's not what we're doing. We are in a suspension process and that is a legal construct and we have to follow through what the law lays down. There is no way around that.
"This is not a misconduct issue this is about public trust and confidence draining away in my view."
He said he did not know the possible financial implications of allowing Mr Crompton to retire or resign as opposed to being sacked.
In response to Lord Scriven's comments, he said: "We are now engaged in a legal process, which requires me to seek and have regard to the views of others, and then to decide if I wish to continue with my proposal.
"Whilst this process is ongoing I am unable to comment further."
