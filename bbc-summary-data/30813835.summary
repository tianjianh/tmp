Lack of women on enterprise zone boards not acceptable, says watchdog

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The lack of women on the boards of almost half of Wales' enterprise zones is "not acceptable", the equalities watchdog has told BBC Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the boards for Ebbw Vale, Central Cardiff and St Athan have no female members.
The 65 board members across all seven boards include only 11 women.
Ministers said they had made "significant" progress "increasing diversity on public sector boards".
Kate Bennett, the commission's national director for Wales, said the number of women on Welsh enterprise zone boards was "not acceptable" and "very unusual".
In an assembly debate on Wednesday, a call by three AMs for the Welsh government not to give contracts or grants to companies without female directors on their boards was described as illegal by ministers.
