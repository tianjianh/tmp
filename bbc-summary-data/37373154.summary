Ian Whitten: Exeter Chiefs back happy with move from centre to wing

Exeter's Ian Whitten says he is not fazed by moving from centre to wing for the Premiership club this season.

The Irishman has started Exeter's first two league matches out wide, with new signing Ollie Devoto taking his place in the Chiefs' midfield.
"I've always taken the outlook that I'm just happy to be out there.
"It's a competitive squad and it's a good team and a good club and it's just nice to get out on the pitch for them," he told BBC Sport.
Last season Whitten forged a strong centre partnership with Sam Hill, having initially played alongside Henry Slade before the England international broke his ankle in December.
Whitten impressed in the club's final two pre-season game out wide, but was forced off early in the opening-day defeat at Wasps this term after suffering a dead leg.
"It went quite well in the Ulster game on the wing and the after that it's been a bit of a mixed bag," he said.
"I've always mixed between centre and wing since I've been here, some years it's been mainly on the wing, other years it's been mainly in the centre.
"You're always a bit nervy the first couple of games you play on the wing, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you are."
Exeter have begun the season with two defeats, having lost at Wasps - who they beat in last season's play-off semi-finals - and then going down at home to champions Saracens.
Whitten says those results mean there is added pressure on Exeter to get a result when they entertain Harlequins on Saturday.
"There's not that much of a panic about it at the minute, but there is a bit of pressure on us this weekend, everybody knows that," he added.
"You'd be lying if you said you didn't feel the pressure or you weren't aware of it to a certain degree, that's why it's important that you just keep focusing on yourselves and what you do."
