Items including the 22-year-old victim's packed suitcases containing her clothes and shoes were taken
Evans, 33, from Gorseinon, has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty at Swansea Crown Court.
Det Insp Trudi Meyrick said police forensically examined the snack, which had been taken from the kitchen, half-eaten and left on the floor.
"Forensic technology is an important way of catching [a] burglary suspect and in this case has resulted in us putting the suspect before the court to receive a prison sentence," she said.
