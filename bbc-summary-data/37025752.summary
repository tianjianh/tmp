Williams sold over Â£50,000 worth of tickets in July when he stopped rival Gary Corcoran at the Wales Ice Arena.
His reward is another opportunity to box in front of his own fans, with Williams confirming he will headline a bill at Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena.
Williams, 24, trained by Welshman Gary Lockett, will feature alongside stablemates Alex Hughes and Jay Harris.
Promoter Frank Warren is yet to announce details of Williams' opponent, but it is expected to be a title defence for the Rhondda boxer with further details to come on Monday.
Super welterweight Williams will begin his preparation by travelling to Spain to spar with British world champion Kell Brook, who challenges Gennady Golovkin on 10 September at the O2 Arena.
