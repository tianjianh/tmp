[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jed Wallace scored a brace to help Millwall thrash Northampton Town and bolster their League One play-off hopes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts flew into a three-goal lead before the break, with Aiden O'Brien also on the scoresheet, as the Lions remain sixth in the table and in the play-off spots - one point above seventh-placed Southend with three games left.
Millwall striker Lee Gregory saw an early shot hit the post as Northampton struggled to gain a foothold.
O'Brien opened the scoring in spectacular fashion on 27 minutes, lashing in a sublime first-time volley off the bar from just inside the box after neat interplay with Joe Martin.
Ten minutes later Wallace struck a magnificent 25-yard effort which arrowed into the top corner, giving visiting keeper Adam Smith no chance.
Wallace got his second just before half-time, striking home from eight yards after O'Brien's neat cut-back from the by-line.
The Lions continued to attack in the second half but could not add to their tally as the Cobblers defence performed damage limitation to stifle the hosts.
