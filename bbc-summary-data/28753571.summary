[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a man whose remains were found at a Bristol recycling plant is not being treated as suspicious.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said an initial post-mortem examination had been completed on 34-year-old Matthew Symonds and a file was being prepared for the coroner.
The case has also been referred to the Health and Safety Executive.
The family of Mr Symonds, who came from Swindon, said they remained "distressed" about the circumstances in which he died.
Mr Symonds' remains were found at a Biffa depot in Avonmouth on 1 August.
It has been established that his body was transported with commercial recycling waste from a site in the centre of Swindon.
In a statement, his grandmother, Susan Symonds, and aunt, Rachel Symonds, said: "The whole family are shocked and saddened by the sudden death of Matthew in such circumstances.
"We remain distressed about the way it happened - it is a tragedy and appears to have been a terrible accident. He will never be forgotten.
"Despite his hard life and upbringing, he was a good lad who was kind and polite.
"He loved to talk and would continue until in the end you had to tell him to be quiet.
"The loss of his mum had a massive impact on him. As an only child he was devoted to his mum Madeline who sadly died in September last year.
"Due to the post-mortem and police investigation, it has not been possible to make any funeral arrangements yet."
Wiltshire Police said further tests would be carried out on Mr Symonds' remains but it was no longer a criminal investigation. An inquest would be held at a later date.
