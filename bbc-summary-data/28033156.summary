[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Jones, from Denbigh, was staying in the city of Chania, but has not been seen since 19 June, say his family.
They raised the alarm yesterday as he had been due to fly home on Tuesday but failed to turn up for his flight.
They say he is a keen walker and it is possible he went out walking in the hills in the surrounding area.
Mr Jones's son Jeffrey Jones from Prestatyn said the family first learned he was missing when they visited his home on Wednesday.
The father of four arrived in Crete on 17 June and sent his family a postcard in the first few days saying he was planning a walking trip.
His son described him as a "Bear Grylls" type man who is used to coping with the outdoors and said he would have been well equipped.
North Wales Police confirmed Mr Jones had been reported missing and said police in Greece were leading the investigation, working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Interpol.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: "We are aware of a British national, Robert Arthur Jones, reported missing in Greece. We are providing consular assistance to the family.
"UK police are assisting the Greek authorities with the investigation."
