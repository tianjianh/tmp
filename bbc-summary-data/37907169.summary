[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People in the US voted in their millions to choose who would be the next leader of the country.
The two main candidates for the job were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
After many months of campaigning by both candidates, the wait was over and it was announced that Donald Trump would become the next president of the US.
This is the end of Newsround's live online coverage of the US election results.
Thank you for your questions and comments throughout the day!
Hillary Clinton has given a speech after the result of the US election, which she lost to rival Donald Trump.
She apologised to her supporters for not winning the election. "This is not the outcome we wanted or worked so hard for," she said.
However, she went on to say how proud and grateful she was for the campaign that she fought.
She told her supporters that they represent "the best of America" and that it had been "one of the greatest honours of [her] life" to represent them.
She said that she had congratulated Donald Trump on his victory, adding: "I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans."
As well as asking you in the UK what you think about the result, Newsround also spoke to children in the US about their feelings.
This is what they had to tell us...
Newsround went to speak to some of you to find out what you would like to say to the next US president Donald Trump.
We want to know why Donald Trump has been elected despite what he has said about Mexican people and the horrible things he has said about women. Even though he has been really horrible to and about women, some women have voted for him. Why?
Ayshah: Different people vote for different reasons.
A lot of people think Donald Trump will be good for the country because he's said he will bring more jobs and keep America safe. He's also not a politician and many Americans want a change.
A lot of people don't like Hillary Clinton because they say she can't be trusted. Everyone makes a personal choice when it comes to voting.
How do the American people feel about the result?
Ayshah: People have different opinions.
Those who voted for Donald Trump will be happy. At the official party for his campaign, people were cheering and waving banners when the results were coming in.
But those who voted for Hillary Clinton will be feeling disappointed today. Some were seen crying at Clinton's party, which was held in New York.
The kids I've spoken to so far in the US have mixed feelings. Some of them were shocked when they woke up to the news that Donald Trump will be their next president. But others have told me they are happy and excited about the choice adults have made.
Do you think Donald Trump will elect Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State?
Ayshah: Donald Trump will start announcing the people that he wants to work with over the next couple of months.
It's more likely he'll choose people who supported him throughout his campaign. It's unlikely that Hillary will be Secretary of State as she stood for the opposite party and was his rival.
President Barack Obama has invited Donald Trump - the 'President-elect', who is the soon-to-be president - to the White House on Thursday to discuss handing over the job.
Obama is also expected to make a speech soon to talk about the results and how the country can come together now the election is over.
A photo taken today shows work has already begun outside the White House to prepare for the inauguration ceremony in January, when Donald Trump will officially start the job as US president.
How did Donald Trump become president?
Ayshah: Our guide shows you the exact process of how you become president if you want to find out more.
Why is Donald Trump building a wall across the Mexican border?
Ayshah: He says he wants to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the US to stop people from going into the US illegally.
He's said it's too easy to cross between the two countries at the moment and the wall will keep American people safe. It's one of the top issues his supporters were worried about.
What is Donald Trump going to do now that he is president?
Ayshah: He will not officially start the job until 20 January next year. So that means he is currently called a President-elect.
However, between now and then, he will start to choose the people who will work closely with him while he is president. We will have to wait and see what he decides to do first once he starts the job.
How long is Donald Trump going to be president for?
Ayshah: Usually a president stays in the job for four years before the US people can elect a new president.
It's rare that an elected president would be in the White House for a shorter time than this, unless something exceptional happened.
After four years, Donald Trump could be re-elected if the American people want him to be. He would then be in charge for a total of eight years, like President Barack Obama has been.
When Newsround visited the US recently, Ayshah met Spencer, who was supporting Donald Trump in the election, which had not happened yet.
Since then, the candidate he was supporting has been elected to become the next president.
We caught up with him this morning to see how he was feeling after the result...
Will Donald Trump actually build a wall?
Ayshah: It's something that he's talked a lot about in his speeches and his slogan "build a wall" has been chanted by his supporters.
For now we'll have to wait and see. He doesn't officially go into the White House to start his job until January, so nothing will happen until then.
How did Hilary feel when she lost?
Ayshah: Well, we haven't heard from Hillary Clinton yet. She's expected to give a speech soon and we'll bring you the latest on Newsround, so check back here.
At the party where Hillary supporters were gathered to hear the result, the head of her campaign John Podesta came on stage to tell her supporters to head home, as she wouldn't be making a speech straight away.
In Donald Trump's speech, he announced that Hillary Clinton rang to congratulate him.
Now that the election is over, many of you may be wondering what will happen next.
While Donald Trump has been elected as the next US president, he won't officially start the job until a ceremony on 20 January 2017 called the inauguration.
The Obamas can live in the White House, the official home of the president, until Donald Trump's inauguration.
On moving day, they will say goodbye to all the staff who work in the White House, and then Trump and his family will move in.
To find out more about what happens next, check out our guide.
Why weren't there other candidates?
Ayshah: There were other candidates for the job, but they didn't get many votes at all, and they were from much smaller parties.
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were the two who were the most popular.
Every President since 1853 has been from one of the big US political parties - the Democrats or the Republicans. And this time it's the Republicans who've come out on top.
Could Donald Trump ban homework in the UK?
Ayshah: No, he's going to be president of the US, so he will not make rules about how schools in the UK work.
Will he bring the US closer together or will it end up in chaos?
Ayshah: Donald Trump said in his victory speech that he wants to bring the country together.
At his speech in New York he said: "It's time for us to come together as one united people." But there have been concerns that the US is very divided and it's an issue that kids there told me should be dealt with.
Donald Trump has won the election to become the next president of the US.
However, it has not just been a victory for him. People in the US have also been voting for who they would like to represent them in another part of the government called Congress, which also helps to run the country.
After this election, the party which Donald Trump represents - the Republicans - have kept a lot of power in Congress.
This is good news for Donald Trump, as he will be working with lots of members of his own political party to run the US.
But what do the Republicans believe in? How are they likely to want to run the country?
Newsround wants to know what YOU think about Donald Trump taking on one of the biggest jobs in the world.
Do you have any questions about the result, Donald Trump or what happens next?
