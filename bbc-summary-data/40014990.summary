Championship side Cornish Pirates have signed Plymouth Albion back row Rupert Cooper on a one-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old spent five years in the second tier with Nottingham before joining Albion last summer.

"The Pirates are clearly ambitious both on and off the field and I can't wait to get started."
