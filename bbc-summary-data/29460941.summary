A woman suffered only minor injuries when the car she was driving crashed in to a house near Birmingham.

The BMW Mini left Thornhill Road in Streetly just after 22:30 BST on Wednesday - smashing through a hedge, a tree and a brick wall before eventually hitting the property.
The woman, understood to be in her 20s, was freed by a passer-by before crews arrived, a fire service spokesman said.
She was taken to hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises.
Grandfather-of-four John Clifford, who has lived in the property with his wife Pam for almost 40 years, was watching television in the living room when the crash happened.
"There was a bang, bang, bang and then a huge explosion sound," said the 76-year-old retired teacher.
"My immediate reaction was 'is that a gas explosion?'.
"The house absolutely shook. I shouted to Pat 'what the hell is that?' I went to look through the window and all I could see was the car."
Mrs Clifford was watching television in bed when the drama unfolded.
"I heard this rumbling noise and thought 'that sounds odd'," she said.
"I thought 'it must be a lorry with a blown out tyre'. Then there was this crash seconds later and an explosion."
Just minutes before the crash, Mr Clifford had been in the downstairs bathroom, directly next to the wall where the car came through.
"We are lucky," he added.
"But the girl was even more lucky. How she got out in one piece I don't know."
No-one has been arrested. An investigation has been launched by West Midlands Police. An expert was due to visit the house to assess the damage.
