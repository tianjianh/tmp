Leeds United 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United were beaten at home by high-flying Wolves in the Championship, leading to Darko Milanic's sacking as head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mirco Antenucci's crisp shot from just inside the box gave Leeds the lead in the first half.
Wolves equalised when Giuseppe Bellusci failed to control in the box and winger James Henry finished from close range.
Both sides pushed for a winner but Leon Clarke came off the bench to side-foot home from Matt Doherty's pass.
Defeat ended Milanic's 32-day reign at Elland Road, with academy manager Neil Redfearn expected to take over from the Slovenian.
The home side took the lead when Alex Mowatt's 50-yard floated ball found Steve Morison, making his first start for Leeds in 17 months, and he laid in his strike partner Antenucci to fire home his fourth of the season.
Mowatt should have made it 2-0 shortly afterwards but he scuffed his shot with the goal gaping when laid in by the lively Morison.
After few meaningful efforts before half-time, Wolves improved after the break with Nouha Dicko, Rajiv van La Parra and Clarke all going close.
Their pressure was rewarded when Leeds centre-back Bellusci did not deal with a cross, and his attempted clearance fell to Henry, who drilled the ball into the roof of the net.
Clarke, on as a half-time substitute for Dave Edwards, scored his first goal of the season as he finished off a flowing Wolves move inside the area.
Kenny Jackett's side have now won back-to-back games and are third in the Championship table, only sitting outside the automatic promotion places on goal difference.
Leeds' Darko Milanic, speaking before he was sacked:
"I am disappointed because we deserve some more points. This is not a good position for me and the team, but I still see good things that we make. I believe it.
"My job is to do this better, to improve. I work with my team a lot and it's a young team without a lot of experience."
Wolves manager Kenny Jackett:
"We are aiming to get one of the promotion places. We have made a solid start and are in a good position and are showing we are capable.
"This is a tight division and I have not seen anyone who is streets ahead, so perhaps being the newcomers can help us."
