Swansea's Guildhall clock goes automatic as keeper retires

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to fit Swansea's Guildhall clock with automatic winding mechanisms is being carried out before its official keeper retires.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Horologist David Mitchell, who has maintained and wound the city's clocks for nearly 50 years, finishes next month.
Instead of replacing him, the council has decided to automate the clock in future in a bid to save money.
The work, approved by Cadw, takes place on Monday and Tuesday.
Council leader Rob Stewart thanked Mr Mitchell for his "many years of outstanding specialist service" and said work on the clock would help preserve it.
Mr Mitchell added: "The Guildhall clock, like all clocks in Swansea, is special to me because I worked on it for close to 50 years, but I know it's in safe hands."
New mechanisms will also be installed on clocks in Swansea Market and Treboeth Public Hall.
