Princess Anne is to open a Â£3m rehabilitation centre for injured jockeys in North Yorkshire later.

Jack Berry House in Malton was funded mostly by retired jockey Jack Berry, who broke 46 bones in his 16 year racing career.
The centre includes an underwater treadmill, hydrotherapy pool, horserace simulators, a gym and respite accommodation.
Mr Berry said: "Words can't justify how proud I feel at this very moment.
"Jump jockeys average a fall every 16th ride and in one in ten falls they get injured. We need to look after them," he added.
North Yorkshire is an important centre for the horse racing industry, with more horses and jockeys being trained in Malton and Middleham than ever before and more than 50 trainers now in the area.
Until now, injured jockeys in the area had to travel elsewhere for treatment.
Jack Berry House will be used to train apprentice jockeys as well as giving rehabilitation and respite care.
It will be run by the Injured Jockey Fund (IJF).
Jockey Dougie Costello, recovering from a broken ankle, said: "A jump jockey basically has to learn to ride with injury.
"You'll never come back to what your body was but if you can come back to 99% and we've got people like this to help us, then as a sport we're working in the right way."
Princess Anne is due to cut the ribbon at Jack Berry House at 15:00 BST.
In February, she opened accommodation for young racing staff in Malton partly financed by a fund set up after teenage jockeys Jamie Kyne and Jan Wilson died in a flat fire in 2009.
