Where is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un? He was last seen out limping in public more than a month ago.

Apparently the 30-year-old is resting after an ankle, or is it a knee, injury?
Nobody quite knows.
There are a few rumours going around about why the leader of the country didn't make an appearance at a big political event on Friday to mark the ruling party's anniversary.
The last time Kim Jong-un was seen in public was in September, the longest period since he came to power in 2011.
He inherited power after his father Kim Jong-il died.
Some think that Kim Jo, Kim Jong-un's younger sister is secretly in power in North Korea.
There are few pictures of the 25-year-old, but we know that Kim Jong-un is close to his sister and that she often accompanies him on business.
He also has two half-brothers and an older and younger brother.
Kim's absence has brought a renewed focus on his top military aide, Hwang Pyong-so, who has had an unprecedented rise from a desk job to the top rungs of North Korea's leadership in the space of a few years.
It's thought he was in charge of Friday's ruling party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang.
Media reports in North Korea say Kim Jong-un is having to rest after an injury to his ankle or knees. Again, nobody is quite sure.
The last time he was seen in public was 3 September limping and hobbling.
Some say his love of cheese has caused his weight gain causing his bones to crack.
Kim Jong-un is believed to be between 5ft 2in (1.58m) and 5ft 9in (1.79m), possibly weighing 280 pounds or 20 stone (127kg).
Nobody is exactly sure. Like most things in North Korea it is hard to verify any facts because of the country's secretive nature.
He is said to love wearing Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men's footwear, to give him height and authority.
Have the shoes taken their toll on his health?
Earlier this month, it was reported Kim Jong-un had gout, which causes painful inflammation in the joints, usually in the feet.
There are also reports he has diabetes.
Kim Jong-un has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011.
Other unsubstantiated things about the elusive leader include reports that he loves the LA Lakers basketball team and has had cosmetic surgery to help cover his weight gain.
Previously he's spent 21 days out of the public eye in March 2012 and then another 24 in June the same year. In January 2013 he wasn't seen for 18 days.
