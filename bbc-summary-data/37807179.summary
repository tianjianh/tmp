It was Bradford's first home defeat of the season and the second time that League Two Stanley have beaten the Bantams this season, having won on penalties at home in the EFL Cup in August.
Bradford began well, almost taking the lead in the third minute but James Hanson's header was cleared off the line by Mark Hughes.
Accrington went in front after 30 minutes though with a goal by Romuald Boco, who had seen his 25-yard shot rebound off the crossbar 13 minutes earlier.
Sean McConville delivered a cross from the right and Boco scored with a near-post header.
Bradford keeper Colin Doyle did well to deny the visitors a second goal early in the second half, diving full length to save Clark's shot from the edge of the penalty area, before the home side managed an equaliser in the 72nd minute.
Substitute Billy Clarke delivered an inswinging corner from the right and Matthew Kilgallon scored with a close-range header.
Accrington continued to attack and were rewarded with a winning goal in the 80th minute when Boco flicked the ball into the path of Clark on the left and he scored with a superb angled shot.
