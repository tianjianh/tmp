A search and rescue helicopter base at Prestwick Airport was the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's busiest in Scotland between October and December last year.

New statistics also show that Prestwick, along with a base at Caernarfon in Wales, was the busiest in the UK over that period.
Crews at the Ayrshire and Welsh bases each responded to 72 taskings, or call-outs to incidents.
However, Prestwick's taskings took longer than Caernarfon's.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency assumed responsibility for helicopter search and rescue in 2016,  taking over the role from the Royal Navy and RAF.
Scotland has three other coastguard helicopter bases.
Between October and December last year, Inverness responded to 44 taskings, Stornoway on Lewis 16 and Sumburgh in Shetland 24.
