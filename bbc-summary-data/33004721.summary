Former top Fifa executive Chuck Blazer has admitted he and other officials from world football's governing body conspired to take bribes in relation to the 1998 and 2010 World Cups and other major tournaments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The revelations by the 70-year-old American came in a newly unsealed 40-page transcript from a US court hearing in November 2013.
As part of a deal, he waived his indictment and pleaded guilty to 10 charges, including conspiracy to commit racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax evasion and failure to report foreign bank accounts.
Below are the key statements from the transcript made by Blazer.
"Personally I have rectal cancer. I am being treated. I have gone through 20 weeks of chemotherapy, and I am looking pretty good for that. I am now in the process of radiation, and the prognoses [sic] is good."
"At the same time I have a variety of other less significant ailments dealing with diabetes II and coronary artery disease but holding up reasonably well."
"From 1997 through 2013, I served as a Fifa executive committee member. One of my responsibilities in that role was participating in the selection of the host countries for the World Cup."
"I also served as General Secretary of Concacaf [the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football] from 1990 through December of 2011, and was responsible for, among other things, participating in the negotiations for sponsorship and media rights."
"During my association with Fifa and Concacaf, among other things, I and others agreed that I or a co-conspirator would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity."
"Among other things, I agreed with other persons in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup."
"Beginning in or about 1993 and continuing through the early 2000s, I and others agreed to accept bribes and kickbacks in conjunction with the broadcast and other rights to the 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003 Gold Cups [regional Concacaf tournaments]."
"Beginning in or around 2004 and continuing through 2011, I and others on the Fifa executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup."
"Among other things, my actions described above had common participants and results."
"Between April of 2004 and May 2011, I and others who were fiduciaries to both Fifa and Concacaf, in contravention of our duties, I and others, while acting in our official capacities, agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud Fifa and Concacaf of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes."
"I and others agreed to use email, telephone, and a wire transfer into and out of the United States in furtherance of the scheme. Funds procured through these improper payments passed through JFK Airport in the form of a check."
"Between December 2008 and May 2011, I and others agreed to and transmitted funds by wire transfer and checks from places within the United States to places in the Caribbean, and from places in the Caribbean to places in the United States."
"I agreed to and took these actions to, among other things, promote and conceal my receipt of bribes and kickbacks. I knew that the funds involved were the proceeds of an unlawful bribe, and I and others used wires, emails, and telephone to effectuate payment of and conceal the nature of the bribe."
"Funds procured through these improper payments passed through JFK Airport in the form of a check."
"Between 2005 and 2010, while a resident of New York, New York, I knowingly and wilfully failed to file an income tax return and failed to pay income taxes."
"In this way, I intentionally concealed my true income from the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], thereby defrauding the IRS of income tax owed."
"I knew that my actions were wrong at the time."
"In 2010, while a resident of New York, I had an interest in and controlled bank accounts in the Bahamas with a total value exceeds $10,000 [sic]."
"I intentionally and wilfully did not file a report disclosing those accounts to the Department of the Treasury."
"I did this while violating the Federal Tax Law."
