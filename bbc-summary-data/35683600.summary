West Brom manager Tony Pulis says striker Saido Berahino's form is the key to him getting the move he craves.

Berahino scored his first league goal since October in West Brom's 3-2 win against Crystal Palace on Saturday.
On Friday he apologised for threatening to go on strike after failing to secure a move to Tottenham in August.
Pulis said: "He wants to play for a top-four team. You can't take that from the boy. If he is playing well, he will get the recognition. And the move."
Newcastle had a Â£21m bid for Berahino rejected in January.
The England Under-21 international's contract expires in 2017 and Pulis says Berahino has been too easily led.
He said: "Every window that opens, he gets driven in a direction that, maybe, a more experienced or stronger character would deal with.
"He is not a bad lad. I have been round to his house, I have met his mum, they are nice people."
West Brom's win leaves them 13th in the Premier League ahead of Tuesday's game with Chelsea at The Hawthorns.
