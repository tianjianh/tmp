Conservative Nick Boles, who is undergoing chemotherapy for a tumour in his head, said he felt "pretty grim" but he wanted to "represent my constituents" in Grantham and Stamford.
He posted a picture on Twitter of himself in a wheelchair and wearing a blue medical mask.
Mr Boles has been off work since his diagnosis last October.
He will be in Parliament to vote on amendments to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill - which, if passed, will allow Brexit talks to get under way - on Tuesday.
Mr Boles has spent the last week receiving his third round of chemotherapy.
He published a statement on Facebook, saying: "Today, on my own initiative, I am coming out of hospital to support the government on the Article 50 bill."
Mr Boles added: "I feel pretty grim and will have to go back to hospital after I have voted.
"But I want to come to Parliament to represent my constituents on this important bill and do my bit to ensure that it is passed without amendment."
Mr Boles supported the Remain campaign during last year's EU referendum debate, but he said last September that the early signs for the UK in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU had been more "positive" than anticipated.
