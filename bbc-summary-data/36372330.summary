They are the lifetime collection of broadcaster Gyles Brandreth and his wife, Michele Brown.
The Brandreth Bear collection could "keep on growing" at Newby Hall, Mr Brandreth said.
It was previously held at the former Teddy Bear Museum in Stratford-on-Avon.
The bears will be on permanent display in a new purpose-built Bear House at Newby Hall.
The collection includes Fozzie from The Muppet Show, Children in Need's Pudsey Bear, Superted and Winnie the Pooh.
Mr Brandreth said there were plans to put on plays.
The collection also features teddy companions of the rich and famous.
Newby Hall near Ripon was built by Sir Christopher Wren in the 1690s and is thought to be one of Britain's finest examples of Adam-style architecture.
Last May, a permanent collection of 65 dolls houses was installed in Newby Hall's potting sheds.
