[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark McGhee will serve a two-match touchline ban after admitting use of abusing and/or insulting language towards a match official and a steward.

The Motherwell boss will not be in the dugout for the games against Kilmarnock and Aberdeen following the incidents at Dundee's Dens Park on 5 November.
McGhee will incur a ban for a third match if he again breaches Scottish FA disciplinary rule 203 this season.
Two further charges against McGhee were dropped at Thursday's hearing.
These were adopting "aggressive behaviour towards a match official; and/or" adopting "aggressive behaviour towards a steward".
Well lost the match in Dundee 2-0, with both goals coming after a controversial incident in the first half.
The visitors claimed the ball had crossed the line when Dundee goalkeeper David Mitchell collided with a post while clutching an over-hit Scott McDonald cross.
Prior to the outcome of McGhee's hearing, Motherwell player-assistant manager James McFadden was asked at the club's media conference about the possibility of the manager's absence from the dugout.
"It won't really change," said McFadden.
"The manager, contrary to belief, is quite reserved on the touchline and I'm the one that does all the shouting.
"I think the team will be set up the same way, the structures will be the same and it will just be a continuation of what's been happening anyway."
However, McFadden admitted McGhee's absence from the technical area could hinder his chance of playing.
The 33-year-old played for Motherwell's under-20s this week to maintain his fitness in case he is called upon.
"I hadn't been playing so I was just making sure I was ready if required, because we've got a lot of games coming up and in case we get any injuries," explained McFadden.
"But I need to be ready just in case because we are quite short on numbers and I want to still play. We'll just see how that goes."
