Lui, 26, has scored two tries in his six Super League appearances for the Red Devils this season after his move from NRL side North Queensland Cowboys.
"It's positive in that it's only a short time but he's someone who has played really well for us so far," boss Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester.
"We've got players who can come in now and take their opportunity."
