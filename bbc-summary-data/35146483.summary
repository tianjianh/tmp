Wales believe a friendly with Ukraine would be the perfect preparation for the Euro 2016 tie with Russia.

Discussions have taken place over the prospect of arranging a match in Kiev next March.
"We're hoping that will be one of the [friendly] games," said Wales assistant manager Osian Roberts.
"It's quite obvious to see the similarities with Russia so we're trying to mirror the games in the tournament with the preparation games."
The fixture has an obvious attraction for Ukraine too, given they will face Northern Ireland in Group C in France next summer.
Russia will be Wales' final Group B opponents in Euro 2016 on 20 June in Toulouse, following games against Slovakia (11 June) and England (16 June).
Wales' preparations for the finals began with a 3-2 loss to the Netherlands at Cardiff City Stadium in November.
There are two friendly dates designated in March, with a final warm-up match likely to be staged at the end of May, preferably at home.
Ukraine booked their place in the finals by beating Slovenia in the play-offs. They finished third in their group behind Spain and Slovakia.
"It's important that the friendly games are a useful exercise for us in preparation for the summer," added Roberts on BBC Radio Wales.
"Ukraine would be a perfect preparation game for us, no doubt about that."
Wales and Ukraine have met twice before in 2001, with both games ending 1-1 during the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign.
