[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle edged out bottom-of-the-table Cambridge United to go top of League Two thanks to a fifth consecutive win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Carey put Derek Adams' men on the road to victory, firing into the roof of the net from 12 yards after nine minutes following Ben Purrington's incisive run and perfect cutback from the by-line.
Plymouth surged further ahead on the hour when on-loan Reading winger Craig Tanner's cross from the right was tapped in at the far post by Jordan Slew - one of five changes to Adams' starting line-up.
Medy Elito cut into the box on the right and smashed a low shot past Luke McCormick to make it 2-1 after 79 minutes, but the hosts held on.
McCormick had done well to deny substitute Adam McGurk just after half-time and pulled off a spectacular save to tip over Joe Piggott's goal-bound header in the 49th minute.
First-half sub McGurk came within inches of scoring in the 42nd minute but powered his header just wide, while U's skipper Luke Berry's 25-yard free-kick was tipped onto the crossbar and over by McCormick.
