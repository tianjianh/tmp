[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Habte, 20, of Conybere Street in Highgate, attacked Samuel Simret in Summer Lane, Newtown, in August.
A post-mortem examination confirmed the 26-year-old died from a stab wound to the chest.
Habte was originally charged with murder but the charge was reduced to manslaughter.
Police said they tracked down Habte thanks to his distinctive "bun" hairstyle, which was seen by witnesses.
They said an argument between the two men had started in a coffee shop. Mr Simret left the scene but the pair later became involved in a fight in which Mr Simret was stabbed.
He died two days later in hospital.
Det Insp Paul Joyce said: "Habte and Samuel Simret had both come over to this country from Eritrea and were well-known to each other.
"It seems they became involved in a dispute and Habte decided to arm himself.
"This was a tragic case of a young man senselessly losing his life but we hope the result today sends out a message that knife crime will not be tolerated on the streets."
