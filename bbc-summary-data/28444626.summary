A woman who was once forced to use a wheelchair because of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or ME, has swum 26 miles from Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly.

Beth French, 36, who had the condition as a teenager, made the crossing in 17 hours, 28 minutes.
The massage therapist from Milverton, Somerset, is believed to be the first person to complete the swim in that direction.
Now she is planning a swim from Gibraltar to Morocco.
Ms French was struck with glandular fever at the age of 10 and diagnosed with ME at 17, when she was forced to use a wheelchair.
After swimming the English Channel in 2012, she went on to complete a 24-hour swim in the Molokai Channel in Hawaii in December 2012.
Speaking after her latest achievement, Ms French said: "I was determined to finish, there was no question of not achieving it.
"I was absolutely gobsmacked when I heard the time, I had expected to do it in 20 hours."
Ms French was observing English Channel rules during the swim, meaning she could not use flippers, a wetsuit or drysuit.
"There was an awful lot of jellyfish," she said. "They stung regularly but not badly. After a while, I managed to ignore them.
"There's not an inch of my body that hasn't been stung."
An estimated 250,000 people in the UK suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
