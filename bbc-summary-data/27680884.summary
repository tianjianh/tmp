'Trojan' schools publish Ofsted reports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three of the Birmingham schools inspected in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations have published the findings of their Ofsted reports.

They are rated "outstanding" or "good", although one urges governors to prepare students for "multicultural Britain".
Local Labour MP Liam Byrne has said that the failure to reveal the results has become a "complete shambles".
There have also been widespread claims that other schools have inspection reports calling for major intervention.
Mr Byrne has written to Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for the immediate publication of all the Ofsted reports, warning that it was unfair to delay giving schools and parents the official outcome of inspections.
The inspection of 21 schools in Birmingham was a response to claims of a takeover strategy by a hardline Muslim group.
"This investigation is now at risk of descending into a complete shambles. The school inspections were completed weeks ago, leaks to the media have multiplied, and quite frankly parents have got a right to know the truth," says Mr Byrne.
He warned that it was an unacceptable uncertainty for schools and families during the exam season - and when many families were thinking about taking up school places in the autumn.
Although there have been plans for all the inspection findings to be published together, this has been pre-empted by repeated reports that five or more of the schools have been found inadequate.
Individual schools, with positive outcomes, have also begun to publish their own report findings.
These include Ninestiles School which has a letter for parents on its website telling them that inspectors found the "quality of leadership and management is outstanding".
It quotes from a report saying a "culture of inclusion, equal opportunity and individual responsibility is at the core of this academy, which helps promote community cohesion".
Small Heath School has published the letter from Ofsted which also found the "quality of leadership and management is outstanding".
"A major strength of the school is that students value the differences between people of different beliefs, race and backgrounds," says the report.
The only criticism is for the local council which, it says, has "not done enough to help the school to share its good practice with other schools in the city".
Washwood Heath Academy has published its report, showing that the "quality of leadership and management is good".
It says that pupils at the school "know about risks related to religious extremism" and are taught to respect "the things that make people different such as sexual orientation".
But the report also calls for governors to "fully support the academy's priorities for raising attainment and preparing students for living in multicultural Britain".
All three of these Birmingham schools were told that their "safeguarding arrangements meet requirements".
There have been widespread claims that schools in the Park View Academy group could face more negative findings in Ofsted reports.
But a statement on the website of one of the schools - Golden Hillock - criticises "highly irresponsible" suggestions that "schools will close, creating unnecessary and unwarranted concern amongst families and students, many of whom are just about to start their GCSEs".
It says that the academy trust is entitled to a "confidential process of right of reply" and that the speculation overlooks that "just two years ago Park View was the first academy to be rated 'outstanding' in all categories under the new inspection regime".
