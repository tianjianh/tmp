[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 'closer' to East Stand development

A legal deal over a parcel of land at Sixfields Stadium has moved Northampton Town a "big step" closer to being able to restart work on the East Stand, the club has said.

The land had a lease owned by CDNL, set up to oversee the development of the League One club's ground.
However, CDNL was forced into liquidation in 2015.
The club says only now has a deal been reached with administrators and those owed money by the company.
This came after Cobblers chairman Kelvin Thomas and director David Bower bought CDNL.
A club statement said: "Now there are still some steps to take before we are able to start work again, as with any title and land issues it will still take time to regularise the position and agree the legal documentation.
"However, we are a lot closer than we were on Tuesday and we will try and push the legal teams to complete this work as quickly as possible."
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the club's former chairman David Cardoza saw off the latest attempt by Northampton Borough Council to recover public money lost in a failed loan made for the redevelopment of Sixfields in 2013.
A High Court judge has ruled Mr Cardoza does not have to return £180,000 he was paid by the club in 2015 without the case going to a full trial.
The council, which lost more than £10m in a loan scheme for a failed stadium redevelopment, says it will press ahead towards a trial.
