[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barcelona 4-0 Deportivo La Coruna

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lionel Messi marked his return from injury with a goal as La Liga champions Barcelona comfortably beat Deportivo La Coruna at the Nou Camp.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Argentina forward, back after three weeks out with a groin problem, scored his side's fourth seconds after coming off the bench.
Rafinha had put the hosts in control with a first-half brace, before Luis Suarez's clinical finish made it 3-0.
Deportivo's Laure was sent off for an elbow on Neymar in the second half.
Wins for Atletico Madrid, Real and Sevilla mean Barcelona remain fourth in the table.
Messi's display will be particularly pleasing for coach Luis Enrique before the visit of Manchester City in the Champions League next week.
That game will mark the return of former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, whose City side were held to a 1-1 draw by Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.
