The accident at Quintinshill in Dumfries and Galloway on 22 May 1915 remains the biggest loss of life in a train crash in the UK.
The Princess Royal and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon are scheduled to attend events in Gretna and Leith.
A service is also planned in Larbert to mark the centenary of the accident.
The disaster happened when train packed with troops travelling from Larbert in Stirlingshire collided with a local passenger service.
Almost at once, a Glasgow-bound express train smashed into the wreckage at the Quintinshill signal box, setting off a fire which engulfed the troop train, which was packed with nearly 500 members of the Leith Battalion of the Royal Scots.
More than 200 soldiers were killed, as well as 12 civilians, although some remains were never identified and the exact death toll is uncertain.
In addition to the deaths, there were 246 injuries.
The troops were on their way to Liverpool, where they were due to sail to the front line at Gallipoli.
The Princess Royal will attend an ecumenical service at Gretna along with Ms Sturgeon on Friday and will lay a wreath, with a second wreath being laid on behalf of the Royal Scots.
Dumfries and Galloway Council leader Ronnie Nicholson said: "As we commemorate the events in World War One, it's important that we take time to respectfully mark the centenary of this momentous event, which took place in our region.
"Our council is working with local communities and a range of appropriate organisations to deliver a fitting tribute."
The Princess Royal and the first minister will also attend a service at Rosebank Cemetery in Leith on Saturday.
Ahead of those events, there is a memorial service in Larbert on Thursday, when a procession involving the military, community groups and local schools will walk from the town's parish church to Larbert station for an evening service.
