[SN]TITLE[SN]
Commuting burglar sought after South East raids

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A smartly-dressed "commuting criminal" is being hunted by police investigating a string of burglaries in the South East.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police suspect Simon Knights, 38, may be using the rail network to move around committing burglaries before getting the train home.
Five police forces - Sussex, Hampshire, Kent, Essex and the Metropolitan Police - have been looking for him.
Surrey Police has joined the hunt after linking him to a burglary in Guildford.
Thousands of pounds worth of jewellery has been stolen in more than a dozen break-ins that police suspect Mr Knights is responsible for in Sussex, Hampshire, Kent, London and Essex.
Reward
It is thought he is stealing cash and jewellery to fund a gambling addiction, police said.
A Â£2,500 reward is being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of him for at least one of the offences.
Det Insp Dave Wardley-Wilkins, of Sussex Police, said: "People might see him on trains along the south coast, possibly smartly dressed. He has links to Essex so could have returned there.
"In the CCTV recorded in Surrey, he appears to have hurt his arm, possibly while he was breaking the window. We believe he then got a train to Wimbledon but do not know where he went from there."
Police said the he is white, about 5' 8" with ginger hair and blue eyes.
