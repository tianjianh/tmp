The visitors took a surprise lead in the second half when Joaquin Larrivey finished after Nolito's backheel.
Luis Enrique's Barcelona side hit the woodwork four times, with Lionel Messi and Neymar both being frustrated twice.
Luis Suarez, making his home debut, had two chances to score an equaliser but missed with a header and had an effort saved by goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez.
It means Suarez has lost in both of the competitive matches he has played for Barcelona since joining from Liverpool for Â£75m.
After serving a four-month suspension for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup, the Uruguayan striker made his first appearance for Barcelona in their 3-1 El Clasico defeat away at Real Madrid last Saturday.
Barcelona missed out on winning La Liga by three points last season and will hope this result does not prove crucial at the end of the campaign.
They had the majority of the chances and could have scored inside the opening 10 minutes but Neymar wasted a header and then hit the bar.
Barca's Lionel Messi, two goals away from becoming the all-time La Liga goalscorer, had three opportunities in the first half.
His first shot was punched away by Alvarez, he then rounded the goalkeeper but saw Jonny Castro deflect his shot onto the bar before the Argentine headed over from eight yards out soon after.
Larrivey put Celta Vigo ahead inside 10 minutes of the second half, one of only four shots on target they had in the whole match.
But Barcelona continued to be wasteful.
Neymar hit the bar, Suarez headed straight at Alvarez from 10 yards out and Messi clipped the upright from a free-kick as Celta Vigo held on to claim their first La Liga win at the Nou Camp.
