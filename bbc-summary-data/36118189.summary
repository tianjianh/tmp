[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 3-1 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster's relegation from League One was virtually sealed as bottom club Crewe came from behind to win for the first time in 16 games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a 30-minute delay at the start to drain a waterlogged pitch, Doncaster went ahead through Tommy Rowe's deflected 28th-minute strike.
But Crewe made it 1-1 at the break thanks to Callum Ainley's tap-in before Marcus Haber and Brad Inman struck.
Doncaster's inferior goal difference gives them no real chance of survival.
Rovers have one game left and are on -16. They are three points behind Fleetwood, who have two matches to play, and whose goal difference is -4.
