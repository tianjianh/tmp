The Yorkshire rider will be on board the BMW Motorrad S1000RR Superbike and Superstock for the major international road race meetings in 2016.
"We've been in negotiations for a couple of months, but I've always been serious about coming to the Tyco BMW team for next year," said Hutchinson.
"I'm really looking forward to getting going now with them in 2016."
Hutchinson replaces William Dunlop, who left the Tyco BMW team earlier this month after they "mutually agreed to pursue different options for 2016".
The 36-year-old clinched a hat-trick of wins on the Mountain Course at the Isle of Man TT this year.
"After pretty much four years away from the sport I now need a bit of consistency," added Hutchinson.
"BMW is a huge brand and along with Philip Neill at TAS, they have shown how much they want to be involved with me for next season.
"That enthusiasm sold it to me and with direct support from BMW Motorrad it was hard to turn them down."
Hutchinson is also scheduled to ride BMW Motorrad S1000RR machinery next season for Tyco BMW in the British Superstock 1000cc series.
Meanwhile, Fermanagh rider Lee Johnston will remain with the East Coast Racing team for 2016.
