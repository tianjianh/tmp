The royal spent three weeks in Malawi in July and August working on a major project to transfer 500 elephants more than 200 miles to a wildlife reserve.
He said elephants "cannot roam freely like they used to without coming into conflict with communities, or being threatened by poaching and persecution"
Wildlife is "increasingly susceptible" to growing human populations, he added.
Harry has released four photographs - which were all captioned by him personally - of his time in Malawi working with the 500 Elephants initiative, led by African Parks.
The animals were being moved 200 miles (322km) across the country from the Liwonde National Park and Majete Wildlife Reserve to Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, where it is hoped they will be able to thrive.
Harry said: "They need to be moved to another place and this is the most efficient and least invasive way of being able to do it.
"I can tell you after three weeks there is zero stress on these animals and they're going from one beautiful place to another beautiful place."
The photographs show Harry helping to "tip" a standing elephant onto its side after it was sedated, while he was also part of a group hanging on to a rope to prevent a male elephant running away after being darted.
The prince said Africa's wildlife will be "increasingly susceptible" to growing human populations.
"To allow the coexistence of people and animals, fences are increasingly having to be used to separate the two, and try to keep the peace," he added.
