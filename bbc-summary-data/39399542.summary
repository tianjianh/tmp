The world's best players including Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Jason Day and Henrik Stenson will be taking on the tricky Augusta course in a bid to win the coveted Green Jacket.
The key action on Saturday and Sunday will be shown live and uninterrupted on BBC Two, while there will be highlights of the first and second rounds.
There's also a documentary on last year's champion Danny Willett. It tells the extraordinary story of the Sheffield golfer who last year became the first Briton to win the Masters since 1996, after the early arrival of his baby Zachariah enabled him to take part after initially thinking he wouldn't be able to play.
In addition, online and Connected TV viewers have the option of up to four extra streams on Saturday and Sunday, showing live coverage of Amen Corner, holes 15 and 16, one featured group as well as the Masters own On the Range channel.
You can also listen to all four days on BBC Radio 5 live, while live text coverage on the BBC Sport website will also help you keep up to date, with easy access to video streams, radio commentaries and statistics just a click away.
There will also be the chance to catch up on the highlights, reaction and interviews online, via the Red Button or on selected Connected TVs.
