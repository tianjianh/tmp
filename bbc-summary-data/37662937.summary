Gregor Townsend praised his Glasgow Warriors players for their bonus-point win over Leicester Tigers but is demanding improvements for next week.

The Scots ran in five tries in an exciting 42-13 victory in the European Champions Cup opener at Scotstoun.
"It was a great result and a fantastic start to our campaign, to deny them a bonus point and score maximum points ourselves," said head coach Townsend.
"But we could have been much better. I am frustrated with a few things."
Glasgow are away to Munster next Saturday afternoon and before then, despite inflicting on Leicester their heaviest European points loss, the players can expect Townsend to point out where they could have improved.
"We didn't execute some of our set-piece plays very well," the head coach told BBC Scotland.
"I thought our forward pack were outstanding and we put them under so much pressure, but we could have had a lot more reward for it.
"With the pressure we had in the scrum, I am disappointed we didn't come away with a try, and it took a bit of inspiration from our backs to get the momentum back in our favour.
"I am listening to myself being critical when it is such a great start but there are a few things to improve for next week.
"We gave away too many penalties in the first half. But when we managed to get the ball, our forwards were carrying really well, with [scrum-half] Henry Pyrgos putting them into the right areas."
Townsend felt the performance did not match the heights of the 37-10 victory over Bath two years ago in the same competition.
However, he picked out one particular area that was to his satisfaction.
"I thought both half-backs played really well," he said.
"Finn [Russell] was outstanding, especially in the first half with some great kicking.
"He trained really well this week, is back full of confidence and both he and Henry realised where the space was.
"Some of Finn's passes, moving the ball wide when it was on, were excellent."
Russell was the subject of a tip tackle by Matt Toomua, for which the Australia centre was shown a yellow card.
"It was a dangerous tackle," was Townsend's assessment.
"By the law, because he didn't land on his head, it wasn't a red card, but the only reason he didn't land on his head was because Finn put his arm out.
"It could have been a red, but it didn't affect the outcome. Finn got straight up and that was great to see."
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill felt his team lost their way after a promising first 15 minutes.
"We started well against a stiff breeze, controlled the game well, our tactics were good, even with Matt Toomua in the bin," he said.
"Then we made silly errors and invited Glasgow into the game. We couldn't cope when they had quick ball and quick recycle."
