England will rest wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for the last three games of their five-match one-day series against Australia.

They have called up fellow keeper Jonny Bairstow, 25, as his replacement.
Lancashire's Buttler, 24, made four and nought as Australia won the first two ODIs.
"It has become clear in the last couple of days that Jos will benefit from a break from cricket ahead of the winter tours," said coach Trevor Bayliss.
"While we initially felt Jos would have enough left in the tank, rest is key and Jos has had a heavy workload throughout 2015."
The third ODI will take place at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
Bairstow made 34 off 40 balls on Sunday as Yorkshire lost to Gloucestershire in the One-Day Cup semi-final.
He will miss Yorkshire's trip to Lord's this week as they look to beat Middlesex and secure the County Championship title for the second successive season.
