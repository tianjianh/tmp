[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old ex-Newcastle man failed to make a league start or score a goal for the Cobblers in his previous spell at the club in the 2013-14 season.
Hooper is reunited with boss Rob Page at Sixfields, for whom he scored five goals in 30 games at Vale last season.
"Did I get the best out of him? I'd like to think so and hope I can again," Page told BBC Radio Northampton.
"He is a big physical lad, he was at Northampton before and he has matured a hell of a lot since then.
"He has experience and league goals now under his belt and grown in confidence because of that, and that will hold him in good stead hopefully in his second spell at Northampton Town."
