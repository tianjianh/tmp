The Scot takes on the role for the second successive Games after leading the team at Sochi 2014.
Former curling coach Hay guided Rhona Martin's rink to Winter Olympic gold at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.
"Success four years ago gave the nation cause to be proud of our winter Olympians and helped put winter sport at the forefront," Hay said.
Britain secured gold, silver and two bronze medals in Sochi, equalling their total from their most successful Games in 1924.
