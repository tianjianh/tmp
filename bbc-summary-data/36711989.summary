James Newman started work on the "Megaprocessor", which is 33ft (10m) wide and 6ft (2m) high, in 2012.
It does the job of a chip-sized microprocessor and Mr Newman has spent Â£40,000 ($53,000) creating it.
It contains 40,000 transistors, 10,000 LED lights and it weighs around half a tonne (500kg). So far, he has used it to play the classic video game Tetris.
In a video demonstration he admits the game isn't easy to play.
Mr Newman, a digital electronics engineer, started the project because he was learning about transistors and wanted to visualise how a microprocessor worked. The components all light up as the huge device carries out a task.
"The machine on your desk may be a million times better than what I have built - but mine is much prettier," he told the BBC.
"Mine has 10,000 times more LEDs."
Mr Newman hopes the Megaprocessor will be used as an educational tool and is planning a series of open days at his home over the summer.
"I doubt I'll be able to sell it," he said.
"My dream is that it goes to a museum or educational institute so that people can learn from it."
