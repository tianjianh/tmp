Six Nations: Exeter's Campagnaro joins Italy's absentees

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italy have suffered another blow before facing Wales with centre Michele Campagnaro out injured.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter's Campagnaro has started all Italy's 2016 Six Nations games and scored two tries on their 2014 visit to Cardiff.
Twice-capped Zebre centre Giulio Bisegni, 23, has been called up.
Italy earlier lost Edoardo Padovani, Lorenzo Cittadini and George Biagi through injuries suffered in defeat by Ireland.
It means the Azzurri must make at least four changes with fly-half Padovani, prop Cittadini and lock Biagi joining Campagnaro on the sidelines.
Racing92 prop Martin Castrogiovanni, 34, has been recalled to the 28-man squad following suspension.
Perpignan fly-half Tommy Allen is also called up alongside uncapped pair Jacopo Sarto and Tommaso Castello.
Italy will be playing their final Six Nations game under coach Jacques Brunel, with Harlequins boss and former Ireland full-back Conor O'Shea expected to take over.
The Azzurri are winless in 2016 while Wales are hoping to finish second behind champions England, having lost in this year's tournament for the first time on Saturday.
