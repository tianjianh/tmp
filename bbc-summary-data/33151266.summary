Artwork honouring archbishop 'should remain despite indecency claims'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-newspaper editor has said work a former archbishop did in South Africa "outweighs" any allegations of gross indecency against the cleric.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steve Lowe, who led a campaign to bring a bust of Trevor Huddleston to Bedford in 1999, said the anti-apartheid activist was not a "serial offender".
The late archbishop, who admitted patting boys' bare bottoms, was honoured with a blue plaque on Monday.
Archbishop Huddleston was investigated by police while the Bishop of Stepney.
The decision to put the plaque up was criticised by Peter Saunders, from the National Association for People Abused in Childhood.
Mr Saunders said the police report could be "the tip of a nasty iceberg".
'Bare skin'
In the Scotland Yard report, made in 1974 and viewed by the BBC two years ago, officers suggested charging him with four counts of gross indecency.
In each case it was alleged he "pulled a boy on to his lap, put his hand underneath his trousers and pants, and fondled his bottom and bare skin".
The case was dropped when the Director of Public Prosecutions said there was insufficient evidence.
As secretary of the Bedford Anti-Apartheid Group and editor of Bedfordshire on Sunday, Mr Lowe campaigned for the bust of Archbishop Huddleston to be constructed in Bedford.
He said "it is still appropriate" for the bust and plaque to be displayed because of the archbishop's "monumental work" in South Africa.
How Archbishop Huddleston's bust came to Bedford:
"He has not been accused of abuse, either sexual or physical, and was never charged," said Mr Lowe.
"These crimes, if they were crimes, were at a time when young boys sitting on adult men's laps was not unheard of."
Mr Lowe added: "It is not like Jimmy Savile, nothing approaching that.
"It was wrong, no doubt about it. As a parent, I would be very angry, but the work he did in South Africa outweighs this particular crime, were it even a crime.
"There are not many great men around who haven't done one or two things they might not be proud of."
