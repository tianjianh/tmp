The 29-year-old world number 204 began two shots behind leader Adam Hadwin of Canada, but birdied three of the last four holes to finish on 20 under par.
Hadwin was one clear of the field after Saturday's round of 59, only the fourth on the PGA Tour on a par 72 course.
He followed it with four birdies and two bogeys in a 70 to finish runner-up.
Scotland's Martin Laird was the highest-placed European, tied for ninth place on 14 under.
