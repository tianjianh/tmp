The number of mycologists has declined by 70% over the past 20 years, with less than 12 remaining.
As a result, Plantlife Cymru are launching a three-year project to try and engage people across Wales in fungi conservation.
Wales is one of the richest countries in the world for fungi, with 112 species, many of which are in decline.
Wild fungi, such as mushrooms and toadstools, are spore-producing organisms that feed on organic matter and are found throughout the UK.
Plantlife Cymru said the shortage in experts means some species could disappear without anyone knowing.
School children, land owners, local communities and budding new experts could become 'Waxcap Fungi Apprentices', going on to study and conserve threatened species and their habitats.
Anita Daimond, from Plantlife Cymru, said: "We will be working with schools, communities, conservation partners and land owners across Wales to breathe new life into what has become an almost forgotten field of science.
"Welsh grasslands are home to some extraordinarily beautiful fungi.
"The current shortage of fungi experts meant their future looked bleak but we are confident that this new project will help by finding and training the next generation of fungi fanatics."
