Kieran Dorian knew the women from his school days in Dundee and became obsessed with them individually over the course of four years.
In a separate incident, he spat blood at the officer's feet after making sexually offensive remarks towards her.
Dorian, 20, will be sentenced in January.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told he went to one woman's door at 03:00 and stayed there until 07:00 before insisting he walk her to work.
Dorian later put a "rambling, nonsensical" love letter through the woman's door on Christmas Eve.
The court heard he sent another woman a video of himself scrolling through her Twitter feed.
Referring to the police assault, depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson said the officer was working on the Safezone bus parked near Dundee's nightclubs.
Dorian approached the bus with a head wound before jumping up and down and swearing at staff.
Miss Robertson said: "He made offensive remarks to the officer and made sexual comments to her.
"He then threatened to rape her.
"The accused then gathered up spit and blood in his mouth and spat it at the officer's feet.
"He later made further sexual remarks, including about the officer's mother."
Dorian, of Broughty Ferry, Dundee, admitted four stalking charges committed between October 2011 and May 2015.
He also admitted charges of assault and behaving in a threatening and abusive manner.
Dorian also admitted making lewd sexual comments to two 13-year-olds in the queue at a McDonald's restaurant in Dundee on 30 July before sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl on the same date.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael deferred sentence until January for Dorian to engage with social workers and released him on bail.
He said: "The way you behaved puts you in the territory for a custodial sentence.
"The question is if other options are available or not.
"The way you behave over this next six weeks will influence my final decision."
