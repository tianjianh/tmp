A brass-bound "magic" lantern and more than 100 photographic slides, that were bought from a rag-and-bone man had been valued at between Â£800 and Â£1,200.
The lot sold at Newcastle's Anderson and Garland auction house for Â£6,200.
Scott's 1910-1913 voyage was the first polar trip to be visually recorded. The photographer returned home early but every other team member died.
Seller Michael Wilson said it was "just stuff I've hoarded over the years".
Mr Wilson inherited the pieces from his father, who bought them for half a crown - equivalent to 22.5p.
"It was just like another toy but it was educational as well," he said. "It was interesting so it was always kept over the years.
"I think when you're a hoarder, you just can't help yourself.
"I've told myself I'm not going to buy anything else until I've cleared out everything that needs to go."
Scott wrote in his journal at the time that he would have "cinematograph and photographic record that will be absolutely new in expeditionary work".
The slides' original negatives were shot by travel photographer Herbert Ponting.
Ponting returned from the expedition early in 1912, while the remaining team ran out of food and perished.
A spokeswoman for Anderson and Garland said the sale went "very well".
She said the lot attracted wide interest, with a UK buyer putting in the winning bid.
Fragments of a coffin and robe purported to belong to St Cuthbert, which were also due to be auctioned during the three-day fine arts sale, were withdrawn.
Anderson and Garland would only say the estate's executors had removed the item.
