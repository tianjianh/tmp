Tracey Woodford death trial: Killer 'cold blooded'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-butcher was "determined and cold blooded" when killing and dismembering a woman, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Nigel May, 50, denies murder at Cardiff Crown Court.
Tracey Woodford, 47, was discovered at his flat in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, in April.
In his closing speech, prosecution barrister Roger Thomas QC said Mr May had repeatedly lied throughout the case, adding: "It's impossible to believe barely a word he says."
Mr Thomas told the jury Mr May was able to "carry on oblivious" and was "totally unmoved by the smell and the scene in his flat for a period of three-and-a-half days".
He said he did not believe Ms Woodford had agreed to sexual contact with Mr May, adding: "We submit that fragile woman did tell him where to go and it cost her her life."
Accusing Mr May of lying, he said: "The suggestion he was acting at any time in self-defence is nonsense.
"He claims self defence but he can't remember what he did. He could have restrained her and pushed her away, but not kill her."
The jury was told Mr May's second defence of loss of control was "a manufactured defence".
Mr Thomas also said that during the murder "sorrow and remorse are noticeably absent [but] sexual desire and anger are noticeably present".
"One thing that is certain is that she didn't go to his flat for sex."
Reminding the jury of the medical evidence of how Ms Woodford had been strangled, Mr Thomas said he showed "cold blooded resolve".
Mr May failed to call an ambulance and see if she could be revived, he added, but instead "he sits down, has a fag and decides to chop her up".
In defence barrister Malcom Bishop QC's closing speech he reminded the jury that Mr May accepts he killed Tracey Woodford.
He said he acted in "self defence" but added if the jury rejected that they should consider that he "lost control".
"It can be explained by blind panic. It was a crazy plan to conceal a body by dismembering - remembering his early days as a butcher. It is crazy," he told the jury.
The trial continues.
