Scott Cameron, 28, from Corby Hill in Carlisle, was found dead at the scene.
His white Mini left the road and came to rest at the bottom of an embankment about one mile south of Skippers Bridge.
It happened some time between 02:00 and 07:30 on Saturday.  Police are still working to establish the exact cause and time of the crash.
An appeal is being made for anyone who may have spotted the victim's car on the road prior to the accident.
Police are particularly keen to trace a man seen walking on the A7 near to the crash scene at about 07:00.
He is described as being about 35 years of age and was wearing a green anorak and green wellington boots.
He may also have been carrying a backpack.
PC Callum Kingstree said: "We would like to trace this man in case he may have any information which would help us piece together the circumstances surrounding this crash."
