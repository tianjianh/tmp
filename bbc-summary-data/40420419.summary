John Leech was already a successful artist when he drew the miser Ebenezer Scrooge in 1843.
Unseen sketches by Leech found by chance in a friend's Latin textbook, from when he was at Charterhouse School in Surrey, have now been found.
They are on show at the University of Leicester along with his other work.
Margaret Maclean, from the university's special collections department, said the illustrations were found by accident in late 2016.
"I was looking at books for another exhibition and found this one full of drawings and doodles," she said.
"It was obvious these were way beyond the normal schoolboy standard, so we looked into who might have made them."
The book in fact belonged to a friend of Leech - thought to have been George Berney.

Ms McLean added: "We know John Leech did not like his Latin and Greek classes so you can imagine him grabbing his friend's book and scribbling away.
"Even those done in 30 seconds while the teacher droned away show a vitality, an eye for character, which came through in his later work."
The sketches were believed to have been done by Leech based on comparisons with one of his textbooks, which is full of sketches.
"You can clearly see they are by the same hand - the style, the subject and feeling behind them is so similar," Ms Maclean said.
Dickens described Leech as "the very first Englishman who had made beauty a part of his art."
When Dickens' first illustrator killed himself, Leech was considered as a replacement but, while he was not selected, he was used for the author's Christmas books and they became lifelong friends.
The display will run until 31 July in the David Wilson Library.
