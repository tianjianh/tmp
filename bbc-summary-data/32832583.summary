It was addressed to "Marconi Operator, RMS Titanic" and stamped on 11 April 1912 - the day after the ill-fated ship set sail from Southampton.
What the parcel originally contained is unknown, but according to the valuer it missed the ship by a "few hours".
Auctioneer John Nicholson is to start bidding at £500, but "hasn't got a clue" how much it is worth.
He hopes it will be of interest to Titanic enthusiasts.
The lot has been described as an "important piece of maritime history and of Titanic interest".
It also includes photographs of a Marconi telegraph operator, Alec Bagot, and the telegraph equipment aboard Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.
Valuer Gordon Patrick said it was given to the vendor's mother, who lived in Southampton and died in 1972.
He said: "It was given to her by the first officer of the Olympic, the Titanic's sister ship, who was a friend of hers.
"We don't know what was in the parcel, but they think it missed the ship by a couple of hours."
He believes a collector will snap up the memorabilia. He said: "It's quite exciting - there's real Titanic mania."
The Titanic sank on the fifth day of its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.
Titanic memorabilia continues to be popular. Last year the last letter to be written on the vessel sold for £119,000 at auction.
Previously a menu from the day of the disaster was sold for £76,000, while a violin played as the ship sank went for £900,000.
The sale will take place on Saturday 30 May at the John Nicholson auction rooms in Fernhurst, West Sussex.
