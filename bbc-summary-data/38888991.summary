[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 3-4 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City fought back from 2-0 down to claim a stunning win at Derby County, damaging the Rams' Championship play-off hopes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were 2-0 up after just 17 minutes thanks to goals from Julien de Sart and Darren Bent.
Kadeem Harris scored either side of half-time to bring the visitors level, and Craig Noone put them ahead with a fine curling effort.
Bent's header made it 3-3 but Ralls' injury-time penalty won it for Cardiff.
Victory lifts Neil Warnock's side up to 12th in the Championship table, just one place and five points behind Derby, who fall to 11th and are now eight points adrift of the top six.
Steve McClaren's men had recovered from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at home to Bristol City on Saturday, but on this occasion it was the Rams who were on the receiving end of a dramatic turnaround.
Derby looked in total control when De Sart struck on the rebound and Bent converted from Tom Ince's pass to put the home side 2-0 up.
But four minutes before the interval, Harris gave Cardiff hope when his deflected strike looped over Scott Carson in the home goal.
Harris then scored less than two minutes after the restart as he pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.
Cardiff led for the first time when Noone skilfully found the top corner from the edge of the box, but Bent appeared to have salvaged a point for Derby when he rose higher than Sean Morrison to head in.
However, there was a final twist in added time as Bluebirds substitute Rhys Healey was tripped by Alex Pearce, allowing Ralls to calmly stroke his penalty into the bottom corner.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:
"You score three goals at home and you expect to win but we haven't done that in the last two games. Why? Because we conceded seven goals.
"We've gone from a team who were hard to beat and defended very, very well to conceding seven in two games and you don't collect points doing that.
"This is the first defeat at home since September so let's not panic and over-react and say the wheels have come off, but we have to work hard on the training field."
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock:
"That's what you call old-fashioned football, end-to-end stuff and that's why I love the game. It was great to be involved in one like that, especially coming out on the right side.
"It gives me a lot of pride when I see us come to a place like this and stand up and be counted, and that's why I love the Championship more than any other league because you get genuine lads in this level.
"The goal before half-time helped us enormously. We talked about not thinking about drawing the game but trying to win it. I think we can go anywhere and give people a good game now. The biggest problem we've got is ourselves."
