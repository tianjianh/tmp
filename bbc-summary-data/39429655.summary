A police force has begun the rollout of body cameras for 800 officers and community support officers.

Dyfed-Powys Police said training would begin on Wednesday ahead of them being deployed on the streets.
Cameras are always on but only record once the officer presses a button.
Police and crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: "The use of the cameras supports transparency in policing and will aid the investigation of complaints against officers."
The move follows a three-month trial in 2015 and any member of the public has the right to request footage taken of them within 31 days.
Any recordings not needed for policing purposes are automatically deleted from cloud storage after that time.
The force said recordings would only be made if there was "a policing need" and officers would announce when they start and stop filming.
Cameras will always be on standby, filming on a 30-second loop, but audio does not record until the officer presses the button.
Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "They will provide the public with more reassurance and will help officers to document valuable evidence - leading to swifter justice for victims."
