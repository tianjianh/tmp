Central First School in Ashington has also converted store rooms and even a toilet in an effort to accommodate pupils.
The school's actions come as the Local Government Association said it feared the demand for school places could soon reach a tipping point with no more space or money to extend schools.
Principal David Geoffrey told Look North's Peter Harris the school had to be "ever more inventive" to teach youngsters in "full to the brim" conditions.
