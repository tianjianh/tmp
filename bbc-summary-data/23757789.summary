The winning ticket was selected in the Lotto draw on 29 June, said National Lottery operator Camelot.
The firm said it was delighted the winner from Rhondda Cynon Taf had come forward.
"It would have been awful if the ticket holder had missed out on this substantial and life-changing amount of money," said a spokesperson.
"We would like to remind all National Lottery players to check their tickets every time they play."
The company said unless the winner wants publicity no further information will be released.
Earlier this month another winner in Rhondda Cynon Taf came forward to claim a £1m prize in the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw.
