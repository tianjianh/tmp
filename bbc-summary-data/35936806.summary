Grant Gilchrist has agreed a deal to remain at Edinburgh for next season.

The 25-year-old Scotland lock is currently recovering from a broken arm sustained in his only club appearance this term.
"The last couple of years have been a frustration for me but I'm looking forward to being fully fit for pre-season," said Gilchrist.
"I'm really hungry to play for Edinburgh again and looking forward to giving my all."
Gilchrist fractured an arm bone playing for Edinburgh in October 2014, just days after being named Scotland captain for the autumn Test series.
He recovered in time to feature at last year's World Cup but picked up a groin injury in his second game of the tournament.
Returning for Edinburgh for the first time in 16 months in February, Gilchrist suffered his second broken arm as a second-half replacement in a Pro12 loss to Ospreys.
"I'm delighted to be staying and really excited about next season," he added.
"This is the club I have grown up with. I came through the academy here and I've now been part of the first team for over five years.
"I care a lot about the club and I really believe we've got the players and the culture at the club to have prolonged success."
