[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old, who has won 103 caps, will play for a team managed by former Manchester United and England winger Steve Coppell.
Former Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Fulham central defender Hughes has been without a club since being released by Melbourne City in April.
Hughes played in three of NI's four games at Euro 2016 in France.
The veteran international was reported to be considering a contract offer from League One side Oldham Athletic earlier this month.
Hughes will have former QPR winger Antonio German and one-time Barcelona youngster Josu among his team-mates at the Blasters.
He will have to wait for his first taste of action for his new club as the Indian Super League does not start until October.
