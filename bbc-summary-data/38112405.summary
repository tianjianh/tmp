[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana squad sizes cut for 2017

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teams in cycling's three Grand Tours will be reduced from nine riders to eight from the start of 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana will be affected while other major races will also feature one less rider per team.
It is hoped the move will improve rider safety and increase competition by making it more difficult for teams to control a race.
The number of teams will stay the same however, race organisers announced.
