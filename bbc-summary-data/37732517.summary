[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leswalt wind farm refusal overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish government reporter has overturned a council's refusal of plans for an eight-turbine wind farm in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brookfield Renewable UK can now proceed with the plans at Larbrax, near Leswalt, subject to certain conditions.
Dumfries and Galloway Council rejected the scheme in August last year.
However, the company appealed and the Scottish government has now ruled the project can go ahead.
A reporter concluded that the locations where adverse landscape or visual effects would be experienced were "limited".
"The benefits of the proposal, particularly the contribution it would make to renewable energy targets, are significant," he added.
"The proposal can also draw considerable support from national planning, energy and climate change policies.
"I conclude, on balance, that these benefits outweigh the harm the proposal would cause and the consequent conflict with the development plan."
He attached a total of 33 conditions to the approval.
