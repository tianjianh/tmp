The visitors hit the post early on through Jordan Chapell's shot and then opened the scoring when Danny O'Brien latched on to Ryan Lloyd's cross.
Ryan Astles doubled the lead from John Rooney's cross but Ross Hannah missed a penalty after a foul on Chapell.
Hannah made up for his miss and gifted Chester their third with a close-range finish following Sam Hughes' set-up.
The visitors moved up to 16th place in the table while Altrincham lie just three points above 21st-placed Halifax, who also have a game in hand.
