County Championship: Trescothick and Trego hundreds boost Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marcus Trescothick and Peter Trego both made centuries to drag Somerset back into contention with Middlesex on day three of the County Championship match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Division One leaders Middlesex, who were bowled out for 381 at Taunton to lead by 145, looked in charge when they reduced Somerset to 59-3 and 126-4.
But Trescothick, who made 124, and Trego, still there on 115, shared 181 to leave the contest in the balance.
Somerset closed on 348-6, an advantage of 203 runs.
On a surface that has become easier for batting as the game has progressed, the outcome seems likely to rest on the length of time Trego spends at the crease on the final day.
Somerset would perhaps want to post a target in excess of 250, while anything less would probably leave Middlesex as favourites.
That the home side, who at one stage looked set to be defeated inside three days, are still in with a shout is down entirely to Trescothick and Trego.
Opener Trescothick had seen Johann Myburgh bowled offering no shot to Harry Podmore and captain Chris Rogers shovel the same bowler to point for a duck.
After James Hildreth was caught at slip from the off-spin of Ollie Rayner, Trescothick found some support from James Allenby, but when he mistimed a pull to mid-on, Somerset were still 19 behind.
But Trescothick, playing characteristically powerful cover drives, and Trego, who capitalised as the Middlesex bowlers often dropped short, compiled their huge fifth-wicket stand to drag the hosts back into it.
Trescothick's 48th Somerset hundred took him past Sir Viv Richards to second on the all-time list, while Trego completed his 14th first-class ton.
Only when James Harris found some late energy did he have both Trescothick and Craig Overton caught behind, leaving Alex Barrow to accompany Trego to the close.
Harris was earlier the last Middlesex wicket to fall, caught at slip off Tim Groenewald for 78, missing a maiden first-class hundred, just like James Fuller, who fell to the same combination for 93.
