It is a tribute to the 16 children and two teachers who were on their way home from an exchange trip when their flight crashed into the French Alps killing everyone on board.
Germany is holding a state memorial service in Cologne Cathedral on Friday for the 150 people killed in the Germanwings disaster on 24 March.
Around 100 people will travel to the service from Haltern.
The temporary memorial dominates the playground in the spring sunshine.
It was, in the words of the town's mayor, Haltern's darkest day.
"The initial shock was huge," Bodo Klimpel tells me. "No-one wanted to believe it."
It is three weeks since the crash and we are talking in his office in the town hall. He looks exhausted.
"We're trying to achieve a certain level of normality again but it's very difficult," Mr Klimpel said.
"This is a town of 38,000 people. The students who died had lots of friends and big families.
"Everyone here knows one of the victims or their relatives. So it's particularly hard for all of us to accept this reality."
A large number of psychologists and counsellors were working with students in the school, he said.
And there's also support available for parents, who've had to cope with the revelation that the plane appears to have been deliberately crashed by its co-pilot Andreas Lubitz.
Lubitz is believed to have locked his senior colleague out of the cockpit, put the plane into a descent, then accelerated.
What happened in the last 30 minutes of Flight 4U 9525?
Who was Andreas Lubitz?
'It's indescribably difficult for the relatives, who of course initially thought their loved ones were the victims of a terrible accident, so when they learned the co-pilot had planned this it just added to their pain," Mr Klimpel explains.
"Now these families are desperately trying to get their children back but we can't get hold of the bodies because they're still in the process of identifying them. It's a terrible situation for the parents."
An estimated 1,400 people will attend Friday's state memorial service in Cologne Cathedral.
Five hundred relatives of the victims will be in the congregation alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck.
"I believe the service is very important," says the mayor. "I hope very much the relatives can find comfort and support in this. It's important for them to know the whole world shares their grief."
'We will not be able to forget this catastrophe and we don't want to. We don't ever want to forget the 16 students and two teachers. We have to learn to live with the tragedy but we won't ever forget it."
After the interview I walk past the school. The sun is shining and birds are singing. The students are back after their Easter break and some of them are sitting exams.
Next week they plan to plant 18 trees in Haltern.
One for every life lost.
