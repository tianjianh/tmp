Ian Bear and Ryan Lawrence, both from Airdrie, were also given five-year football banning orders.
The incident happened during disorder at Forfar Athletic's tie with Airdrieonians in April last year.
Bear, 36, and Lawrence, 19, both pleaded guilty midway through their trial to a breach of the peace.
They admitted running on the field of play, shouting, swearing, using foul language and struggling with Mr Douglas at Station Park, Forfar, on 11 April, 2015.
An allegation that the crime was motivated by sectarianism was removed from the charges.
Mr Douglas told Forfar Sheriff Court that he received sectarian abuse from supporters in the crowd and was spat on as he took a goal kick towards the end of the game.
Mr Douglas said: "The final whistle had just went and I heard our left back, Iain Campbell, shouting at me and I turned round.
"The first man was about two feet away from me.
"I tried to protect myself at first and we made contact with each other at the same point.
"He punched me in the head and I punched him.
"The second fan approached and we made contact as well."
"I've played 650 games in my career and it's only the second time anything like that has happened to me."
