North Pennine archaeology project gets £295,000 grant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An archaeology project in the north of England has received funding to expand a volunteer programme for a further three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money, £295,000, has been awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to the North Pennines area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) Partnership.
The Altogether Archaeology pilot project was launched two years ago.
It aims to improve the understanding of the way people have lived in the North Pennines over the past 10,000 years.
The pilot phase involved excavation work at the 13th century Muggleswick Grange in County Durham, and Westgate Castle, the former Bishop of Durham's medieval hunting lodge.
The volunteers also took part in an excavation of a prehistoric rock art site near Hallbankgate, and a Bronze Age cemetery on Appleby Golf Course in Cumbria.
The North Pennines AONB Partnership is an alliance of 25 public, statutory and voluntary sector bodies with an interest in the future of the area.
