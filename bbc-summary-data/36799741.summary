[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Quinn took his tally of wickets in the match to 11 as Essex seized control against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were bowled out for 290 and Division Two leaders Essex, set 213 to win, ended day three on 16-1.
Gloucestershire's deficit of 78 was wiped out as openers Gareth Roderick (102) and Chris Dent (72) put on 148.
When Roderick was trapped lbw, that started a collapse of eight wickets for 62 runs, with Quinn (4-87) and Graham Napier (4-62) leading Essex's charge.
Essex, who lost Jaik Mickleburgh for one in the seven overs of their run chase that were possible before the close, will open up a 23-point lead at the top of Division Two if they complete victory on Saturday.
