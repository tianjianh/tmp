Hundreds of people have joined in a minute's silence one year after a vintage jet crashed at Shoreham air show, killing 11 men.

Families and friends of the victims were among those who gathered on Shoreham Toll Bridge at 13:22 BST.
It marked the moment the Hawker Hunter jet crashed nearby, on the A27 in West Sussex.
Sussex Chief Constable Giles York joined the families on the bridge.
Live updates on Shoreham air disaster anniversary
Mr York said police remained committed to "finding answers as to how and why this dreadful thing happened".
"The tragedy of the Shoreham air crash still has significant impact for the families who lost loved ones, as well as their friends and across many communities in Sussex," he said.
The Rev Canon Ann Waizeneker read out the names of those who died ahead of the silence.
Civic leaders and members of the emergency services then laid flowers on the bridge, which became the focus of the community's grief in the weeks following the disaster.
Balloons and 11 white doves were also released in memory of the victims.
The father of Jacob Schilt, who died with his friend Matt Grimstone as they were on their way to play in a Worthing United football game, said the anniversary was difficult, but in a good way.
"It is very important to mark this occasion for our family and friends and Jacob's friends," Bob Schilt said.
"The community have given so much to us and to the other families and it is very important that we are able to mark the occasion with them as a sort of token of thanks."
The skies above Shoreham's Brighton City Airport, which staged the air show, also fell silent for one hour as a mark of respect.
The aerodrome was closed for all aviation activities between 13:00 BST and 14:00.
Flags are also being flown at half-mast at civic buildings in West Sussex to mark the anniversary.
It follows a service of remembrance on Saturday at St Mary de Haura church.
Pilot of the Hawker Hunter Andy Hill, 52, is at the centre of a manslaughter investigation.
He has been questioned under caution but not arrested.
Sussex Police is awaiting a ruling from the High Court over whether it can have access to Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) material relating to the crash as part of their inquiries.
The final AAIB report is not expected to be published before the autumn.
West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said a full inquest into the deaths, due to take place in March 2017, is likely to be delayed by the High Court action.
"Everything depends on the High Court hearing due in October - that has to come first," she said.
"Sussex Police then need their experts to look at any evidence that emerges and the CPS need to make a decision on whether any prosecution is appropriate."
The owners of the Hawker Hunter, Canfield Hunter Ltd, have admitted responsibility for the crash and settled two compensation claims from victims' families.
