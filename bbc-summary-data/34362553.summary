Wrexham scout leader admits indecent images of children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scout leader who admitted making and possessing more than 87,000 indecent images of children along with nearly 1,500 videos, has been told to expect a prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mold Crown Court heard some of the images Ben McCarthy, 40, from Wrexham, had were in the most serious category.
He admitted six making indecent images charges and seven possession charges between February 2014 and January 2015.
McCarthy also admitted two counts of voyeurism dating back to 2011.
Judge Rhys Rowlands remanded him in custody to be sentenced in November.
"Don't hold out any hopes of a non-custodial sentence for this sort of behaviour," the judge told him.
