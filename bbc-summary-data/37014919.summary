Dempsey, silver medallist in 2012, won the first two of Monday's three races, before finishing second in the third.
It means the 35-year-old takes a five-point lead over Dutchman Dorian van Rijsselberghe, the defending champion, in the 12-race opening series.
Meanwhile, GB's Nick Thompson, Bryony Shaw and Alison Young are 11th, 10th and 13th in their respective events.
In the sailing events, all classes race either 10 or 12-fleet races with each boat receiving points equal to their finishing position.
At the end of the fleet races the 10 boats with the lowest points totals compete in a medal race where points are doubled for each position at the finish.
In the men's Laser, Nick Thompson finished eighth and 17th to score 25 points from Monday's opening two races.
Thompson, the men's double Laser world champion, is 19 points behind overnight leader Tonci Stipanovic of Croatia in the 10-race opening series.
Elsewhere, Bryony Shaw is in contention in the women's RS:X windsurfing after placing 10th overall after three races.
Shaw finished seventh, 20th and ninth to score 36 points. She is 32 points behind leader Charline Picon of France in the 12-race event, but only 18 points outside the medals.
Britain were also represented in the women's Laser Radial, with Alison Young taking race positions of 13th and 18th to go 13th overnight.
China's Xu Lijia leads the 10-race Laser Radial with seven points.
