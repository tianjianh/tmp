Hereford FC was due to play a fifth round FA Vase game at Hartley Wintney in Hampshire but it was called off.
The Hereford club tweeted in search of a good cause to give the surplus food to: "We've got pasta and rolls that were prepared for players food today.
"Does anyone know of any charities that can make use today or tomorrow?
"We'd hate the food to be thrown out, it can't be frozen and needs to be used by Monday."
Hartley Wintney FC shared players' disappointment that the match had been called off.
But it remained in high spirits by joking: "Contrary to popular reports; the ref arrived fully sober this morning!"
A statement on Hereford FC's website said: "Subject to FA approval, today's postponed FA Vase game against Hartley Wintney will be rescheduled for Saturday 6 February.
"As such, our scheduled Midland Football League Premier home game against Walsall Wood is likely to be postponed.
"We will confirm the above once we have confirmation from the FA."
Camberley Town FC in nearby Surrey invited fans of both teams to watch its home match against County Durham team Newton Aycliffe.
Southport's National League game against Boreham Wood was also postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.
Saturday's National League game between Altrincham and Dover Athletic at the J Davidson Stadium was called off for the same reason.
