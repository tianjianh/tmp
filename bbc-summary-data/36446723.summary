Drug crime in the Isle of Man has risen by 30% over the past year, according Manx constabulary figures.

The annual crime performance statistics for 2015/16, which will go to Tynwald in July, show a total of 257 offences compared with 198 the previous year.
A police spokesman said most "were for low level possession, not supply".
There were about 2,000 crimes recorded during the year - the lowest since the 1970s. Chief Constable Gary Roberts said low crime levels were "good news".
Figures show there was a 53% fall in burglaries, an 18% drop in criminal damage and 33% fewer public order offences but there was an increase in sexual offences and domestic assaults.
Home Affairs Minister Juan Watterson said: "While recorded crime is falling, the demand on the constabulary is not.
"Increasingly the constabulary's role focuses on broader aspects of public safety, including dealing with people who are dependent on alcohol or drugs."
