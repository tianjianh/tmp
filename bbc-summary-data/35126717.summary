A 14-year-old boy has been cleared of raping a vulnerable woman in her flat.

He and a 13-year-old boy were also acquitted of sexually assaulting the woman in Liverpool in September 2014, when she was 43.
A jury at the trial in July failed to agree a verdict and prosecutors said on Thursday that the woman did not want to give evidence again.
Judge Brian Cummings QC accepted their decision and recorded not guilty verdicts at Liverpool Crown Court.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it was not in the public interest to summons her and therefore offered no evidence.
At the July trial, the woman said: "I was saying 'don't do this, you're going to regret this for the rest of your lives.' I was trying to talk them out of doing it."
A relative of one of the boys clapped in the public gallery as they left court on Thursday.
