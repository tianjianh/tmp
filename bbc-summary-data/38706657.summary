The Aslams have five adult children. Some of them have travelled to Medina for the funeral.
Family friend Salma Raja said Mrs Aslam had been a lively, exuberant person.
Speaking ahead of the funeral, she said: "She used to solve everyone's problems. Anyone who came to her, she never said no.
"She was such a lovely person, I can't tell you, she was very, very good. She was never sad.
She added: "Mr Aslam was great as well. He was a serious kind of a person.
"Talat was more bubbly and outgoing. He was moren you could say intellectual, very, very intelligent.
"And he was a very good businessman as well."
