England cricket director Andrew Strauss has named the 40-year-old ex-Australia fast bowler as a possible replacement for sacked coach Peter Moores.
Gillespie has been the Yorkshire coach since 2011 and led them to the County Championship title last year.
"I'm in my dream job," he told BBC Sport. "It would certainly take persuading [to leave]."
When asked about being linked to the England role, he added: "It's very humbling, very flattering.
"The Yorkie boys have been giving me enough grief about it, which has been quite funny. But I haven't had any contact and until that happens I can't say anything.
"We'll just have to wait and see. Strauss mentioned my name publicly, so I may get a call. It's just fantastic [at Yorkshire], but I don't know what the future holds."
Gillespie's former Australia Test team-mate Justin Langer had also been named as a possible contender but ruled himself out of the running by signing a two-year contract extension with Western Australia on Tuesday.
Moores's second stint as coach was ended on 9 May by Strauss following a dismal World Cup and a drawn Test series in West Indies.
At his unveiling last week in his new role, Strauss named Gillespie as a contender for the coaching job, but also ruled out a return this summer for Kevin Pietersen despite the batsman scoring his first triple century the previous day.
Pietersen later claimed he had been "led down the garden path" by incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves, who had appeared to open the door to a recall. Graves denies offering Pietersen any guarantees.

Gillespie played in four Ashes series victories for Australia between 1996 and 2006, as well as the 2-1 defeat by Michael Vaughan's England in 2005.
He coached in Zimbabwe and the Indian Premier League before joining Yorkshire in November 2011.
He won promotion to the first division in an unbeaten first season and last year secured the Headingley side's first Championship title since 2001.
Gillespie's England prospects are further complicated by a contract agreed last month to coach Adelaide Strikers in the Australian Big Bash League for the next two winters.
"That's a role I'm really excited about and looking forward to sinking my teeth into," he added.
"I've got a lot of work to do here at Yorkshire, we've got a good core of senior lads and some young lads coming through and making their name. It's an exciting time for our club."
Yorkshire batsman Joe Root, England's vice-captain, has spoken highly of Gillespie's credentials as a potential England coach.
"I've loved working with Jason at Yorkshire, so would love to do so for England," said Root.
"People have got to make decisions that are completely out of my hands. Of course his experience at international level is going to be a benefit but he's great with everyone in and around the squad.
"He keeps things simple and you've seen what a good job he has done with the Yorkshire setup."
Other possible candidates for the job include former Australia batsman Tom Moody, former South Africa and India coach Gary Kirsten and Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach standing in as head coach for England's two-Test series against New Zealand starting on Thursday at Lord's.
Gillespie thinks England are in for a tough challenge against the Black Caps and Australia in the Ashes re-match that follows.
"New Zealand are a very good cricket side," he added. "They've always been a very good side in the short form of the game and a very competitive side in Test cricket.
"Australia have played good cricket over the last couple of years but any Test match is a challenge for any side.
"I'm sure England will go out there and look to play a nice positive brand of cricket, but we'll see what happens."
