Casement Park inquiry: Suspended Sport NI chief Antoinette McKeown attends hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of Sport NI has made an unexpected appearance at the inquiry into the controversial Casement Park stadium project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoinette McKeown was suspended from her role earlier this year.
She turned up at a Stormont committee where two of her Sport NI colleagues were giving evidence about the stadium.
She sat in the public gallery as the officials spoke to the Culture, Arts and Leisure (CAL) committee.
Asked later by the BBC why she was there, she said: "I am still accounting officer for Sport NI and it was vitally important for me, having heard the evidence given by Sport NI previously to the CAL committee, that I came here today as accounting officer to ensure that Sport NI is giving a true and fair account of events in relation to Casement Park."
She said she did not want to talk about her suspension from Sport NI.
Asked about Casement Park, and whether she passed on concerns from within Sport NI about emergency exiting to sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín, she said: "That's a matter between me and the [Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL)] inquiry that I'm fully co-operating with.
"I'm not commenting on that because I find myself currently in a process, and despite persistent media attention I have retained the integrity of that process and I want to continue doing that today.
"However, as accounting officer for Sport NI, it is important that I was here today."
Pressed again to answer the question, she said: "I will answer that question to the inquiry, but on the basis of the evidence that I have heard Sport NI give today, I also believe that I have evidence which the CAL committee may wish to hear."
Ms McKeown was suspended in March this year.
Last month, her union representative told the BBC she had been suspended due to "leadership issues".
Kevin McAdam of Unite said: "Antoinette McKeown believes she acted in good faith, in the proper manner with the structures that are in Sport NI.
"Had she been allowed to manage as expected, then the organisation would be in a healthier, better place now.
"She is currently under suspension pending investigation into leadership issues, not necessarily related to her, but to the organisation in general."
According to documents given to MLAs in April, Sport NI official Paul Scott - a stadium safety expert - won an internal grievance case against Ms McKeown.
The sports minister has begun an investigation into the Casement Park project after claims it had been mishandled.
The investigation is continuing.
