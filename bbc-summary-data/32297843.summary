The man was admitted to a hospital in Glasgow in the early hours after showing possible symptoms of the virus.
He was taken to the Brownlee Centre for infectious diseases at Gartnavel Hospital at about 02:20.
A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the results were expected on Tuesday afternoon.
A year after the outbreak in West Africa was officially declared, the virus has killed more than 10,000 people.
Most deaths occurred in the worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
