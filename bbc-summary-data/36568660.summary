O'Neill's side are bottom of Group E after Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Belgium, but a win against the Azzurri may take them through to the knockout stage.
With Italy already through, their Chelsea-bound head coach Antonio Conte has said he will rest some key players.
"We must go and try to win - that can be our only thought," said O'Neill.
"There was a thought about possibly being able to go through unbeaten with three draws. That is gone now, and we've a game to win
"We'll throw absolutely everything into it to try and win."

Six Italy players - goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, midfielders Daniele de Rossi and Thiago Motta, and forward Eder - are one booking away from a suspension.
With that in mind, Conte says he will "pick a side to win the match, but also to rest players".
O'Neill, meanwhile, wants his side to take confidence from their opening fixture in France - a 1-1 draw with Sweden.
"I don't think it will be as difficult as it's maybe looking from here," added O'Neill.
"We're capable of breaking Italy down and we might have to only take the one chance - that might be enough."
