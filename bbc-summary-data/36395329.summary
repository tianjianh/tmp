Ched Evans: Footballer's rape retrial in October

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Footballer Ched Evans' retrial for rape will be held in October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Evans, who always denied raping the woman, had his conviction quashed at the Court of Appeal in London in April.
The ex-Wales international was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire.
At a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court on Friday, High Court Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said Mr Evans, 27, of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, would stand trial again from 4 October.
The former Sheffield United, Manchester City and Norwich player served half of his five-year term and was released from prison in October 2014.
He has not been signed by a club since.
At the brief court hearing, Mr Evans spoke only to confirm his name and enter a not guilty plea to one count of rape, alleged to have happened on 30 May 2011.
Mrs Justice Nicola Davies will hear the trial, which will be held in Cardiff, and it is scheduled to last for two weeks.
The striker's case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, after new evidence emerged.
The appeal hearing was held on 22 and 23 March and following the announcement of the retrial in April, Lady Justice Hallett said the judges heard "fresh evidence".
She said: "In summary, we have concluded that we must allow the appeal and that it is in the interests of justice to order a retrial."
