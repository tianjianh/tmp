Dearing also admitted two counts of theft of a number plate, a second count of stealing fuel and two charges of driving whilst disqualified.
Following the hearing Miss Carr, 46, said: "Luckily I just got a few bruises. I came off quite lightly. It was more mental really, the shock of it.
"Because I put my hands out I went straight over the bonnet.
"I try not to think what could have happened.
