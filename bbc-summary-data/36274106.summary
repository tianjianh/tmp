Vincent Thurkettle found it four years ago but has only just revealed details.
The hunk of gold weighs 97g, the size of a small chicken egg!
The area where it was found has been searched again in case there's any more gold, because it's thought it was part of a 120 million pound collection which sank in 1859.
Vincent can't keep the gold though as it has to be put on show in a museum, but he may get a 'finder's fee.'
