Plan to raise parking fees in Llanelli town centre scrapped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to increase parking fees have been scrapped in a Carmarthenshire town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors also rejected introducing charges for evening parking in Llanelli at a meeting on Thursday.
Instead, members approved a trial in October for two hours free parking in all county council car parks in the town centre.
The decision, by Carmarthenshire's executive board, aims to encourage more footfall into the town centre.
An increase of 20p per charge band had been planned, and charges were to be made for parking after 18:00 BST.
Visitors to the town centre will be able to park for free next month between 15:00 and 17:00 each day.
