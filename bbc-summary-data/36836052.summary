The 18-month-old girl fell from a window on Ryland House in Great Hampton Row in Hockley, Birmingham, on Monday.
"Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that nothing could be done to save her," said West Midlands Ambulance Service.
The death is being treated as unexplained and a post-mortem examination is due to take place, said West Midlands Police.
Latest updates and reaction
Birmingham City Council confirmed the tower block is owned by the authority and the girl was not known to social services.
A spokesman declined to comment further while police investigate.
A shop owner, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he heard screaming and at first thought it was a fight, until he came out and learnt of the tragedy.
"People are very, very sad - they are feeling it very bad. I don't know the family, they might have been new to the area," he said.
He described the area as a mix of Jamaican and Somali communities and added they were "close" and had "a good relationship with each other".
Hockley is a district north-west of the city centre with a number of high-rise flats.
