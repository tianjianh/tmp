Police said two men, both driving vans, were involved in a "verbal altercation" on the northbound M77, near Silverburn Shopping Centre, at 15:30 on Thursday.
They left their vehicles, after which the man who was driving a white Ford Transit was hit on the head by the man who was driving a red Nissan van.
Police have appealed for people who witnessed the incident to get in touch.
Det Con Fiona Kane said: "The area in which the assault took place was at the very busy junction of the M77 adjacent to Silverburn Shopping Centre.
"We understand that a number of other motorists witnessed the incident, as a number of them were held in the traffic as the two vans had stopped on the busy road.
"Our inquiries have revealed that before the assault took place, the two drivers of the vans were driving erratically and at speed on Barrhead Road."
The detective added: "I would like to trace anyone who was in the vicinity of Barrhead Road between 15:30 and 15:40 hours, and who recognises the descriptions of the vans and the driving behaviour."
Police said that the red Nissan van also had roof bars.
Following the attack, both drivers carried on along the northbound M77.
