Election 2015: Economy debate takes centre stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Election campaigning is to focus on the economy as Labour and the Tories attack each other's plans before independent analysts present their verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour leader Ed Miliband will claim the Tories are planning "the biggest cuts anywhere in the developed world".
But Conservative Chancellor George Osborne highlighted what he called the "frightening" cost of a Labour government supported by the SNP.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies is to assess pledges on Thursday morning.
It will release its analysis of the policies presented by the Conservatives, Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.
However, BBC political correspondent Ben Geoghegan said it was "unlikely to settle what are some of the most contested issues in this election campaign".
In other election news:
The IFS has previously said the differences between Labour and the Conservatives' deficit reduction strategies were "pretty stark".
The Conservatives are planning an overall budget surplus by 2019-20. Labour would deliver a surplus only on the current budget and allow higher spending on investment.
This issue includes the wider economy and deficit reduction but also employment and the role of business.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Labour highlighted an analysis from the International Monetary Fund, claiming it showed Conservative cuts planned for the next three years would be "bigger than anywhere else among the world's 33 advanced economies".
Mr Miliband will claim spending cuts outlined in last month's Budget would be "double the pace next year than this year".
At an NHS rally in Leeds, he will say: "The Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party in generations.
"It is a plan so extreme that far from protecting the NHS they would end up cutting the NHS."
Chancellor George Osborne, meanwhile, used an interview in the Daily Telegraph to renew the Conservatives' attack on Labour over the possibility of the party being supported in government by the SNP.
Mr Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP if his party falls short of a majority on 7 May, but the Conservatives say there could be a looser arrangement with Labour relying on SNP support to win Commons votes.
Mr Osborne cited a Treasury estimate of the SNP's spending plans that said they would trigger an extra £6bn in debt interest payments.
"There's a real cost for families," Mr Osborne told the Telegraph.
"It's equivalent to just over £350 per family."
Labour called the chancellor's comments "ludicrous" and said they were "based on old figures".
They came after Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted footage of former SNP leader Alex Salmond suggesting he would be writing a Labour government's first Budget. The prime minister said voters would be shocked, but Mr Salmond dismissed it as a "light-hearted remark".
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, say they would offer currently unpaid carers a £250 payment to "ease the cost" of looking after relatives who need at least 35 hours' support over 12 months.
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said carers were "the unsung heroes of British society".
