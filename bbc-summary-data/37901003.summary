Steve Feltham had hoped to complete his challenge in three years after giving up his job and selling his home in Dorset to move to Dores near Inverness.
This year marked the 25th anniversary of his effort to explain sightings of Nessie.
He has been named Ambassador of the Year at the Highlands and Islands Tourism Awards.
Mr Feltham, who continues to search for the monster, said: "Winning this award makes me realise that what I've been doing for two and a half decades doesn't just make my heart sing, it has a knock-on effect for the tourism industry in the Highlands of Scotland."
He has previously been recognised by the Guinness Book of World Record for the longest continuous vigil hunting for the Loch Ness Monster.
