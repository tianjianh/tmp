A Monmouthshire village was left stranded on Sunday morning after a lorry blocked the only road in and out.

A 126-tonne crane lorry got jammed on the one-lane bridge into Sudbrook, near Caldicot at about 09:30 GMT, cutting off the village.
The lorry has since been removed and the road cleared.
Network Rail assessed the "structural viability" of the bridge and carried out "remedial works."
The bridge crosses the main south Wales to Birmingham railway line.
The line remained open, but trains from Newport to Gloucester and Birmingham were subject to a 20 mph speed restriction.
A Network rail spokeswoman said that restriction was lifted at 16:45 GMT.
Stranded residents took to social media to vent their frustration.
"Wide load stuck on the bridge in Sudbrook!" said Julie May. "If an ambulance or fire engine was needed here then how would they get through?"
Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox tweeted: "We have been campaigning for years for a second access to Sudbrook. An issue like this blocks emergency services."
At the time, Gwent Police insisted: "I'd like to reassure residents that, if there was an emergency, we'd find a way to get to them."
