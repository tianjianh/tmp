Organisers said the "unprecedented investment" has allowed them to develop their most ambitious programme to date.
The festival will run over 10 days from 22 May and will include theatre, music, comedy, dance, literature and film.
Programme director Peter Renwick said the grant, from Dumfries and Galloway Council's major events fund, was a "vote of confidence" in the festival.
He added: "I think the festival is really developing what it does and that confidence means we can go to other funders, national funders - Creative Scotland, etc. And that means we are really able to fund a bigger programme and a better programme.
"I think that really comes across this year and people will see changes over the next two or three years and we will really push what we're doing."
Council events champion Colin Smyth said: "The arts festival, like many other festivals and events organisations in the region, is becoming more financially sustainable, dynamic and customer focussed as a result of their own hard work, skills and expertise and the assistance they receive from the unique Dumfries and Galloway major festivals and events strategy.
"It is laying a very solid foundation to attract high numbers of visitors to our region as it grows in scope, prestige and national profile."
