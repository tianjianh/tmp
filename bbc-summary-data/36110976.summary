Bournemouth captain Simon Francis hopes to repeat win over Chelsea

Bournemouth captain Simon Francis says his side are drawing on the memory of their Premier League win at Chelsea as they prepare for the return fixture.

A win on Saturday would move the Cherries level on points with the defending champions.
"That game at Stamford Bridge was one of the highlights of the season," Francis told BBC Radio Solent. "We'll take a lot of confidence from that."
Glenn Murray's late header gave Bournemouth a 1-0 victory in December.
It made Eddie Howe's side the first promoted club to beat Chelsea at home since Charlton in April 2001.
But Francis, who led his side to his first win as captain that day, is expecting a very different test five months down the line.
"We know our home form hasn't been good enough against the top teams, bar beating Manchester United," he said.
"We know the dangers Chelsea possess and what a win against them would do for us. That's a huge incentive for us."
Bournemouth still have a chance of a top-half finish in their first-ever top flight season and Francis is keen to finish with momentum behind them.
"We're not going to take our foot off the gas," he added. "These are massive games and we don't want this season to fizzle out."
