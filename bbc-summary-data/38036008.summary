[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Premiership: Partick Thistle 1-2 Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late double from substitute Joe Dodoo snatched victory for Rangers at Firhill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kris Doolan put Thistle in front, bundling home from close range at the second attempt with 15 minutes left.
Dodoo equalised five minutes later, his crisply-struck volley flying past Thorsten Stuckmann in the Thistle goal.
The 21-year-old struck the winner four minutes into stoppage time, coolly slotting home after being played in by Kenny Miller.
Rangers extend their unbeaten league run to seven matches and though they were below their best, they move above Aberdeen into second place.
Mark Warburton's side were pedestrian in the opening period and though they improved after the break, Thistle will feel they did enough to earn a point.
The harsh reality is that they failed to do so and remain without a home win since the opening day of the season.
Although Thistle play some impressive football, their inability to pick up victories at Firhill could cost them dearly as the season progresses.
Rangers had been wasteful prior to Dodoo's double strike. Even in a first half in which they were second-best Miller should have had them in front, but his close-range header was saved.
They began the second period looking far more purposeful and the game might have taken on a different complexion had Harry Forrester been awarded a penalty as he was brought to the floor by Abdul Osman.
With Joe Garner again looking a forlorn figure, further chances fell to Forrester, Miller, Dodoo and Wallace but none were sufficiently clinical.
But just as they had against Dundee last weekend, they struck late to secure all three points, though the victory cannot disguise an under-par performance.
Thistle's Achilles heel this season has often been a failure to convert dominance of a match and promising opportunities into goals.
That weakness again proved to be their downfall as they passed up a series of chances, particularly in the first half, to break the deadlock.
Chris Erskine was Rangers' tormenter-in-chief playing behind the striker, but he was guilty of the most glaring miss, though his shot was deflected wide.
But Doolan also failed to make the most of early openings that fell his way and though Rangers dominated the second period, Erskine and Christie Elliott had good efforts saved by Wes Foderingham before Doolan finally made one count.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton told the Press Association: "You have to say you can admire their work effort and desire and they kept on going but we were disappointed in the first half and were frustrated at half-time.
"We didn't squeeze play, we didn't look after the football and I thought we came out in the second half much better. I thought Harry Forrester was a nailed-on penalty but we didn't get it.
"But we must take our chances, we must be more clinical in front of goal. I think we deserved the win in the end but (it was) frustrating in the first half."
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "I am proud of the lads, proud of the reaction we got after last week's terrible performance.
"I thought they were good individually and collectively.
"I thought we had the better of the first half, we contained Rangers and got some good opportunities.
"I am just so disappointed we didn't see it out."
