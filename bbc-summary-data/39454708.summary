Dana Petroleum said there was no safety risk from the release, which was detected in the past week on pipework on the seabed beneath the Triton floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO).
It happened 120 miles east of Aberdeen.
The company said a small amount of gas escaped before the problem was isolated.
The situation is being assessed before repairs are carried out.
A spokesman said: "Dana can confirm production is partially shut in on the Triton FPSO following identification of a gas leak on subsea gas lift infrastructure which was isolated and made safe.
"The FPSO is continuing to operate with reduced production with its normal crew of 60 on board.
"All regulatory authorities have been informed. Work is continuing to effect a long-term repair."
A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) spokesman said: "The Health and Safety Executive is investigating a recent gas release. Our pipelines inspectors are making further inquiries with Dana."
