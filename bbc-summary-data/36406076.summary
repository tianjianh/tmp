The regulator, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), said there had been public complaints that they prompted curiosity in "innocent children".
Pakistan is a socially conservative country and such commercials were already rare.
Last year a specific advert for Josh condoms was banned as "immoral".
Pakistan, the world's sixth most populous nation, has a lower rate of access to birth control than the average for the region, according to the World Health Organization.
