Craig Rodger, 25, was hit by a Porsche as he crossed Wilbraham Road in Chorlton, Manchester, in March 2014.
Mohammed Basit Chaudhry was accused of causing death by dangerous driving but died in Dubai the following year.
Mohammed Omayr and Raheel Rehman, both from Chorlton, were sentenced to two and three years respectively at Manchester Crown Court.
Police said Omayr had been contacted by Mr Chaudhry after the crash.
The men drove in convoy to Brookburn Road, about half a mile away from the scene of the crash, where Rehman set fire to a Porsche Panamera.
Mr Chaudhry was dropped off at his home by Omayr, police said, and, six days later, he left the country. The following month he died in a collision in Dubai.
His identity and death were confirmed when his body was brought back to the UK.
Omayr, 33, of Wilbraham Road, and Rehman, 28, of Lambton Road, both admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice at an earlier hearing.
After sentencing, Mr Rodger's family said they had been given "legal closure" but "the grief and heartache for us will go on forever".
They added: "To anyone who thinks they can drive recklessly and dangerously on our roads, this is the result, and to think you can then run and cover up your crime - you cannot and you will always look over your shoulder until you are brought to justice."
Sgt Lee Westhead, of Greater Manchester Police, said Omayr and Rehman were "cowardly and insidious individuals".
"The decisions they made that night are truly abhorrent," he said.
"The unwavering patience and dignity demonstrated by Craig's family throughout this period is utterly amazing."
