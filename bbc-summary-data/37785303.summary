The UK government said it would sustain 40 jobs at Hawarden Airfield near Broughton and 120 at RAF Waddington.
The deal with Raytheon UK will provide the Sentinel aircraft with in-service support and maintenance meaning it can meet operational requirements.
The intelligence-gathering Sentinel forms part of UK operations against so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
Minister for Defence Procurement, Harriett Baldwin, said: "Sentinel aircraft provide vital intelligence to our Armed Forces, giving them the ability to make decisions that helps keep Britain safe."
The contract is supported as part of a £178bn equipment plan.
