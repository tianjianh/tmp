After the trouble at the game Police Scotland set up a dedicated investigation to identify those involved.
Members of the public can send information to a dedicated email address - Scottishcupfinalpitchinvasion@scotland.pnn.police.uk.
The scenes of disorder at Hampden unfolded after Hibernian won their first Scottish Cup Final in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch and there were reports of alleged assaults on Rangers players.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and clashed with rival fans.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their cup final medals.
