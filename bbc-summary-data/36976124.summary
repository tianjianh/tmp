[SN]TITLE[SN]
Appeal after Selkirk holiday lodge plans rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A developer who hopes to build 19 holiday lodges near Selkirk is appealing a decision to reject them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Williams was refused outline consent for the proposal at Whitmuir Hall by Scottish Borders Council's planning committee in April.
The refusal came despite planning officials at the local authority and those in its economic development department backing the plans.
A final decision on the development is expected in October.
Mr Williams' proposals were knocked back by the committee after members said there was insufficient economic justification for the proposals.
Mr Williams has lodged his appeal against the decision with Scotland's Department of Planning and Environmental Appeals.
A planning reporter is now due to be appointed to the project before carrying out a visit to the proposed site.
In 2012, the council's planning committee rejected an outline application for 28 chalets by Mr Williams.
The decision to reject the scheme was upheld the following year by a Scottish government planning reporter.
