[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg both claim to have won the mind games before their super-bantamweight unification match on Saturday.

Bury's Quigg will put his WBA belt on the line against Belfast's Frampton, the IBF title-holder, in front of 20,000 fans at the Manchester Arena.
Both scaled 8st 9lb - just under the 8st 10lb limit - at a heated weigh-in which was attended by about 3,000 fans.
"I'm sitting back, relaxing and watching them lose it," said Frampton.
"They're rattled and it's embarrassing to watch," added the 29-year-old.
Quigg, 27, replied: "They're trying to get into my head. Normally Frampton intimidates opponents, but he doesn't intimidate me.
"He likes to be in control, be the cat playing with a mouse. But this time he's the cat and I'm a Rottweiler."

Frampton-Quigg is one of the most eagerly-anticipated domestic match-ups in recent memory and the first time two undefeated British boxers have fought to unify a world title.

Frampton, who is managed by boxing legend Barry McGuigan, is a slight favourite with the bookmakers.
However, the fact that Frampton was knocked down twice in his last fight against unheralded Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez, along with Quigg's demolition of the Spaniard Kiko Martinez, suggests it could go either way.
Both men had plenty of support at the weigh-in, during which the fighters' respective trainers had to be separated by security.
Quigg's trainer Joe Gallagher and Frampton's trainer Shane McGuigan have been at loggerheads since the fight was announced last November.
The traditional stare-off between the combatants lasted more than a minute, before Frampton broke the spell by blowing Quigg a kiss.
Meanwhile, the row over who will get the so-called 'star' dressing room on fight night shows no signs of abating.
At Thursday's final news conference, Frampton said he should get the bigger dressing room because he was the bigger draw. Quigg said he should have the bigger dressing room because he was the 'home' fighter.
Both men went as far as suggesting the fight might not happen if the issue was not resolved in their favour.
"I'm in the 'star' dressing room or that dressing room is locked," said Frampton, who is undefeated in 21 professional fights, with 14 knockouts.
"I'm not giving in to Scott Quigg. I can walk away from the fight because I've got other options. I think this is all hilarious."
Quigg, who is undefeated in 33 pro fights with 23 knockouts, replied: "I'm having that changing room and that's it.
"It's settled. If not, tell him not to fight. It's all about his ego and his arrogance. Him and his team are living in Cloud Cuckoo Land.
"This fight is as big as it is because of both of us. He's not a pay-per-view fighter without me, and vice versa. It's this fight that is pay-per-view."
Frampton is confident he will have the lion's share of support on Saturday, despite Quigg claiming his rival returned some of his ticket allocation.
"I sold all my tickets, I didn't hand a single ticket back," said Frampton.
"I even bought some tickets from Scott Quigg's nan's chip shop. We'll see who's sold the most tickets on the night."
