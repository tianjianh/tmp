Police Scotland said two men broke into the farm house near to Corsock, Castle Douglas, between 23:30 on Thursday and 01:00 on Friday.
They stole items including a number of war medals, gold watches and antiques.
Officers have appealed for information and said the robbers may have been "casing" the property before the raid.
Det Sgt Graeme Robertson said: "I believe that whoever broke into this house knew what they were looking for - that is the medals, watches and antiques.
"Thankfully the householder, a woman, who was in the house at the time, was not injured but she is very upset by what has happened."
The men were described as being well spoken, with Scottish accents, of average height and build and wearing dark clothing.
One of the men was wearing a balaclava and gloves.
"Due to the rural location of the house and the items taken, we believe that the two men would have had to have the use of a car.
"It is also entirely possible that they may have been in the area before the break in 'casing' the house so I would ask anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour around the area during this time, or anyone who may have been offered these items for sale, to contact police."
