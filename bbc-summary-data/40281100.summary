The collision between three lorries and an Audi happened on the northbound carriageway near Winchester on 6 June.
Susan Curtis, 67, from Buckinghamshire, and Michael James, 77, from Dorset, who were travelling in the Audi, died.
A 63-year-old man interviewed under caution in connection with the crash has since been released while inquiries continue.
A statement, released by police on behalf of the family of Mr James, of Broadstone, said: "Suddenly and tragically Mike James was taken from us and leaves behind two sons and two grandchildren.
"Much loved and will be terribly missed by so many."
Police said the family of Ms Curtis, from Aylesbury, were releasing the picture of her and with her sons in her memory.
Two of the lorry drivers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Police have appealed for witnesses who may have seen or captured the accident on a dashboard camera to contact them.
