The discovery was made by a railway contractor at Ingatestone railway station in Essex on Thursday.
Police say they are in contact with the family and keeping them updated with developments in the case.
The remains have been removed from the scene and the coroner has been informed of the find.
A British Transport Police spokesman said the force was confident the leg belonged to the person involved in the 2014 incident, though tests would be carried out to make sure.
