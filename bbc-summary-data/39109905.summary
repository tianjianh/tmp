Royal Victoria Hospital generator delay during power cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was a 10-minute delay in one of the back-up generators starting up at the Royal Victoria Hospital during power cuts in Belfast on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belfast Health Trust is investigating how it happened and if it had any impact on patient care.
A fault in the NIE transmission network cut power for a short time to 27,000 customers in south and west Belfast.
About 10,000 customers were also affected in the Londonderry area due to a power cut.
NIE Networks said this was the result of "contractor damage to underground electricity cables".
It said electricity supplies had now been restored.
