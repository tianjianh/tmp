Danny Wilson's side rose above Ospreys to eighth in the Pro12 table, one point below sixth-placed Edinburgh and Munster in seventh.
Josh Turnbull, Rey Lee-Lo and Gareth Anscombe went over for the hosts.
Dragons battled throughout with Sarel Pretorius' try and Dorian Jones' penalty their reward.
Rhys Patchell was playing his last game at the Arms Park before joining Scarlets in a Blues team showing two changes from the 28-22 win in Llanelli.
Kristian Dacey replaced Matthew Rees at hooker with Jarrad Heota taking over from Turnbull in the second row.
Dragons were unchanged from their 23-21 win at Gloucester in the European Challenge Cup, but will travel to Montpellier in next Saturday's semi-final on the back of a Welsh derby defeat.
While Dragons were in action, Montpellier won 26-20 in the French Top 14 at Stade Francais.
A player with west Wales roots helped ensure the east Wales contest went Blues' way.
Having moved to number eight, Turnbull underlined his value to Blues this season by bursting past Taulupe Faletau's challenge to go over from close range.
Anscombe added a penalty to that opening try before Jones put Dragons on the scoreboard with his reply.
After Anscombe's second penalty the visitors had chances with Hallam Amos and Pretorius to the fore in attack.
Amos fluffed one chance when he went for the line instead of using an overlap, but Pretorius pounced at the base of a scrum.
Pretorius' yellow card for a deliberate knock-on while attempting to intercept looked harsh to some.
In his absence, man-of-the-match Anscombe's perfectly-weighted chip gave Lee-Lo the chance to gather and score.
Anscombe converted to give the hosts a 10-point half-time lead and added his final penalty as Blues tightened their grip on the game.
However, Blues were as guilty as the visitors of wasting chances.
When Anscombe went over to finish the final move of the game, Blues were already rueing missing the opportunities that could have led to a bonus-point win that would have sent them sixth in the table.
