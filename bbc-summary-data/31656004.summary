Fury took his unbeaten record to 24 with a technical knockout of Romania's Christian Hammer, whose corner threw in the towel after round eight.
The 26-year-old, who is the mandatory challenger for Klitschko's WBO world title belt, said: "I'm ready for him.
"I'm a much improved fighter and that's why I'm ready for Klitschko next."
Manchester fighter Fury, who is 6ft 9in and had a seven-inch height advantage, used his jab to great effect, before knocking Hammer over in round five with a thudding right hand to the top of the head.
The challenger was spared further punishment when his corner pulled out their man with him sat on his stool between the eighth and ninth rounds.
Fury added on BoxNation: "I'm here to entertain. I came here to box a very worthy opponent who was very tough.
"He took a lot of punishment and his corner knew they had to pull him out."
