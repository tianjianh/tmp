Organisers of the event, which has seen Judi Dench, Stephen Fry, BB King and JK Rowling appear, want to "secure its future for the next 50 years".
They say each year they must raise £500,000 to keep the event afloat.
Prince Charles said the festivals "played a crucial role in nurturing new talent."
The festivals' Future 50 Appeal aims to raise £1m for the arts charity "that has been at the heart of Harrogate for half a century - to secure its future for the next 50 years", organisers said.
Backing the appeal, Prince Charles said: "I am so pleased to be able to support such an innovative charity organisation as it launches the Future 50 Campaign, which will help safeguard the festivals' heritage and reputation for excellence, as well as playing a crucial role in nurturing new talent and providing opportunities for all, making life that little bit more worthwhile."
Sharon Canavar, Head of Harrogate International Festivals, said: "We have a strong heritage and an ambitious future. We are passionate about building on this remarkable legacy for future generations.
