Heathrow in quotes: What ministers have said in past

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has announced its support for a third runway at London's Heathrow airport.

The issue has long been a hot potato for politicians, with Prime Minister Theresa May having previously opposed a third runway and some senior Tories remaining against the move.
Here is a selection of quotes - past and present - from key figures.
Theresa  May, who is MP for Maidenhead in Berkshire, said in 2008 the then Labour government's case for Heathrow expansion was "seriously flawed", and in 2009 she pledged to "fight to stop the third runway".
A year later, she said she "strongly" welcomed the cancellation of plans for a third runway under the coalition government.
"Expanding Heathrow in this way would have had a detrimental effect on the Maidenhead and Twyford areas by increasing levels of noise and pollution, and today's announcement is a victory for all those who have campaigned against it."
With several vocal critics of Heathrow expansion in her cabinet, Mrs May has moved to head off possible Cabinet resignations by giving ministers freedom to speak out against the decision.
In a December 2010 interview with the Daily Telegraph the then transport secretary said a third runway at Heathrow was "dead. Dead as a Norwegian parrot."
Setting out his views to voters in his Runnymede and Weybridge, Surrey, constituency ahead of last year's general election Mr Hammond said that "London's role as an international air transport hub can be maintained without additional runways at Heathrow."
He backed a second runway at Gatwick alongside improved transport links between the two airports.
The ex-London mayor has long been opposed to a third runway at Heathrow, saying building one would be "investing in decline".
"The third runway is a sham and a delusion and it will never happen," he has said.
In his acceptance speech after being returned to Parliament Mr Johnson declared that he would lie "in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway".
Ms Greening has campaigned against Heathrow expansion, her Putney constituency being under the flight path. She told the Telegraph in March this year: "Trying to expand Heathrow is like trying to build an eight bedroom mansion on the site of a terraced house.
"It is a hub airport that is just simply in the wrong place."
Mr Fox, the international trade secretary, has been vocal in pushing for airport expansion.
In December last year he wrote an open letter signed by 30 Conservative MPs which said the government should "push on" with expansion and that "this decision has been put off for too long whilst other nations press ahead with growing their airport capacity.
"If we do not make a decision now and deliver the increased capacity, we risk losing further ground."
Labour's London mayor supports a new runway at Gatwick over Heathrow but has urged the government to make a decision quickly, regardless of which it favours.
He said: "The new prime minister has a very important decision to make regarding new airport capacity, and I urge her to rule as swiftly as possible in favour of a second runway at Gatwick, which would bring substantial economic benefits."
However, Mr Khan backed a third runway when he was a transport minister in the previous Labour government.
In an August 2015 Financial Times interview, Mr Corbyn said: "I think the third runway is a problem for noise pollution and so on across West Londonâ€¦I also think there is an under-usage of the other airports around London.
"I'd vote against it in this parliament."
Mr McDonnell is an outspoken critic of Heathrow expansion and in 2009 he famously stole the mace from the House of Commons in a protest over the then government's refusal to allow a vote on the issue.
The West London airport is in his constituency of Hayes and Harlington.
In July 2015 Mr McDonnell claimed the proposals set out by Sir Howard Davies would lead to an unprecedented environmental protest campaign.
"We will fight with every mechanism available including political lobbying, legal action and where necessary direct action to save our homes and community," he said.
Mr McDonald appeared to back expansion in a Guardian article in which he said the "imperative was overwhelming" for more capacity and that "there would have to be overwhelming evidence that the Airport Commission's report and conclusions were fundamentally flawed for Parliament to depart from it".
The Airports Commission backed a third runway at Heathrow in July 2015.
