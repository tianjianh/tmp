Ethan Houghton, 13, died alongside his mother Tracy Houghton, brother Josh, 11, and Aimee Goldsmith, also 11, on the A34 in Berkshire on 10 August.
All Saints Academy in Dunstable, Bedfordshire ,opened this week to allow students to sign a book of condolence in memory of Ethan and his family.
Head of year Josh Smith said the teenager "always had a cheeky smile".
He said: "Ethan was a lovely lad, he was the sort of person who could mix between all the different friendship groups. He was a really lovely lad to have in lessons and he always worked really hard."
Among the tributes to Ethan were anecdotes about his love of football and his determination to play even when he broke his arm.
"You were an amazing boy," said one message, "you always knew how to make me smile," said another.
Dunstable Football Club, where Ethan played for the under-14 team, will pay tribute to the teenager at its FA Cup preliminary round match against Chesham United on Saturday.
A photo of Ethan will be put on the front page of the programme and the under-14 team will walk on to the pitch with the first team.
Ashton St Peter's Primary School in Dunstable opened on Sunday for Josh's friends to light candles and sign a book of condolence. It did not wish to comment.
The crash happened between Chieveley and East Ilsley at about 17:10 BST on 10 August.
Ms Houghton's partner Mark Goldsmith, whose daughter Aimee died in the crash, was injured.
A 30-year-old man from Andover, who was driving one of the lorries involved in the crash, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been bailed until 5 October.
