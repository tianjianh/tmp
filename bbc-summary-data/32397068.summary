[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Prince of Wales is to visit the Republic of Ireland next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Accompanied by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, he will also go to Northern Ireland as part of a four-day visit from 19 to 23 May.
Reports suggest he will visit Mullaghmore in County Sligo, where his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979.
Prince Charles first visited the Republic of Ireland in 1995.
His visit was hailed as a success, and seen as a step on the way towards the eventual visit by the Queen in 2011.
The prince also visited the Republic of Ireland in 2002, but this will be his first official joint visit with the Duchess of Cornwall.
Clarence House said the trip was being held at the request of the British government, and planning was still in progress.
While their itinerary has not been finalised, reports in Dublin suggest that the royal couple could visit Drumcliffe Church, where the poet WB Yeats is buried, and Lissadell House.
The visit was welcomed by Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Charlie Flanagan.
"Following the reciprocal state visits of recent years, this visit to Ireland will represent a further expression of the warm and friendly relations which now exist between us," he said.
"We look forward to their arrival next month, and to a visit programme which reflects the quality of these relations."
The royal couple welcomed Irish President Michael D Higgins to the UK during his state visit in April 2014.
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall most recently visited Northern Ireland together on official visits in April 2014 and in June 2013.
