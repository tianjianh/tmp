[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Waste has started to be removed from a rubbish tip fire in a bid to put it out more than two weeks after it started.

The blaze at the former Hunter Group site in Lockwood, Huddersfield, broke out on 18 August, with sections of the waste pile continuing to smoulder.
Kirklees Council said the removal would allow firefighters to reach the seat of the fire, which had been inaccessible.
The waste removal to get at the fire could take weeks, the council said.
Residents living near the Queens Mill Road site should continue to keep their windows and doors shut and avoid areas affected by smoke or ash, according to Public Health England advice.
People in the area previously told the BBC the fire was causing nausea and headaches.
Kirklees Council said it continued to pursue legal action against the site operators, with a court hearing due on 23 September.
