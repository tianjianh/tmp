Election 2015: Learn lessons from Scotland, warns Morgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former First Minister Rhodri Morgan has warned the Labour Party in Wales it must learn lessons from the party's poor election performance in Scotland.

He said: "If you don't establish a Welsh brand, you could suffer the fate of the Labour Party in Scotland".
Scottish Labour lost 40 seats to the SNP, leaving it with just one MP.
Mr Morgan also suggested Leanne Wood's profile in the television leader debates could boost Plaid Cymru in the 2016 assembly election.
He described Ed Miliband as an "incredibly bright" and "very nice guy" who lacked the "X factor" and "could not enthuse" some Labour supporters.
Labour had allowed the election to be framed as a contest between an "Eton posh-boy and a Hampstead geek", Mr Morgan said.
The ex-first minister said he did not have a favourite to become the new party leader.
