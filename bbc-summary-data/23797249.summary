[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had previously been chief executive of Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust, then chief operating officer for acute and primary services in Tayside.
Mr Marr is moving to Australia, where his wife Carrie is taking up a post in health administration.
NHS Tayside Chairman Sandy Watson said Mr Marr had played a "pivotal role" in Tayside's health services.
Mr Marr said: "I first came to Dundee in 2001 at a time when there were many questions hanging over the future delivery of health services in Tayside.
"From day one it was obvious to me that NHS Tayside had staff with professionalism and a commitment to delivering quality services for their patients."
He added: "I am immensely proud of all that NHS Tayside has achieved over the past few years but I am even prouder of the fact that, thanks to the dedication of all staff at all levels, the people of Tayside have health services they can have confidence in."
