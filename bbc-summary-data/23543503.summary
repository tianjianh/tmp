Mayo murder accused Sanjeev Chada to get medical treatment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has ordered that a man charged with the murder of his two sons should undergo medical treatment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sanjeev Chada, 43,  from Ballinkillen, County Carlow, was further remanded in custody when he appeared before a district court in County Roscommon.
The bodies of Eoghan Chada, 10, and his five-year-old brother, RuairÃ­, were discovered in a vehicle driven by their father in County Mayo on Monday.
Their father was charged with their murders on Thursday night.
Mr Chada had sustained minor injuries when the car he was driving crashed into a wall at Rosbeg, near Westport, on Monday.
He was treated at Mayo Hospital, but was later discharged and arrested.
On Friday, Mr Chada faced Harristown Court in Castlerea for a brief hearing, less than 14 hours after his first appearance at a special sitting of Swinford District Court, charged with the two murders.
Police applied for the accused to be remanded in custody for two weeks.
Mr Chada's solicitor told the judge he was concerned that his client should be looked after and inquired about the possibility of psychiatric help.
The judge directed appropriate medical treatment for Mr Chada, but not a psychiatric report.
Mr Chada is to appear at Harristown Court again on 16 August.
A joint funeral for Eoghan and RuairÃ­ is set to take place on Friday.
