Ryan Giggs has confirmed he held talks with Swansea City before Bob Bradley was appointed, becoming first American to manage a Premier League club.

Manchester United and Wales legend Giggs met the Swans as they pondered who would succeed Francesco Guidolin.
"I always said I'd be open to anything that looked interesting and obviously Swansea was one of those clubs," Giggs told BBC Wales.
"I did that and unfortunately it didn't quite work out."
Giggs says "a few things" ensured he would remain on a sabbatical involving travel and punditry and not take over at Liberty Stadium.
"They probably already had an eye on Bob Bradley - obviously American owners - and for whatever reason it didn't quite work out," said Giggs.
"But I wish them luck and I'll carry on enjoying my sabbatical.
"He's [Bradley] obviously got experience. He's been a manager, I think, for 30 years now."
Giggs also believes Bradley and Swansea have a testing season ahead as they try to climb away from the threat of relegation.
They are 17th in the Premier League and have not won a game since the opening day of the season.
"It's going to be difficult because of the position they're in, but when a new manager comes in sometimes you get a lift, sometimes you get that confidence, different ideas, a bit of freshness and we'll see what happens, but yeah, it will be difficult for them," he said.
The former winger, 42, was interim manager at Old Trafford and was assistant to Louis van Gaal before parting company with the club after a 29-year association following the appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager.
Guidolin had been in charge since the departure of Garry Monk in January, but was dismissed after the 2-1 home defeat by Liverpool on 1 October.
In addition to Giggs, Swansea also spoke to ex-Derby County manager Paul Clement and former Sevilla and Villarreal coach Marcelino before appointing Bradley as manager.
Bradley's first game in charge is against Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday, 15 October.
