[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sevilla 2-0 Granada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Adams suffered a second successive defeat in charge of La Liga strugglers Granada as Sevilla moved level on points with third-placed Atletico Madrid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brazilian midfielder Ganso scored in each half to leave Granada seven points from safety with five games left.
Granada lost French defender Matthieu Saunier to injury after four minutes.
Sevilla look set to finish in the top four for the first time since 2010 and qualify for the Champions League.
Granada's future is much bleaker.
Former Arsenal and England captain Adams, who had already been working with the club, was appointed head coach until the end of the season earlier this month.
His first game in charge ended in a comprehensive 3-0 home defeat by Celta Vigo on Sunday.
Their remaining five games includes a home fixture with leaders Real Madrid on 6 May.
Match ends, Sevilla 2, Granada CF 0.
