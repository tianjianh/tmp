[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stepping Hill nurse Victorino Chua loses appeal bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who murdered two patients and poisoned others at Stepping Hill Hospital has failed in a bid to appeal against his conviction and sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a letter Victorino Chua, 50, called himself an "angel turned evil".
He injected insulin into saline bags and ampoules while working on two acute wards at the hospital in Stockport.
At the Court of Appeal in London, judges rejected the argument his minimum jail term of 35 years was "manifestly excessive".
His lawyers argued the letter should not have been admitted as evidence, but Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with two other judges, ruled it was not "arguable".
Chua injected the insulin into saline in June and July 2011.
It was unwittingly used by other nurses, causing a series of insulin overdoses to mainly elderly victims.
Chua was convicted of murdering patients Tracey Arden, 44, and Derek Weaver, 83, in 2015 at Manchester Crown Court.
On sentencing, the trial judge Mr Justice Openshaw described his actions as "indescribably wicked".
He said it was a "strikingly sinister and truly wicked feature of the case" that Chua did not know who would fall victim to his actions.
