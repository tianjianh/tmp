Police investigating the disappearance of a baby born in north London in 2004 have arrested a man in Hertfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 38 year old was arrested on Friday on suspicion of preventing a lawful burial and perverting the course of justice.
The Met said the child had not been seen in the 11 years since its disappearance was first reported.
A woman, 31, previously charged in connection with the investigation, appeared in court in July.
Victoria Gayle, 31, previously of West Hendon, north London, was charged after police discovered the remains of another baby at a home in West Hendon in June.
A post-mortem examination at Great Ormond Street Hospital was unable to determine the cause of the child's death.
Ms Gayle is due to appear in court again in later this month.
A 50-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man remain on bail.
