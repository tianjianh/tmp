Ireland's John Anderson ruled out of third ODI against Afghanistan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Anderson has been ruled out of Ireland's third one-day international against Afghanistan on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anderson must undertake return to play protocol after suffering a blow to the head while batting in Tuesday's second ODI between the sides at Stormont.
Anderson scored 26 batting at three in his sixth ODI appearance for Ireland.
Afghanistan beat the hosts by 39 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the series after the first game between the sides was abandoned because of rain on Sunday.
Leinster Lightning captain Anderson was struck on the helmet by a Shapoor Zadran bouncer in the 30th over of Tuesday's match, and has since shown symptoms of a concussion.
Before being available for selection again, the 33-year-old must complete a return to play protocol so his availability for the remaining fixtures on Sunday and Tuesday has yet to be determined.
Anderson will remain part of the squad in Belfast during his recovery.
