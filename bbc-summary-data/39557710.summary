Germany, Japan and Poland are also in Pool A in the tournament, which doubles up as the main route of qualifying for next year's World Cup finals.
Pool B comprises Argentina, USA, hosts South Africa, India and Chile.
The top 10 teams from the two semi-finals tournaments qualify for the World Cup plus the five Continental champions and hosts England.
If a country wins their Continental title and has also qualified through the World League semi-finals, then the next ranked country from the World League semi-finals will make the World Cup finals.
Ireland won the World League Round Two in Kuala Lumpur in January by beating Malaysia 3-0 in the final.
England's team will include many of the Rio 2016 gold medal winners who represented Great Britain, while German won bronze at the Olympics.
It was announced last week that Ireland's men will also be in the same semi-final in Johannesburg.
