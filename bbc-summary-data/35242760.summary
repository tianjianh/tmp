Staff at Legal & General's offices in Surrey have voted to take industrial action in a dispute over plans to close the site.

The union Unite said two-thirds of its members at the Kingswood office near Tadworth backed action short of a strike, such as working to rule.
Unite claimed about 1,500 jobs were at risk but Legal & General said most jobs were being moved to Hove and Cardiff.
The company said customers would not be affected by the outcome of the ballot.
Unite's regional officer Ian Methven said the union wanted the firm to explore all options to keep the base open.
He said the company relied on staff "going the extra mile" but their goodwill could not be taken for granted.
A Legal & General spokesman said union members were offered two options in the ballot - to strike or to take lesser action - and they voted not to strike.
"The ballot has given them the option to work to rule, should Unite decide to take this option, which they haven't yet," he added.
He said the site has more than 1,500 employees of which about 600 are Unite members.
Under the plans, the base could close in 2018.
