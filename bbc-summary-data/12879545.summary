Director Zack Snyder said the three-time Oscar nominee has "the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful".
Adams will star alongside Britain's Henry Cavill in the as yet untitled film, set for release in December 2012.
The 36-year-old actress was recently seen in boxing drama The Fighter.
She was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role but the award went to her co-star Melissa Leo.
In the four Superman films starring Christopher Reeve, Daily Planet reporter Lois was played by Margot Kidder.
Kate Bosworth took over the part when the Man of Steel was revived in 2006 in Superman Returns.
Diane Lane and Kevin Costner have also landed roles in Snyder's film, in which they will play Superman's adoptive father and mother.
Snyder's latest movie Sucker Punch is released in the UK on Friday.
