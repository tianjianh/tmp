A sheepdog who went missing with his orphaned lamb "best friend" has been found after three weeks - but without his woolly companion.

"Inseparable" Bella the ewe and Blake the border collie disappeared from their owner Natalie Haywood's home near Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire.
Ms Haywood posted on Facebook saying someone had picked up Blake and returned him home.
She said Blake was "all well" and was behaving "like nothing has happened".
"The hunt for Bella continues still, with Blake's help we will bring her home," she wrote.
Bella was five weeks old when she went missing from her home in the village of Perlethorpe on 8 May.
Because of her age, she needed regular bottle feeding.
She had been adopted from a farmer neighbour after being orphaned, and quickly bonded with Ms Haywood's pet dog.
"They are the best of friends, she follows him around everywhere," said Ms Haywood after the pair's disappearance.
The disappearance sparked a campaign to find them and the hashtag #findblakeandbella.
A Â£1,000 reward for their recovery was offered by ITV presenter Philip Schofield on This Morning, and thousands of people joined a Facebook group set up to find the pets.
Eight cameras were set up in four locations and tracking dogs were used in the search.
