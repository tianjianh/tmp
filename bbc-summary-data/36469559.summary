The human remains were discovered at Pentrellyncymer near Cerrigydrudion in November last year.
Forensic experts say the man had suffered a serious head injury and his death is being treated as suspicious.
However, the individual had been in the forest for several years, and police say his identity remains a mystery.
Detectives said investigations have revealed that the man had undergone two identifiable dental procedures which may help in the search for his name.
"We believe the male had crown work undertaken and the procedure is thought to have been commonly used in the UK between 1980 and 2000," explained Det Sup Mark Chesters, who is leading the case.
"One crown was plastic, badly worn and had remedial filling work. It is unusual for temporary crowns to be filled."
He appealed for any dentists who might be familiar with this work between 1980 and 2000 to come forward.
North Wales Police said the man was probably aged over 54-years-old, with a large build and between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10in tall (1.73m-1.78m).
Officers have also revealed that the individual was wearing a green Pringle jumper made between 2000 and 2004, and sold through Pringle outlet stores.
"Dark wine" coloured underwear has also been identified as being from a Marks and Spencer store.
"Although the description that we have of the man remains limited at this time, as our inquiries progress we hope that more information will come to light which will lead to his identification and help establish the full circumstances surrounding his death," added Det Sup Chesters.
