He struck in the first half, finishing coolly at the near post after an excellent pass from Paddy McCourt.
Luton goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell was inspired, saving twice in a minute from Graham Carey as the Pilgrims piled forward in search of an equaliser.
Hatters debutant Glen Rea then missed an easy chance before Mitchell tipped Gregg Wylde's shot onto a post late on.
Plymouth's defeat enabled Bristol Rovers to climb above them into the top three on goal difference, while Luton moved up to 12th.

Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: "To come away to a very, very difficult place and a side that's pushing for automatic promotion, and to put in the performance we did and get the result we did, I'm very pleased.
"Today we felt that we handled everything they had, there was no clear cut chances for them.
"It's a difficult place to come to but we're delighted with the performance and obviously delighted with the win."
