[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kirstin MacRuary, 39, from Dundonald, South Ayrshire, admitted child sex offences at her home between October 2013 and January 2014.
The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were aged 14 when she invited them to her home to use the internet, watch films and drink alcohol.
At Ayr Sheriff Court, MacRuary was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.
Jailing her, Sheriff John Montgomery told MacRuary there was no alternative to a custodial sentence.
The sheriff said: "You pleaded guilty to two charges of having sexual intercourse with boys between the age of 13 and 16-years-old - both were 14 at the time.
"I've read the social work report - it's an astonishing report in many ways because you don't express any remorse.
"There is, in my view, no alternative to a custodial sentence."
The court heard that MacRuary targeted her first victim between October and November 2013 as he sat on a sofa at her home.
She invited him upstairs and showed him contraception after which she had sex with the boy, who later said it made him feel "weird".
Between December 2013 and January 2014 she targeted the second boy who was in her house watching a film.
MacRuary suggested he go upstairs for a sleep, followed him up to the spare bedroom, took his clothes off, and had sex with him.
The boy then became worried and pushed MacRuary off before fleeing her home.
Police were informed and she was arrested and charged for having sex with children.
Officers examining her laptop found a chat with teenage boys in which she admitted she missed one victim's "cute little face".
It also emerged that MacRuary regularly posted about Irish pop duo Jedward on a social media site.
In one post, she said: "I miss my Jeds, need some Jedcest now."
