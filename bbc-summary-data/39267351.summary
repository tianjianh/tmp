[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A psychiatrist has gone on trial accused of sexually abusing vulnerable patients in south Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Brian Harris, 77, worked for the NHS and in a private practice in Cardiff for 40 years.
He denies all 13 charges of sexual assault, indecent assault and rape against five men. The allegations are said to have taken place between 1991 and 2011.
The trial at Merthyr Crown Court is expected to last up to five weeks.
The jury heard the first of the alleged assaults took place in 1991 on a man who was a patient at Sully Hospital and the Amy Evans clinic in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.
A second man, who was recovering from brain damage, was said to have been assaulted at Sully Hospital the following year.
Ian Wright, prosecuting, said a third patient was "subject to a catalogue of serious sexual assaults including rape" during appointments at the Trealaw clinic in Rhondda Cynon Taff and at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital between 2009 and 2011.
Two other men claimed to have been assaulted at the Trealaw clinic.
