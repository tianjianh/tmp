Gwyn Elfyn plays shopkeeper Denzil Rees in Welsh language series Pobol y Cwm.
But after nearly three decades on the BBC Wales-produced programme, which means People of the Valley in English, Elfyn is leaving the show.
The show's producer has promised that Denzil's exit will be one of the biggest in the history of the programme.
Denzil's departure is being kept secret for the time being, but his last scenes promise to be solemn.
Elfyn has been involved in several important story lines during his time in Cwmderi, the fictional village where the show is set.
His character Denzil, a former farmer, has been married twice, to Eileen and her sister, Maureen.
Although the character has seen some dark days, he has continued to be a cornerstone of the community, say the show's producers.
Elfyn said: "Denzil has two memories that stay in my mind, marrying Eileen and working with Dic Deryn on the skips.
"And as far as my personal memories, the story of losing John, one of Denzil's twins, is the best story I've ever had.
"It was traumatic and the biggest challenge I've had working on Pobol y Cwm. Opportunities like that don't come around very often."
Series producer, Ynyr Williams, said it was a sad time for Pobol y Cwm.
"Every series needs big story lines and Denzil's exit will be one of the biggest in the history of the programme," he said.
"After 28 commendable years on the show it's a sad time and the end of an era but it's also a new start."
During January, Pobol y Cwm fans will witness an illness spreading throughout Cwmderi and no one is sure of the cause.
The residents are too scared to leave their homes and the situation is desperate.
Pobol y Cwm has been produced by the BBC since 1974. It is broadcast on the Welsh language channel S4C.
