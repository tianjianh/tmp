[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young boy has said one of the accused in the Liam Fee murder trial told him she had "killed his dad" with a type of saw.

The youngster made the statement during a recorded police interview after the two-year-old was found dead at a house near Glenrothes on 22 March 2014.
Rachel Fee, 31, and Nyomi Fee, 28, deny murdering Liam and harming two other boys.
The boy also said he felt "unsafe" with the two accused.
In the interview footage shown to the jury on day 11 of the trial at the High Court in Livingston, the boy claimed he suffered a catalogue of abuse at the hands of the two accused.
He said Nyomi Fee told him she had killed his father with a drill-like saw because she did not like liars.
He added: "I didn't like it. I was thinking I would be dead."
The interviewers, a police officer and social worker, told him his father was still alive.
The boy said he felt unsafe at the Fees' house and was made to take cold showers "for 15 or 20 minutes" if he wet the bed.
He said the showers made him shake and Nyomi Fee told him to "stand still".
He also said he was made to hit the boy the women are accused of falsely blaming for Liam's death 20 times with an action figure, and was told by Nyomi Fee to "whack him really hard".
In previous evidence, he said the other boy was responsible for Liam's death because Nyomi Fee had told him so.
The jury has already been shown a video interview with that boy, who told police he had "strangled" Liam but that the toddler had been sitting up and watching television afterwards
Rachel Fee and Nyomi Fee, who are originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny a series of mistreatment and neglect charges against two other children, as well as the murder charge.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
