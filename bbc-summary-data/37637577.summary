Helen Bailey death: Partner denies murdering children's author

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The partner of children's author Helen Bailey has denied her murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Stewart, 55, appeared at St Albans Crown Court to enter the plea.
He was arrested in July of this year by officers searching the grounds of the home in Royston, Hertfordshire, he shared with the 51-year-old writer.
Mr Stewart, who also denies fraud, preventing the lawful and decent burial of a dead body, and three counts of perverting the course of justice, was remanded in custody.
Northumberland-born Miss Bailey, who created the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport books, was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April.
Her body was later discovered in a septic tank at the house, along with that of her pet dachshund, Boris.
Mr Stewart and Miss Bailey met through a Facebook group for bereavement in 2011 which Mr Stewart joined following the death of his wife Diane from an epileptic fit in 2010.
Miss Bailey's husband of 22 years, John Sinfield, drowned in 2011 during a holiday in Barbados.
Mr Stewart will go on trial early next year.
