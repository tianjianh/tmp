Gwen Smith, 64, said she went up to Mary Logie's flat in Leven, Fife, after hearing the noises.
She told a court that the woman accused of the murder, Sandra Weir, had answered the door of Ms Logie's flat.
Ms Weir denies murder and has lodged a special defence of alibi claiming she was elsewhere in Leven at the time.
Ms Smith told the High Court in Edinburgh that she lived directly downstairs from the pensioner and went upstairs to see what was going on after hearing "hammering" noises.
On the third day of the trial, Ms Smith said she had then come across a "horrible situation."
She told prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice QC: "Sandra says to me 'she's fell and there's blood everywhere.'
"I said 'it's alright calm down I will go and see' and then I opened the door and there's Mary."
Ms Smith said that Ms Logie was lying on the floor of her living room.
When Mr Prentice asked her if she saw an item lying nearby, Ms Smith replied: "A rolling pin on the couch."
Ms Weir denies eight charges, including murder.
The trial also heard from a man who told the court he had sold Ms Weir drugs on a number of occasions.
Before giving evidence, Mr Prentice told Aaron Robertson, 44, that if any of his answers implicated him, he guaranteed him immunity from prosecution.
Mr Robertson said Ms Weir was visually impaired and would come to his home with a guide dog to buy drugs.
He said he gave her heroin four or five times in January, charging Â£70 for a 16th of an ounce.
He said Ms Weir had built up a debt of Â£320, which was paid off on 14 January.
The trial at the High Court in Edinburgh continues.
