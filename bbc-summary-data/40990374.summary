The home side took the lead when Roarie Deacon went down easily under a Steven Whittaker challenge and Kevin Holt dispatched the resulting penalty kick.
Whittaker made up for that with a fine low cross that was turned in by Anthony Stokes via defender Kerr Waddell's toe.
Hibs came closest to a winner, but goalkeeper Scott Bain was in fine form.
Dundee, who had lost their first three Premiership games of the season, move off the bottom of the table, one point ahead of Partick Thistle.
Hibs stay in fifth place, now equal on points with Hamilton Academical, who had ended the Edinburgh side's 12-game unbeaten run last weekend.
After that home defeat, head coach Neil Lennon was looking for a vastly improved performance against a side yet to get off the mark.
But slack play by the Hibees defence has been their Achilles heel so often and it once again proved the case.
As Deacon teased Whittaker, the former Rangers and Norwich City full-back stuck out his left leg and, with the Dundee midfielder going to ground, it left referee Don Robertson with a simple decision.
Holt slammed the ball home from the spot to give the hosts the lead.
Bain in the home goal was showing the type of form that led to his inclusion in Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad last year.
The 25-year-old pulled off a string of stunning saves that kept the Dundee goal intact.
However, when the Edinburgh side made the breakthrough, they had a fair slice of fortune going their way.
Whittaker floated a cross into the box and Stokes diverted the ball goalwards and the final touch came off the leg of Waddell with Bain left stranded on his line.
Hibs felt they had fair claims for a penalty when Scott Allan handled the ball as Stokes strode forward, but the referee again waved play on despite the protests from the visiting players.
The second half continued on a similar vein, with Bain denying Marvin Bartley and Brandon Barker.
Chances at the other end were few and far between, but Faissal El-Bakhtoui did go close to a winner.
The Dundee striker's effort from 18 yards drifted inches the wrong side of the post to leave both teams with a point at the end of a pulsating 90 minutes.
Dundee manager Neil McCann: "I am happy with a point. I'm not going to say we weren't up against it. Hibs are a good side.
"What Hibs were doing, they were coming in narrow and trying to strangle the game.
"Today, Neil Lennon will maybe think he deserved three points, but I'm delighted that we got one.
"Scott Bain was terrific. I have been so impressed with him since I came in."
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "There was only one team in it.
"Once we gave our weekly goal away, we played great.
"We dominated the game and I'm disappointed not to win it. The level of performance was superb.
"Their keeper was man of the match and we were a little wasteful in front of goal.
"We're new to the league and it says a lot that we're disappointed not to win this one. We bombarded Dundee."
