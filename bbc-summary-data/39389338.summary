Rochdale 1-1 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Anderson rescued a point for Northampton with a stoppage-time equaliser at Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was forgettable fare with neither side showing the quality or ambition to carve out a genuine opening.
The best half-chance fell to Nathaniel Mendez-Laing just before the break when he was played in by Steven Davies, but David Buchanan rescued the Cobblers, putting Mendez-Laing off his stride as he shaped to shoot.
In a low-key affair of few chances, the home side looked to have secured the points when Mendez-Laing curled home a neat finish from the edge of the area in the 57th minute.
Anderson sent a side-footed attempt narrowly wide of Conrad Logan's post and went even closer minutes later when his firm header towards the roof of the net was palmed away by the Dale goalkeeper.
But Anderson raced onto a hopeful punt upfield by Adam Smith and lifted the ball over a stranded Logan to give the visitors a draw three minutes into time added on.
