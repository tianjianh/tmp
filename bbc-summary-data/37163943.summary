Fire crews attended the property in Lewis Terrace in Mill o' Mains shortly after 19:00 on Monday.
The housing association building was unoccupied at the time and is understood to have been in the process of being adapted for a disabled tenant.
Police Scotland said "extensive damage" was caused to the building and have appealed for witnesses.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue spokesperson said: "On arrival, crews were faced with a timber framed house under construction which was engulfed in flames.
"The heat from the fire was so intense that it began to affect the guttering, fascias and windows of two neighbouring properties.
"Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze using four jets and remained at the scene throughout the evening to dampen the area down."
