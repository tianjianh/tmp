Tottenham and Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama was honoured in Tanzania on Saturday by having a street named after him in Dar es Salaam.

But the gesture looks to have been short-lived as local websites showed a picture of the street sign being taken away the following day.
A statement from the local Ubungo council said procedures to rename a street had not been observed.
There has been no reaction so far from Wanyama, who turned 26 on Sunday.
The footballer was in Tanzania on holiday and had attended a local tournament in the suburb of Ubungo.
Tottenham signed Wanyama from Southampton last July for $11m on a five-year deal.
BBC Africa football correspondent Stanley Kwenda says that Wanyama is the poster boy of East African football, and that in the absence of a strong national football team from the region he is the face of the game there.
