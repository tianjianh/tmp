But the figures from National Records of Scotland showed there was wide variation across the country in the length of time people live.
They also showed that people in the most deprived areas died sooner.
East Dunbartonshire had the highest life expectancy in Scotland, while the lowest was in Glasgow.
The figures, which covered 2011-13, showed:
Tim Ellis, National Records of Scotland chief executive, said: "This report shows that life expectancy continues to vary widely across Scotland.
"People living in rural areas, in general, live longer than those in more urban areas.
"Men in the least deprived areas of Scotland may live 12.5 years longer than those in the most deprived areas while women in the least deprived areas could expect to live 8.5 years longer than those in the most deprived."
