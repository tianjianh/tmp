World Twenty20 2016: Porterfield says Ireland can regroup from Oman defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland captain William Porterfield said his team's shock World Twenty20 defeat by newcomers Oman was "hard to take" but insisted that they can regroup to progress to the main draw.

The Irish must beat Bangladesh on Friday to keep their hopes alive after Wednesday's dramatic two-wicket defeat.
"As long as Oman lose a game, to a large extent, it's still going to be in our own hands," said Porterfield.
"We've got to win our next two games and keep an eye on the run rate."

Chasing 155, Oman openers Zeeshan Maqsood and Khawar Ali added 69 and Aamer Ali's 32 from 17 balls helped steer the minnows to victory in Dharamsala.
Oman needed 14 from the final over but two Max Sorensen no-balls, one of which went for four and another which went for four byes, helped seal a dramatic victory.
Porterfield's decision not to give former England Test player Boyd Rankin his full possible four overs looked questionable as Sorensen was punished at the death after Tim Murtagh had been clubbed for 20 in the 17th over.
The Irish captain defended his decision to hand the late overs to Murtagh and Sorensen and said the slippery ball in the moist conditions may have been a factor in Ireland's implosion.

"A lot of the lads have been there and done in that scenario. Whether the ball was slippery at the end, I'm not sure," added the Ireland captain.

"We just didn't get it quite right in that last four or five overs."
Opener Porterfield had failed to get off the mark in the first over of Ireland's innings before his 29 helped the Irish reach 154-5.
"We felt that getting over 150 was a decent effort but it didn't prove to be enough," continued Porterfield.
"We've been in this kind of position before when we've lost the first game in qualifiers and then fought back to win 10 games in 11 days.
"A lot of the team have been involved in those campaigns so we will now aim to get back on track on Friday."
