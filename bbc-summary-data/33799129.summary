[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gertie the Jack Russell was left stranded on a rock after chasing a flock of birds into the sea in Sunderland on Wednesday afternoon.
RNLI lifeguard Joe Wilson rescued her after the water came up to her chest and she was too scared to swim back.
Mr Wilson said Gertie was "stressed and shaking" when he reached her but she seemed "very happy" to see him.
She was not injured in the incident.
Mr Wilson added: "Gertie had raced into the sea and had become so distracted by chasing birds that she got caught out by the tide.
"Our charity's lifeguards assist with animal rescues to prevent owners from putting themselves in danger. We were very happy to get Gertie's paws back on dry land and offered her owners some friendly safety advice about tide times."
