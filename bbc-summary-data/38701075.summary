Bromley 3-1 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley came from behind to crush Southport and bounce back from two straight defeats in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Wright broke the deadlock for the visitors after a quiet opening period, making the most of a defensive mix up to give Southport the lead after 22 minutes.
That only spurred the hosts into action, with Charlton loanee Brandon Hanlan notching a debut goal to make it 1-1 two minutes later.
Louis Dennis then gave Bromley the lead in the 49th minute and Hanlan helped himself to his second of the afternoon five minutes later to seal the win.
