Twelve coconuts, a packet of biscuits, half a bag of carrots and unsold shop-made cakes are some of the unwanted food items being given away in Cardiff.

They are available via a new location-based food app which connects neighbours in the city and beyond.
The aim of users is to cut waste.
Olio app's Saasha Celestial-One told BBC Radio Wales the idea came about when her co-founder was moving home and did not know what to do with unused food she did not want to throw away.
She told the Jason Mohammad programme: "Not only does preventing good food from going to waste feel amazing, it's a really fun way to get to know new people in the community."
Since its launch in January, over 66,000 people have downloaded the app with plans to expand into 33 more countries.
Individuals and Cardiff eateries have signed up, with leftover bread and unsold cakes being offered.
"Katherine" is offering 12 coconuts bought wholesale and which "survived a coconut shy unharmed - free to a good home". They are available for collection from Adamsdown.
As well as half a bag of carrots at Bute Street, there is a packet of unopened biscuits left over from a coffee morning at Ninian Park.
And they could be washed down with tea being given away by "Luce", near Cathays station.
She has 18 beetroot tea bags remaining from a box of 20, saying they were "bought to be adventurous - but I don't like it".
