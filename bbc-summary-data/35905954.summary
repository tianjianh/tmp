Unionist politicians have said they will be contacting the police after masked republicans took part in an Easter parade in Lurgan, County Armagh.

The parade took place from the Kilwilkie estate to St Colman's Cemetery in the town on Saturday.
DUP councillor Carla Lockhart said it was "deeply concerning" and she would speak to police about the incident.
"The days of masked men parading through our streets should be gone," she said.
The TUV's Roy Ferguson said: "This is a totally unacceptable state of affairs and I will be contacting the PSNI to demand an explanation as to why the terrorist show of strength was permitted to take place and how they propose to bring those involved before the courts.
"It was predictable that the events of this weekend would be used to glorify terrorism. I hope that Lurgan hasn't sent the standard for the PSNI response."
