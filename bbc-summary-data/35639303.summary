[SN]TITLE[SN]
Compulsory purchase order for new Welborne development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Landowners will be forced to sell hundreds of acres of land so work on a major housing development in Hampshire can begin, a council has agreed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 6,000 new homes are planned on 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of land close to the M27 in Welborne, Fareham.
The borough council voted in favour of imposing compulsory purchase orders for the land at a meeting on Monday.
The move came despite opposition from the landowners and hundreds of people living nearby.
Plans for the site also include 30% affordable housing, one new secondary and three new primary schools, health facilities, shops, offices, warehouses, play areas and allotments.
Subject to planning permission, it is hoped work on the site could start in 2019.
