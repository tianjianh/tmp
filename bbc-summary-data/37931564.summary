Australian-born Frizell, 25, is Welsh qualified via his father and has won five caps.
He can continue to represent Wales as they are a tier two nation and Australia are tier one.
"I'd love to play for Australia for as long as I can but if I wasn't playing for them I'd be playing for Wales," he said.
The second row described his debut for Australia against New Zealand in October as a "dream come true" but says he would be happy to play for Wales again in the future.
"Being part of the Wales squad was awesome for my experience," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"It was a stepping stone for myself and a massive part of my development.
In the summer Frizell became the first Wales international to play in Australia's State of Origin competition, regarded as the highest level of rugby league in the world.
He also extended his contract with the St George Illawarra Dragons until 2020.
Next year the Rugby League World Cup will feature both Australia and Wales, who secured their place with victory over Italy.
But it could be the autumn before Frizell knows whether he will be a part of either squad.
"I guess it is kind of weird," he said. "I want to be playing for Australia but if things don't work out I'd love to play for Wales.
"Whatever jersey I put on I'll do the best I can for the team."
Wales Rugby League said it was "saddened" to see Frizell play for Australia but supported his decision.
"Tyson was a strong player in the WRL camp and brought a lot of power, pace and passion when pulling on the red shirt of Wales," a spokesman said.
"We are saddened to see him play for Australia but by Tyson leaving [head coach] John Kear has been able to develop another young Welsh player in his place."
Australia play England in their final Four Nations pool match on Sunday, needing to win to stand any chance of reaching the final.
