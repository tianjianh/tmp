The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) signed off on funding for the museum in 2013.
There had been controversy over an apparent delay in the department confirming its funding.
Conal McFeely, chair of the Bloody Sunday Trust, said: "We are delighted.
"We have been working towards this regeneration of the Museum of Free Derry for many years, and it is a very exciting time for us as we now enter the final stages of achieving our goal.
"I would like to thank all of the funders, the staff and present and past board members of the Bloody Sunday Trust who have worked with us to get to this stage.
"We look forward to continue working with them as we complete the rebuilding of the museum. This marks a significant new beginning for the host community.
"The Museum of Free Derry is recognised as one of the integral and most successful parts of the heritage and tourism sector in Derry and is also an important part of the community and social economy sector in this city.
"This investment, in one of the most deprived areas of the city, will help bring about a major improvement for this area, and will enable us to tell the history of this area."
The redeveloped museum will be based in the Bogside area of the city.
