[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Ipswich Town have signed Everton winger Conor Grant on a season-long loan deal.

Grant, 21, has yet to make a first-team appearance for the Toffees, but scored four goals in 22 games on loan at Doncaster in League One last season.
He follows the signing of Tottenham winger Grant Ward on Monday.
"He gives us a bit of balance. He's more of a left-side of midfield player than a flying winger," Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk.
"He's very talented, has a wonderful left foot and impressed everybody with his free-kicks and corners in training."
