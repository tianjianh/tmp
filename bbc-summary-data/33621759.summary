The match on 14 January will be the American basketball league's sixth regular-season game in the capital.
Orlando played two pre-season games in London in 2003, while the Raptors played there twice in 2011 as the NBA visited Europe for the first time.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver said: "This underscores our commitment to growing basketball in the region."
