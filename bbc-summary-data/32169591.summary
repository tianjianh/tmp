Crafted in the shape of the letter Y for Yorkshire, the trophy will be handed to the winner of the inaugural event, which runs from 1 to 3 May.
It has been designed and made by Thomas Fattorini Ltd - a company originally founded in Yorkshire in 1827.
Earlier this month, Sir Bradley Wiggins confirmed his intention to ride in the race.
The trophy was unveiled at Brudenell Primary School in Leeds earlier.
Tom Fattorini, director of sales and marketing, said: "We do business internationally, supplying trophies to the likes of FIFA, and when we were invited to support the production of the Tour de Yorkshire trophy and medals we felt it was a perfect fit given our Yorkshire history."
The Tour will begin on 1 May with a stage from Bridlington to Scarborough, followed by Selby to York on 2 May, and Wakefield to Leeds on 3 May.
There will be more than 500km (310 miles) of racing through Yorkshire over the three days.
