PDC World Championship draw: Gary Anderson to face Mark Frost in round one

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's Gary Anderson will begin the defence of his PDC World Championship title against qualifier Mark Frost.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anderson beat England's Adrian Lewis in the 2016 final and is aiming to win the event for the third year in succession.
World number one Michael van Gerwen will play Ross Snook or Kim Viljanen in the first round, while 16-time world champion Phil Taylor is up against either John Bowles or David Platt.
The tournament runs from 15 December to 2 January at London's Alexandra Palace.
It is the 10th time the PDC's showpiece event will be staged at the venue, following its move from the Circus Tavern in Purfleet for the 2008 competition.
Seventy-two players will compete for a record first prize of Â£350,000.
Stoke's Frost was one of four players to secure their spots at the World Championship at the final qualifying event in Wigan on Monday.
Anderson, 45, could become only the third player in darts history to achieve three consecutive World Championship wins.
Eric Bristow (1984-86) did so before the sport split into two governing bodies, after which Taylor (1995-2002) and (2004-2006) twice achieved the feat in the Professional Darts Corporation version of the World Championship.
