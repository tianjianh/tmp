Shane Duggan hit the top corner on 12 minutes to put Limerick ahead as Derry struggled to get into their stride.
City improved and deservedly levelled on the hour courtesy of McNamee's pinpoint free-kick before both sides went close to a late winner.
Derry, who stay fifth, have now gone six matches without a win.
However, there are signs of improvement with a second straight draw following four defeats.
The teams were back at Maginn Park after the original fixture in February was abandoned because of a floodlight failure.
Derry made a sluggish start and were punished when Duggan played a one-two with Paul O'Conor before smashing in the opener.
Limerick were bossing affairs but Derry stepped up the tempo before the break and were the better side in the second half.
McNamee displayed his set-piece prowess by flighting the ball over the wall before the ball nestled in the side of Limerick's net.
The visitors remained a threat and City keeper Gerard Doherty produced excellent saves to deny Rodrigo Tosi and Chris Mulhall.
Derry pressed in the closing minutes and Ronan Curtis saw his strike tipped over by Brendan Clarke.
McNamee and Curtis also had goal-bound shots blocked and as Limerick held on to remain a point clear of City.
