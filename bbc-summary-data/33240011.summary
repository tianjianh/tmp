[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called to the semi-detached house in Anniesland's Fifth Avenue at about 03:30 on Monday.
Fire crews were met with a "well-developed" blaze in one of the bedrooms from where the man was recovered.
He was treated at the scene for severe burns and smoke inhalation and later pronounced dead in hospital. The fire is believed to have been caused by a cigarette setting bedding alight.
Specialist officers from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Investigation Unit are working to establish the full circumstances surrounding the blaze.
Asst Ch Officer Lewis Ramsay said: "In the wake of this tragedy everyone's thoughts will of course be with the man's family and friends.
"The loss of life through fire in the home will certainly be felt across the community and it will profoundly touch many people.
"We must all be asking ourselves if we know someone who could be at risk and thinking about those who are older, who have health conditions or who live alone and might be a bit isolated."
He urged anyone who knew an elderly or vulnerable person who needed help to reduce fire risk to contact the fire service.
