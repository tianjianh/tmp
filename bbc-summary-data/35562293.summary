Men deny attempted murder of Aberdeen brothers in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have gone on trial charged with attempted murder after brothers from Aberdeen were stabbed in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Ellis, 31, and a 17-year-old youth who cannot be named for legal reasons deny assaulting the brothers at Wardieburn Street West last April.
The High Court in Livingston heard Peter Stewart, 43, suffered a stab wound through the heart and would have died without emergency surgery.
His brother James, 45, was also found to have a stab wound.
The trial before Lord Glennie is expected to last several days.
