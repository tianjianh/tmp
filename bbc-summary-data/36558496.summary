Let it Shine, co-presented by Graham Norton and Mel Giedroyc, will search for a band to take part in a stage show featuring the music of Take That.
Barlow will be joined by three mentors each week in the eight-week run.
The announcement comes after the BBC lost the rights to their Saturday night talent show The Voice to ITV.
A statement about the show said they will be looking for people who "exude the charisma, showmanship and stage presence" of Take That.
Barlow said the secret to the band's success was their chemistry, which is what they will be looking for with the new show.
"Back in 1989, we were just a group of normal guys from Manchester who came together.
"The secret to our success was that each of us brought something different to the group and that the five of us had real chemistry.
"Now with Let It Shine we're looking for people from all walks of life to form another unique group who can recreate that magic. If you think you've got what it takes, we want to see it!"
Graham Norton has hosted a number of talent search shows for the BBC, including finding stars of Oliver!, The Sound of Music and The Wizard of Oz.
He said he believes this show will follow in their successful footsteps.
"The combination of the BBC, everyone's favourite band and Saturday nights made this an offer I simply couldn't refuse. If I wasn't a part of Let It Shine, I know I would be watching it at home - this way I just get the best seat in the house."
The press release for the new programme reveals footage seen on 30 May, when Gary Barlow surprised shoppers in Bristol with an impromptu concert, was a promotion for the new show.
Charlotte Moore, BBC Controller of TV Channels said they hope the show "will bring families together to celebrate Britain's love of musical theatre, combining singing, performance and dance in a hotly contested search to find a new group."
