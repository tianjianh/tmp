[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 2-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Omar Bogle scored twice before missing an injury-time penalty against 10-man Barnet, as Marcus Bignot picked up his first point as Grimsby Town manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grimsby striker Bogle saw his curling, left-footed free-kick tipped over the crossbar by Jamie Stephens before he opened the scoring after he burst past two defenders and had his shot deflected off Elliot Johnson and into the net.
And he doubled the lead 10 minutes before the interval when a mistake by Harry Taylor allowed Bogle to run free and beat Stephens.
The Bees got themselves back into the game in the 50th minute when Akinde burst into the box and was brought down by Josh Gowling. Akinde picked himself up to dispatch the penalty past James McKeown.
Akinde then levelled from the spot five minutes later after Danny Collins fouled Curtis Weston.
Ryan Watson then squandered two chances to win it for Barnet before the late drama.
Barnet were reduced to 10 men in the 90th minute when Ali Sesay, who had only been on the pitch for five minutes, was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Scott Vernon.
Grimsby were then given a golden chance to win it two minutes into stoppage time when Michael Nelson brought down Gowling, but Bogle sent his spot-kick over the bar.
