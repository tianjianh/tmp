A proposed new flight from City of Derry Airport (CoDA) to Dublin has been cancelled as a result of the Brexit vote.

The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.
A spokesperson from CoDA confirmed that Citywing's proposed new service had become "commercially difficult" since the vote.
Discussions will now take place between the airport and other potential carriers.
The flight was originally announced by the Isle of Man-based regional carrier Citywing in March 2015.
It was due to begin its new service in October but was delayed on numerous occasions.
The proposed new route was to be part funded by the Governments Regional Air Connectivity Fund.
Citywing has not yet issued the BBC with a statement, but a spokesperson from CoDA confirmed the loss on Friday.
"The impact of the referendum vote in favour of Brexit has led to significant devaluation in the pound sterling, given that the airline industry operates in Euro and Dollars, the economics of the route deteriorated to a position which has made the operation of this route commercially difficult."
The spokesperson added that while this was "clearly disappointing news for the Airport and for the passengers", it remained optimistic in future efforts to secure the route.
In August, Ryanair announced it would be reducing its service to London Stansted.
