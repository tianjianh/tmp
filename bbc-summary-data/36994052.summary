[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-0 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry and Shrewsbury picked up their first points of the season but are both yet to find the net in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coventry dominated the first half without really troubling Shrewsbury keeper Jayson Leutwiler.
Kyel Reid blazed an effort wide when he should have scored while Andy Rose headed the wrong side of the post.
Shrewsbury had to up their game in the second half, a couple of changes at the break giving them a much-needed spark.
Louis Dodds shot over in the 51st minute before having an effort deflected wide 60 seconds later.
Coventry should have taken the lead just after the hour mark but Rose's shot from an angle took a nick off a Shrewsbury defender.
The home side then had to play the rest of the game with 10 men after Sky Blues substitute Kwame Thomas was stretchered off on 81 minutes after going down heavily after a challenge on the halfway line.
Ivan Toney could have won it at the death for the visitors but smacked against the bar from 12 yards before Coventry old boy Jim O'Brien then missed an easy chance.
