Dagenham & Redbridge: Striker Mason Bloomfield rejoins from Aveley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge have signed striker Mason Bloomfield from Isthmian League club Aveley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old graduated from the Daggers' academy and made an appearance in League Two against Northampton in September 2014.
He left in August 2015 before spells at Chelmsford, Grays, and Brentwood.
Dagenham boss John Still said: "We will be loaning him back out to Aveley, but we will look to him as one for the future."
Bloomfield was just 17 when he came on as a substitute against Northampton and had played in a youth-team game earlier that day.
He has featured in several behind-closed-door friendlies for Dagenham this season after impressing for Aveley.
Still told the club's website: "The person who recommended him to the club was actually the person who told us about Dwight Gayle and we brought Dwight in the same way as Mason."
He is the second striker to join Dagenham this week, after they paid an undisclosed fee for Eastbourne Borough forward Elliott Romain.
