The 31-year-old had an operation in his native Argentina to remove his left testicle in September after the discovery of a tumour, before undergoing chemotherapy treatment.
Writing in Spanish on Twitter, the Argentina international said: "Today I was given a medical discharge.
"Thank you very much to all who accompanied me at this time."
Newcastle expressed their joy at the news on social media, writing: "Everyone at #NUFC is delighted to share the news that @elgalgojonas has been discharged from hospital in Argentina."
Gutierrez, who had a spell on loan at Norwich last season, has scored 10 goals in 177 league appearances for the Magpies since joining the club in 2008.
He became a fans' favourite when he played a starring role in helping the club win the Championship in his second season in the north-east.
After being largely overlooked by manager Alan Pardew last season, Gutierrez joined Norwich for the second half of the campaign, where he made his last league appearance in a 1-0 defeat by West Bromwich Albion in April.
