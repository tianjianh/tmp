[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former pupil of a special-needs school has been given a suspended sentence after being convicted of sexual offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Stephenson, 25, of Reading, was found guilty of six counts following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court.
He was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years.
Offences included sexual assault on a male under 13. They took place when he was a pupil at Stanbridge Earls School, Hampshire, and in Aberystwyth.
Hayley Porter-Straw, of the Crown Prosecution, said: "This was a complex case where the defendant abused children over a period of 10 years.
"Gareth Stephenson was himself a vulnerable adult who suffers from ADHD. It is disturbing that he started abusing children when he was a child aged 11."
She added: "When he was aged 15 he started abusing young fellow pupils, some of whom were two years younger than him. He would bribe them and punch them if they refused to submit to his sexual requests."
When he was 18, Stephenson sexually assaulted a 12-year-old boy when he went back to Wales.
He was given a 12-month supervision order and was ordered to do 175 hours of unpaid work.
During the trial he was found not guilty of a further three counts of sexual activity with a male child under 16.
Stephenson, of Anstey Road, Reading, was sentenced at Salisbury Crown Court.
Stanbridge Earls closed in 2014. The independent school, which once commanded fees of Â£40,000 a year, taught 191 boarding and day pupils with special needs, aged from 10 to 19.
He will be on the sexual offender register for 10 years and has received a sexual harm prevention order for five years.
