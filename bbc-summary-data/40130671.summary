The brawl broke out at about 23:00 BST on Thursday in the Jourdain Road area of Blackbird Leys.
Police officers found a man in his late 20s with serious injuries at the scene. He was taken to hospital but later died.
Thames Valley Police said his next of kin have been informed and it was "pursuing many lines of inquiry".
Senior investigating officer, Det Chief Insp Ailsa Kent, of the major crime unit, added: "We are appealing for the public's help and would advise anyone who may have information that could relate to this serious incident to come forward.
"As a result of the incident you will see an increased police presence in the area whilst our investigation is ongoing and also to provide reassurance to members of the public."
Resident Estelle Bishop, who placed flowers at the scene, said she was "shocked and overwhelmed".
"I couldn't believe it because it's only over the road from where I live," she added.
"It's not a thing that happens on Blackbird Leys. Not like this anyway, where they've died."
