Nine pupils from Portadown College, County Armagh, aged between 14 and 17, were assaulted on Sunday.
Five were treated in hospital but the school's principal said none of them was seriously injured.
The students had travelled to the city as part of the school's annual trip to attend football matches in Manchester, as Gordon Adair reports.
