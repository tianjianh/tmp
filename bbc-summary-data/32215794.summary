Labour's non-dom pledge unravels?
Footage emerges of shadow chancellor Ed Balls telling BBC Radio Leeds in January: "If you abolish the whole status it will end up costing Britain money because some people will leave the country."
For sale: a general election "battle bus", at the bargain price of Â£25,000. It weighs 18-tonnes, is bombproof, has fewer than 14,000 miles on the clock and counts among its previous owners, the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She used it during the 1983 general election campaign.
It's not the only bus to have caused excitement in this election campaign. Labour's "Woman to Woman" campaign bus was derided when it was first unveiled, with much of the criticism reserved for the colour.
Labour's Harriet Harman defended the pink hue, saying it was important to make sure the bus was conspicuous.
Labour leader Ed Miliband: "Stop defending the indefensible and abolish the non-dom rule - it's the right thing for the country."
Chancellor George Osborne, on Labour's non-dom proposal: "If you look at what Ed Miliband has announced today, it is a total shambles. Within hours the policy has unravelled."
Beth Rigby, deputy political editor, Financial Times tweets: "Like a chocolate truffle wrapped in gold leaf, non-dom status is nice to have, hard to justify."
Tory MEP Daniel Hannan writes in the Daily Mail: "What the blithering flip was he thinking? How did Tony Blair imagine that it would help Ed Miliband if he were to pop up mid-election and remind us that Labour is too disdainful of ordinary voters to ask their opinion on EU membership?"
