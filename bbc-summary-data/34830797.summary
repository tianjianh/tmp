The 38-year-old, who won six La Liga crowns and three Champions League titles, helped New York Cosmos beat the Ottawa Fury 3-2 to win the North American Soccer League Bowl.
"It was my last game in my career," the former Spain striker said.
"I'm very proud of everything I did. For me now, I start a new life with another project. I'm happy, but I'm also very sad."
Raul left Spanish giants Real in 2010 after 16 years as a professional at the club.
The Spaniard, who also played at Germany's Schalke and Al Sadd in Qatar, was Real's record scorer with 323 goals until last month when Cristiano Ronaldo took over the honour.
