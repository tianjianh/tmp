A man who was evicted from his home in a row over mortgage repayments has been barred from making future claims in court against repossession.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Crawford, 64, was evicted from his house in Carlton in July following a disagreement with his mortgage lender.
Dozens turned out to support Mr Crawford who disputed claims he owed Bradford & Bingley Â£43,000.
He told the High Court his house had been "stolen" but the judge said this was "totally without merit".
Mr Crawford told the court in London that the decision to remove him from his house was illegal and he had been "put through hell'.
He said: "As far as I am concerned, the property is still my property, still my wife's property, and you can't sell stolen property."
Mr Justice Phillips disagreed and made an order which prevents Mr Crawford from making court claims in the future.
He said: "I am entirely satisfied that Mr Crawford has persistently issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.
"And, unless the court otherwise orders, he will continue to make applications and claims which are totally without merit."
In July, protesters gathered as bailiffs, under police protection, took possession of the house in Fearn Chase.
Mr Crawford claimed he had paid off the endowment mortgage he took out in 1988, adding the terms were changed without his knowledge.
People from across the UK joined a Facebook group called We Are All Tom Crawford, against the eviction.
