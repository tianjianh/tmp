[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn "has a heck of a lot of learn" but is learning, one of his shadow ministers has said.

Caerphilly MP Wayne David was speaking after controversy over Mr Corbyn's comments on a "shoot to kill' policy.
Mr David told BBC Wales Mr Corbyn "needs to think carefully before he makes such utterances" in future.
Mr David said he believed lethal force to be justifiable against an imminent threat to human life where there was no other alternative.
"I think that was the case in Paris and I think it's the justification internationally for the drone attacks that we've seen in the recent past," he said.
Mr David, shadow minister for political reform, justice and Scotland, continued: "I think that Jeremy is new in the post, there are representations being made to him.
"I amongst others made forceful representations to him after last night's PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] meeting and I think he needs to think carefully before he makes such utterances, as he's thinking carefully about the utterance he has made."
Mr David said he welcomed the "frank and open discussions" Labour was now having under Mr Corbyn.
"It also means that he's very much on a learning curve, he's been a backbencher all his parliamentary career, he has a heck of a lot of learn in a very short time but I am pleased to say he is learning," he added.
