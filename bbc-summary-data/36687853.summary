"I had a lot of fun tonight," Ledecky said. "I just wanted to push myself and see what I could do."
Carlin secured Britain's fifth swimming medal in Rio.
Siobhan-Marie O'Connor in the 200m individual medley and the men's team in the 4x200m freestyle relay also won silver.
Adam Peaty is Britain's only gold medallist so far after winning the 100m breaststroke gold.
"I couldn't do it without my family," said Carlin after the race. "They have been there through the tough times and it is nice that they can be here.
