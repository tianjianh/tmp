[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield and Cleethorpes train conductor dispute settled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Industrial action by more than 40 train conductors on the Transpennine Express route between Sheffield and Cleethorpes has been cancelled, the RMT union said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dispute with the train operator was over the dismissal of Glen Watson, a conductor on the service.
Transpennine Express said Mr Watson's employment had now ended on "mutually accepted terms".
The RMT said all local protests were over and thanked members for their support during the dispute.
Three 24-hour strikes had been held.
The dispute started when Mr Watson was dismissed after a train-surfing incident at Cleethorpes station.
Transpennine Express said the conductor did not force the train to stop and deal with the matter properly.
The train operator has agreed to discuss a new policy at a joint safety committee for dealing with such problems, said the RMT.
