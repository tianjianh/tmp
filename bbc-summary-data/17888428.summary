[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has regained the top batsman spot in the ICC Test rankings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chanderpaul hit 68 and 69 in the third Test against Australia in Dominica to earn 19 ratings points and move ahead of South Africa's AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis.
The 37-year-old from Guyana first topped the batting charts in July 2008.
He last held the top spot in May 2009 but dropped as low as 15th in June 2010 before his revival.
Chanderpaul will arrive in England this week for the Test series as the number one-ranked batsman, as he did in May 2009.
1. Shivnarine Chanderpaul (WI) 827 points
2. AB de Villiers (SA) 821
3. Jacques Kallis (SA) 819
4. Younus Khan (Pak) 797
5. Kumar Sangakkara (SL) 779
He passed the 10,000-run mark during the match in Dominica, becoming only the second Windies player and the 10th of all-time to reach the mark.
Australia's 75-run win on Friday in the match, which gave them a 2-0 win in the series, saw them move ahead of India into third place in the Test table.
South Africa's Dale Steyn retains top spot in the bowlers table, ahead of Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal and England's James Anderson.
