Mary Berry has "absolutely no plans to retire", her agent has said, after some reports suggested she only intends to work for one more year.

The Great British Bake Off judge, 81, is leaving the show when it moves to Channel 4 from the BBC next year.
Fiona Lindsay, Berry's agent for 25 years, said: "It has been reported that Mary only intends to work another year - that's simply wrong.
"She has lots of exciting projects coming up, including TV with the BBC."
It has already been announced that Berry will be a guest on James Martin's Christmas With Friends on the Food Network on 14 and 21 November.
She will also appear in the two Bake Off Christmas specials - which have already been recorded - when they air on the BBC later this year.
Berry quit The Great British Bake Off last week out of loyalty to the BBC, a few days after presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins also decided not to make the move to Channel 4.
Paul Hollywood is the only Bake Off star to have agreed to switch channels and stick with the show.
Channel 4 will begin airing the programme in 2017, starting with a celebrity special in aid of Stand Up To Cancer.
The channel signed a three-year deal earlier this month with Love Productions, which makes the programme.
The Great British Bake Off began life on BBC Two in 2010, where it became a firm favourite with viewers before moving to BBC One in 2014.
Last year's final was the UK's most watched television programme of the year, with 13.4 million viewers tuning in to see Nadiya Hussain win the competition.
