[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 4-1 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United scored four goals in a stirring second-half display as they fought back to beat Doncaster and climb off the bottom of the League One table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Debutant loan signing Gary McSheffrey put Rovers ahead in a drab first half, running through and calmly slotting in.
The U's did not manage a shot on target but were rampant in the second period and Chris Porter's strike made it 1-1.
A Elliott Lee curler and Alex Gilbey's fine strike earned a commanding lead before Richard Brindley sealed victory.
Doncaster would have moved out of the relegation zone with a win following Blackpool's draw with Bury and seemed well set after McSheffrey's cool finish.
But Colchester's astonishing second-half response earned just a seventh league win of a miserable season to take them above Crewe, who lost to Sheffield United.
