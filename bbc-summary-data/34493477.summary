Cameron McGeehan had put Luton ahead with his seventh goal of the season, nodding Sean Long's cross past debutant goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan.
But the home side fought back with two goals in the final 23 minutes.
Rhys Murphy equalised for the hosts with a header from Gwion Edwards' cross, before Matt Harrold's low shot from 20 yards completed their comeback.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"We go a goal down but we showed great character to bounce back, and the second-half performance is how I want this team to play with some tempo, desire, some energy and good passages of football.
"I think you saw the best of Matt Harrold, and Rhys Murphy playing off him looked really sharp. We stuck at it and I felt we played some decent football.
"We started the season quite well and then we had a dip in the first international break and we talked about last week's international break and wanting to turn the corner and making it a positive one.
"We've had to come from behind twice at home in two games and we played how I want us to play in the second half."
Luton Town manager John Still told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"We said at half-time that we felt we were comfortable and their only way back in would be sloppy passing from us and giving away free-kicks. In the second half we did both.
"We've played six games. Won four and drawn one. Am I disappointed with that? No I'm not, but I'm disappointed with the game today.
"We have two home games now. It'll be good to get back home. We've been good away from home. I've got no issues with playing home or away but it'll be good to be back home."
