A pregnant Israeli woman has been stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian man in a settlement in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military says.

The assailant was shot by the head of security at the Tekoa settlement, south of Jerusalem, after attacking the 30-year-old woman at a warehouse.
The woman was said to be in a moderate and stable condition in hospital.
The attack comes less than 24 hours after an Israeli woman was killed at another West Bank settlement.
Dafna Meir, a 39-year-old mother-of-six, was stabbed to death inside her home at Otniel after a struggle with the assailant, who reportedly fled to the nearby Palestinian village of Khirbet Karameh.
The Israeli military launched a manhunt following the attack, setting up roadblocks and telling residents to lock themselves inside their homes.
There were conflicting reports about the condition of the man who stabbed the woman at the Tekoa industrial zone on Monday.
Palestinian health ministry officials initially reported that he had died of his wounds, but later said he was in a serious condition in hospital.
The Israeli military confirmed he was receiving treatment in Jerusalem.
Twenty-seven Israelis have been killed in stabbing, shooting or car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since October.
At least 155 Palestinians have also been killed during that time. Israel says most were assailants, shot by their victims or security forces as they carried out attacks. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.
