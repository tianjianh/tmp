Swansea City: New boss Bob Bradley promises new start

New Swansea City manager Bob Bradley is promising a "fresh start" at the club.

Wales left-back Neil Taylor and Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero were among those marginalised under previous boss Francesco Guidolin.
Taylor has made only one appearance this season, and reacted angrily when he was substituted before half-time while Montero has not played a Premier League match.
"Whenever there's a change it's a fresh start for everybody," Bradley said.
With Swansea just one place above the relegation zone, the former United States boss inherited a squad including some disillusioned players.
Taylor's one start was against Chelsea in September and lasted less than a half, though Guidolin apologised to the player for the early substitution.
But Bradley hopes his arrival will give all players a chance to impress.
"You can see that on certain faces, that's clear," said Bradley.
"Even in a time in a season when it's been difficult, when there's been a managerial change, you see enthusiasm, fresh faces, you see a certain amount of excitement.
"That doesn't automatically mean because you've changed some things everything's going to come together right away but it's a start."
Bradley became the first American to manage in the Premier League when he succeeded Guidolin on 3 October.
Unlike the Italian, Bradley will have a say on transfer dealings at the Swans, who are 17th in the Premier League.
"I will be a part of the process. I listen, I have suggestions but most of the work so far has been digging my hands into the group here and getting to know them," he said.
"So far I haven't looked too far beyond Saturday but, yes, I did have some conversations with [chairman] Huw Jenkins. Now I've had a chance to speak with [head of recruitment] Dave Leadbeater, our scouts - so that's all establishing some start points."
