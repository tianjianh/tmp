Dr Aijaz Bashir Ashai admitted causing his victim to engage in sexual activity at the La Mon hotel in Belfast on 14 July.
At the time, Ashai was working for the Nepalese cricket team who were playing T20 World Cup qualifiers at Stormont.
Ashai, 42, was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for three years.
At Newtownards Magistrates Court, a prosecuting lawyer told how Ashai's victim had twice spurned his "sexual advances" during a massage at the hotel spa.
"She shouted 'no,' left the room immediately and told the manager, who saw the injured party exit the treatment room in a distressed state," said the lawyer.
Immediately after the incident, Ashai "apologised repeatedly" but was arrested by police who had been alerted.
The court heard that after he apologised for his behaviour, Ashai offered the woman a Â£10 tip, which was refused.
When arrested and questioned by police, Ashai, from Mumbai in India, accepted he had gone for a massage, but denied behaving in any sexual way.
He initially claimed the only time he touched the woman was to move her arm away from his inner leg as it became painful as she used her elbow on the muscle.
However in court, Ashai accepted his guilt and the prosecutor said that until now he had no convictions.
A defence solicitor told the court that he had been "expressly instructed to express his sincere remorse for the upset and distress that was suffered by this young lady," adding that it was "commendable" she had gone back to work so quickly after her ordeal.
He agreed that Ashai was "very fortunate" his victim had written what the judge said was "one of the most balanced victim impact statements I have seen".
The solicitor also agreed that it was "surprising" and an aggravating factor in the case "for a man in his position" to have behaved in this way, but he said that unlike many similar cases, there was an absence of other aggravating factors.
He revealed that Ashai had already been served with a notice that he will no longer be permitted to stay in the UK and that when he does return to India, he may have further professional sanctions.
The judge also ordered Ashai to pay Â£1,000 in compensation.
