[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knitwear firm has said there is "no solution" to save more than 50 production jobs at the Peter Scott site in Hawick.

Consultation with staff ended last month and there is now a "gradual decline" in worker numbers at the site.
A spokesman said employees had put forward several proposals but none could provide a "timely financial return to profitability".
About 12 staff have so far found alternative employment.
The company announced in May that it was considering ending its production operations at the Buccleuch Street site.
It has now confirmed that staff numbers are being reduced "as each section completes the work in front of them".
"Peter Scott will remain trading with the retention of nine members of staff with the proposal to outsource the ongoing product lines now being put into place," a spokesman added.
Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire MSP John Lamont renewed his call for the creation of an Enterprise Zone in the town.
"This is desperately sad news for those who are involved and unfortunately the latest in a string of closures in Hawick," he said.
"Textiles has such a rich heritage in Hawick that it certainly has a bright future, but it is clear that the industry is going through a difficult transition and that new highly skilled jobs must be found elsewhere.
"The most important thing for Hawick is that we attract new businesses to create much needed jobs, which is why we need meaningful action as soon as possible."
