A woman and her one-year-old baby were trapped in their home by a fire sparked by a candle that had not been properly blown out.

The pair were asleep in Manor Road, Colchester, when the woman was woken by the sound of the fire on the stairs.
They were rescued from an upstairs bedroom by firefighters and were both unharmed.
Acting station officer Ian Ryder said:"This fire could have had dire consequences."
The candle was in a scented oil burner which had not been properly extinguished when the woman went to bed, the fire service said.
Mr Ryder added: "As this oil burner was on the stairs it completely cut off their escape route.
"This is the third fire in Colchester we have been to in the last fortnight which was started by a candle.
"Make sure you use them safely and always put them properly out before you go to bed."
