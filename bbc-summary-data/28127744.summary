A man who beat his homeless love rival to death in a "jealous rage" has been jailed for life.

Brian Sharp, 55, of Manor Road, Folkestone, was told he would serve at least 18 years for murdering Tim Clayton in the Kent town last November.
Sharp's trial at Canterbury Crown Court heard he had become jealous about 45-year-old Mr Clayton's close friendship with his on-off girlfriend.
His victim was asleep behind a building when Sharp began his 12-minute attack.
Kent Police said Sharp, accompanied by his Staffordshire bull terrier, had attacked Mr Clayton as he slept at the rear of Europa House in Pound Way in the early hours of 9 November.
Sharp punched and kicked Mr Clayton for 12 minutes, before leaving the scene.
CCTV showed Mr Clayton, a father of two, getting up and checking himself in a car window before returning to go to sleep.
He was found unconscious several hours later by bank staff arriving for work and died in hospital the following day.
After the guilty verdict last week, Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham said: "This was a violent, callous and premeditated attack on a vulnerable man in the middle of the night.
"Sharp became consumed by jealously after learning of his girlfriend's friendship with Mr Clayton and he went out that night to hurt him.
"Mr Clayton didn't have a chance."
