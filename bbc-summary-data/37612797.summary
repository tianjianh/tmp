England's training camp in Brighton was "spot on" preparation for next month's autumn series despite several injuries, says vice-captain Mike Brown.

Wasps flanker Sam Jones broke his leg, Bath's Anthony Watson suffered a broken jaw, Exeter's fellow winger Jack Nowell tore a quad, while a handful of other players returned with minor knocks.
"We need that intensity when we meet up because international rugby is a step up," said the Harlequins full-back.
"It's training and things happen."
England's autumn internationals begin against South Africa on 12 November, with further matches against Fiji on 19 November, Argentina on 26 November and Australia on 3 December.
Jones, Watson and Nowell are set to miss all of those games, with Premiership Rugby releasing a statement saying: "England should not be doing full training sessions straight after a Premiership weekend."
But when asked whether the players were surprised by the nature of the training, Brown told BBC Radio 5 live: "No, not at all. That's what we expect when we go to international camp.
"It was spot on, there were guys there for the first time who really put their hands up, and there were those who have been there the whole time [under head coach Eddie Jones] that continued where we left off.
"It puts is in a good place in terms of our preparation for South Africa. We need to make sure the intensity there, and that's the whole point of these camps.
"It's unlucky people got injured and hopefully they get back on the pitch as soon as possible."
Meanwhile, Wasps boss Dai Young urged unity in the club against country row, with England head coach Eddie Jones set to meet directors of rugby this week.
"It's hugely important we work together," Young told BBC Radio 5 live. "It can't be an us-and-them scenario.
"I'm sure Eddie doesn't want players injured. No-one has any desire for this not to work as a partnership. We just need to learn from things."
