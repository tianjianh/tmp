The family of a schoolteacher from Leeds who was stabbed to death in her classroom have called for an independent inquiry into her death.

Ann Maguire, 61, was killed at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, in April 2014.
Sixteen-year-old pupil Will Cornick was jailed for a minimum of 20 years after admitting her murder.
Mrs Maguire's family said due to Cornick's guilty plea the evidence was never fully reviewed.
Mrs Maguire had taught at the school for 40 years and had been due to retire just months after she was killed.
Cornick, who was 15 at the time of the murder, had attacked her from behind, stabbing her seven times in the neck and back, as she was helping another pupil with their work.
Her husband, Don Maguire, said it was important to know whether anything could have been done to prevent her death.
"At the court hearing last year there was a guilty plea and so there was never a full criminal trial which went through all the evidence," he said.
"We believe that a comprehensive, open and independent statutory review examining all the information is crucial to learning lessons from this horrific incident which took place in front of many other pupils in school, traumatising pupils and staff and devastating our family.
"We know an independent inquiry won't bring Ann back but it will give us peace to know whether there was anything which could have been done to prevent her death so that other families don't have to suffer like us in future."
The Department for Education (DfE) said the Secretary of State understood the family's desire for an inquiry into "the tragic events".
"We understand that Leeds Safeguarding Children Board has already begun a two-stage learning lessons review which we trust will be open and full", the statement continued.
No decision would be taken until the review had taken place, the DfE said.
