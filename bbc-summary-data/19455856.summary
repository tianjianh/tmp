The pair joined Trevor Horn's band The Producers, with Oliver on drums, to play Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Relax.
More than 10,000 people are expected over the weekend at the Big Feastival at James's Churchill Heath Farm.
It comes after James hosted the Harvest Festival last year which led to financial losses.
The Britpop star, who now makes cheese, lent his name and his land to the event.
But despite being attended by the likes of David and Samantha Cameron, organiser Big Wheel folded, leaving 200 people out of pocket by a total of Â£1m.
Speaking at this year's event James said: "We learnt a lot from last year.
"I found out that Jamie was looking for somewhere to host the Big Feastival in the countryside. I was all over him.
"I said I've got the perfect venue. Music and food, I can definitely help you with that.
"I'm absolutely thrilled to bits. It looks like we've pulled it off."
Saturday night was headlined by Paloma Faith with Texas due to perform on Sunday.
Oliver, who organised the first Big Feastival event in London last year, said: "It's fantastic. We kicked the whole thing off in Clapham last year, but we wanted to bring the whole family thing to it and do camping, and Alex James has been very kind in lending us his back garden.
"What's nice is that I did it on my own last year. Alex did a festival on his own last year. Coming together, we've managed to help each other quite a lot."
The event is raising money for the Better Food Foundation.
