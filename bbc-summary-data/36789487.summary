CCTV captured the moment the men, armed with a shotgun and handgun, threatened two members of staff outside Janet Isherwood jewellers in Kay Street, Rawtenstall.
The men then forced their way into the shop, before escaping with the jewellery and driving towards Bacup.
Lancashire Police is appealing for anyone with information about Monday morning's robbery to come forward.
