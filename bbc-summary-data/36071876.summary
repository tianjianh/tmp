Asda will add 25 new products to its shelves as part of the contract, which is worth more than Â£850,000 in total.
The firm said it would make it the largest single retailer of craft beers and ales in the country.
The supermarket's regional buying manager for Scotland, Brian O'Shea, said more customers were choosing "premium beers".
"The craft beer culture continues to grow, and it's clear customers are trading up to more premium beers, particularly ones which come from local brands," he said.
"The new lines we have launched are all premium quality and will give customers a new more local choice, with a variety of flavours to suit every palate and occasion."
The deal means that Asda will sell more than 75 Scottish beers, ales and ciders at its stores.
The breweries that are involved in the deal are:
Asda said it had worked with Craft Beer Clan, which promotes Scottish beer, to secure the new range of drinks.
Heather McDonald, owner of WooHa Brewing Company, said: "Although we're currently one of the youngest microbreweries in Scotland having just celebrated our first anniversary, this new deal is a great example of the supermarket's commitment to supporting Scottish suppliers no matter how big or small the brand."
Meanwhile, a family-owned farm in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire has agreed a deal to supply Aldi stores in Scotland with cold-pressed rapeseed oil.
Mackintosh of Glendaveny is to be on shelves now across Aldi's 65 Scottish stores, with a value of Â£100,000 put on the contract.
The company has been producing cold-pressed rapeseed oil since 2009, and this is its first supply deal with the supermarket chain.
Another supply deal will see Ian Macleod, the whisky company, take on UK distribution of Atlantico Rum.
The spirit, made in the Dominican Republic, adds to a portfolio of whisky, gin and rum brands, led by Glengoyne and Tamdhu single malts.
