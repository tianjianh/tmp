[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to Westridge Road, St Denys, on Friday afternoon. Hampshire Constabulary said there may have been an earlier "dispute".
A 26-year old man and a 35-year-old man, both from Southampton, are in police custody.
The identity of the dead man has not yet been confirmed and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.
Residents of the multi-occupancy property have been moved to temporary accommodation.
Det Ch Insp Nick Heelan appealed for witnesses.
He added: "We are following up several lines of inquiry. At this stage we believe this to be an isolated incident and that there is no risk to the wider community."
