Grant aid businesswoman banned from being a director

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A businesswoman who received financial support from the Welsh Government has been disqualified from being a company director for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government gave a £9,000 grant to Project WD, a clothing factory in Swansea owned by Judie Thomas.
But an investigation by the Insolvency Service revealed another company owned by her went into liquidation in 2015 owing £129,322.
She also owed £95,322 to HM Revenue and Customs and a contractor £32,977.
Ms Thomas did not give all the information she needed to her accountant and did not authorise her accountant to tell HMRC about the errors she had made, it was also found.
The Insolvency Service official receiver Stephen Baxter said: "This disqualification demonstrates that directors who fail in their obligations and cause creditors to lose money can expect to be investigated by the Insolvency Service, and enforcement action taken to remove them from the market place."
Earlier this year, BBC Wales discovered that Project WD was awarded £9,000 from the Welsh Government's ReAct scheme, which aims to get unemployed people back to work.
Some of those employed by Ms Thomas under the scheme have been pursuing legal action for unpaid wages.
Ms Thomas, who was previously made bankrupt, has been a director at five companies.
Project WD recently went into liquidation.
