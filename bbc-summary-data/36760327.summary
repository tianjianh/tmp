[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portugal ended Euro 2016 with bragging rights on the field, but who came out on top in BBC Sport's Predictor game?

More than 380,000 people took part, among them 22 pundits, presenters and commentators from across the BBC.
The likes of Alan Shearer, Martin Keown, Danny Murphy, John Hartson and Kevin Kilbane were among those who took part, but it was BBC Radio 5 live commentator Alistair Bruce-Ball who topped the standings in their mini-league, pipping radio colleague Ian Dennis and Football Focus presenter Dan Walker, who finished joint second.
Despite finishing top of the BBC Sport league, Bruce-Ball was only 1,203rd in the overall league - out of 381,078 players.
The winner was a user called AndyN4, who correctly predicted the score in the final between Portugal and France would be 0-0 after 90 minutes.
That result enabled him to leapfrog fellow player CSKA Sofia, who had been leading going into the final, to win by 10 points.
For each of the 51 games in the tournament, 10 points were awarded for a correct result (ie correctly predicting the winner or a draw) with 40 for the exact score.
