[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brendan Rodgers men will be at home for the first leg on Wednesday 17 August.
They then face the return in Israel a week later on 23 August.
Celtic, who beat Kazakh side Astana 3-2 on aggregate in the third qualifying round, have lost at the play-off stage two years in a row, with defeats to Maribor in 2014 and then to Malmo last season.
It is Beer Sheva's first time in the Champions League; beating Moldovans Sheriff Tiraspol before Shir Tzedek's goal 12 minutes from time knocked out Greek champions Olympiacos 1-0 on aggregate.
Unbeaten at home all last season, they won their first title since the 1970s, seeing off more established Israeli clubs including Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa.
Celtic will be visiting the Turner Stadium in the desert of southern Israel, the most southerly stadium in European competition history, Uefa has confirmed.
Champions League play-off round winners progress to the group stage of the competition while losing sides drop into the Europa League group stage.
