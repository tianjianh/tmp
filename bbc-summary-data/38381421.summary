The 31-year-old second-row forward will remain at the Twickenham Stoop until the summer of 2020.
Horwill has scored three tries in 33 appearances for Quins since joining them from Queensland Reds in 2015.
He has won 62 caps - the most recent of which came in a 39-28 defeat by England in June - and has captained the Wallabies on 16 occasions.
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston described the deal as a "statement of intent" by the 2012 Premiership champions.
"From the moment James joined 18 months ago, he has shown himself to be both a world-class player and an outstanding leader," he told the club website.
"He has proved a shining example to the rest of the squad."
