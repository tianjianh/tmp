[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A newlywed celebrating his honeymoon plunged headfirst through a guest house balcony which had rotted, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Bullivant, 36, fell 4.5m (15ft) through the balustrade just 20 minutes after arriving at Chellowdene guest house in Falmouth, Cornwall.
He was hospitalised with a laceration to his head and a shattered right hand.
The hotel's owners admitted failing to properly maintain the balcony and were each ordered to pay more than £7,000.
Truro Magistrate's Court heard the balustrade gave way when Mr Bullivant leant on it.
Kingsley Keat, prosecuting on behalf of Cornwall Council, said: "When the gentleman leant on it he fell straight forward and landed on his head."
Mr Bullivant, from Peterborough, was off work for three and a half months following the fall on 21 September 2015 and still suffers "constant pain" in his right hand.
Following the hearing, he told the BBC he has a large scar on his head, suffers flashbacks and is "petrified" of heights.
He said: "We were meant to stay in Falmouth for a week but ended up in hospital for a week instead."
Troy and Julie McCann, aged 48 and 49, who live at the guest house on Gyllyngvase Hill, were described as "highly respected hoteliers" with no previous health and safety breaches.
The couple were each fined £4,000 and ordered to pay costs of £3,037 each.
