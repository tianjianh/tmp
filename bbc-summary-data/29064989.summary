About 70 human skeletons have been uncovered by archaeologists during a dig at a former factory in Peterborough.

The finds were made by a team from Durham University, which is surveying the site on Midland Road before it is redeveloped for houses.
The remains are believed to date to the medieval period, but could be Roman.
Developers Westleigh plan to build 70 homes on Midland Road once the archaeologists complete their dig.
Dr Rebecca Casa-Hatton, lead archaeologist at Peterborough City Council, said: "At the moment we presume they may be medieval but we can't discount they may be late-Roman.
"It's very, very crowded so the cemetery would have been extensive."
She added archaeologists were expecting to find human remains in this area because of similar late Roman or medieval burials uncovered during the building of the railway line during the 19th Century.
"Hopefully, this excavation will shed light on the period of these burials and the burials found in the general area," she said.
Gary Turner, head of investment and partnership at Westleigh, said: "The discovery was made about six weeks ago and since then we have obtained a licence from the Ministry of Justice to exhume the remains.
"Once removed, the remains will be analysed to unlock further details on their history."
