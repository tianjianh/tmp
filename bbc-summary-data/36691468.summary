Kenya's world champion Yego, 27, led with a season's-best 88.24m, but fell on the follow-through in round four and sat out the rest of the contest.
Rohler, 24, then threw 90.30m in round five to win Germany's first javelin gold since the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Trinidad and Tobago's Keshorn Walcott took bronze with a throw of 85.38m.
Walcott was the youngest Olympic javelin champion when he triumphed at London 2012 at the age of 19 years and 131 days.
Yego, nicknamed 'YouTube man' after his unorthodox method of learning the sport, won Kenya's first Olympic medal outside of boxing and running.
