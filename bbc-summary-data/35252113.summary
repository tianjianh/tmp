A former Borders ambulance depot will be demolished and replaced with a medical centre, under plans submitted to the local council.

NHS Borders wants the Galashiels facility to accommodate GPs, health visitors and district nurses.
An ambulance crew would also be based at the new health centre in Roxburgh Street.
The move is expected to allow paramedics quick access to the west side of the town.
Jane Davidson, the chief executive of NHS Borders, confirmed that a planning application was submitted to Scottish Borders Council in December.
She added: "Demolition of the existing building on the site is scheduled to commence in the next week or so, and based on our current planning assumptions the first stage of building will start in May."
Plans for the site were delayed after the Scottish Environment Protection Agency raised flooding concerns.
Aitken Turnbull Architects said an earlier design was withdrawn in June 2014 for a full flood risk assessment to be carried out. The site is next to a mill lade.
The firm said that after a second plan was submitted in May 2015, the project was put on hold.
The development will replace the existing Roxburgh Street medical practice, where there is limited car parking.
A total of 21 spaces are incorporated into the design of the new health centre, as well as an additional four for paramedics and their ambulance.
Dr James Frost, a GP at the surgery, said: "There is a great deal of anticipation surrounding this project as it will impact over 3,300 patients in the Galashiels area."
The Scottish Ambulance Service moved its depot from Galashiels to the Borders General Hospital in Melrose last year.
