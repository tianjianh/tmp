Markets in Asia took their lead from Wall Street's performance on Friday where shares closed higher after the release of weak US job numbers.

The disappointing jobs figures are seen as delaying the timing of when the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.6% at 18,005.49.
Investor sentiment was boosted by talk that the Bank of Japan could introduce further economic stimulus measures.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index finished up 1.6% to 21,854.50 as mainland Chinese markets remained closed for the Golden Week holiday.
Casino shares rose for the second consecutive day on the expectation of better tourist arrivals in the gambling hub Macau during the Chinese holiday.
Shares of Galaxy Entertainment were up by more than 5%, while Sands China rose by more than 3%.
Glencore shares listed in Hong Kong were up as much as 72% at one point on reports the commodities trader was looking to sell its agricultural business.
However, Glencore issued a statement saying it was "not aware of any reasons for these price and volume movements".  Its shares closed up nearly 18%.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark closed up 1.95% at 5,150.5, while in South Korea the Kopsi index closed up 0.37% at 1,977.16.
