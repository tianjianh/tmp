Erick Maina, 15, was found in Fazakerley, Liverpool, on Saturday. The cause of death has not been revealed.
Racist comments about him were later found daubed near his school, Maricourt Catholic High School in Maghull.
An 18-year-old man from Netherton and a 17-year-old from Bootle are accused of racially aggravated criminal damage. Both are due before Sefton magistrates.
On Monday, the school's head teacher Brendan McLoughlin paid tribute to the "bright and intelligent" pupil.
"Erick was a popular and well-liked pupil at the school. He represented his peers as form captain and was a member of the school council," he said.
Detectives are investigating the boy's death on behalf of the Sefton coroner.
