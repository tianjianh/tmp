[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crossbow murder victim was 'collecting drug money'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A murder victim was collecting drug money when he was shot with a crossbow before falling off a balcony, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Solari said he dropped off and left his friend Sion Davies, 25, at a flat in Caia Park estate, Wrexham, last October to collect the cash.
But, later, the 26-year-old became concerned when Mr Davies did not answer his mobile, Mold Crown Court heard.
Anthony 'Charlie' Munkley, 53, and Lee Roberts, 33, both deny murder.
"We used to get cannabis off Charlie but we also sold cannabis to him, up to two ounces," Mr Solari said.
After leaving his friend at Mr Munkley's flat on 11 October 2014, Mr Solari became concerned when Mr Davies did not return.
He called his mobile repeatedly but got no answer.
Mr Solari said he then received a phone call in the early hours of the following morning to say his friend had been found dead.
The trial continues.
