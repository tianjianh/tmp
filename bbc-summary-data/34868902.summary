Scotland international Hood, 23, joined from Hunslet this year and made 22 outings but will move to Australian side Burdekin Roosters in Queensland.
Menzies, 27, signed from Swinton for 2015 but made just one appearance towards the end of last season.
'Both Liam and Luke are still young and have huge potential," head coach Ian Watson told the club website.
