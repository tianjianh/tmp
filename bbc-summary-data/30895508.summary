The star played Deirdre Barlow in Coronation Street for more than 40 years.
ITV says she died in hospital in Manchester on Monday after a short illness. She was 60 years old.
Dermot O'Leary, who is presenting the NTAs, said he texted his executive producer about a tribute.
"It's actually going to be quite a sad night," he told Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw.
"The one thing about the Coronation Street and EastEnders casts is that they are very, very tight. So I know they will be devastated."
Organisers have now said they're working on a last-minute plan to mark Anne Kirkbride's contribution to the soap.
Kirkbride, who joined Coronation Street as a teenager, has not previously had an individual honour at the NTAs.
"Corrie will greatly appreciate it," the presenter said. "The whole point of the show is that we reflect the viewers and I'm sure the viewers will be upset."
Some of the biggest names in TV will attend the show at the O2 Arena in London.
The cast and crew of Coronation Street are said to be "heartbroken and deeply saddened".
The soap is up for the best serial drama prize on Wednesday night.
"I remember watching Corrie as a kid and she's always been in it," said Dermot. "She's a perennial."
