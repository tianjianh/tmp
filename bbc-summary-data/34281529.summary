The GAA's Casement Park redevelopment project has already cost almost £6m, even though construction work on the proposed stadium has not yet started.

Figures released on Thursday show that in the past three months, £159,000 has been spent on the west Belfast site - an average of around £50,000 a month.
Work was due to begin in early 2015.
However, planning permission for the stadium was overturned in December 2014 and since then it has been embroiled in controversy over emergency exit plans.
The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) also faced opposition from local residents over its plans to build the state-of-the-art, 38,000-capacity stadium.
In spite of the difficulties, GAA representatives insist they will be submitting a new planning application.
It is not clear what the most recent money - £159,000 since the start of June - was spent on.
The GAA said it was unable to discuss the costs in detail.
A spokesperson said: "The costs incurred since June 2015 are in the context of delivering a major infrastructure project of this size.
"Ulster GAA, as is normal practice, does not comment on commercially sensitive matters including live contracts."
Most of the funding for the £77m project is coming from public finances.
According to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL), the total spent so far is £5.87m.
Asked about the reason for the recent funding of about £50,000 a month, a departmental spokesperson said: "DCAL has in place a funding agreement with the Ulster Council of the GAA which allows them to draw down money for eligible expenditure incurred against the project.
"This agreement includes conditions in relation to suspension, termination or cancellation in the event of the conditions of the funding agreement not being met.
"The contract between Ulster GAA and Heron Buckingham Joint Venture outlines how delays to the contract will be dealt with," they added.
Heron Buckingham are the contractors appointed to build the stadium. Without planning approval, and with the design now under consideration amid wrangles over emergency exiting, the contractors have not been able to begin any building work.
The director general of the GAA, Paráic Duffy, has insisted that the new Casement Park stadium will go ahead in spite of the recent difficulties.
He told the BBC: "It's a challenge, but I still believe that this is a stadium that will be built and can be built and we're working on that basis.
"Whatever it takes, we're going to get it done."
