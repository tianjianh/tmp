[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Probert, 56 and his partner Joanne Winder, 40, both died following a crash on the A470 near Llanrwst., Conwy county, on Easter Sunday 2015.
Lawrence Lougher, 29, of Addlestone, Surrey, was found guilty of causing the deaths of the Colwyn Bay couple by careless driving.
He was jailed for 12 months at Caernarfon Crown Court.
The court heard Lougher failed to check for the overtaking motorcycle when turning his BMW across the road.
Mr Probert died at the scene and Ms Winder died at Ysbyty Gwynedd two days later.
The court previously heard that Lougher was originally told he would not face prosecution, but there had been a review.
As well as the custodial sentence, he was banned from driving for two and a half years.
