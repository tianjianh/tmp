Ryan Fraser is nursing an Achilles complaint and will be assessed, while Benik Afobe is still sidelined by a hamstring strain.
Burnley's Michael Keane missed last week's draw with West Brom because of a calf injury but has returned to training and should be fit.
His defensive partner Ben Mee is likely to miss out again with a shin injury.
Martin Fisher: "Before a ball had been kicked in August, Bournemouth and Burnley had both been picked by plenty of pundits to be among the favourites to go down.
"In fact, neither side has even seriously flirted with the relegation issue and to be safe with two games left to play represents a magnificent effort.
"It's Burnley's highest placing since the days of Leighton James, Ray Hankin and Alan Stevenson in 1975, while just one more point will cement Bournemouth's best ever finish in their 118-year history.
"A Cherries win is long overdue in this fixture. The last came in November 1998 when an even fresher-faced Eddie Howe starred in their defence."

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "We try and improve every year, that has been our big way of working really, trying to develop players to improve the team, and step by step we have been able to do that.
"This year the objective was to improve on the 42 points and 16th (place) which we had achieved the season before. Now we have got two games left to try to do that."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "I think the key marker for me, without judging everyone else, is that it was only the first game of the season when we were in the bottom three.
"That's a fantastic marker for a side that was given no chance.
"Historically we have a strong way of finishing seasons and we want to finish this season strong as well."
Burnley's form has picked up in the past couple of weeks but Bournemouth always look good going forward and they will be confident of getting a goal, so let's go for a draw.
