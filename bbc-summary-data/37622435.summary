Ellis was previously an assistant to coach Vera Pauw, who departed from the role when her contract expired after the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.
"We decided to have continuity within the team," said Safa CEO Dennis Mumble. "We have strong confidence that Ellis and her assistants will do a good job."
Ellis has one month to prepare the team for the Women's Africa Cup of Nations.
South Africa kick off their campaign against Zimbabwe on 19 November before facing hosts Cameroon and Egypt in their other Group A matches.
The final will be played on 3 December in Yaounde.
Safa said it is continuing its efforts to find a permanent successor to Pauw.
Mumble added: "The Association is busy sifting through the names of possible candidates that will take over from Vera. We don't want to rush the process as we want the best possible candidate for the job."
