East Stirlingshire 0-3 Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers maintained their 100% Betfred League Cup record with a straightforward win over East Stirlingshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A first-half penalty from Andy Halliday and a simple finish by Josh Windass gave Mark Warburton's side a half-time grip on the Group F fixture.
Substitute Joe Dodoo, on his Rangers debut, made it 3-0 with a late tap-in from Lee Wallace's cross.
But Lowland League Shire can be proud of a stuffy performance.
Rangers thoroughly deserved their victory but would have expected to score more goals. If anything they stand accused of over working it, the shot from distance a seemingly alien philosophy to their coaching mantra.
However, they wasted no time in going about the anticipated onslaught of a team four levels of the Scottish game below them.
Windass, son of former Aberdeen favourite Dean, had the ball in the net early but was flagged offside. But the alarm bells were blaring for the Shire.
Within moments, Ross Fisher clearly had a fistful of Barrie McKay's shirt as he turned in the box. Halliday lashed home the resulting penalty to prompt what onlookers assumed would be a torrent of goals.
Even this early East Stirlingshire's striker David Grant cut a lonely and isolated figure.
They could hardly get a touch as the Ibrox side played monopoly with the ball and Kenny Miller should really have scored their second on the end of a fabulous run and cross by Michael O'Halloran, but somehow Fisher nicked the ball off his toe as he prepared for a tap-in.
Windass was Rangers' outstanding performer of the first 45 minutes, although there was an element of luck about his goal. McKay fired in a good cross from the left and it seemed to strike Windass and fall at his feet. From there it was a simple tap-in.
At this stage it was a King Canute performance by the home defence, yet unlike the great man they did actually stem the tide.
Somehow the Lowland League team weathered the storm and retreated to the dressing room just two goals down.
Rangers used the second half to introduce Niko Kranjcar - who looked well short of match fitness - and new signing Dodoo, but Shire grew in confidence and actually should have scored when Graeme MacGregor opened his body to shoot over when he really needed to put the laces through the pass from Grant.
But into time added on Dodoo had a tap-in from Wallace's delivery to make it three.
At times it was too easy for Rangers and curiously it's John Sludden's team, by avoiding a heavier defeat, who may go into the season buoyed by their performance.
