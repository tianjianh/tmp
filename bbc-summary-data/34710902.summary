The cascade - or Weeping Window - section will be draped down St George's Hall before opening to the public on Saturday ahead of Remembrance Sunday.
The installation, which marked 100 years since the start of World War One, drew more than five million visitors.
The poppies will be on display in Liverpool until January.

Assistant Mayor Wendy Simon planted the first poppies at the venue, where thousands of men signed up to fight in World War One in 1914.
She said the exhibit was "really important" for the city, "for us to remember, for young and old to come together, to reflect and to really think about what people sacrificed so we can live in the freedom and democracy we have today".
How St George's Hall played its part in World War One
Created by artists Paul Cummins and Tom Piper, the artwork was named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red after a line written by a soldier who died in Belgium.
Each of the 888,246 poppies in the Tower of London display represented each death in the British and Colonial forces between 1914 and 1918.
About Â£9m was raised for military charities after most of the poppies were sold to the public but two sections - the Wave and the Weeping Window - were bought for the nation by the charities Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation.
Both sections will be exhibited at various venues across the UK before they are permanently housed at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester after 2018.
