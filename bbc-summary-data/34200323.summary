About 57,000 people have taken part in the Great North Run, which saw Mo Farah win the men's elite race.

The event began in Newcastle with the finish line 13.1 miles away in South Shields.
Farah's victory was his second consecutive win in the half-marathon, which is now in its 35th year.
Kenyan Mary Keitany won the women's race and David Weir achieved a record-equalling sixth win in the elite wheelchair competition.
Shelly Woods took the women's wheelchair crown for the seventh time.
Farah, 32, who last month retained both his 10,000m and 5,000m world crowns in Beijing, became the second British man to win the event twice as he crossed the line ahead of Kenya's Stanley Biwott.
It matched the achievement of Mike McLeod, the winner in 1981 and 1982.
He said: "It took a lot out of me. The crowd always give massive support.
"If it wasn't for the crowd edging me towards the end it definitely would have been a different result."
Taking a break from running, British distance athlete Jo Pavey fired the starting pistol.
As is traditional, the Red Arrows performed a fly-over as runners crossed the Tyne Bridge on their way into Gateshead.
A number of stars once again featured in the mass event including Professor Brian Cox, Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell and former footballers Michael Gray and Kevin Kilbane.
Cracknell told the BBC's Gabby Logan: "I haven't run for four or five weeks and I may not be the most efficient runner. I see Mo only just pipped me by about half an hour!
"I saw him at the hotel yesterday morning and he had a go at me for eating too much.
"This is special because people come and watch a family member or a friend, and they stay and support everyone else."
It is expected around Â£25m will be raised by those taking part for charity.
BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern, who is from Middlesbrough, said: "For the first time ever I ran it without headphones on and the crowd carries you along.
"It was tough in terms of the heat, but Newcastle looked brilliant. It was hard, but great fun."
