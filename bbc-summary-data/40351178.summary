[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said they acted after finding a man waving an "item" around near the London Central Mosque in Regent's Park.
There were no reports of any injuries and the suspect is being held at a central London police station on suspicion of affray.
The force said it was not treating the incident as terrorism-related and said the item being waved was a shoehorn.
"Officers are keeping an open mind regarding any motivation for the incident", the force said in a statement.
The incident comes after a van was driven at worshippers near the Muslim Welfare House mosque and community centre, in Finsbury Park, in the early hours of Monday.
Nine people were taken to three London hospitals and two were treated at the scene. Those who were injured had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if that was because of the attack.
Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, has been held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences.
