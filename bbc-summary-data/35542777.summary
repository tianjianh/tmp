[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old has made four appearances for the Cherry and Whites this term.
Trinder is nearing full fitness after being out with a hamstring injury.
"Henry's attitude during my time at the club has been second to none, and his determination to return to fitness has been admirable," said Gloucester's director of rugby David Humphreys.
"We are building a lot of depth within our squad, and Henry is another key cog in our backline."
