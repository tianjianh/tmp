[SN]TITLE[SN]
Snow hits higher parts of the north of England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It might be springtime, but it certainly does not look or feel that way for those living in the higher parts of the north of England where snow has settled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although it is a far cry from the severe wintry conditions of 2010, some roads have been closed.
Parts of the M6 around Shap and Tebay were among the areas worst affected.
A small number of schools were closed, and police have urged motorists to allow extra time for journeys.
