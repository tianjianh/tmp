Matej Vydra's headed the hosts in front during a dominant first-half display.
Having secured promotion last week, the Hornets knew a win would see them claim their maiden Championship title.
But substitute Nuhiu scored from close range, as Watford were made to pay for failing to take their chances, with Bournemouth taking top spot.
Watford started brightly, finding plenty of joy down the right, with Marco Motta and Miguel Layun exposing the Sheffield Wednesday defence.
Captain and attacking talisman Troy Deeney was at the centre of the first moment of controversy, as he latched on to Ben Watson's through ball and went down in the box as he looked to round goalkeeper Chris Kirkland, although the Wednesday man looked to have his hands on the ball.
Watford continued to move forward with ease but the away fans made sure the home crowd knew Bournemouth had taken the lead against Charlton, as they belted out a chorus of "AFC Bournemouth, they're top of the league".
However, the party atmosphere returned to Vicarage Road midway through the first half as Vydra headed in his 16th league goal of the season.

Ikechi Anya almost made it two goals in two minutes but the winger could only find the side-netting from a tight angle.
Wednesday changed formation in an attempt to stem the attacks from Watford, but it was to no avail and the away side were lucky to go into the break only a goal down.
The Owls, safely situated in mid-table, came out looking to attack more in the second period and Chris Maguire and Tom Lees forced Heurelho Gomes in a couple of good saves.
Watford seemed to lose their attacking edge in the second half and were made to pay for failing to add to their narrow lead, as Nuhiu's equaliser in the 91st minute handed Bournemouth the title.
Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "We made mistakes during the game but the referee didn't give a penalty, it's a clear penalty and inside the last second of the game Nuhiu was offside 100% - I am sure of that.
"Promotion to the Premier League was our first target. We're disappointed we don't lift silverware, this was our dream, but now we must start thinking about what is in front of us."
Sheffield Wednesday boss Stuart Gray: "It feels like a huge point because at half-time I just could not believe we were only 1-0 down.
"That was probably one of the worst 45 minutes we've had. We were so disappointing.
"We were like a rabbit in the headlights. We gave them far too much respect, we stood off them, our passing was poor and then they created chance after chance."
