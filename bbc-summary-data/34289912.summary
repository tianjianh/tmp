Students gave the university the best marks in the country for teaching and overall student experience.
Judges said the university's research was pushing back boundaries, and praised its impact on the city.
The newspaper also produced a league table of Scottish universities, topped by St Andrews.
The 2016 edition of the guide takes into account the National Student Survey, which recently ranked Dundee and Glasgow as Scotland's best.
Judges also noted that Dundee was ranked the UK's best university for research of biological sciences, and has recently opened a Â£50m research Discovery Centre.
Alistair McCall, editor the guide, said Dundee University was "the epitome of what a good university should be".
He said: "It provides an outstanding education and university experience for its students, is a key driver in the regional and national economy, and its researchers - particularly in the medical field - are pushing back the boundaries of knowledge and the treatments available to the wider benefit of society."
Principal Prof Sir Pete Downes said the university's goal was to "transform lives".
He said: "Our record in recent years on student experience is remarkable. I know from speaking to our students how much they enjoy their time here at Dundee.
"We are absolutely delighted to be named as Scottish University of the Year in the Good University Guide. This outstanding series of results and rankings is a tribute to the dedication of staff right across the University."
