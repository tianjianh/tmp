UFC: Ronda Rousey to make comeback against Amanda Nunes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey will make her comeback against Amanda Nunes on 30 December, more than a year after being knocked out by Holly Holm.

American Rousey, 29, lost her unbeaten record and the bantamweight title in the shock defeat last November.
She will try to reclaim her crown against champion Nunes of Brazil in the main event of UFC 207 in Las Vegas.
Rousey is the longest reigning UFC champion in women's mixed martial arts history.
She held the 135-pound crown for three years from November 2012 to November 2015.
In February, the Olympic judo bronze medallist said she "considered suicide" after her defeat by compatriot Holm.
