"Nodular sclerosing is the most common of all types of Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK. Nearly six out of 10 of all diagnosed cases are this type and it is the most common type in young adults. It is usually found at an early stage when lymph glands in the neck become enlarged."

The 28-year-old stopped playing football in March having again been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma after previously overcoming the disease in 2014.
Thompson's treatment has included a course of chemotherapy and stem cell replacement in Manchester.
He said on Twitter: "Simple terms, I'm cancer free."
Thompson, who has also had spells with Tranmere, Bury and Southport, rejoined Rochdale, where he began his career in their youth system, from Carlisle at the start of last season.
He made 27 appearances, scoring three goals, in all competitions for his hometown club, who finished ninth in League One, and played his most recent game in the 2-2 draw at MK Dons on 11 March.
The football world was quick to congratulate Thompson on his good news.
