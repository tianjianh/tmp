Northern Ireland manufacturing 'continues to struggle'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland manufacturing continues to struggle, according to newly-released data on the economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Output, new orders and employment numbers all declined in February among manufacturing firms surveyed on behalf of Ulster Bank.
Its monthly Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) says the NI manufacturing sector "is enduring more difficult conditions than its counterpart in Great Britain".
However, the NI service sector is "outperforming" its UK equivalent.
As a result, overall the private sector has maintained a "solid start to the year".
New orders picked up to their fastest rate in eight months.
The bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said: "It should be remembered that whilst Northern Ireland is enjoying stronger rates of growth than the UK as a whole this is from a lower base.
"We are playing catch-up. Our recovery until now has been slower and is therefore at a less advanced stage."
The bank's monthly PMI is a survey of firms that tracks indicators such as new orders, employment and exports.
