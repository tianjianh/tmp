Wales defender Jazz Richards is on the verge of joining Cardiff City from Fulham with Bluebirds left-back Scott Malone set to move the other way.

Richards was part of Wales' squad at Euro 2016, making one substitute appearance, with new Cardiff boss Paul Trollope on the national coaching team.
The 25-year-old Richards joined Fulham in January 2015, having played more than 50 games for Swansea City.
"We're hoping that'll be completed in the very near future," said Trollope.
"And we think he'll be a great addition to the squad,."
Trollope has already added striker Kenneth Zohore and fellow forward Frederic Gounongbe from Belgian side KVC Westerlo and the club completed the signing of Lex Immers in May.
With Wales manager Chris Coleman explaining Trollope is unlikely to continue coaching the national side, the Bluebirds have been linked with another Wales squad member, Birmingham winger David Cotterill.
Former Wales and Cardiff defender Danny Gabbidon thinks a move to the Bluebirds would suit Richards.
"I think it could be a good move all round. If anything at the minute, Jazz is probably playing better for his country than his club," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"Obviously he's worked with Paul Trollope in the Welsh set-up, that would help him. I think he needs to play week, in week out."
Malone scored one goal in 56 appearances for Cardiff since joining from Millwall in January 2015.
The 25-year-old was not in the Bluebirds' squad for their 4-0 pre-season friendly win at Shrewsbury on Saturday.
Cardiff impressed in their new 5-3-2 formation, which Wales used to excellent effect in their historic run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals.
Richards featured prominently in that system during Wales' qualification campaign, and new Bluebirds head coach Trollope hopes his arrival will be one of many at Cardiff City Stadium.
"I think there's a few to come," added Trollope. "We are actively looking to strengthen. I think the group is a good group, there's a good core here."
