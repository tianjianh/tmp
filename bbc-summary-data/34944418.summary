David Brickwood, 74, died in hospital after being assaulted in Lindsay Avenue, Abington in the early hours of 26 September.
His son, Dale, said he had "cried a million tears" over the "violent and dreadful attack".
Crimestoppers has offered the reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
Sue Witts, East Midlands regional manager for the charity, said: "Mr Brickwood was well-known and well-liked within his community, which is what makes this violent crime all the more shocking.
"We all deserve to feel safe in our own homes and it is extremely important the people responsible are brought to justice to ensure they cannot strike again."
In a tribute after his death, Dale Brickwood described his father as "the most honest, hardworking, caring man I've ever known".
Northampton Police said five arrests have been made in connection with the murder, but no charges have been brought.
