Social worker cautioned after domestic abuse finding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A social worker for children in care has been cautioned after he failed to tell his employer he had been found guilty of domestic abuse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kwabena Boateng joined Northamptonshire County Council's service for children in care in 2009.
In 2014 four allegations of domestic violence against a woman were found proved during a family court hearing.
The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) found he had failed to disclose the court's findings to the council.
In its findings, the HCPC conduct panel heard Mr Boateng's role with the council involved "making daily safeguarding decisions" and to "protect children and young people from further harm".
It heard the council learned of the family court's finding that Mr Boateng had been the "perpetrator" of domestic violence via the guardian of two children also involved in the case.
The HCPC panel said: "The Panel concludes that the nature of the family court findings, namely domestic violence, are such that they go to the heart of, and are clearly relevant to, a social worker's practice and must be disclosed."
However, the panel also heard how Mr Boateng had a "previously unblemished record", had shown "expressions of remorse and apology" and how, since the 2014 court hearing, had continued work as a social worker "without issue".
Northamptonshire County Council was approached for a comment about the case but has yet to respond.
