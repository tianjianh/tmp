After a goalless first half, Cobblers striker John Marquis was fouled by Lanre Oyebanjo in the box and Ricky Holmes fired in the resultant penalty.
Rod McDonald and Holmes hit the bar for the hosts before John-Joe O'Toole doubled their lead from close range.
Gwion Edwards' free-kick reduced the deficit, but the visitors saw Andy Bond sent off soon after.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"You know they set traps, but more than anything else they work harder than any team and they're good in possession.
"The back four are all comfortable with the ball and they are a blueprint of how we need to be.
"We're a million miles apart at the moment in terms of them being champions and we're nowhere near it.
"We have to learn and have to say 'How can we improve?' and decide which players are going to be here next season.
"How are we going to play and how we can emulate or copy them and get the energy levels within our team?"
