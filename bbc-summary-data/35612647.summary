Manchester United: Computer games or watching your team?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plenty of Manchester United fans will wish they had played computer games rather than watch the club's dismal 2-1 Europa League defeat at FC Midtjylland on Thursday.

But for a player on their books, that's exactly what happened - he was unaware that his club were even playing.
Nick Powell played for Manchester United in their previous European game, the 3-2 defeat by Wolfsburg which eliminated them from the Champions League in December.
But the 21-year-old, who has not lived up to expectations following his move to United from Crewe, is now on loan at Hull - and seemingly has put his parent club out of his thoughts.
When asked if had watched the game in Denmark, he said: "No, I completely forgot - I was playing Fifa, if I am honest.
"I did read the reports and, I don't know, it's hard. They're under pressure because the gaffer has come out and said it's the best way to qualify for the Champions League next year.
"There's no excuse - they should have have won, but that's just the way it is."
