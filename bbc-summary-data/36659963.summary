The 28-year-old's career began at hometown club Neath and he played for Cardiff RFC before joining Blues, for whom he played three times last season.
He has also played for Brisbane Bulldogs in Australia and for Wales Sevens in 2011 and 2012.
"His versatility will give us more options in the backfield particularly during the international window," said Scarlets rugby manager Jon Daniels.
"That said, he is coming here to challenge for a starting position in the team, which adds to the competition in the group.
"He is well known in Welsh rugby for his commitment and professionalism and so in a new environment time will tell how far he can progress."
Scarlets are the only Welsh team in the upcoming season's European Rugby Champions Cup.
Smith said: "There's a lot of competition in the squad and I'm also looking forward to potentially having an opportunity to play in the Champions Cup against some of Europe's best clubs."
