George Magraw, 21 and from Ellesmere Port, was taken to hospital on Wednesday after jumping from a 13ft (4m) high platform at Flip Out Chester.
The University of Leeds student is understood to have undergone a lengthy operation on his injuries.
Cheshire West and Chester Council has launched an investigation into the park, which has closed the tower.
The council said two other people were also injured on the same day as Mr Magraw.
Councillor Karen Shore, Cheshire West and Chester's cabinet member for environment, said: "We are investigating reports of accidents which led to three people being injured at Flip Out Chester.
"The company has voluntarily closed its tower jump while investigations are ongoing."
Flip Out Chester, located on Chester Gates Business Park, opened in December 2016 and houses 200 trampolines and an obstacle course.
A spokesman said there had been "a number of incidents" on Wednesday, but the park had had "an excellent safety record" since it opened and hosted 150,000 visitors.
"Safety is our number one priority and we strive to ensure that everyone who visits can enjoy all of the activities in a safe environment," he added.
