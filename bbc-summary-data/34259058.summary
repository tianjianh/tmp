Deloitte's Newmarket Horse Racing Industry report has concluded the area was a "national sporting asset".
Robin Miller, Forest Heath District Council's deputy leader, said: "We should be looking to government to support infrastructure improvements.
The council cited improvements to the A14's junctions as priorities.
The Deloitte study followed on from 2014's SQW report into the economic value of horse racing to the local economy in west Suffolk.
It concluded the racecourses, stables, studs and related industries were worth Â£208m a year and provided 8,500 jobs within a 25-mile radius of the town.
Councillor Miller said: "For those who don't know Newmarket or don't live here, it has been something of a hidden gem and this is a real opportunity for people to understand its economic importance."
William Gittus, chairman of the Newmarket Horsemen's Group and managing director of Jockey Club Estates, said: "What is really encouraging about the report's findings is the recognition that the racing industry in Newmarket has the scope and potential to grow further and, as an asset of national importance, can help the district leverage external investment for major infrastructure improvements that will benefit everyone."
Graham Abbey, chairman of the Newmarket Chamber of Commerce, said: "Horseracing makes Newmarket a unique place to live and work, but it also brings challenges for all of us.
"The chamber is absolutely ready to sit down with all parties and work through these challenges so that everyone benefits and all of our businesses can grow and thrive."
