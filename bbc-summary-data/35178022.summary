The diplomat was leaving a VIP lounge at Charles De Gaulle airport to board a flight when he realised that the money was gone.
After a search, video footage was found showing a temporary employee picking it up and he was arrested at his home.
He has since been released as possible charges are being considered.
A police source told AFP news agency about half the money had been recovered.
The diplomat only noticed the money was missing when two mobile phones fell from his bag. Unable to find it, he left airport police to continue the search while he boarded the plane.
The employee has been fired from his job, officials say.
