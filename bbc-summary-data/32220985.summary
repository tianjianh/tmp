World War Two veteran Bill Dudley of Connah's Quay celebrated with a party at the Mold McDonald's restaurant where he works.
The great grandfather started working part-time in customer care nine years ago after becoming bored pottering around the house.
Mr Dudley, who served in the Navy, said: "I still love coming to work."
A day of celebrations took place at the store Wednesday for the former crane driver, whose wife calls him "Old McDonald".
The restaurant's franchisee Stewart Williams said he admired Mr Dudley's "constant enthusiasm".
"We are all incredibly proud to work alongside him as he's such an inspiring member of the team. I look forward to celebrating his birthday again next year," he added.
