[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eight candidates to fight it out to be Labour's London mayor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight candidates will fight it out to be Labour's choice to be the next mayor of London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Candidates include one ex-MP, four current MPs, a writer, a former mayor of Lambeth and one journalist.
All will vie to get on a shortlist next month, chosen by a committee of the Labour Party.
Then will lie ahead weeks of campaigning, hustings and media appearances before the winner emerges in the middle of September.
The line up is:
Labour is running a selection process based on the primary principle that extends voting rights to supporters who sign up to the party and pay a Â£3 fee by the middle of August.
But the first hurdle is to get nominations from at least five Labour constituency branches in London and at least one nomination from a so-called Labour affiliate, including unions, the Co-op or Fabian Society.
Candidates will be interviewed on 13 June by a selection committee made up of three members of the London regional board and three members of the party's national executive committee.
A shortlist will be revealed that day.
The process will run in parallel with Labour's selection of a new leader.
The Conservatives have not yet revealed when they plan to run their selection process although three people - deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh, London Assembly member Andrew Boff and businessman Ivan Massow - have so far said they are running.
