The defending champions include 15 of the squad that beat Canada to win the last World Cup in 2014.
Rachael Burford, Rochelle Clark, Tamara Taylor and Danielle Waterman will play in their fourth consecutive World Cup.
Bristol's Sarah Hunter, who led the world number ones to the Six Nations title in March, captains a squad with a combined total of 1,207 caps.
Six players also represented Great Britain in the rugby sevens at the Rio Olympics last summer.
England are in Pool B and open their tournament against Spain on 9 August, before facing Italy on 13 August and USA on 17 August.
Simon Middleton's side go into the World Cup after beating Australia, Canada and New Zealand in the International Women's Rugby Series earlier this month.
"We are confident we have an incredibly strong squad, made up of hugely experienced players who have featured in previous Women's Rugby World Cups and other major tournaments such as the Olympics," said Middleton.
"At the same time, we have younger players who have been involved in a Grand Slam-winning side and a successful three-Test series against some of the best teams in the world earlier this month."
He added: "Our focus has always been on going to Ireland to win the Women's Rugby World Cup. To do that, we are going to have to give more than in any competition we've played over the past year."
