Sixty people are still missing. At least 700 were injured.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said it was too early to tell how many vehicles were affected.
In a statement it said: "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) wishes to express its most profound condolences to the families and friends of those who lost loved ones in the explosions in Tianjin.
"Our thoughts are with them as well as with all those who were injured in this tragic event."
JLR has manufacturing plants in Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the West Midlands and at Halewood on Merseyside.
On Friday, India's Tata Motors, which owns JLR, saw its stock price fall 2.72% on the Mumbai stock exchange.
Tianjin is one of three major ports in China through which JLR imports vehicles.
JLR said 5,800 of its cars were in Tianjin at the time of the explosions.
Carmaker Renault said the blast burned 1,500 of its imported cars and Volkswagen said 2,700 of its cars were damaged.
