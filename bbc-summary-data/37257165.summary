Luke Williams: Darrell Clarke's ticket criticism 'saddened' Swindon Town boss

Swindon Town head coach Luke Williams says he is "saddened" by Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke's criticism of Swindon's ticket charges for their rearranged league game on 20 September.

Saturday's initial match was abandoned amid torrential rain after 60 minutes.
Clarke called charges for new tickets for the match "absolutely disgraceful".
"It hurts me because it is my club and it's upsetting to hear somebody talk about the club in that way," Williams responded, speaking to BBC Wiltshire.
"It saddens me to hear the words but I imagine the words are born out of emotion and out of defence for Bristol Rovers and the fans.
"I look at it from a Swindon point of view and Darrell will look at it from a Rovers point of view. That's healthy. He is concerned for his own fans, quite rightly.
"I understand the enormous cost involved in staging an event and, no matter if the game is finished or not, we have a huge bill to cover."
Fans reacted angrily on social media to the news that refunds would not be offered for Saturday's game, and adult tickets for the rearranged meeting will cost Â£19 to 25.
In a statement on Wednesday, Swindon chairman Lee Power stood by his club's decision over the tickets.
"While we understand supporters' frustration, what happened on Saturday afternoon was an act of God and beyond the club's control," Power said.
Rovers have offered returning away fans free coach travel to the County Ground for the League One encounter.
