[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scots lost 3-2 against the Czech Republic in their opening match but bounced back in fine style against the South Americans on Saturday.
Kilmarnock player Taylor did the damage with a first-half strike that sailed into the top corner.
Scotland are second-top of Group C ahead of their final pool-stage match against Indonesia.
The Czechs top the group on six points with Scotland and Brazil on three apiece.
Leipzig's Oliver Burke, who scored a double in the defeat by the Czech Republic, and Dundee's Craig Wighton had sights of goal before left-back Taylor sent the Scots into the lead.
Burke came to the fore after the break as Scotland played some nice football from middle to front.
The Brazilians began to enjoy more possession as the match wore on but were unable to break the Scots' resistance, as they held on for the victory.
