About 50 firefighters were called to a recycling plant at Llandow Trading Estate, near Cowbridge, on Sunday.
Health and environmental officials are monitoring the situation due to concerns about the plume of smoke.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it was trying to minimise the impact of the fire on the environment and residents.
In a statement, Vale of Glamorgan council said: "Following on from discussion with Public Health Wales, we can confirm that current advice remains the same, keep doors and windows closed and minimise the amount of time spent outside."
Llandow Caravan Park owner Sharon Evans said holidaymakers were leaving the site nearby due to smoke.
"We have got this stinking smell and we don't know what we are breathing in," she said.
Mark Watts, station commander for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said: "There is, naturally, concern about the smoke plume and we are in consultation with Public Health Wales and Natural Resource Wales and we are monitoring the situation."
There were two fires within three weeks at buildings run by Siteserv in 2013.
A fire service spokesperson said crews had been met with a "large, severe fire" involving a building measuring 50 metres wide (164ft) and 25 metres high (82ft).
"Crews worked swiftly to prevent the fire from spreading to many hundreds of tonnes of waste material stored nearby," they added.
In total, six pumps, four water tankers, an aerial water platform and an incident control crew were needed at the scene.
"South Wales Fire and Rescue Service's fire investigation team has attended the incident and are working closely with South Wales Police to investigate the cause of the fire," the spokesperson added.
Bill Purvis, from NRW, said: "Once the fire has been fully extinguished and we are satisfied that the site is safe, we'll be contributing to the investigation into what may have caused this, and establishing what steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of it happening again."
