All three were wearing black and travelling in a blue Renault Clio with scratches on the bonnet.
Det Insp Steve Williams said the circumstances of the incident were being investigated.
He added: "There would have been a number of people in the village yesterday as the Bus Route 76 Beer Festival was taking place in Llandyrnog and we are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen a similar vehicle driving around or who witnessed the incident involving the children."
