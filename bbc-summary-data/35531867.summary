[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers captain Michael Shenton will miss the rest of the Super League season with a serious knee injury that will require surgery.

The centre, 29, damaged his anterior cruciate ligament in their first game of the new campaign against Hull KR.
Shenton was injured in a tackle by John Boudebza, who has been charged with a Grade B offence and could face a ban.
"It's really disappointing these type of tackles are still in the game," said head coach Daryl Powell.
"There's a job needs to be done in terms of dealing with that, but that is no consolation to Shenny or to us."
French hooker Boudebza, who joined Hull KR before the start of last season, could receive a ban of up to two matches.
"I've felt fresh coming into the season so to have it cut short from a reckless challenge is difficult for me to swallow," Shenton said.
"I'll be doing all I can off the field to support the boys through this season."
