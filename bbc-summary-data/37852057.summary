David Tennant is to return to the West End next year to play the title role in Patrick Marber's Don Juan in Soho.

The play is a loose adaptation of Moliere's 17th Century tragi-comedy Don Juan that transports the legendary womaniser to contemporary London.
The production, which Marber will direct, will run at the Wyndham's Theatre from 17 March to 10 June.
The original 2006 production starred Rhys Ifans in the title role and was directed by Michael Grandage.
The play drew a good review from the Telegraph's Charles Spencer, who described it as "savagely funny, disturbingly dark and disgracefully sexy".
Tennant previously performed at the Wyndham's in 2011, playing Benedick in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.
He recently played Richard II with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican, moving to New York with the production earlier this year.
The former Doctor Who actor played another famous womaniser, Casanova, in a 2005 BBC TV series.
Further Don Juan in Soho casting will be announced at a later date.
