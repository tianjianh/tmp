[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sark could get joint customs and police role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Visitors to Sark may be able to travel directly to the Channel Island if the roles of police and immigration officers are combined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently, people have to go via another Channel Islands customs post - either Guernsey, Jersey or Alderney - to meet immigration and customs laws.
The suggestion of a joint role has been made in a review of policing in Sark.
The island currently has two voluntary part-time officers for the 600-strong population.
Supt Nigel Taylor, from Guernsey Police, is assisting the Sark authorities with the review.
He said: "There are opportunities for a dual-warranted individual... to carry out the functions of customs and policing providing the necessary training is in place.
"[We're] exploring all the options to make sure it's cost effective policing in Sark, but it's also fit for a modern day society."
The Guernsey Border Agency and the island's police force have been united under a head of law enforcement, but no plans to merge the two organisations have been released.
