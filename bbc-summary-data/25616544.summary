Michael Laudrup says Swansea's FA Cup win at Manchester United meant more to the players and fans than it did to him.

The Swans won for the first time at Old Trafford thanks to Wilfried Bony's 90th-minute header against 10-man United.
Laudrup, who played for Barcelona, says he is happy but would prefer Premier League points.
"The only thing that makes it special for me is I know how special it is for the fans and players," said Laudrup.
"But for me, I always said I'd rather win against Crystal Palace or West Ham or Stoke or Norwich or a side who are on more or less the same points as us.
"For me it's great because it's great for the players and the fans but if you ask me separately just for me, no, nothing special."
Swansea stunned the Old Trafford crowd by taking the lead against United through Wayne Routledge before Javier Hernandez's equaliser.
The Swans had previously played Manchester United at Old Trafford 10 times, with the first fixture back in 1931. However, they had never won and had drawn just twice, most recently in 1934.
With just 10 minutes left United's Fabio Da Silva was shown the red card for scything down Jose Canas.
Bony headed in Routledge's cross to end a run of seven games without a win for the Swans.
Swansea will now play against either Birmingham, Bristol Rovers or Crawley Town in the fourth round.
It's the fifth time David Moyes's side have lost at home this season after suffering Premier League defeats against West Bromwich Albion,Everton,Newcastle United and Tottenham.
The Red Devils host the Swans again in the Premier League on Saturday.
In the build-up to the game, Laudrup called for FA Cup replays to be scrapped and said his side were more attack-minded as a result.
"I wanted to avoid a replay so I wanted to risk a little to go for the game," said Laudrup.
"After they equalised they had 10-15 minutes where they had a couple of chances and put us under pressure.
"But apart from that I didn't get the feeling that it was going to be a really long afternoon.
"We looked comfortable even at 11 against 11 and I thought we had a chance. Then after the sending off I added one more striker to go for the game."
