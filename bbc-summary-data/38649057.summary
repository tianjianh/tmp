A rare long-necked plesiosaur could soon go on display in Oxford after the city's Museum of Natural History successfully bid for a grant.

"Eve" was discovered at Must Farm quarry at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and donated to the museum last year.
The museum was awarded Â£90,000 from the DCMS/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund to display the specimen alongside another plesiosaur.
Director Prof Paul Smith said it would "reinvigorate" the museum.
Eve will be displayed with a short-necked plesiosaur discovered near Oxford in the 1990s in new cases, and with new artwork and digital content.
"The exhibit will present a picture of central England 165 million years ago: submerged 50 metres underwater in a warm, shallow sea, teeming with animals that are now long-extinct," a spokesman said.
Mr Smith said it would "conserve and exhibit two internationally-significant fossil marine reptiles".
The museum is currently looking for matched funding to complete the project.
