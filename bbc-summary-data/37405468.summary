The Emmy Awards have been dished out in Los Angeles and records have been broken. Game of Thrones has taken 12 awards, while Veep actress Julia-Louis Dreyfus received her sixth Emmy.

But there are other moments worthy of note - some of which have caused a bit of a stir online.
Here are five of them.
How do you deal with evil and make bad things disappear? Leslie Jones, the Ghostbusters star who was forced to quit Twitter in July following racist abuse, suggests locking things in a box.
Jones tackled the serious issue of online harassment with humour while requesting the assistance of Ernst & Young, the accounting company charged with protecting the secrets of the award ceremony.
"Since you're good at keeping things safe," she said, "I have a job for you: my Twitter account. Put that in the vault, please!"
Jones, 48, starred in the remake of the hit 1980s film, but the decision to cast all women was criticised by some Ghostbusters fans.
She received abuse on Twitter and was later targeted by hackers. Copies of her passport and driving licence were published online, as well as personal photos from her iCloud account.
"You all are over here using your skills to protect best voiceover in a French sitcom. Meanwhile, I'm butt naked on CNN," said Jones.
"I just wanted to feel beautiful, y'all. Can a sister feel beautiful?"
Known for turning up her nose when in character but failing to turn up at all at the Emmys, Dame Maggie Smith managed to create a little drama at the ceremony, despite - or rather because of - her absence.
After winning outstanding supporting actress in a drama series for her role as Violet Crawley in Downton Abbey, she was called out by host Jimmy Kimmel for failing to show - again.
"Maggie, if you want this, it'll be in the lost and found," he said.
Kimmel went on to suggest that when Dame Maggie hears she has been nominated for an Emmy award, the proposal most likely goes "right in the garbage".
Social media was on it, and before long a number of images and clips from Downton Abbey were shared showing an unperturbed Violet Crawley in all her snobbery.
Dame Maggie, who is regularly nominated, has never attended the ceremony in person.
Jeffrey Tambor, who took the outstanding comedy actor gong for the second year in a row, made a heart-warming call for Hollywood to provide more work for transgender actors.
"I'm not going to say this beautifully - shush, shush," he said as he prepared to make a serious plea.
"To you people out there, you producers, you network owners, you agents and you creative sparks, please give transgender talent a chance."
Tambor, who plays a transgender woman in the Amazon series Transparent, added: "I would not be unhappy were I the last cisgender male to play a female transgender on television. We have work to do.
"Give them auditions. Give them their story," he declared while accepting his Emmy.
The fascination with fashion and appearance is rife at such events. Show hosts can often push and prod those trapped on the red carpet to reveal a secret or two.
Comedian Amy Schumer took little persuasion, however, when asked to provide viewers and listeners with a description of her attire.
"Vivienne Westwood, Tom Ford shoes and an OB Tampon!" Schumer told E! News.
Such a comment from anyone else may have proved awkward, but Schumer manages to deliver these one-liners without embarrassment.
She may not have won an Emmy on the night, but had there been a category for breaking a taboo things may have been different.
It has been a long time coming, but at last we may have a glimpse into the future.
Rami Malek, who received the award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his role in Mr Robot, is the first ethnic minority actor to have won the award since 1998.
As he arrived on stage and leaned into the microphone, the visibly shocked Malek said: "Please tell me you're seeing this, too."
The American-Egyptian actor was referencing the hallucinations suffered by the mentally ill character he plays in the popular drama series.
"I play a young man who is, like so many of us, profoundly alienated," he said.
