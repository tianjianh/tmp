An 8m (26ft) tall rocket is the centrepiece of this year's Weston Sand Sculpture Festival.
The annual event is usually based around a theme - this year's is "When I Grow Up", aimed at capturing residents' "childhood dream jobs".
They will also have 16 artists from overseas competing for the public vote in a championship event.
The Weston-super-Mare festival is in its 11th year and runs from the Easter weekend throughout the summer.
Co-organiser Nicola Wood said: "Almost anything is possible in the eyes of a child and we wanted to capture that mentality within this year's festival, which is now in its 11th year."
