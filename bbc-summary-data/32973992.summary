A £1.5m grant will fund the plans in Anglesey, Bangor, Cardiff, Cardigan, Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley and Tregaron in Ceredigion.
It will take the total number of Welsh language centres to 10.
Mr Jones said they offered "wide-ranging opportunities" for people to use Welsh at "grass roots level".
"Already we've seen some exciting centres being developed across Wales thanks to the Capital Investment grant, demonstrating our commitment to seeing the language thrive in our communities," he said.
The Cardiff centre will be run alongside the Cardiff Story museum at The Old Library on The Hayes in the city centre.
