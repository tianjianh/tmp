[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish child abuse inquiry to hold first hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish child abuse inquiry is to hold its first preliminary hearing in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chairwoman Lady Smith will use the hearing to explain the approach of the inquiry and provide an update on its current investigations.
The probe is expected to last four years, and will look in detail at historical abuse of children in care.
Education Secretary John Swinney has rejected calls for the remit of the inquiry to be broadened.
No witnesses are expected to appear at what is a procedural hearing, at which Lady Smith will set out how people and interested parties can participate in the inquiry.
The inquiry states its purpose as being "to investigate the nature and extent of abuse of children whilst in care in Scotland", while considering "the extent to which institutions and bodies with legal responsibility for the care of children failed in their duty", in particular seeking any "systemic failures".
Its terms of reference say it covers a time period "within living memory of any person who suffered such abuse", up until the point the inquiry was announced in December 2014, and will consider if "changes in practice, policy or legislation are necessary" to protect children in care from abuse in future.
The inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than Â£3.5m has been spent on it during this period.
Its original chairwoman Susan O'Brien quit the post in July 2016, complaining of government interference, while a second panel member, Prof Michael Lamb, also resigned claiming the inquiry was "doomed".
Lady Smith was appointed to replace Ms O'Brien, but Mr Swinney said he was confident a replacement for Prof Lamb was not needed - although he added that experts could be called in to assist Lady Smith and remaining panel member Glenn Houston.
There were also complaints about the remit of the inquiry, with survivors' groups claiming some abusers could be could be "let off the hook" if children's' organisations, clubs and local parish churches were not specifically included in the probe.
However, Mr Swinney told MSPs that it was clear there was "not unanimity on this issue", concluding that the probe should focus only on in-care settings so that it remained "deliverable within a reasonable timescale".
He said "terrible crimes" had been committed in other settings, such as day schools and youth groups, but said criminal behaviour should be referred to the police and would be "energetically pursued through the criminal courts" where evidence exists.
A bill has been introduced at Holyrood removing any time bar on people seeking damages over childhood abuse.
