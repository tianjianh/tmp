Sudesh Patel has been running the shop since it opened in February last year but the raids have meant losses of more than Â£15,000.
Met Police believes one gang is behind the robberies. Mr Patel said more police patrols in the area would help to make them feel more safe.
Islington Council said it had spent more than Â£2 million on CCTV in the area. BBC London's Emilia Papadopoulos reports.
