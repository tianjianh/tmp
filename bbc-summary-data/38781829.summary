The Boeing 727 aircraft fuselage will be escorted by police from Bournemouth International Airport.
The journey will begin at 10:00 GMT from the B3073 Parley Lane and then on to the A31 east.
The transporter and its load will be 4.45m (14.5ft) wide - police have warned delays are expected due to its slow speed.
