Kyren Wilson said winning his first match at the World Championship was almost as good as securing his maiden ranking event title.

Wilson won a final-frame, first-round contest against Joe Perry to set up a last-16 tie with Mark Allen on Sunday.
"I want to make memories at the Crucible and you are only going to do that by winning matches," the Shanghai Masters champion told BBC Sport.
"It's fantastic to win my first match here and is only just behind Shanghai."
The Kettering potter, 24, scored six half-centuries and two tons playing a typically aggressive style against world number 10 Perry.

"It was a fantastic match throughout," Wilson said. "Me and Joe flowed off each other.
"There were a lot of big breaks and that is the way all players like to play snooker. It was very entertaining and I am sure the fans loved the decider.
"I am a very natural player and I like to go for my shots."
Wilson is relishing the chance to take on world number seven Allen over three sessions in their best-of-25 last-16 match.
"It is fantastic to play top players at top venues, so I am very much looking forward to it," Wilson added.
"It is not easy for young lads to come through and play well at places like the Crucible, but I am starting to get more and more comfortable under the TV conditions.
"After winning in Shanghai there are more expectations on me. I come into tournaments believing I can win, but you cannot get too far ahead of yourself."
