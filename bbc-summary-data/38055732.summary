A footpath level crossing at a train station has been closed due to incidents of "dangerous misuse".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Network Rail said a nine-day study at Stone station, in Staffordshire, recorded 33 "misuse incidents".
These included children standing on the crossing and not crossing safely and quickly and people looking at mobile phones as they crossed the railway.
The organisation said the permanent closure had been made to "ensure the safety of local people".

Mark Killick, area director for Network Rail, said: "We've done this for the safety of local people based on the evidence we have gathered.
"We are committed to improving safety at level crossings."
A diversion will be in place via Chestnut Grove and Mount Road/Mount Crescent, crossing the railway at the road barrier level crossing.
An average of 64 people a day used the crossing, up from 20 per day during a nine-day study in May 2015.
