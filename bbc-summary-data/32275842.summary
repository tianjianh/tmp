[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Donahoe, of Altiskane, Strabane, appeared in court charged with raping a 19-year-old woman on 22 March.
He is also charged with attempting to rape a 15-year-old girl on 7 April while on police bail for the earlier offence.
He was remanded in custody at Enniskillen Magistrates Court.
Objecting to bail, a police officer said the 19-year-old woman had identified him as the man who had twice raped her last month in the grounds of Strabane Health Centre.
Mr Donahoe was arrested later that day and admitted there had been sexual contact between him and the woman but claimed it was consensual.  He was released on police bail.
The officer said the 15-year-old claimed the accused had tried to rape her after she and a friend had gone drinking to an older man's flat on Easter Monday.
A defence solicitor said his client appreciated the seriousness of the offences and realised that "by breaching police bail he has put himself in a precarious position".
The judge told the accused he was concerned that while he was on police bail there was a second allegation and a witness "who is in fear of you".
He was remanded in custody to appear at Strabane court by video link on 7 May.
