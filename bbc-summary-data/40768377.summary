The German held firm on the windy south Wales coast as Fred Couples and Billy Andrade staged a late challenge.
It is a record 10th career senior major for Langer - one more than Gary Player.
Langer, 59, dropped two shots early in his final round, but his four-shot overnight lead was never seriously threatened as he triumphed for the second time at Royal Porthcawl.
Corey Pavin, Langer's closest rival at the start of the day's play, closed to within three shots in the early stages, but bogeys on the 13th and 15th effectively ended his challenge.
Phillip Price was the best placed home golfer, the Welshman finishing joint sixth on one over.
Langer won the Senior Open the last time it was played at Porthcawl in 2014.
