Bobsleigh and skeleton World Championships: Koenigssee replaces Sochi as hosts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2017 bobsleigh and skeleton World Championships will be held in the German resort Koenigssee after the event was taken away from Sochi following claims of doping.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation said it is not "prudent" to hold the event in Russia.
A report claimed more than 1,000 Russians benefited from a doping cover-up between 2011 and 2015.
Russia said it might seek compensation after being stripped of the event.
The German venue was picked because of its location, suitability for the athletes who will be racing, organisers' experience and track availability at such short notice, the IBSF said.
Latvia became the first nation to say they would boycott Sochi while South Korea, host of the 2018 Winter Olympics, and skeleton athletes from the United States had also been considering withdrawing.
The event takes place between 13 and 26 February.
