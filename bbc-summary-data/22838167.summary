The four-day show in Llanelwedd, Powys, attracted its highest ever attendance of 241,099 in July 2012.
The Royal Welsh Agricultural Society said the event made a surplus of income over expenditure of £209,247 which is slightly up on the figures for 2011.
The society's Winter Fair and Spring Festival also made a profit.
