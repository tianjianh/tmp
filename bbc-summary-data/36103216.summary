The Norwegian announced, three days after Celtic's defeat by Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final, he was to step down as manager in the summer.
"Some will be a little bit sad, some will be happy," Deila said.
"It's always a new opportunity for everybody. When you have a big squad somebody is not as happy as others if they don't play."
Deila says the main reason for his departure was the lack of improvement his side have shown in recent months.
"Improvement is one of my biggest values. When you don't get it, it kills me inside and I lose energy," he said.

Celtic's form in the Scottish Premiership in recent months has drawn criticism and defeats by Ross County in the League Cup semi-final and Rangers at the same stage of the Scottish Cup weakened Deila's standing in the eyes of the fans.
"I don't think there has been a lot of improvement and, when you don't get improvement, the outside pressure is going to get harder and harder as well," Deila said.
"I have no problem dealing with that, I have been sitting in this room a lot of times and there has been a lot of difficult questions.
"That is not the problem. The problem is when you don't get improvements and the things you said you wanted to create when you came in the door, you haven't created.
"One of the reasons we haven't had that improvement is because of the pressure and speculation around me all the time."
Deila hopes the side can now concentrate on protecting their eight-point lead over Aberdeen and secure a fifth consecutive title.
"That is why I think it is best for the club that new energy is coming into the club next season and now we can really focus on winning the five games and getting five in a row," he added.
"It is going to be a huge thing for me, the players and the whole club. This is why the decision has been made."
David Moyes is reportedly in the running to succeed Deila as manager, with Neil Lennon confirming he would be keen to return to the club he managed between 2010 and 2014.
