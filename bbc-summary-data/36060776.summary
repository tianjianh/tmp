[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael O'Connor scored a brace as Port Vale hammered Rochdale to dent Dale's play-off hopes and keep their own faint League One top-six aspirations alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theo Robinson's superb curler opened the scoring for Vale before O'Connor tucked home the first of his two spot-kicks after Sam Foley was fouled.
JJ Hooper raced onto a poor back-pass by Joe Rafferty to make it 3-0 but Calvin Andrew's drive gave Dale hope.
O'Connor scored a second penalty after Remie Streete had been pushed.
The result means both teams are five points away from the League One play-off places with two games to play.
