Welsh Tories pledge 70,000 new homes to rent and buy

More than 70,000 extra new homes will be available to rent or buy if the Conservatives win the assembly election, the party has said.

Housing spokesman Mark Isherwood said the target would be hit by working with builders, landlords and councils.
The current Labour-run Welsh Government had shown "no foresight, ambition or desire" on housing, he said.
The Conservatives would also retain the right-to-buy for council tenants, which Labour has pledged to scrap.
This latest pledge follows a previous announcement to scrap stamp duty - which is being devolved to the Welsh Government in 2018 - for first-time buyers on homes worth less than Â£250,000.
Mr Isherwood said: "Sadly, Wales faces a crisis in housing supply, affordability and support, which other political parties in Wales have shown no foresight, ambition or desire to deal with.
"It is also vital new properties are built in the right places. From involving local communities in the planning process, to reforming guidance to encourage building on brownfield and publicly-owned land, Welsh Conservatives will responsibly meet the challenges facing the housing sector in Wales."
