Newport County striker Rhys Healey has confirmed FA Cup rivals Plymouth Argyle have made an approach for him.

The 22-year-old, on loan from Cardiff City, has scored six goals in 18 appearances for County this season.
He said he was aware of the approach before the 0-0 FA Cup second round draw with Argyle.
"I've heard there's been interest as well but it's not for me to be dealing with that so I've left it for someone else to deal with," he said.
"I'm not surprised because if any striker's scoring goals they're going to get interest.
"But it's not down to the player to be dealing with it - it's down to someone else to deal with it for them because all I want to do is concentrate on scoring goals for Newport each week.
"I don't think it has affected me. Once I step over that line everything goes away outside football. Nothing distracts me."
Newport face Plymouth in a replay on 21 December with a trip to face Liverpool in the third round at Anfield awaiting the winners.
Before then, bottom-of-the-table County face Morecambe at Rodney Parade on Saturday in a key League Two match.
"To get out of the bottom is the main thing," added Healey.
"We need to go into Saturday knowing we are going to beat Morecambe, which we should do and crack on from there.
"We're one of the best sides in the league when we get going, so it's just a matter of getting that first win and getting the momentum going."
