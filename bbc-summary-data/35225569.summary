[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Air and foot searches have been carried out around walkways in the Auchincruive Estate and Annbank area since Graham Johnstone went missing.
A police marine unit, a dog unit and rescue helicopter have been involved.
Mr Johnstone's family reported him missing after he left his home in Whitehill Crescent, Annbank, at about 10:40 on Friday and failed to return.
Police said Mr Johnstone enjoyed walking along local river walks and routes, and although he was in good health, his family was "extremely worried".
He is about 5ft 8in tall, with grey, slightly balding hair. He is clean shaven and wears glasses.
At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing a black zipped top, beige trousers and a fawn cardigan.
An extensive search was undertaken around Oswald Bridge after a man matching Mr Johnstone's description was seen at about 11:45 on Friday.
He was wearing walking boots and carrying what may have been an olive green hat or balaclava.
The sighting has not been confirmed and police are trying to ascertain if it was Mr Johnstone.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen Mr Johnstone to contact them.
