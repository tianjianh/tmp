[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men aged 33 and 49 and two women aged 29 and 37 were in the house on Falkirk's Windsor Road when the three men forced entry on Wednesday evening.
The robbers made off, with property including a two-figure sum of cash, in a waiting dark-coloured hatchback car.
All of the suspects were described as being white and wearing dark clothing. None of the victims were badly hurt.
Det Insp Graeme Hendry urged anyone with information about the raid, which happened at about 23:50, to come forward.
He said: "This is an isolated incident during which the victims were injured, though, thankfully, not seriously.
"Nevertheless this was a traumatic experience for those involved and we are now keen to trace the three suspects who entered the home as well as another individual who we believe was waiting in the car."
