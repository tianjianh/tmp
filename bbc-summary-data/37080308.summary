Uruguay forward Suarez finished off a marvellous move, involving Denis Suarez and Arda Turan, with a firm strike.
Munir doubled the lead late on when he ran on to Lionel Messi's pass and fired past keeper Sergio Rico.
The second leg is at the Nou Camp on Wednesday, with Spain's La Liga season beginning on Friday.
