Ken Skates told the Arts Council of Wales annual conference people of all kinds could benefit if involved.
He said doing drama and sport had helped him cope with mental illness.
Mr Skates also urged arts groups to "explore and exploit every single option" for funding - crowdsourcing included - but stressed it was "not about removing government support".
"If we are to really truly ramp up investment and participation levels we need to explore and exploit every single option for getting more funding," he told BBC Wales after speaking at Thursday's conference in Cardiff.
