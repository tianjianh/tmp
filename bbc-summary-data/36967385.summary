Events such as TweedLove, the Tour o' the Borders and the Enduro World Series have all made the area popular with cyclists.
Scottish Borders Council said it wanted to develop existing events and build on consumer demand.
It comes after research by Visit Scotland showed cyclists and mountain bikers spent more than Â£155m in 2015.
The local authority has produced a draft Cycle Tourism Strategy document detailing the challenges and ambitions of developing cycling as a means of delivering economic benefits to the region.
The council is now calling for those with an interest to take part in a consultation on the issue.
