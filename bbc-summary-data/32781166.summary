[SN]TITLE[SN]
How does your front garden reflect your personality?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's front gardens are increasingly turning from green to grey, with almost a quarter now entirely paved over, a survey for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) suggests. But what does your front garden say about you?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The survey showed that 24% of front gardens are now entirely paved, concreted or gravelled. More than a quarter - 28% of the 1,492 people polled - said there was no greenery at all in their front gardens.
We asked you to share your pictures of your front gardens and show us how you've been bucking the trend with your flowers, bushes and attempts to branch out with your beautiful designs intended to reflect your personality.
Thank you for your pictures.
