Oxford had dominated the race in recent times but Cambridge took an early lead.
They held their rhythm through the tricky conditions on the Thames to triumph by five seconds.
Earlier, Oxford made it four wins in a row in the Women's Boat Race as the Cambridge boat almost sank in the latter stages.
The Dark Blues successfully found the shallower, calmer waters on the Thames and were able to power to a comfortable victory.
In the men's race, Cambridge - coached by 2000 Olympic gold medallist Steve Trapmore - made the most of their height and weight advantage.
"A lot of hard work goes into this - we wanted it more," said Cambridge president Henry Hoffstot, who had been part of the losing Light Blue crews in 2014 and 2015 along with cox Ian Middleton.
"Steve and I went out on the course yesterday," said Middleton. "We knew what the conditions would be like and the guys dealt with it really well."

In the women's race, Oxford went in as favourites and coped better with the tricky conditions.
President Maddy Badcott praised cox Morgan Baynham-Williams, who engineered a move across the river, which helped give them victory.
"We are so lucky to have Morgan - she smashed it," Badcott told BBC Sport.
"Those conditions are probably the worst I have experienced on the Tideway and I'm so glad it has worked out for us and our training paid off.
"This is probably the best team I have ever been part of and that spirit got us through the race."
