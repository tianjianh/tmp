About 100 people have gathered in Cardiff to break the daily Ramadan fast and celebrate the city's diversity.

The Ramadan Iftar has been organised by the Muslim community, to help feed the homeless and welcome refugees.
Organisers said it was a chance to celebrate the city's communities in light of recent terror events.
Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, was arrested after worshippers appeared to be targeted by a man driving a van near Finsbury Park Mosque early on Monday.
He was charged with terrorism-related murder and attempted murder.
Cardiff councillor Ali Ahmed said: "Ramadan is about sharing, caring, supporting and donating.
"We extend an invitation to anyone in the city to join us in the evening for food and friendship."
Council leader Huw Thomas said: "I, like everyone I know, was deeply saddened and shocked to hear about the incident outside a mosque in London in the early hours of Monday morning and to see news reports that a man from Cardiff has been arrested in connection with this offence.
"As a council, we will redouble our efforts, working with other agencies and partners, to reassure all of Cardiff's communities that they are welcome, secure and safe here."
Mr Thomas added: "Cardiff has always been known as a welcoming city, a city that celebrates diversity, a city that pulls together in difficult times. It's important we pull together now and don't let hate and those who promote hate to drive a wedge between our communities.
"It is a chance to show that we will not be set against each other. Cardiff has never been like that and never will be.
"We have much more in common than those who would seek to drive us apart will ever realise."
