Kyriakides, 22, is part of the squad for the Sultan Azlan Shah Tournament, currently taking place in Malaysia.
Great Britain could reach the final if they beat New Zealand on Saturday.
"It's been amazing getting the chance to play against the top teams in the world," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Kyriakides continued: "I feel very proud to be flying the flag at the moment and hopefully more and more can come from Wales.
"Welsh Hockey has changed a lot over the last few years and hopefully more Welsh players can break through into the GB team.
"There's a few Welsh lads at the moment in development and I think they've got a real big chance of coming through in the next few years."
