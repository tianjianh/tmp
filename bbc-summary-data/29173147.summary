Kwesi Appiah leaves his post as Ghana coach by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ghana Football Association (GFA) says it has parted company with national team coach Kwesi Appiah by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former coach Milovan Rajevac is being widely tipped to return to the post he held between 2008 and 2010.
Rajevac had originally been lined up to work as a technical advisor alongside Appiah.
The GFA says it will announce Appiah's replacement before October's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Guinea.
During his first stint in charge, Rajevac led Ghana to the runners-up spot at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations and the quarter-finals of the World Cup a few months later.
Appiah had been under pressure since Ghana's turbulent World Cup campaign, where they failed to win a single match against a backdrop of off-field issues.
A draw at home to Uganda in their opening Group E match in the 2015 Nations Cup qualifiers increased the calls for Appiah to move on.
Even a 3-2 win away from home over Togo on Wednesday was not enough to save Appiah's job.
Appiah and the GFA will meet next week to discuss the terms of his severance package.
