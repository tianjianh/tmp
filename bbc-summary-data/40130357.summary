Merseyside Police said in both instances the victims were shot in their homes by a group of men who made forced entries late on Thursday.
The critically ill man, who is said to be 43, was shot in the chest at home in Liverpool at about 22:50 BST.
Twenty-five minutes earlier a 27-year-old man had been wounded in the legs and arms at his house.
The first attack was at a house in Chatham Close, Seaforth, where four men forced their way into the property to shoot the 27-year old man.
In the second incident a group of men carried out a similar attack in Bradville Road, Fazakerley.
A Merseyside Police spokesman said the force is "investigating the possibility that the two shootings are linked".
Appealing to the public for information Ch Insp Paul Sutcliffe said: "I'm sure the community will be appalled to find that a man has been shot inside his home."
