The highest majority was 64% in Gosport, closely followed by Havant and the Isle of Wight on 62%.
Only three districts voted to remain: East Hampshire, Hart and Winchester, which recorded a strong 59% majority.
Hampshire Conservative MPs were divided in their reaction, with Southampton's Royston Smith expressing "euphoria" while Portsmouth's Flick Drummond spoke of future government "paralysis".
Nearly 55% of the million votes counted in Hampshire were for the Leave campaign, slightly higher than the national outlook.

In larger cities and towns such as Portsmouth and Southampton, people voted for Brexit.
Up to 54% of voters in Southampton backed the Leave campaign while 58% of voters in Portsmouth voted for Brexit.
Basingstoke, one of the last districts to be counted, also backed Brexit with 52% voting to leave the EU.
The Armed Forces Minister and Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, Penny Mordaunt, took to social media to thank local voters, while the Conservative MP for Southampton Itchen, Royston Smith, spoke of his "euphoria".
The Conservative leader of Fareham Borough Council, Sean Woodward, tweeted: "We got our country back."
But other political leaders voiced fears for Britain's economy.
The Conservative MP for Portsmouth South, Flick Drummond, said the result would "paralyse" the government while it concentrated on renegotiating trade agreements and trying to attract foreign investment.
The Labour leader of Southampton City Council, Simon Letts, said: "What I'm really scared of is that the economy will go into recession and the public finances will deteriorate rapidly."
The leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Portsmouth City Council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson, said trade with the rest of Europe would be more difficult.
He told BBC Radio Solent: "Take the motor industry - if we're going to have tariffs put on our exports of cars, why do Peugeot keep building cars in Britain?"
There was a mixed reaction from businesses in the region.
The Basingstoke-based AA said drivers could expect higher petrol prices, due to the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar.
Colin Boswell, who runs the Isle of Wight Garlic Farm, said the vote was a "step backwards".
He said: "The European market was an increasing part of our trade. There was a lot of interest in garlic and what we do and we will have to see what the future brings."
But Angela Lloyd, secretary of Viviers Fish Market in Portsmouth, said her boss was "dancing on the quay" with delight.
She said the business had been badly affected by EU regulations and limits on fishing, which had led to higher imports from Spain.
