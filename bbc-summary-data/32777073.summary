Cameras captured the man delivering the "vicious blow" on Northgate in Darlington at 13:30 BST on Sunday.
The RSPCA, which was alerted by a member of the public who tried to intervene, described the attack as "absolutely shocking".
The footage shows a man walking the dog on a lead and lashing out when the animal resists.
RSPCA inspector Clare Wilson said the man was seen beating the dog up to six times, which was not caught on the CCTV.
She said: "The footage shows the man going to walk off, but the dog doesn't appear to want to follow him.
"He tries to drag the dog, but then turns and kicks the poor animal right under the chin, just like you'd kick a football.
"A witness said they saw the man beat the dog five or six times, which isn't seen on the footage. She said she even heard a crunching noise as he beat the dog."
Insp Wilson said the man was wearing a white t-shirt, a body warmer, navy jogging bottoms with white stripes and trainers.
She added: "The dog looks either like a mastiff or a big bull breed and is a tan colour.
"It is an absolutely shocking incident and I'm urging anyone who knows anything about who the man or the dog are to call me as soon as possible."
