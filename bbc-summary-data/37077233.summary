An artist famous for making a paper bridge strong enough to hold a car, is creating a new installation inspired by the waterfalls of the River Tees.

Steve Messam will film Cauldron Snout, High Force and Low Force in slow motion video then project the footage on to three whitewashed barns.
Mr Messam has been commissioned by Durham County Council.
The barns on the hillside at Bowlees Visitor Centre will be open to the public in October.
Last year the artist created a bridge out of 22,000 sheets of paper which was temporarily erected near Patterdale in the Lake District and weighed four tonnes.
Mr Messam said: "I will be filming each of the waterfalls in real time, but these films will be slowed down by about 20 times so that you can really see the power of the water in a way that just isn't possible with the human eye."
Waterfall will show for six nights over two weekends, 14,15 and 16 October and 21, 22 and 23 October.
