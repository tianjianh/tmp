Granit Xhaka close to completing Arsenal move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal are close to completing the signing of Borussia Monchengladbach captain Granit Xhaka.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clubs have reached an agreement on a deal reported to be worth Â£30m for the Switzerland central midfielder.
Xhaka, 23, has flown to London to finalise personal terms and have a medical, scheduled for this weekend.
His arrival will strengthen a midfield depleted by the departures of Mikel Arteta, Tomas Rosicky and - possibly - Mathieu Flamini.
Xhaka will become Arsenal's first acquisition in what is expected to be a busy transfer window at the Emirates Stadium.
