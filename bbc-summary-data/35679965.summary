The ground was cleared soon after Falkirk's 3-1 victory over Queen of the South due to the discovery of an unattended package.
The forgotten chocolates were in a bag, wrapped in gift paper.
"A police expert attended the Falkirk Stadium and the package was declared safe," read a statement from the Championship club.
