Kids try out old technology from the 80s

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tablets, computers and phones have advanced super quickly in the last few years, and are a huge part of our daily lives.

But how does today's technology compare with that from 30 years ago?
We sent Ricky to the Centre for Computing History to try out some old school tech with some local kids.
Take a look at how they got on.
Released in 1981 the top end model of the BBC Micro had 128KB of memory, to put that into perspective you would need almost 8,000 Micro Computers, to equal the same memory as an average smartphone today!
The memory was so small you couldn't even fit one photo taken from today's smartphones on there.
The BBC Micro Computer was hugely popular, and was in around 80% of school classrooms in the UK at the time.
However, they stopped making the it in 1994, when it couldn't compete with the more advanced models.
Check out what these kids thought of it...
The Apple Newton was one of the first touch screen tablet devices made by Apple, and was released in 1993.
The only way you could make the touch feature work, was by using a pen called a stylus.
One of its main features was it's ability to recognise handwriting, however many people said it was a bit rubbish and it got it wrong - a lot!
The Newton was stopped five years later because it was very expensive, and not very popular.
