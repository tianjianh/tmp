[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Molyneux's late equaliser halted Portsmouth's promotion charge as Morecambe came from behind to draw at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kal Naismith initially gave the home side the lead as he netted his sixth League Two goal of the season, but they were pegged back by the Shrimps.
Pompey had the first chance of the game in the third minute when Carl Baker tried his luck from long range but goalkeeper Barry Roche matched it with an excellent save.
Morecambe were left waiting until midway through the first half for their first effort on goal but it was wasted by midfielder Aaron Wildig, who hit it straight at Portsmouth's David Forde.
Naismith put Pompey ahead in the 64th minute with a speculative effort from 25 yards after he was not closed down by the Shrimps' defence.
However, Molyneux then drew his side level in the 83rd minute after he was played in by Kevin Ellison before smashing the ball into the back of the net.
