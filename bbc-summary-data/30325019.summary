Duncroft School: No prosecutions over Jimmy Savile inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No charges will be brought against former staff at a school in Surrey where Jimmy Savile abused girls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was alleged that two people at the former Duncroft Approved School in Staines had allowed the late television presenter access during the 1970s.
After looking into the scale of his abuse at the now defunct school, Surrey Police submitted a case summary to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
The CPS has now determined that no further action should be taken.
It had investigated whether staff were complicit in Savile gaining access to girls, or whether they were aware that such abuse took place and took no steps to report it.
Nigel Pilkington, head of the CPS South East complex casework unit, said: "After carefully and thoroughly reviewing this case, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that staff were complicit in allegations of sexual offending against the school's pupils.
"There is also insufficient evidence to suggest that members of staff knew of the risk that the man [Savile] posed and wilfully failed to protect pupils from harm.
"Furthermore, a jury would also have been required to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the staff members considered the complaints made to be genuine and wilfully chose to ignore them.
"We concluded that, on the evidence, a jury would not be able to do so," he said.
As part of its investigation, Surrey Police had interviewed more than 100 former pupils at Duncroft, which closed in the 1980s.
Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, was a Radio 1 DJ and the presenter of the Jim'll Fix It show on BBC One.
He was one of Britain's most prolific sex abusers and is thought to have assaulted hundreds of people between the ages of five and 75.
He had denied the allegations of child abuse at Duncroft when questioned by police in 2009.
The matter was referred to the CPS which advised there was insufficient evidence to take further action.
