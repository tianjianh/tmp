Irish vote prompts same-sex marriage call for Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The yes result in the same-sex marriage referendum in the Republic of Ireland has led to calls for its introduction in Northern Ireland.

More than 62% voted for same-sex marriage - almost 38% were against it.
A mass rally in support of same-sex marriage is due to be held in Belfast next month.
Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International, said the referendum result was an endorsement of equality for all citizens in the Republic.
"That elation is tempered by the realisation that here it is business as normal," he said.
"It is discrimination as usual in Northern Ireland for same-sex couples, for gay people.
"This is now the one region in the UK and Ireland where gay people are not allowed to get married."
The former moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Dr Norman Hamilton, said he believed legalising same-sex marriage would be resisted in Northern Ireland in the immediate future.
"I can't see the Presbyterian Church or, indeed, any of the other Churches changing our fundamental position on same sex marriage in that we do regard marriage as being exclusively between a man and a woman," he said.
"But if there were changes to be made, then I would want to urge that they are made by the legislators rather than by the courts."
DUP MLA Peter Weir said he did not see the need for a referendum in Northern Ireland.
"We are defending the role of traditional marriage," he said.
"This is an issue that has been debated on four occasions in the assembly and, on each occasion, it has been rejected by the majority of assembly members.
"We believe that the traditional marriage definition is correct one. We would be concerned about the impact on Churches.
"We don't really run social policy in this country by way of referendum."
CaitrÃ­ona Ruane, Sinn FÃ©in, said Patrick Corrigan from Amnesty was "absolutely right".
"I was part of the campaign in the south over the last number of weeks. There was a real conversation across family tables amongst the young and old.
"For the first time my LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) friends felt part of the conversation. An overwhelming population in the south voted for it - they voted yes for equality.
"If we do not legislate I have no doubt there will be a legal case  on discrimination."
The first gay marriages are likely to take place in the Republic of Ireland in early autumn.
On Sunday, one of Ireland's most senior Catholic clerics called for the Church to take a "reality check" following the country's overwhelming vote,
Diarmuid Martin, Archbishop of Dublin, said the Church in Ireland needed to reconnect with young people.
The archbishop told the Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰: "We [the Church] have to stop and have a reality check, not move into denial of the realities.
"I appreciate how gay and lesbian men and women feel on this day. That they feel this is something that is enriching the way they live. I think it is a social revolution."
In total, 1,201,607 people voted in favour of same-sex marriage, while 734,300 voted against.
Same-sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries worldwide.
