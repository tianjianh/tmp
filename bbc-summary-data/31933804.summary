Dragons' Den hires three new, er dragons for new series

"I'm in." We like to think that's how Dragons' Den bosses were greeted after recruiting three new entrepreneurs.

BBC Two has announced Nick Jenkins, Sarah Willingham and Touker Suleyman will join the show for series 13.
They'll join existing Dragons, Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden as businessmen and women enter the Den to pitch their ideas to the multi-millionaires willing to invest their own cash.
But who are the three new additions? We've taken a quick look.
You might not recognise the name, but one of his company's TV adverts is probably engrained in your memory.
Nick, who originally studied Russian at University, is the founder of online personalised greeting card website Moonpig.com.
We know you're humming right now!
He sold the company to Photobox.com for Â£120million in 2011 and has since invested in start-up businesses, mostly in the technology and internet retail space.
"I am very excited about joining Dragons' Den and using my experience to back some great new businesses and help them through the turbulent first years," he said.
If you're one for fancy suits then you may have visited one of Touker's stores.
He's the owner of fashion brand Hawes & Curtis. He's also the man behind womenswear label, Ghost. Ask your older sister.
After starting his retail career at the age of 18, Touker's rise in the business world hit a stumbling block in the 1980s when one of his business ventures went into liquidation.
He was forced to start again from nothing.
"It is a privilege to join the panel of Dragons' Den," said Touker.
"I want to support people with the guts to pursue their dreams and provide the financial backing, opportunities and support that will ease their path to success."
We figured Sarah's the Dragon we'd like most to go for a drink with.
She has combined her passion for business, food and drink into a multi-million pound business empire.
In 2003, Sarah bought The Bombay Bicycle Club, turning it into the largest and most successful Indian restaurant chains in the UK before selling up a few years later.
Sarah, who appears on TV offering money saving advice, also co-founded and invested in The London Cocktail Club and Craft Cocktail Company.
The three Dragons will replace Piers Linney, Kelly Hoppen and Duncan Bannatyne.
It means Peter Jones is the only original investor left on the show.
Filming for the new series of Dragons' Den begins next week and will return to BBC Two later in the year.
