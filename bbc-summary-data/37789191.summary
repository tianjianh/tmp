Around 19 websites believed to be selling diet products containing a chemical linked to a series of deaths in the UK have been closed down.

The Food Standards Agency said the websites selling 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) were shut down in the last year.
But a BBC investigation has found hidden sites on the so-called dark web were still selling the products.
DNP is an industrial chemical licensed for commercial use but not for human consumption.
In April 2015, Eloise Aimee Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury took diet pills she had bought over the internet. Later that day she was dead.
Sean Cleathero died in October 2012 aged 28, after taking an illegal slimming pill in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.
His mother Sharon Ayres, said: "Why would people still want to take it anyway, whether they think there is a safe dose, because there isn't a safe dose?"
Former Prime Minister David Cameron raised the issue in the Commons following the death of Sarah Houston who died in Leeds in 2012 after she had taken pills containing DNP.
The BBC investigation found a number of suppliers were marketing DNP as a diet product for human consumption.
A number of samples were bought online and sent for laboratory tests which found they contained about 40% DNP - a potentially lethal amount.
Jon Griffin, analyst for Kent Scientific Services at Kent County Council, said: "You're not being able to control your body temperature, at 40 per cent that danger rises significantly, this has got some potential in there for very serious repercussions.
"Worst case scenario would be death."
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) seized Â£1.4 million worth of unlicensed dietary medicines in 2015-16, Â£960,000 more than two years before.
Lynda Scammell, senior policy manager at the MHRA, said: "The internet offers access to a vast number of websites offering products marketed as 'slimming' or 'diet' pills.
"Many of these pills will not be licensed medicines. That means their contents are unknown and untested.
Chances are they simply will not work, but they may contain dangerous ingredients," she said.
"The consequences for your health can be devastating."
