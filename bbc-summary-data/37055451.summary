Dujardin, who could become the first British woman to win three Olympic gold medals, posted a score of 85.071% - the highest of all 44 competitors.
It helped move the British team of Dujardin, Carl Hester, Fiona Bigwood and Spencer Wilton up to second.
Germany (81.424) lead ahead of Britain (79.252) and the US (76.971).
The team competition concludes on Friday, with the top six qualifiers completed by the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.
"I think, for me, going in there today was about going in and enjoying it. That was the biggest thing," 31-year-old Dujardin said.
"I watched a lot of people on the first day going in there looking nervous.
"I thought, 'It's my absolute passion, I've got the horse of my life, I've got a top trainer and huge support team around me, so go out there and enjoy it'."
