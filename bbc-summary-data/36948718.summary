[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blues made six changes to the side held to a goalless draw by Cardiff on Saturday, and dominated the first half.
But Alex MacDonald worked hard to keep Oxford moving forward as the game wandered aimlessly into extra time.
Sercombe was positioned perfectly to head home a left-wing cross two minutes from time as Oxford, newly-promoted to League One, reached the second round.
