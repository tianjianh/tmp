Beaten Premiership finalists Wasps have stepped up their rebuilding for next season by signing South Africa centre Juan de Jongh from the Stormers.

The 29-year-old centre will join up with Wasps after completing the South African Super Rugby season.
De Jongh has won 19 caps since scoring a try on his international debut against Wales in June 2010.
"Juan's international experience and ability to play 12 and 13 will benefit us," said director of rugby Dai Young
"He has a good eye for a gap and plenty of pace which makes him dangerous in attack, while he also has strong organisational skills in defence.
"With Kurtley Beale returning to Australia to further his Wallaby career, Nick De Luca retiring and Alapati Leiua moving to Bristol, Juan and Gaby Lovobalavu's arrival will add to the talented group of centres we have at the club."
Wasps were beaten 23-20 after extra-time by Exeter Chiefs in Saturday's Premiership final at Twickenham.
