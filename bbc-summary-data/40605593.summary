"We are really excited that Cameron has signed an extension to his contract," said head coach Pierre de Bruyn.
"He has been a match winner for us with the bat in both in the 50-over and T20 format, offers us a good option with the ball and is also a fine fielder."
Delport took 1-14 and then hit four fours in a 17-ball 19 last week in the Foxes opening T20 Blast three-wicket victory over Lancashire.
Leicestershire return to action on Friday when they travel to New Road to face Worcestershire.
