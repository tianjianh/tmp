The 43-year-old's publicist Annett Wolf said in a statement on Tuesday that he had the support of his long-time partner, the actress and filmmaker Jennifer Westfeldt.
The couple are asking for privacy and sensitivity over his stint in rehab.
The disclosure comes ahead of the final season of the 1960s advertising agency drama Mad Men.
The final seven episodes of the seventh series begin on Sky Atlantic on 9 April.
Hamm plays Don Draper, a troubled advertising executive in New York with a dark past.
He's been nominated for numerous Emmy Awards but has never won one.
Last year Hamm told Newsbeat that he was the only one left filming the final scenes of Mad Men and that "it was emotional".
