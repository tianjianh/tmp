The new roles come on top of 100 jobs announced by the company in November, as they expand their operations in Forres.
The latest posts range from customer services to senior management positions.
Capita said in a statement it hoped to have all the new staff on board by the spring.
Capita Scotland chief executive Steve Langmead said: "The 140 new roles will mean that Capita now employ 300 people in Moray and over 500 in the north of Scotland.
"The high quality of people available in the north of Scotland, coupled with the excellent support we receive from the Scottish government, is making this a very attractive area for continued expansion."
Fears about employment in Moray were raised in July last year when RAF Kinloss stopped functioning as an airbase.
Following the UK government's Strategic Defence and Security Review, the base is to become an army barracks.
SNP Moray MP Angus Robertson said Capita's commitment to Forres was "extremely important" for the local economy, especially given the major reduction in forces personnel at Kinloss.
Capita employs more than 4,000 people in Scotland in a wide range of businesses, including life and pensions administration, property consultancy, IT services, recruitment and occupational health services.
