The 2011 Masters champion birdied four of his final seven holes to finish 16 under par at Waterkloof.
The tournament win is Schwartzel 11th European Tour title, eight of which have been won in his home country.
South Africa's Anthony Michael finished third on six under, two shots behind Denmark's Winther.
Winther was the only non-South African in the top six, with Justin Walters, Richard Sterne and Dean Burmester tied for fourth on five under.
Schwartzel, 31, paid tribute to his vision guru Dr Sherylle Calder after completing his second Tour win of the season, following November's Alfred Dunhill Championship victory.
"I played really well all week, but today I thought I was a bit iffy at stages," the world number 43 said.
"The difference today was I was putted really well. I spent many hours on the putting ground over the last few days, and working with Sherylle last night, I definitely found something."
