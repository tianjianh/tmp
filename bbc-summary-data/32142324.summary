She died of heart failure and stopped breathing as her grandson and nursing home workers stood by her side.
Tomohiro Okada, an official at her Osaka nursing home, praised her for achieving a healthy long life.
"She went so peacefully, as if she had just fallen asleep," said Okada. "We miss her a lot."
Okawa, born in Osaka on 5 March 1898, was recognized as the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013.
Okada said Okawa lost her appetite about 10 days ago.
The daughter of a kimono maker, she said at her birthday celebration that her life had seemed short.
Okawa married her husband, Yukio, in 1919, and they had two daughters and a son.
She is survived by four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
Her husband died in 1931. She was 47 when World War Two ended.
