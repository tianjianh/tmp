Most of all, it's a chance for more women and girls to get involved in physical activity. In fact, a number of sports organisations and clubs are using this week as an opportunity to introduce females to their sport, offering sessions to try out something new.
Here's just a small sample of the ways that you can get involved in Women's Sport Week:
In honour of Women's Sport Week, BBC Get Inspired and Radio 1Xtra present Body Talk, an intimate and interactive discussion on body image issues for women in and around sport.
Radio 1's Adele Roberts will be chatting with a collection of open and honest women from the sport and entertainment worlds.
Five-time Paralympic gold medallist Hannah Cockcroft, So Solid Crew's Lisa Maffia, two-time Olympic cycling champion Joanna Rowsell Shand, Olympic boxer Natasha Jonas, rapper Nadia Rose, TV psychologist Emma Kenny and Liverpool's own Olympic heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson are just some of the people we'll hear from.
What you need to know
The group will be talking at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) in Liverpool on Thursday, 6 October at 14:00 BST.
