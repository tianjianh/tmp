[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solicitor's injuries were 'in keeping with assault'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solicitor who was killed by her drug addict boyfriend suffered injuries "in keeping with assault" Swansea Crown Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Jones, 38, was due to stand trial for the murder of Alison Farr-Davies, 42, in Swansea last September, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
She had suffered a brain haemorrhage and injuries to her body.
The court was previously told the couple's neighbour thought she heard someone fall down the stairs.
Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Jones said a post-mortem examination suggested the most likely cause of death was blunt head and chest injuries, as well as a penetrating cardiac injury.
He said Miss Farr-Davies suffered injuries to her face, neck, arm and torso, and the overall pattern was "in keeping with assault, and not a fall".
Ms Farr-Davies, from Kidwelly, had qualified as a solicitor in 2001 and practised in Cardiff and England.
She had become a drug user and met Jones when she was sleeping rough in Swansea. They moved into a flat on Neath Road and started a relationship.
The day before her death a neighbour peered through their letterbox after hearing what she thought was a person falling down the stairs.
Jones said "nothing was wrong" and promised to call an ambulance. It was not until the next day that he made the call, and when police arrived he escaped through a window.
Reading her impact statement, Louise Staples said her sister's death has "destroyed us all".
"I have nightmares. Seeing her face in the mortuary haunts me," she said.
She told court she had asked Jones to take care of her sister and he said he would.
The hearing continues.
