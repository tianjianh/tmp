Rossnowlagh hosts annual Orange Order parade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual Twelfth of July parade in Rossnowlagh in County Donegal has taken place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fifty lodges from counties Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan were joined by lodges from Northern Ireland.
The traditional parade takes the marchers from St John's Parish Church along a one mile route into the village.
The parade was accompanied by several bands.
County Grand Master of the Orange Order in Donegal, David Mahon, described the parade in Rossnowlagh as a traditional family day out in a county where he said there were good community relations and a respect for diversity.
Edward Stevenson, the Grand Master of the Orange Order of Ireland, said this year's event was particularly poignant.
"It's 100 years since we're commemorating the Battle of the Somme where many men from both Donegal, Tyrone and right across Ireland went to fight for king and country at that time," he said.
"Indeed I was in France in the past week on the 1st of July at the special commemorations for that."
The march comes before the annual 12 July celebrations in Northern Ireland, marking the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.
