A new visitor centre at the Battle of Britain memorial - designed in the shape of a Spitfire wing - is beginning to take shape.

The building at Capel-le-Ferne, in Kent, is due to open in 2015, in time for the battle's 75th anniversary.
The steel framework, intended to recreate the shape of the iconic fighter, is currently being installed.
The centre will tell the story of the World War II battle over Kent and Sussex in 1940.
It is being built at the end of an existing memorial, which is shaped like a three-bladed propeller.
Work began in September, with Wing Cdr Bob Foster, 93, using a digger to break the ground.
He flew over 40 sorties in the battle and is the last remaining member of his squadron.
