Lengthy talks to settle how Cardiff council will deal with a budget shortfall of Â£41m have ended in agreement.

Councillors voted to pass the Labour cabinet's plans which will see a 5% council tax rise and up to 600 posts under threat.
There was also a vote of no confidence in Labour's council leader Phil Bale tabled by opposition parties.
About 100 protesters gathered outside City Hall ahead of Thursday's meeting.
Inside the chamber, Labour members put forward a new pledge, promising more cash for day centres, play groups and drugs services.
But there  were several angry calls from the public gallery about the cuts and the way which the late changes were proposed.
The amended cabinet budget was passed following a lengthy debate, with changes put forward by Plaid Cymru and the independents rejected.
The council's meeting comes after a seven-week public consultation on its 2015-16 budget proposals.
Following the confidence vote call by opposition groups on the council against leader Mr Bale, an emergency meeting is expected to take place next week.
