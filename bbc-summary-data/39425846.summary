Paul McMullen and St Mirren's Lewis Morgan, who was making his under-21 debut on his home ground,  threatened in the first half.
Substitute Ryan Hardie headed over as the hosts continued to press in the second period.
Craig Wighton was also off target in the closing stages and Dom Thomas and Morgan had efforts saved by Andreas Vaikla.
Jordan McGhee, Oliver McBurnie and Stevie Mallan all had chances for the home side and Peeter Klein's shot was deflected wide for the visitors.
The draw at least ends a run of five straight defeats for Scotland Under-21s, but their goal-less streak stretches back to 29 March 2016, when they beat Northern Ireland 3-1.
Coach Scot Gemmill had lost his previous three matches in charge since replacing Ricky Sbragia in September.
His side will face the Netherlands, England, Latvia and Ukraine in European Championship qualifiers later this year.
Morgan's club-mate Mallan, Celtic youngsters Jamie McCart and McMullen, who are on loan at Inverness and Dunfermline, and Kilmarnock's Greg Taylor were the other debutants in Gemmill's starting line-up.
And Thomas - on loan at Queen of the South from Motherwell - won his first cap as a substitute.
Scotland Under-21 coach Scot Gemmill: "If you look at the players we have, there is definitely goals in the team.
"The boys are scoring at Championship level for the first team. Anyone who saw the game will have seen how close we were to scoring.
"But when we talk about six games with no goals, that's slightly unfair in my opinion because that's not this team. You're talking about the Scotland Under-21 age group, but that is the team who played last year.
"I thought it was a positive performance. I challenged the boys to play with a higher intensity, with a real commitment to go and win a match and I think that was evident in the performance.
"Of course we're disappointed that we didn't get the win but in terms of the boys starting to gel together, I think we can really look forward to some big games later in the year.
"If they play with that intensity, with that speed, with that determination then I think there is a lot of positivity to take forward."
