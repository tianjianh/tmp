[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-0 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County's recovery under caretaker manager Mike Flynn continued as Mickey Demetriou's second-half free-kick saw them beat Yeovil 1-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles remain in the League Two relegation zone, a point behind Hartlepool with four matches to play.
The Welsh club were bottom of the table and 11 points adrift of safety when Flynn took over from Graham Westley in early March.
Yeovil stay 20th, but are now only four points clear of the drop zone.
Demetriou fired in left-footed from 20 yards just before the hour as Newport dominated at Rodney Parade to claim a third consecutive win.
Newport County manager Mike Flynn: "It was a huge effort from the players. I know I keep saying but I won't get bored of it they were absolutely outstanding again today.
"I thought we were by far the better team, we just lacked that final cutting edge in the final third. We should have scored two or three today but luckily I told Mickey Demetriou to take the free-kick and he scored."
Match ends, Newport County 1, Yeovil Town 0.
