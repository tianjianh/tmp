[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey cruised to an eight-wicket victory after being set a revised target of 182 in 29 overs after rain in Cardiff.

Mark Stoneman (74) and Kumar Sangakkara (81 not out) got them home with five overs to spare.
Glamorgan's score of 239, after being put in, owed much to Colin Ingram (72) and Jacques Rudolph (57).
Jade Dernbach bowled superbly for his 3-30 while Sam Curran claimed 3-51 to restrict the Welsh county's batsmen.
Surrey took wickets at key times throughout the Glamorgan innings after a threatening third-wicket partnership of 113 between Rudolph and Ingram, who hit three sixes, two of them colossal blows into the stands.
South African international Ingram, in his third season with the club, was presented with his county cap before the start of play.
But the middle order could only produce cameos in murky conditions as Sam Curran picked up vital victims and Gareth Batty bowled a tight spell, after Dernbach's early strikes.
Surrey's innings was delayed by an hour and three-quarters by rain, but left-handers Stoneman and  Sangakkara showed their class, the Sri Lankan veteran passing 19,000 runs in List A cricket.
Stoneman's half-century took just 36 balls as the recent recruit from Durham continued his spectacular easy-season form.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was a difficult one for us, with quite a lot of weather round we knew it was going to be a shortened game somehow, but you can't guess that.
"From the start we were under pressure with the bat, Colin and I got a partnership going then unfortunately I got out and we could never get in a position to gather momentum.
"A shortened game is always in favour of the team batting second, but we have to reflect on how we bowled - it wasn't through a lack of effort, but Sangakkara is a class batsman and he played another brilliantly mature innings."
Surrey pace bowler Jade Dernbach told BBC Radio London:
"After what happened a couple of days ago (in the defeat by Somerset), it was really important that we bounced back.
"And with such a professional performance, we can leave this little mini-away trip with our heads held high.
"You can't complain when you're taking wickets and doing a particular job for the team at that time in the game.
"Starting things off, you want to set the tone. For me, the wickets are a bonus, it's just good to start the game for the boys and get us up and running."
