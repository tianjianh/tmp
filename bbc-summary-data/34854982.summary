Ken Livingstone: Timeline of an apology

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ken Livingstone's journey from refusing to apologise to Labour shadow minister Kevan Jones over comments about his mental health to an "unreserved" apology took just over three hours - pretty long by modern standards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here's how the ex-London mayor held out:
10:51: The Daily Mirror publishes an article in which Ken Livingstone says Kevan Jones -  who had questioned Mr Livingstone's ability to lead a review of Labour's defence policy - was "obviously very depressed" and "might need some psychiatric help". Mr Jones is known to have suffered from depression in the past.
11:20: Mr Livingstone refuses to say sorry, telling LBC Mr Jones should "get over it".
11:24: George Galloway stands by Mr Livingstone, saying people are trying to "defang" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as a social media backlash gets under way.
11:29: Mr Livingstone tells the Evening Standard he was unaware of Mr Jones' mental health history, but refuses to retract his remark.
11:36: Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman issues a statement saying Mr Livingstone "should apologise straight away," as the Labour leader is "incredibly concerned that people with mental health problems shouldn't be stigmatised".
12:10: Mr Livingstone stands firm in a BBC interview. "If someone's rude to you, you are rude back," he says. Mr Jones should apologise first, he adds.
11:36 to 12:30: Condemnation and calls for Mr Livingstone to be sacked or resign from his role in the defence review. Former Labour frontbencher Chuka Umunna says the veteran left-winger appears to be spreading prejudice. Mr Livingstone still refuses to apologise.
12:30: A group of Labour MPs, including former ministers, tell Jeremy Corbyn to ring Ken Livingstone and demand he apologises
12:31: Mr Livingstone "sort of" apologises to ITV.
12:34 to 13:25: More condemnation and calls for Mr Livingstone to apologise, including from Labour MP Emma Reynolds, who says his comments are "totally unacceptable".
13:26: Mr Livingstone tells BBC Radio 4's The World at One he's sorry if Mr Jones is upset. Labour MP Pat McFadden says this apology was not genuine.
13:51: Labour deputy leader Tom Watson says Mr Livingstone must apologise and withdraw his comments.
About 14:00: Jeremy Corbyn rings Mr Livingstone
14:02: On Twitter, Mr Livingstone apologises "unreservedly". He says his comments "should not have been made at all, let alone in this context".
15:08: Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn welcomes a "full and fulsome" apology from Mr Livingstone, adding that he had caused a "great deal of offence" and he "has now done the right thing".
