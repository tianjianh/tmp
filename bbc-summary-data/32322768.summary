Hundreds of demonstrators briefly shut down a meeting in San Francisco City Hall on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a new dashcam video of an officer hitting an armed suspect with a vehicle in Arizona became public.
Mario Valencia, 36, who was being pursued by police for multiple robberies and assaulting an officer, survived the collision.
The protests across the US on Tuesday came after two cases of unarmed black men killed by law enforcement in a week.
Walter Scott, a 50-year-old, was shot in the back and killed in South Carolina.
Eric Harris, 44, was shot and killed when a 73-year-old reserve deputy said he accidently drew his gun instead of a Taser.
There have been demonstrations about police use of excessive force, ever since a black unarmed teenager was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer.
Among the cities where Tuesday's protests were held were Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Birmingham and Cleveland, where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police.
Marchers in Cleveland held signs reading "Stop Murder By Police", according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Dozens of people were arrested in New York following an otherwise peaceful protest where hundreds of protests marched  from a rally in Union Square to police headquarters.
Many of the arrests came after marchers briefly stopped traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge.
In San Francisco, some of the demonstrators were teenagers who had walked out of school in protest.
"We see it in other states, but how long until we see it here again?" Jose Ramos, 17, told the San Francisco Chronicle. "How long until it's one of our family members?"
Protesters marched into City Hall, chanting "no justice, no peace, no racist police", according to local media.
The city's legislative members then adjourned their weekly meeting.
Other protesters were arrested in nearby Oakland when they attempted to shut down a ramp onto a motorway.
In Madison, Wisconsin, four people were arrested when dozens of students blocked one of the city's busiest streets for hours in protests about the killing of Tony Robinson.
Prosecutors are still considering whether to charge the police officer in the case.
On Tuesday, Chicago announced it would pay $5.5m (Â£3.7m) in damage for city residents, mostly black, who were tortured by a police commander from the late 1970s to the early 90s.
