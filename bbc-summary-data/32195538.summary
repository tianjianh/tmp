Royal Cornwall Hospital ward closed amid Norovirus outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ward has been closed at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro because of an outbreak of Norovirus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hospital said it was "urging people to choose appropriate services" and "make use of pharmacies and minor injury units".
A spokeswoman asked families not to visit if they had been unwell and to call the ward before visiting patients.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust declared a "black alert" in February due to pressure on its services.
