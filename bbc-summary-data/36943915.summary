Surrey's hopes of reaching the last eight of the One-Day Cup took a knock as rain ruined their match against Glamorgan at the Oval

The hosts raced to 157-1 in just 19 overs before the weather intervened at 15:20 BST - with the game finally abandoned four hours later.
England one-day opener Jason Roy smashed 93 off 67 balls to follow his T20 century against Kent.
Surrey must beat Middlesex on Tuesday and hope other results go their way.
Roy hit 14 fours and three sixes as he shared a ferocious stand of 113 in just 12.2 overs with Steven Davies (42 not out), with Glamorgan shuffling through seven bowlers.
The visitors gave a competition debut to spinner Owen Morgan and a first competitive game of 2016 to seamer Ruaidhri Smith.
The umpires scheduled a restart at 17:45 BST only for rain to return as they took the field, and they finally called the game off at 19:25.
With one match to play, Surrey are still sixth, a point behind Hampshire, Kent and Middlesex and two behind Essex, although they boast the best net run-rate in the group if they finish level on points with any of their rivals.
Surrey batsman Steven Davies told BBC Radio London:
"We saw the forecast and thought whether we should try to score quicker, we decided to play the game as if it was a full game, but we score pretty quickly anyway.
"Jason certainly played very well and it was nice to get a few runs myself.
"Middlesex beat us in a T20 game not too long ago, so it'll be a good local derby - we've just got to win and see what happens."
Glamorgan spinner Owen Morgan told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was nice to make my domestic debut, albeit for 19 overs, and a great occasion at the Oval for the first time, so it was memorable for myself.
"Jason Roy was seeing them pretty well in fairness, so it's good to test yourself against guys who are doing well at international level.
"I was surprised to be involved at all this year with the first team, so I'm pretty pleased to have had a game at this point in the summer, that's a positive."
