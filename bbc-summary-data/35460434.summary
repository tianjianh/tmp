Maximum croft house grants increased from April

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The level of grant support available to help crofters build or improve their homes is to be increased, the Scottish government has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From 1 April crofters will be able to apply for up to £28,000 under the new Croft House Grant Scheme.
Up to £38,000 will be available to crofters living on islands or specified mainland communities.
The levels have been frozen since 2006 and the changes follow consultation with the public and crofters.
Environment Minister Aileen McLeod said good quality housing would help to attract and retain people in Scotland's most remote and rural communities.
She said: "The Scottish government's Croft House Grant Scheme has invested £14m to build or improve almost 700 homes since 2007 and the changes I am announcing today will help ensure this support is fit for purpose in the years to come.
"I am pleased to confirm that - despite on-going cuts to our budget as a result the UK government's continuing austerity programme - we are committed to continuing to provide funding for croft houses."
Jamie McGrigor, Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP and convenor of the Scottish Parliament's cross party group on crofting, said the extra support had been long awaited.
He said: "I broadly welcome today's announcement which is long overdue given grant levels have been frozen since 2006, meaning of course that they have been cut significantly in real terms over this period."
