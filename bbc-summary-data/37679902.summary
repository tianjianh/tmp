E-liquids that 'look like children's sweets' taken off shelves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concern has been raised over potentially harmful e-liquids being sold to look like "children's sweets".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trading standards officers in Knowsley on Merseyside seized a "large number" of the vaping liquids which are used in e-cigarettes.
A council spokesman said they were packaged to appeal to children and lacked the necessary warning signs.
E-liquids contain nicotine and can be "extremely dangerous" if swallowed by mistake.
The council removed the items from five business premises in Huyton, Prescot and Kirkby in September.
The products taken off the shelves include:
According to the Food Imitations Safety Regulation 1989, it is an offence to supply products which are not food, but could easily be confused with food due to their packaging or shape, particularly by children.
Eddie Connor, councillor responsible for public health wellbeing, said: "I'm pleased that our Trading Standards team have investigated and removed these potentially harmful products from sale in Knowsley.
"The safety of customers is always our highest priority and I'm concerned that young children could be attracted to these products because of their appearance.
Mr Connor added that Knowsley's trading standard officers are investigating the supply chain for the e-liquids.
