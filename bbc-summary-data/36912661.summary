They had gone into "quite rough" water in a red-flag warning zone at about 21:30 BST on Wednesday, fully clothed, Sussex Police said.
When police spoke to the teenagers near Hastings pier they told officers they were hunting for Pokemon, a spokesman said.
The lifeboat was then stood down afterwards, Solent Coastguard said.
