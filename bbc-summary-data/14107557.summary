[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Tunisian media have relished greater freedoms, and have been in flux, since the 2011 popular revolt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the former regime, press and broadcasters were tightly controlled. Since then, the number of broadcast and print outlets has increased, as has their freedom to report and debate political and social issues.
State TV - which used to toe the government line - has changed tack, giving airtime to the former opposition.
Freedom House says there is polarisation within the media, with news outlets divided by ideology, political affiliation and economic interests.
The state broadcaster has two national TV channels and several radio networks. Egyptian, French and pan-Arab satellite TVs have a large following.
Tunisia has a developed telecom environment, with a high rate of mobile phone ownership and relatively cheap broadband.
There were more than 5 million internet users by 2014 (InternetLiveStats.com).
Use of social media during the 2011 protests prompted commentators to describe the events as a "Facebook victory" and a "Twitter revolution".
Facebook is extremely popular and is used by many as a news source.
Pervasive filtering ended with the fall of Mr Ben Ali. Since then, officials have blocked Facebook pages set up by cyber activists, and courts have ordered bans on pornographic sites.
