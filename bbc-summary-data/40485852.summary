A man who admitted murdering his six-month-old baby daughter on Christmas Day has been jailed for life.

Lee Parker, 33 inflicted "terrible" injuries on Aya Parker after taking drugs, Bristol Crown Court was told.
Aya's skull was fractured in several places and paramedics were unable to revive her, the court heard.
Sentencing Parker, of Britton Gardens, Kingswood, Bristol, Mr Justice Phillips said he was in a "violent rage... causing catastrophic head injuries".
"Injuries like that are rarely seen in children as young as Aya," he told Phillips, who was ordered to serve a minimum term of 15 years and two months.
"This wasn't premeditated, but a rage. Her injuries show you intended to kill her, influenced by drink and drugs.
"You have never provided an explanation as to why you carried out these terrible things to your own child.
"The only explanation for the extreme and violent attack is that you had lost your temper having drunk heavily and had taken cocaine and cannabis."
A post-mortem examination revealed Aya died from blunt force trauma injuries to the head, consistent with being struck against something more than once, on Christmas Day last year.
Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Gary Haskins said Parker had changed his plea to guilty "at the 11th hour".
"As Aya's father Lee Parker was expected to love and protect her at all costs," Mr Haskins said.
"Instead, for reasons we will never know, he robbed her of the life which lay ahead of her and caused unimaginable pain to those who loved her.
"Aya was just six months old and was about to enjoy her first Christmas yet because of the actions of her father it was sadly her last.
In a written statement, read in mitigation, Parker said he hoped the guilty verdict "will help Aya's family to come to terms with what's happened".
