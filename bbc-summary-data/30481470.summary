Sony hacks: What we know from the leaks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We all now know Sony's internal computer system was hacked in November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group that did it has revealed scripts from upcoming movies as well as the salaries of some of the biggest stars and personal emails between employees.
Some details are harmless, others have triggered FBI investigations and put jobs at risk.
A group calling itself Guardians of Peace claimed responsibility although their reasons and demands remain unclear.
Sony's new film The Interview, a comedy that features a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, is the reason for all this chaos.
North Korea denied being involved in the hack attack but has described it as a "righteous deed" that may have been carried out by its "supporters and sympathisers".
Sony Pictures has contacted some US news outlets in an attempt to limit the damage.
They've asked various media sites not to publish what has been leaked by the group.
So let's look at what we've found out so far:
The Interview was meant to be Sony's big Christmas release but is now at the centre of a terror threat.
The hackers, calling themselves Guardians Of Peace, says US cinemas which show the film can expect a "bitter fate".
But America's department for homeland security said there "was no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theatres."
As a result, the New York premiere of the film was cancelled and James Franco and Seth Rogen stopped doing publicity for the movie.
Sony Pictures has now cancelled the planned release of the film. It says the majority of cinemas had decided not to show the comedy.
So what do we know so far?
George Clooney's personal emails revealed he was personally stung by the critical reaction to his film The Monuments Men.
It's claimed he was completely mortified by the poor take-up of the movie, which he co-wrote.
In an email to the co-chairman of Sony's Motion Pictures Amy Pascal, Clooney spoke about not being able to sleep over the reviews of the film.
It's also claimed he asked for "protection from all the reviews" after its initial release.
Women sometimes get paid less than men at Sony.
Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams didn't get the same fee as their male co-stars in American Hustle, according to another leak.
The Daily Beast went through thousands of emails, but to summarise, the male stars received 9% of back-end compensation, which is essentially an amount based on the success of the movie in the box office, not an upfront fee.
J-Law, apparently, picked up just 7%.
Emails reveal Sony executives made joking references to black-themed films that President Barack Obama might like.
The exchanges, reported by Buzzfeed, were between Amy Pascal (yes, remember her name - we'll be mentioning her again) and top producer Scott Rudin.
"What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?" Ms Pascal said to Mr Rudin.
It's then reported that she speculated about whether President Obama might like Django Unchained, a movie about a former slave.
Mr Rudin suggested 12 Years a Slave might be preferred.
They have both since apologised.
Comments about Barack Obama weren't the only ones flying between this duo, according to the leaks.
Mr Rudin reportedly labelled Angelina Jolie a "minimally talented spoilt brat".
It's claimed the comment was in reference to the actress being upset about director David Fincher working on the film Jobs, about the life of Apple founder Steve Jobs, when Jolie wanted Fincher to direct her in Cleopatra.
Jolie later came face-to-face with chairman Pascal at a party where photographers pictured  them sharing an uncomfortable stare.
It's fairly well-known that Leonardo DiCaprio was originally supposed to play Steve Jobs but later passed on the upcoming Aaron Sorkin movie, but what isn't common knowledge is Ms Pascal and a film producer's apparent reaction to the news.
"Horrible behaviour," producer Mark Gordon wrote. "Actually despicable," Pascal corrected him in emails leaked by the Daily Beast.
Sony declined to comment on this story.
It's thought Sony executives also made fun of Willow and Jaden Smith - that's despite his success for Sony with the Karate Kid remake and dad Will's long-standing relationship with the studio.
An email from Tom Rothman, head of TriStar productions, to, yes you guessed it, Pascal, saw the exec forwarding a link to the Smith kids' out-there interview with The New York Times, along with the note: "1. Read this. 2. they r home schooled: don't let this family date your movies!!!"
An early version of the script for the new James Bond film has been stolen by hackers.
Spectre's producers confirmed the screenplay was taken as part of an attack on Sony Pictures in November.
In a statement on the film's official website, Eon Productions said they were concerned the script may at some point be published online.
Spectre is due to be released in November 2015.
It's Channing Tatum to Amy Pascal's rescue.
Another email for her, but fear not, it is everything Tatum and caps lock fans could want.
"F YOU TED !!!! SECOND OF ALLLL TIMMMMME" he writes, after 22 Jump Street's opening weekend box office numbers were released.
The film beat Ted, Seth McFarlane's foul-mouthed bear, which they had been competing with.
"COME ON JUMPSTREETERS WE GOT CATE BLANCHETT WIT DIS BOX OFFICE".
"AAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAH" he continues for 14,553 characters.
