Top Gear: Magnificent Seven?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory, Sabine, Matt, Chris, Chris and Eddie - everyone is talking about the new supersized Top Gear line-up.

When the cast was announced, host Chris Evans remarked, "We really do have a bit of everything for everyone."
It led to some people suggesting the show's creators had taken the idea of balance a little too far:
The photo released by the BBC press office was quickly turned into a meme on social media, as people added their own faces or subtitles to the original picture.
In one, the faces were all replaced with characters from the US sitcom Friends; in another the diverse line-up included Scotland's former First Minister, Alex Salmond and Prince Charles.
One of the most shared tweets honed in on the fact that the solo female presenter, Sabine Schmitz, is pictured in a tee-shirt with the symbol of a woman.
Lots of people shared pictures of mass crowds, introducing them as the new Top Gear line-up. Even Virgin Trains got in on the gag.
Soon social media was exploding with other "new Top Gear line up" memes based around well-known groups. They included a group shot of the US Republican candidates, the fictitious Addams family and the popular BBC 1970s series, It Ain't Half Hot Mum.
And what about the new Top Gear presenters themselves? Newcomer Rory Reid and fellow co-presenter Chris Harris shared their news in rather more understated tweets.
