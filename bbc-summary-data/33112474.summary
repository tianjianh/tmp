[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raja Casablanca appoint Ruud Krol as coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morocco's Raja Casablanca have installed former Dutch World Cup captain Ruud Krol as their new coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Krol, given a two-year deal, becomes the third man to take charge of the club in a matter of months.
Raja fired Jose Romao after failing to qualify for the Champions League group phase, while his successor Faouzi Benzarti went back to his native Tunisia after three weeks in the job.
It is a fifth job in north Africa over the last two years for Krol.
In 2013 he took CS Sfaxien of Tunisia to the African Confederation Cup title and was then briefly caretaker coach of Tunisia when they lost in the World Cup qualifying play-offs to Cameroon.
He followed that with brief spells at Esperance in Tunisia and Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya.
Krol, 66, has also previously coached in Egypt and South Africa, where he won championship honours.
