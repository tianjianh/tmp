Blackburn Rovers 1-1 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship strugglers Blackburn Rovers came from behind to claim a point at home to play-off contenders Huddersfield Town.

Kasey Palmer headed home Chris Lowe's corner on six minutes, the Chelsea loan man's third goal for the Terriers.
But Danny Graham's 34th-minute penalty at Ewood Park extended improving Rovers' unbeaten run to three matches.
They still stand 19th in the table, while Huddersfield drop a place to seventh, having not won in five games.
The visitors always looked the likelier of the two sides to win but Rovers keeper Jason Steele repelled their best efforts, his best save coming when he tipped over Aaron Mooy's superbly dipping free-kick.
The Terriers had made a blistering start, as Michael Hefele's 12-yard effort was deflected wide after he found himself free in the box.
And the visitors' set-pieces caused huge problems, Hefele connecting with Mooy's corner six yards out, but the ball was bundled out, before Martin Cranie's header crashed against the bar.
Graham's penalty, high into the net after Hefele's foul on Sam Gallagher, was the home side's only first-half effort on target. But, although Steele had to make two more second-half saves from Mooy and Elias Kachunga, Rovers extended their unbeaten home run to five games.
Blackburn boss Owen Coyle:
"We've not played well, but what we did do was find a way back into the game with a little bit of spirit, a little bit of heart.
"It's a hard-earned point, it's a valuable point as always. What we've shown is that we are getting to be a far better team than we were at the outset of the season.
"That's a game that we would have lost by two or three goals in the early part, but we're far better and we've come a long way since then and we continue to look to move forward."
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:
"In my opinion we looked fantastic over the whole 90 minutes. If we win this game, I think we will speak about one of our best performances ever this season, but this was still one of our best performances this season.
"In football, sometimes you don't get what you deserve, but we have no complaints about our performance.
"If there was anyone out there who wrote us off, I think everybody has seen we are still confident and still trust ourselves to win football matches."
