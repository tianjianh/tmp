Paxman, who quit the BBC programme in June, said: "There are new and interesting questions to ask about the way we choose our governments. This should be fun."
Channel 4 executive Jay Hunt called Paxman "a compelling presenter" adding his "sense of mischief and danger make him a fantastic fit with 4".
The election will be held on 7 May.
Paxman hosted his final edition of Newsnight earlier this year after 25 years  fronting the programme. He is being replaced by Radio 4's Today frontman Evan Davis - who starts on 29 September.
The BBC announced in February that Question Time's David Dimbleby will present his final general election coverage in 2015.
It will be the 75-year-old's ninth general election, since first covering the 1979 results which saw Margaret Thatcher become prime minister.
BBC News presenter Huw Edwards will take over from Dimbleby for future election coverage.
