Akhtar Javeed, 56, from West Ham, was gunned down outside his warehouse in Digbeth, Birmingham on 3 February.
The 18-year-old was arrested in Derby on Thursday night and is in police custody.
A silver Renault Megane has also been seized and is being examined. Police had been looking for a similar car seen in the area at the time.
On the day of the shooting two masked men in a silver Renault Megane entered Direct Source 3 Ltd on Rea Street South, police have said.
Five staff members were handcuffed with cable ties and it appeared Mr Javeed was shot while fighting off the attackers.
He was found outside his business premises with a "major neck wound" and pronounced dead in hospital.
The robbers escaped empty-handed in the Renault Megane and turned on to McDonald Street, without their vehicle lights on, detectives said.
Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin of West Midlands Police said investigations into the Mr Javeed's death are continuing.
"We are still appealing for anyone who saw a silver Renault Megane in or around that time to get in touch," he said.
Detectives are also keen to speak to two people - a worker pushing a bike and a private hire taxi driver - also seen in the area at the time.
