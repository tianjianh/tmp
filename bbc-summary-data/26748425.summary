The singer sparked a flurry of interest earlier this week when he tweeted that he had given his "whole wardrobe [to] a bunch of charity shops" in Suffolk.
Now the St Elizabeth Hospice and Sue Ryder shops in his home town of Framlingham have been given eight bags of items.
EACH children's hospices also have taken delivery of eight bags.
Sheeran's mother dropped off the bags in Framlingham on Wednesday.
The St Elizabeth charity, which runs a hospice in Ipswich, said a special "one-off" sale of the clothes would take place "in the next few days".
Sue Goodchild, the charity's head of retail, said: "We are extremely grateful to Ed Sheeran and his family for this donation.
"The Sheeran family have long been supporters of St Elizabeth Hospice and understand how we rely on local support of our 26 shops to help fund local hospice care."
Jacqui Bell, manager of the Sue Ryder charity shop in Framlingham, said they would be holding an auction at the store on 18 April.
She said: "I feel that being in Framlingham, with this being his home town, we will get a good response.
"Ed has given us printed stickers to put on the items, which include sweatshirts, T-shirts and jeans, and some of them have his logo printed on them anyway."
Sheeran, 23, is an ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH) and his father dropped off more clothes at its fundraising office in Ipswich.
EACH said it was planning on holding an online auction, but it would be saving some of the items for a sale at its new charity shop, which is due to open in Framlingham in May.
