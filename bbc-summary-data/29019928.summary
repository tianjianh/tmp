Burnley sign Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley have signed Chelsea's Nathaniel Chalobah and Manchester United's Michael Keane on loan until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Chalobah, 19, has yet to make a Premier League appearance, while 21-year-old Keane has made one top-flight substitute outing for United.
Chalobah won the 2010 Under-19 European Championship with England and has 18 Under-21 caps to his name.
The pair are the ninth and 10th signings of the summer transfer window by Burnley.
Chalobah came through the Chelsea youth ranks and has regularly captained their reserve and youth sides.
He was an unused substitute for the Blues' Carling Cup third-round tie with Newcastle in 2010 at the age of 15.
Last season, he spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Nottingham Forest, where he made 12 appearances and scored twice, before joining Middlesbrough in a temporary deal in January and making a further 19 appearances.
The season before he made 42 appearances for Watford, scoring five goals to help the club reach the play-off final, where they were beaten by Crystal Palace.
Keane began his career at Old Trafford before signing professional terms in 2011.
He made his debut for United in the League Cup against Aldershot Town in the same year and, after several more appearances in the competition, finally made his first Premier League appearance for United against Sunderland last month.
Burnley are bottom of the Premier League table, with one point from their first three games.
