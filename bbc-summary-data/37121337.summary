[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sergeant guilty of machete attack in 'dented pride' row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An army colour sergeant who attacked a fellow soldier with a machete to restore his "dented pride", has been found guilty of wounding with intent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Norwood of 1st Battalion Scots Guards assaulted L/Sgt James Warnock at barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire, in July 2015.
The 24-year-old suffered a severe wound to his shoulder, Portsmouth Crown Court was told.
Sgt Norwood said he took a machete from the stores "to scare" L/Sgt Warnock.
The 38-year-old of Priesthill Road, Pollok, Glasgow was cleared of a second charge of attempted wounding with intent against Craftsman Nicholas Wood.
In an earlier trial at Winchester Crown Court, Norwood was cleared of the attempted murder of L/Sgt Warnock.
The jury in that hearing was unable to reach a verdict on the other two charges leading to the retrial at Portsmouth.
Norwood told the court at Portsmouth that he took the machete from the stores at Mons Barracks and went to find L/Sgt Warnock "to put the fear of God into him" following a row at The George pub.
He said the argument in the pub had started because of comments about "inter-brigade rivalry and insubordination" but he had become angry when L/Sgt Warnock "had taken things too far".
He said: "I didn't want to harm anyone with that machete. I made a reckless decision, a foolish decision, my pride was dented, my ego was dented.
"I knew I would be the butt of many jokes, many slanders, I know how the Army works and I foolishly went to his room to scare him, to salvage some dignity, that he would say, 'No, I shouldn't have done that, colour sergeant', that's the only reason I did it."
Norwood, who was remanded in custody, will be sentenced on 10 October.
