The 26-year-old Canadian left QPR in the summer after making 31 appearances for them in the Championship last term.
"I'm really pleased to be here and I'm ready to go. The manager puts belief in his players and this is a great group of lads," Hoilett said.
"I'm here to hopefully bring some more creativity and goals. I can't wait to get started."
Meanwhile, striker Marouane Chamakh and centre-back Sol Bamba had medicals at Cardiff on Monday ahead of their free transfers.
Chamakh, a 32-year-old Moroccan who was released by Crystal Palace, had previously attracted interest from Bluebirds boss Neil Warnock.
Centre-back Bamba, 31, left Leeds United due to personal reasons in September.
