Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson was happy with new recruits Nick Williams and Matthew Morgan after their debuts in the 25-24 win over Bristol.

Neither scored, but Williams looked sharp after a lengthy injury lay-off while Wales international Morgan impressed at full-back.
"Both players for their first outing in a Blues shirt showed what they are capable of," said Wilson.
Morgan has joined from Bristol while Williams was recruited from Ulster.
Former Junior All Black Williams signed in December 2015 but underwent surgery on a shoulder injury.
Morgan helped Bristol gain promotion to the English Premiership last season before switching to the Arms Park.
"Matthew showed great footwork and acceleration and Nick - the competitiveness in the man - a huge man with a huge collision and defensively the ability to turn the ball over," added Wilson.
"I'm sure there's plenty to come from both of them."
Morgan was happy with his first run out for the Blues, and says he is looking forward to fighting for the number 15 jersey with Blues regular Dan Fish.
The former Ospreys back also plays fly-half, but with current Wales player Gareth Anscombe and new recruit Steven Shingler at the region he expects his chances to come in the back three.
"I spoke to Danny Wilson in my first week here and he says he sees me more as a 15, so I'll just train there," said Morgan.
"Obviously Dan Fish is a 15 as well and he's a good quality player so it will be good to push each other."
The match against Bristol was the Blues' last friendly before they kick off their Pro12 campaign at home against Edinburgh on 3 September.
