Oxford United: Club closing in on training ground deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United is closing in on a deal to use Oxford City Football Club's home ground as its training facility.

In a joint statement, both clubs said the move could be a "win-win solution".
United needs a long-term training ground after BMW Mini got permission to expand its plant onto the site.
Oxford City said the deal would help secure its future, months after an inquest into its chairman's death heard he was worried about the club's finances.
The clubs plan to create a joint trading company which will lease and operate the Marsh Lane facilities, providing income for both Oxford United and Oxford City.
Oxford United previously trained on the 24-acre site of the Oxford Sports and Social Club and Oxford Cricket Club for six years.
However, following a Â£4.9m deal between BMW Mini and Oxford City Council the land is set to be built on.
United and the council have been at odds over who would run a new complex on Horspath Road, leaving the football club to seek its own solution.
The U's would still play league and cup games at the Kassam Stadium and the facility in Marsh Lane would remain Oxford City's match day home.
United chairman Darryl Eales said: "This really is a win-win solution.
"We are delighted to be able to help Oxford City whilst also establishing a broader base for Oxford United commercially, as well as hopefully for our first team and our women's team."
The news comes after the death of former Oxford City chairman Colin Taylor, who took his own life in July last year.
An inquest heard Mr Taylor, whose body was found at Oxford City's ground, was worried about the club's financial difficulties.
Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said: "The council initiated these discussions in the wake of Colin Taylor's sad death and the realisation of OCFC's financial position."
It is understood the agreement will allow the construction of an artificial surface, which will replace Oxford City's Court Place Farm pitch.
