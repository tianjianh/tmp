[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Juan Martin del Potro said he "more than won the tournament" despite his comeback at the Delray Beach Open ending in a semi-final defeat.

The 27-year-old former world number four lost 7-5 7-5 to American Sam Querrey on his return after an 11-month absence following two wrist operations.
"There are so many positive things," the Argentine said. "I'm looking forward to the future because I can make a plan for playing tournaments."
Querrey faces Rajeev Ram in the final.
Ram upset fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-3 to set up an all-American showpiece in Florida.
Despite not making the final, 2011 Delray Beach champion Del Potro performed well in his four matches - the same number he played in the whole of 2015.
He forced Querrey to produce his best display of the tournament, with the world number 61 breaking at 5-5 in each set to seal victory.
Del Potro has suffered a succession of injuries since his 2009 US Open triumph and was ranked outside the top 1,000 before this tournament.
