A biomass electricity generation plant, to be approved by the council, would use straw pellets as a raw material.
Protesters claim construction on contaminated land could pollute water sources for a nearby soft drinks factory, leading to job losses.
Power company EON said emissions would be controlled and neither air nor water sources would be affected.
Residents are worried about poor air quality, but the company said emissions would be maintained within strict levels and constantly monitored.
The site for the Â£300m scheme would be in the Thorpe Hamlet district close to the city centre.
Plans for Generation Park, on a former industrial site between the River Wensum and Yarmouth Road, have been backed by the University of East Anglia.
Campaigners said it threatened damage to a water source used by the Britvic soft drinks factory.
Campaign spokesman Conrad Jones said: "Generation Park is on the old coal-fired power station and the ground is very contaminated. Developers will have to be very careful when they disturb it."
As well as the incineration plant using straw pellets providing electricity and heating for 120 new homes, the site will contain student accommodation and research  and education centres.
Norwich City Council said the plant would also reduce its carbon footprint by 22%.
Professor Trevor Davies, from the University of East Anglia and the Generation Park spokesman, said: "There is no risk to health or threat to water sources."
Consultation on the project by the city council lasts until the end of the month.
