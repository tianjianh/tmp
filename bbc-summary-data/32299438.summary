[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton and Dunstable Hospital staff failed to advise vital injection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 24-year-old man who failed to receive a vital injection at birth at a Bedfordshire hospital has won £7.38m damages from the NHS at the High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, not named for legal reasons, was left disabled after the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to tell his mother of the importance of vitamin K.
Some babies born with a lack of this vitamin can suffer brain damage or die, due to internal haemorrhaging.
The baby developed physical symptoms of brain damage within three months.
Robert Glancy QC, for the family, told London's High Court the man's mother was never told of the importance to her child of the vitamin.
It was mandatory for the drug to be offered at the time in 1989.
By the time the symptoms manifested he had suffered lasting physical and cognitive disabilities.
The NHS which employed the medical staff at the birth was found liable.
Its lawyer Matthew Barnes, agreed the compensation claim of a lump sum of £2,345,000, plus annual index-linked and tax free payments for life.
Judge Michael Yelton said: "I can't think of  anything worse for him than having to contest this case.
"I approve this order and the underlying settlement which seems to me to be very much in the claimant's best interests."
The man's lawyer, Arani Yogadeva, said outside court that he would need 24-hour supervision and support for the rest of his life.
He had developed a cold-like illness, a high pitched cry and a squint at three months.
A CT scan at Great Ormond Street Hospital revealed a brain haemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus.
The NHS Litigation Authority said: "The court has approved compensation which will assist in meeting the claimant's current and future care needs for life.
"The legal case concerned tragic events over 25 years ago."
