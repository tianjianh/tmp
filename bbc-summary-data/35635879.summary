Gustafson, 28, has moved from prop to the middle of the front row while at Rodney Parade.
He captained Wales Under-20 in 2007 before joining Dragons and has made 149 appearances for the region.
Gustafson says the move is "nerve-wracking, but it's a great opportunity".
He added: "It's a challenging environment where you have to want to be at your best in everything you do, every day."
Ospreys rugby general manager Andrew Millward said of Gustafson: "He's someone who wants to compete for the shirt and he's eager to push on with us.
"Off the field he's been doing a lot of coaching already with aspirations in that direction and he can be a huge asset using those skills."
