[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southampton 1-0 Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlie Austin scored after just 41 seconds to earn Southampton a first win in five Premier League games as Everton boss Ronald Koeman had an unhappy return to St Mary's Stadium.

Everton had hardly touched the ball when Austin headed home from point-blank range after an assist from 19-year-old debutant Josh Sims.
Koeman, who was given a mixed reception on his return to the club he left in June, saw his side miss numerous chances to equalise.
The best fell to Idrissa Gueye, but the former Aston Villa midfielder shot over after Seamus Coleman's cut-back.
The win lifts Southampton up to 10th in the Premier League, two points behind seventh-placed Everton.

Relive the action from Sunday's Premier League games
Defeat means Everton have won once in eight Premier League games, with Koeman's honeymoon period well and truly over.
In an entertaining game, his side created enough to ensure his return to the club he successfully managed for two seasons would be fruitful.
But Everton tested Saints keeper Fraser Forster just once - a tame 93rd-minute shot by Gareth Barry.
As well as Gueye's wild miss, Barry and Ross Barkley headed great chances over while Yannick Bolasie wasted a further two opportunities in a game during which striker Romelu Lukaku, despite playing the full 90 minutes, had just 35 touches.
It could have been worse for the visitors. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the outside of the Everton post after the interval, while Maarten Stekelenburg brilliantly kept out Austin's flying header and Phil Jagielka cleared off the line from James Ward-Prowse.
It does not get any easier for Koeman. Three of their next four league games are at home to Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.
Saints boss Claude Puel sprang a major surprise by naming teenage forward Sims in the side ahead of experienced attacking options Shane Long and Jay Rodriguez.
Sims was selected after impressing for the under-23 side, and the England youth international grasped his chance with a mature and confident display.
He had already had a shot charged down when he lifted the ball into the path of Austin to open the scoring as some fans were still taking their seats.
Sims used his pace to cause Everton's defence problems and, in a display which augurs well for Southampton's future, tested Stekelenburg with a header and a shot from distance.
He also ensured Leighton Baines left with a bruise or two after an over-enthusiastic challenge, before receiving a standing ovation when he was replaced six minutes from the end.
Southampton boss Claude Puel: "It was a very good performance for us because we had a lot of injury problems before the match.
"It was a good game against a good team, it had lovely action and I took pleasure from our chances - it's interesting for the future.
"Josh Sims - for his first Premier League game, I guess it's OK! I am happy for him and the team. He showed very good progress with the under-23s and I thought it would be a good opportunity for him.
"I think it's important to respect the academy here and when we have problems with injuries it's fantastic to be able to start players from the academy."
Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "Our start was really poor because even the kick-off was ours and we lost the ball too fast.

"I can't complain about our second half but if you don't score, you can't win.
"I wasn't aware of Josh Sims when I was here and he is not my problem - I work for Everton, not Southampton."
After playing in the Europa League last Thursday and the Premier League on Sunday, Southampton now turn their attention to Wednesday's EFL Cup quarter-final at Arsenal (19:45 GMT). Everton have a full week to prepare for Manchester United's visit to Goodison Park next Sunday (16:00 GMT).
