[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miroslava Breach was shot eight times in her car outside her home in the state capital, Chihuahua.
One of her children was in the vehicle but was not hurt.
Mrs Breach had reported on organised crime, drug-trafficking and corruption for a national newspaper, La Jornada, and a regional newspaper, Norte de Juarez.
The gunmen left a note saying: "For being a loud-mouth."
The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the attack.
"This wave of violence threatens citizens' right to access vital information, and harms Mexico's democracy by limiting public debate," said a spokesman for the CPJ, Carlos Lauria.
He urged the Mexican government to put an end to the violence by bringing the perpetrators to justice.
The CPJ says 38 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992.
