Brett Morgen said he wanted to dispel any myths about the rock star who killed himself at the age of 27.
He said Cobain was someone who just wanted a family and "had a great sense of wit".
Montage of Heck features unseen footage and photographs of the singer.
The film has also used extracts from his diaries, from growing up, and carried out interviews with his family.
According to the film maker, the backdrop of the documentary is about the biggest band in 1991, but it's also about a boy who suffered "a great deal of rejection and abandonment" in his childhood.
Cobain spent a lot of time growing up trying to find his place and the "band becomes his family."
Morgen said: "We get a sense of his wit from his journals, I had no idea that Kurt was so romantic. You don't think of Kurt as a romantic songwriter.
"But especially for a man in his 20s, he was a man who was in love with love."
Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is released in the UK on 10 April.
