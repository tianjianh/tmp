The city is intending to spend Â£18m on a year-long series of art events after being awarded the title in November.
Ms Millard, who was a student at Hull University, said it was an "honour and a privilege" to take on the role.
The council said it was now recruiting a chief executive and a programme director.
Ms Millard, now a freelance journalist, broadcaster and author, said: "I arrived in Hull to study at the university over 30 years ago and in my heart, I have never left.
"Hull now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use culture and the arts to transform perceptions of the city and to change the lives of local people.
"As chair of the culture company, I want to help Hull grasp this moment. "
Hull City Council claims the year-long event could bring more than Â£60m into the local economy and generate 7,500 new jobs.
