[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A power cut left parts of Winchester without electricity, causing shops and restaurants to close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The power went off shortly before 15:00 GMT, causing businesses to shut on one of the busiest days of the year.
Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said about 18,178 properties in the SO22 and SO23 areas were initially affected by the fault.
It said its engineers had established the cause of the fault and restored power shortly after 16:00.
Donna Bache-Holleran, who owns a jewellery shop off the High Street said the power cut was "a major headache".
She said: "The High Street was absolutely packed, then all the lights went out and everyone had to empty the public out of their shops and lock up."
