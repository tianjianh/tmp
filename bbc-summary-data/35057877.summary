The Blues finished as Group G winners with a 2-0 win against Porto, meaning they will be pitted against one of six group runners-up in Monday's draw.
Either Paris St-Germain, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven, Benfica, Roma or Gent await.
"Every team finishing second wants to play us or Zenit St Petersburg," said 52-year-old Mourinho.
The reigning Premier League champions have struggled domestically, losing eight of their 15 top-flight matches this season to leave them in 14th position.
But they have fared better in European competition, winning four and drawing one of their six group games to reach the knockout phase.
The Blues secured their last-16 spot through Ivan Marcano's first-half own goal and Willian's sweet strike after the break.
"Every team doesn't want to play Barcelona, they don't want to play Real Madrid, they don't want to play Atletico, they don't want to play Bayern Munich," added Mourinho.
Mourinho is aiming to become the first manager to win the Champions League with three different clubs, having led Porto and Inter Milan to the trophy in 2004 and 2010 respectively.
And the Portuguese boss says the Blues, despite their disappointing domestic form, can upset the favourites.
"A team which is struggling as we are is obviously not a candidate to win the Champions League because you have the best teams in Europe," said Mourinho, who also managed Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013.
"But when we won it with Porto we were not candidates. When we won it with Inter we were not candidates.
"When we were candidates with Real Madrid we lost two semi-finals, and we lost two semi-finals with Chelsea as well.
"So let's see, you never know."
Mourinho summoned Diego Costa back into his starting XI after leaving the Spain striker on the bench against Tottenham and Bournemouth in the Premier League.
Costa, 27, scored 20 goals in a productive debut campaign as the Blues won the Premier League title last season, but has struggled to replicate that form this term.
However, he impressed the Chelsea manager on his recall against Porto, helping create both goals but missing some goalscoring chances.
"He could have scored two or three goals today," Mourinho said.
"His lack of confidence? Yes, clearly. But his attitude was very good and his movement was much better.
"The first goal was an own goal but his movement is great, the pass arrives. Last season he would score immediately. This season he couldn't.
The eight group winners will be drawn against the eight runners-up, although teams from the same country cannot play each other.
Teams who faced each other in the group stage also cannot be drawn together.
It means Chelsea cannot face Arsenal or Dynamo Kiev in the last 16.
