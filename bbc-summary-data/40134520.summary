The Â£5.7m extension will see Sodexo continue to provide catering on match days at Pittodrie Stadium, as well as operate the cafe and public retail units.
It will also sell and operate all conference and banqueting events.
The contract builds on a 23-year relationship between Sodexo and the club.
In January last year, officials at Aberdeen FC held talks with Sodexo after complaints from fans at Pittodrie.
Complaints were understood to have been made about the quality of catering offered and products running out
David Trotter, from Sodexo Sports and Leisure, said: "Our partnership with Aberdeen Football Club has spanned more than two decades and is an excellent example of how our team works alongside a venue to source and serve quality, locally-sourced produce to thousands of football fans, while also using our events and conferencing expertise to drive non-match day business."
