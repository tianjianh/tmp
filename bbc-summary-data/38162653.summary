The 36-year-old from Manchester played alongside wife Helen as they became the first same-sex married couple to win Olympic gold in the same final.
IoM sport's Gary Corkhill said her "vast international experience" will make her "a fascinating guest."
The awards ceremony will be held at the Villa Marina in Douglas on 22 March.
After Rio, she retired from international duty after a record 375 appearances, 49 goals and 13 years as England and GB skipper.
Corkhill added: "Kate is an inspirational and charismatic leader who helped build the incredible team ethos and commitment that drove the GB team to its nail-biting victory in Rio."
Richardson-Walsh said: "The Isle of Man has a fantastic sporting pedigree and it's a privilege to be able to take part in the awards."
Nominations for the Isle of Man Sports Awards close in January.
