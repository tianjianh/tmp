[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel John Roch, 19, from Narberth died on 20 July 2014 following the incident at Talsarn motocross track near Lampeter.
Coroner Peter Brunton concluded the teenager died as a result of misadventure.
A post mortem found he sustained a fractured vertebra and skull.
The inquest heard Mr Roch had been riding bikes since he was four-years-old and began competing at age seven.
James Evans, a marshal at the event, told the inquest: "On the second lap I saw the quad flip up.  The quad was airborne and landed vertically."
Track and accident inspector, Stephen Murty, conducted an investigation following the death and found the surface was "expertly laid" but the gully where Mr Roach crashed was an "unnecessary hazard" that would "affect the fastest riders by the most margin".
Mr Brunton said competitors would have been familiar with the gully as it had been present for around five years.
He extended his sympathies to Mr Roch's family, describing his death as "the nightmare every parent dreads."
