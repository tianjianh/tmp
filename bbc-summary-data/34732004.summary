The 26-year-old left-armer has been appointed women's cricket senior officer at the ICC and will start at the end of November.
Colvin, England's youngest Test cricketer when she made her debut aged 15 in 2005, took an indefinite break from the sport in 2013.
"This new challenge with the ICC is the perfect next step for me," she said.
"The women's game is barely recognisable from when I first started playing.
"Since my break, the speed of professionalism in international women's cricket has been remarkable.
"There are so many amazing opportunities now in the women's game - both as a player and off the field."
Colvin took 3-67 in the first innings of her England debut in an Ashes Test against Australia at Hove.
She went on to play five Tests, 72 one-day internationals and 50 T20 matches, taking 173 wickets across the three formats.
