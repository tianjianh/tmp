[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stirling Albion 1-0 Arbroath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stirling Albion closed in on the League Two play-off positions after Craig Beattie came off the bench to fire them to a win over Arbroath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Celtic striker, a 78th-minute substitute, curled the ball into the net with the outside of his right foot.
Steven Doris should have added to his eight goals this term but fired over the crossbar on two occasions.
The victory, Stirling's first in four matches, lifts them up to sixth, just a point behind fourth-placed Clyde.
