Jones met Ford at Bath's training base on Friday to talk about their England contingent and the pair earned a recommendation from their club boss.
"I gave him a couple of names such as Henry Thomas and Nick Auterac in particular," Ford told BBC Points West.
"We exchanged numbers and he's keen to build up a good relationship."
New England head coach Jones began work in the role earlier in December and is working his way around the 12 Premiership clubs.
Bath already have a large group of players in England's Elite Player Squad and several are already in Jones' thoughts ahead of the 2016 Six Nations, which starts in February.
Ford says it was a productive meeting with the 55-year-old Australian, adding: "We both want England to do well.
"It was an initial 'touch base' to tell me which players he was looking at for the Six Nations.
"There are players already in the EPS such as George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson, Dave Attwood, Dave Wilson and Rob Webber.
"He's also looking at Semesa Rokoduguni and Kyle Eastmond. I threw the two names in, plus Matt Banahan who has been playing well for 18 months."
Banahan, 28, has not played internationally since the 2011 World Cup but has not given up hope of an England recall.
"If the opportunity comes to pull on on the white shirt, I'll jump and take it," the Bath back told BBC Radio Bristol. "If my form is good enough it'll happen."
