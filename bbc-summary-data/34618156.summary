St Johnstone forward Michael O'Halloran is hopeful he can get into the Scotland squad, insisting: "You have to aim high."

The 24-year-old has been tipped by Saints manager Tommy Wright to get an international call-up.
"I picked up a few [Scotland] Under-21 caps when I was at Bolton," said O'Halloran.
"It is nice to hear the manager talking about me in potential Scotland terms. It shows he has confidence in me."
Scotland coach Gordon Strachan has signed a new contract to lead the side in their upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins in September.
Before then, the Scots, who missed out the play-offs for the Euro 2016 finals, are likely to play some friendly matches.
"The national team were really unlucky pushing for the Euros and I'd like to think one day I can get into the full Scotland squad," O'Halloran said.
St Johnstone travel to face Inverness Calendonian Thistle on Saturday, having lost at home to Partick Thistle last weekend.
"I don't think we did ourselves justice up in Inverness last year," added O'Halloran, who was loaned out by Bolton to Sheffield United, Carlisle and Tranmere before joining Saints in 2014.
"We put in two disappointing performances. We want to put that right and bounce back from the Partick defeat.
"I had a hamstring injury and then the foot was troubling me.
"I trained on the Friday before the Partick Thistle game. I wasn't sure if I was going to be involved at all so I was happy to come on from the bench.
"I am enjoying myself and I am ready to go again. I have been playing consistently on the back of a good season last year.
"And putting the Partick Thistle defeat aside, the team has been on a good run of form."
