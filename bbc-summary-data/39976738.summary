Ice Hockey UK - with Dumfries and Galloway Council - was successful in its bid to stage a section of the under-20 world championship.
Teams from Great Britain, Estonia, Japan, Netherlands, Romania and Korea will take part.
A bid to stage an under-18 event was unsuccessful and it was awarded to Tallinn in Estonia.
The Dumfries venue has previously staged a number of events including under-20 and under-18 world championship tournaments in the 2013/14 season and the women's division 2 group A tournament in 2015.
