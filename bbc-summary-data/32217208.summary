Police said the man and woman were set upon at about 03:45 BST on Sunday shortly after they left the Blue Fly Cafe Bar on New Street.
The 24-year-old man was punched and kicked for 10 minutes, suffering a broken jaw and chipped teeth.
His girlfriend, 29, was repeatedly pushed to the floor. The attack only ended when a taxi driver intervened.
PC Sophie Wilson said: "The victims are extremely grateful to the taxi driver for having the decency to stop and help when they were in a very frightening situation.
"I am appealing for the taxi driver to get in touch as soon as possible as he may have vital information about the suspects.
"This is a very disturbing incident which will quite rightly shock the local community in York and those who regard the city as a friendly and safe place to visit.
"We are providing support to the young couple from Spain who have had their stay tarnished in the most sickening and vicious way."
North Yorkshire Police said it was treating the attack as a racially-aggravated assault.
The suspects are described as white, aged between 20 and 25, with short or shaved hair.
