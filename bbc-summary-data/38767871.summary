Hate crime 'surge' after Trump win
The Delta airlines employee, who wears a heard scarf or hijab, was sitting in her office on Wednesday evening when Mr Rhodes is alleged to have come up to the door, sworn at her, punched the door, blocked the doorway and kicked her in the right leg.
When another individual intervened and she then left the office, he is alleged to have followed her and got down on his knees in an imitation of Muslim prayer.
"[Expletive deleted] Islam, [Expletive deleted] ISIS, Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you. You can ask Germany, Belgium and France about these kind of people. You will see what happens," he is accused of shouting.
