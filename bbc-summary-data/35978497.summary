Hull's traditional indoor market is to undergo a £1.6m refurbishment as part of plans to attract new visitors to the city.

The market, built in 1902, will have an expanded food court, additional stalls and a live performance area.
The work is part of a larger £25m redevelopment of the city centre in preparation for Hull hosting the City of Culture arts festival in 2017.
Hull City Council said work is expected to be finished by summer 2017.
Council planning documents said the market had become increasingly rundown as shoppers have moved away from Hull's old town towards the new retail development to the west of the city.
Garry Taylor, a projects manager at the council, said: "It is only right that as part of the regeneration of the city centre, the market also receives a facelift."
Plans for a University Technical College to be built next to the city's New Theatre were approved during the same meeting.
The £10m project will eventually house 600 students aged 14-19.
