[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 4-1 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic made it two wins from two at the start of the League One season as Nick Powell's second-half double helped them overcome Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics led when Michael Jacobs turned in Powell's cross but Bury debutant Alex Bruce quickly headed in a leveller against his old side.
An unmarked Powell then nodded in Lee Evans' cross and he made it 3-1 from the spot after Ivan Toney was fouled.
Evans found the top corner in stoppage time to extend the margin of victory.
For hosts Wigan - relegated from the Championship last term - it was a third win in a row in all competitions this term, having opened with victory at Milton Keynes Dons before seeing off Blackpool in the EFL Cup.
Former Hull City and Wigan centre-back Bruce, 32, signed for the Shakers earlier on Sunday on non-contract terms.
