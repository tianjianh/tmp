[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been unveiled to turn a former Borders golf course into an upmarket holiday estate.

Rutherford Castle Golf Club closed down in 2015 due to falling membership.
Development firm Richmond Wight Estates bought the 200-acre site near Carlops, and plans to transform it with 300 luxury lodges, a dry ski slope, and leisure and equestrian centres.
Detailed plans, which include retaining nine holes of the golf course, are to be submitted later in the year.
It is thought the project could create about 200 jobs.
Richmond Wight Estates has previously developed parks in Perthshire, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.
Managing director Chek Whyte said: "We are very pleased to have concluded this deal to buy the land at Rutherford Castle and expand our leisure portfolio, in a fantastic location well placed for both Edinburgh and Glasgow."
Plans were previously approved to build a Â£50m hotel at the site, although developer Manor Kingdom eventually used its part of the site to build luxury housing instead.
