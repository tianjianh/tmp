Leyton Orient director of football Martin Ling says he may not hire a new manager before the start of pre-season.

Current boss Omer Riza is out of contract on 30 June, with the National League club's players scheduled to start pre-season training on 3 July.
Former O's boss Ling returned to the club on Friday, following a takeover by a consortium led by Nigel Travis.
"If it takes a little bit longer to get the right man, that's what we'll take," Ling told BBC Radio London.
"The fact that the first-team coach isn't here for the first day of pre-season isn't as important as getting the right man."
Ling also said he does not expect to have a full squad ready for the start of the season on 5 August, with only 15 players currently on professional deals.
"I just feel that we've got to be careful that we just don't dive in quickly and get the wrong players," he said.
"I'm looking more at the end of August to have a finished squad than the start of August if I'm honest, because you've got the window open to then.
"Also, if you have got a couple of shortages in positions - which I don't expect to have - then we can use the loan market where the Football League can't, which is a big advantage, especially if you've got mates like [manager] Dean Smith at Brentford."
Meanwhile, Riza told the club website on Saturday that he will re-apply for the role of first-team manager.
An Orient statement said: "It was explained to Omer that, with no coaching staff under contract beyond 30 June, the club will be undertaking a full and comprehensive recruitment process for all senior coaching positions."
The 37-year-old, who was the O's assistant manager before replacing Danny Webb on 30 March, added: "It is with great disappointment that my meeting with Leyton Orient did not involve any guaranteed offer of a position for me.
"I was thanked for all my hard work and invited to re-apply for one of three roles which are available. I have made the decision to apply for the role of first-team manager.
"I have also indicated to the club one other role that I would be happy to fill within the academy. I have worked tirelessly during the off season to ensure that, whatever the fate of the club, the team was handed over in the best possible condition."
