Ten-goal striker Brunt, 22 damaged cruciate knee ligaments.
On-loan Hibernian defender Forster, 22, broke his jaw after colliding with advertising hoardings at The Hive.
"It's two players that we will miss here for the rest of the season it looks like," manager Derek Adams said.
"From my point of view it's hugely disappointing, and the 17 minutes of injury time tells you how serious the injures were," he told BBC Radio Devon.
Forster has played five times for Argyle since making a loan-move to Home Park in January.
"He slid off the end of the pitch and hit the barrier full-on at high speed, it was a really sickening injury," said Adams of Forster, who was taken to hospital after the incident.
On Ryan brunt's injury Adams said: "It caught underneath him. He knew right away that he had a problem, so it looks as though it could be a cruciate.
"It's a big blow to lose two big players for us and when you've got 12 games to go in the season you don't need to lose any more, we're tight enough as we are as a squad and we don't need any more injuries."
