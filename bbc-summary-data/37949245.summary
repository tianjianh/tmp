[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the world's most deadly snakes has been discovered on a boat at Aberdeen Harbour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The green mamba was found on a ship that had docked on Wednesday from west Africa.
It is understood workers on the vessel put the snake into a box before calling animal welfare experts.
A police escort was used to transport the animal to a Scottish SPCA animal centre in Drumoak. However, the snake was later euthanised.
The SSPCA said the nearest anti-venom was held in London and that the snake was destroyed amid health and safety concerns.
The western green mamba feeds on small animals and rodents and is mainly found in the coastal tropical rainforests of western Africa.
Experts say its bite can be fatal in as little as 30 minutes.
