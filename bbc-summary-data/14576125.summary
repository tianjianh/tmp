Dover councillor apologises over 'racist' Facebook post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor in Kent has been suspended from the Conservative Party while it investigates an apparently racist comment he made on Facebook.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dover District Councillor Bob Frost appeared to make comments about black people during an online conversation about the recent riots.
Mr Frost, a teacher, has apologised "unreservedly" and deleted the posts.
Deputy Council Leader Sue Chandler said: "There is no place in our society for this kind of language."
She added: "We have therefore suspended Councillor Frost from the Conservative Group pending investigation."
The comment was made while Mr Frost was having a conversation on the social-networking site, alluding to the London riots while he was on holiday.
On his status he wrote: "I'm missing the vibrant and multi-cultural society which I normally celebrate here in Sicily! Not!"
It was then suggested by someone else on Facebook that he take a trip to north London.
He replied: "All the bunnies here are of the woodland variety rather than the jungle."
Sola Afuape, chair of the equality charity Afiya Trust, said: "You don't expect somebody in a position of power, in a leadership position, to make comments like this.
"They're clearly offensive - racist in fact."
In a statement, Mr Frost said: "What I said was wrong and I apologise unreservedly.
"I am mortified by the offence that I have caused and have deleted these comments.
"I am very sorry."
