Susan Gravel, 62, was hit while walking along Station Road, near the junction with King George's Court in Stainforth, at about 12:55 GMT on Saturday.
Police said the stolen grey or silver BMW had crashed into a parked vehicle on Station Road before the incident.
It was seen leaving an Asda supermarket car park, close to where officers in an unmarked police car were patrolling.
Mrs Gravel's family paid tribute to a "loving, caring sister, mother, aunty and grandmother".
"We have been left devastated by our loss," her family said.
Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the crash. One reads: "Sleep tight Aunty Sue. Love you always."
South Yorkshire Police said the vehicle's registration started with HV07.
In a statement, the force said: "The police vehicle was not actively pursuing the BMW when the collisions occurred, however the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission due to the earlier involvement of officers from South Yorkshire Police."
The force has appealed for the driver of the BMW to contact the police and for any witnesses to come forward.
PC Phil Carson said: "We urgently need people to contact us who may have seen the car involved, whether it was before, during or after the collision.
"Understandably, Susan's family has been left devastated by their loss and we need to interview the BMW driver as soon as possible.
"If you were the driver or know them, contact us now."
