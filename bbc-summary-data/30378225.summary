Christmas Henry vacuum cleaner nativity made in Westcliff-on-Sea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nativity scene using Henry vacuum cleaners has been created in the window of an electrical goods shop in Essex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kris Sale, from Sale Appliances in Westcliff-on-Sea, came up with the idea because he had a soft "baby Henry" toy and said he enjoyed making "quirky" window displays.
The five cleaners represent the kings, Mary and Joseph.
"Kids love it," said Mr Sale who has also built a stable, topped with a star, to house the vacuum cleaners.
Mr Sale has a reputation for his window displays. In the past he has turned a washing machine into a fish tank, and put a dummy repair man inside a cooker to make it look as though the appliance was being mended.
He said: "We're planning to change the nativity for New Year's Eve. The Henrys are going to have a party. It'll be one heck of a bash."
