A part of the shrine collapsed and many are feared trapped under the rubble.
Rescue operations have been taken up on a "war footing", police officials told BBC Hindi.
Officials said the main shrine, which attracts thousands of pilgrims, was not affected.
The damaged portion of the Manikaran Sahib gurudwara, in the state's Kullu region, has been cleared of all pilgrims and the injured have been taken to hospital, police said.
