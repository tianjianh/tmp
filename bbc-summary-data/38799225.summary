A teenage driver has been sent to a young offender institution for five years after he left a cyclist with life-changing injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benjamin George, 19, of Cornish Gardens, Bournemouth, pleaded guilty to eight offences including causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Bournemouth Crown Court heard the cyclist was catapulted into the air after George went through a red light.
Dorset Police had abandoned a pursuit of George two hours earlier.
Officers began to follow his Vauxhall Tigra at 02:18 BST on 27 October and saw the car head the wrong way down a dual carriageway.
The chase was aborted because of the "level of risk" involved, police said.
Council CCTV operators continued to track the vehicle.
At 04:47 BST, an operator saw the Tigra drive "at speed" through a red light at the junction of Poole Road and Queens Road, sending the cyclist flying into the air.
George was detained for four years for the crash and for a further year for an offence of dangerous driving committed on 14 October.
He also admitted failing to stop after a road accident, driving without a licence or insurance and making off from a petrol station without payment.
The teenager was disqualified from driving for six years.
Sgt Nikki Burt, of Dorset Police's traffic unit, said: "George's irresponsible, reckless and extremely dangerous actions that night endangered the lives of the public.
"It is miraculous that the victim is making a recovery and that nobody else was seriously injured or killed."
