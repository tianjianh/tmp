PPR boss Francois-Henri Pinault said the acquisition of Brioni "completes our portfolio of luxury brands" in the menswear.
PPR also owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, among others.
In 2010, Brioni had sales of 170m euros ($234m, Â£146m) and a workforce of 1,800.
PPR shares rose more than 3% on the news.
"We have great ambitions for this fashion house," Mr Pinault said, referring to Brioni.
"We will give it access to our expertise and know-how, so that it can write a new page in its history while continuing to preserve its identity."
Brioni was founded in 1945 and has been worn by most of the actors that play James Bond in the movies until recently.
Tom Ford was the designer of Bond's suits in the last film.
PPR's main rival is fellow French luxury giant, LVMH.
