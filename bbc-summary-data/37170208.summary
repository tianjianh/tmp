Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool boss aims to emulate Reds legends' achievements

Jurgen Klopp hopes to draw on the experience of past Liverpool managers and oversee a sustained period of success at the club.

Klopp, 49, was appointed in October 2015, and led the Reds to eighth in the Premier League, as well as the finals of the League Cup and Europa League.
The German wants to replicate the success of Liverpool "grandfathers" such as Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley.
"Sometimes you can use the experience of other people," he told the BBC.
"I don't live in the past but there is a reason why we are here - because of our fathers and grandfathers. These people are like the grandfathers.
"Life is so quick. What keeps you in the race is the experience."
Klopp was speaking to MOTD presenter and former Everton, Tottenham and Leicester City striker Gary Lineker in an interview for The Premier League Show, a weekly magazine programme that airs for the first time on BBC Two at 22:00 BST on Thursday.
Shankly won the First Division three times, the FA Cup twice and the Uefa Cup once while managing Liverpool between 1959 and 1974.
Paisley won three European Cups, six First Division titles, the Uefa Cup and three League Cups from 1976 to 1983.
Klopp signed a new contract in July that will keep him at Anfield until 2022. His side started the season with a 4-3 win at Arsenal but lost 2-0 at Burnley on Saturday.
"I would like to celebrate something each season over the next six years," he added. "Not the small thing, really celebrate something - driving on the big bus through Liverpool. That would be nice.
"I've said it before, but it is not important what people think when you come. It is important what they think when you leave. That is when you need to be judged."
Klopp moved to Liverpool after seven years at Borussia Dortmund.
The German club are famous for their 'Yellow Wall', a stand packed with 25,000 fans that creates one of the most intimidating and impressive atmospheres in world football.
However, Klopp says the atmosphere generated during Liverpool's dramatic comeback at Anfield against Dortmund in the Europa League quarter-finals in April eclipsed anything he had experienced before.
"When I was at Mainz, there were 20,000 people going nuts," he said. "Then I went to Dortmund and you would get 80,000. Not too bad, but then the last half-hour against Dortmund was the best I've ever had. I felt no-one could stop us."

In the interview, Klopp also gives an insight into his managerial philosophy.
He also says he understands why people might think he "is crazy", given his emotional antics on the touchline.
Klopp said his number one aim as a manager is to excite fans.
"Having memorable games in a row, that is my first target," he said.
"People being unable to wait for the next game, that is what football should be. If you can do this very often, then you will be successful."
Having experienced the benefits of a winter break in Germany, Klopp is keen to see it introduced in the Premier League.
He highlighted England's performance at Euro 2016 in France as a reason why it would be beneficial for England, who were knocked out at the last-16 stage by Iceland.
"I know a lot of these players, they have a good attitude and want to work," said Klopp.
"Dele Alli, what a season, but then maybe it felt like 500 games in his legs, he was not 100%.
"Harry Kane... what a season and then he cannot show it at the European Championship. You need fresh legs."
