[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number of homes in east Belfast  reported a loss of supply after a water main burst in the area overnight.

A Northern Ireland Water spokeswoman said the burst was at the Castlereagh Road and Prince Regent Road junction.
A scheduled repair took place between 01:00 BST and 08:00 BST on Friday. The company said afterwards, some homes experienced low water pressure.
It said while up to 12,000 customers could have been impacted by the burst, they had less than 100 no water calls.
"When a water distribution system drains down, it takes time for the system to charge following the restoration of supply, having additional staff on the ground would not quicken this process up," NI Water said.
"Therefore, resources were not an issue on this incident and further resources could have been deployed if they had been required.
"NI Water regrets and apologies for the inconvenience caused to those customers but would be satisfied that every possible step was taken to ensure this disruption was kept to an absolute minimum."
