A talented artist and musician, Elizabeth Daplyn lived in Highgate, north London, with her partner Rob Brennan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They parted at 0810 BST on 7 July 2005 on their way to work and Ms Daplyn boarded the Piccadilly Line train. She died in the blast.
The 26-year-old administrator worked at University College Hospital in the neuro-radiology department.
When she was reported missing, her father Michael returned to the country and travelled to London to meet her mother, who lives in Swansea, and sister.
Ms Daplyn was born in Leicester but spent her early years abroad before attending schools in Rochester, Kent.
After an art foundation course, she studied Fine Art at Oxford University.
Graduating with a 2:1, she set herself the difficult task of making a living in the art or publishing world.
But after several unpaid internships, her pragmatic streak surfaced and she began to look for paid work.
In 2002, she moved to London and worked in a number of administrative roles before joining the hospital.
During her short life she moved all over the UK and around the world, from Kent to Lahore and Newport to Nigeria.
This fuelled her love of travel and food, which she shared with others in person and on blogs.
At the inquest into her death five years on, her sister Eleanor Daplyn said in a statement: "From a young age, she had the ability to fit in to almost any location and situation readily, with humour, and with a sizeable appetite for all that was new and interesting."
Her sister went on to say that at the time of her death, Ms Daplyn had been as settled and content as she had ever known her, and was very happy to be living with Mr Brennan.
"When thinking about what she might have done in the future, I honestly have to say I don't know," she said.
"The scope of her intellect and imagination mean that it could have been everything and anything."
Speaking shortly after her death, her uncle, the Reverend Tim Daplyn, in Somerset, said: "She was very bright, and a talented singer who had a lot of friends.
"We didn't realise she had so many until she disappeared."
