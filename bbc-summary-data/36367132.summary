The Real Madrid star left the pitch with a thigh problem following a clash with goalkeeper Kiko Casilla.
"It was a minor scare, a knock, but in a few days I will be well," said Ronaldo, who has 51 goals this season.
Real Madrid face Atletico Madrid in Milan this weekend in a repeat of the 2014 final, which Real won 4-1.
Portugal forward Ronaldo, 31, has been plagued by a thigh injury that forced him to miss three games in April.
He came off at half-time during Real's final La Liga game of the season.
