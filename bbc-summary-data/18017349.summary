Seven of the group's albums entered this week's Billboard 200 chart, with their debut 1986 record Licence to Ill the highest entry at number 18.
The trio's albums collectively sold 55,000 copies in the two days after Yauch's death, compared to 4,000 the previous week.
The rapper, better known as his alias MCA, died on 4 May of cancer aged 47.
The other albums to return to the chart included compilation Solid Gold Hits at 51, Paul's Boutique at 56 and Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 at 107.
The band's fourth album, 1994's Ill Communication also came in at 109, with Check Your Head at 124 and The Sounds of Science at 141.
In terms of digital downloads, the group also sold 151,000 tracks - up from 14,000 the week before.
The most popular track was Brass Monkey from Licensed to Ill with 15,000 downloads.
Online music streaming site Spotify also said it saw a 17-fold increase in people listening to Beastie Boys songs after Yauch's death.
Figures only account for the first two days after the rapper's death as Nielsen SoundScan - the company which tracks US music sales - collects weekly data until Sunday.
Sales for the group's music is expected to be higher next week.
