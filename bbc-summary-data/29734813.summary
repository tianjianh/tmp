Darren Sykes, 44, and his son Paul were found in the property in Penistone, near Barnsley, on Wednesday evening.
A second boy rescued from the house has been named as Jack Sykes, 12. He remains critically ill in hospital.
South Yorkshire Police said the fire was started deliberately and they were not looking for anyone else over the incident.
Ch Insp Debbie Mahmood, said: "This is a tragic incident in which a young child has lost his life and a full investigation will be carried out.
"My thoughts and condolences are with the family of the young boys at this distressing time."
Emergency services were called to the property in Tennyson Close at about 18:30 BST.
The three victims were taken to hospital, where Mr Sykes and his son were pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Friday.
Andy Platt, head teacher at Springvale Primary School in Penistone, paid tribute to the youngster.
"Paul was an outgoing, popular boy who was blossoming into a fine runner and cornet player. He will be greatly missed," he said.
Jack's mother is keeping a bedside vigil, police said.
The house remains cordoned off and the cul-de-sac is closed to traffic.
Police declined to comment on whether a substance had been used to accelerate the spread of the blaze.
