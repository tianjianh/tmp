Hawick pram near-miss driver jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who narrowly missed a pedestrian pushing a pram through Hawick has been jailed for 18 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darrell Potts, 24, from the town, was found guilty of dangerous driving on various streets in August 2015.
A court heard he drove at excessive speeds forcing people to take evasive action and had to brake sharply to narrowly avoid someone with a pram.
He also failed to observe a pelican crossing and did not stop when requested to do so by police.
In addition to his jail term, Potts was also banned from the road for five years at Selkirk Sheriff Court and ordered to re-sit an extended test after his ban.
