A Kyle Bennett goal just before the interval and Kal Naismith's second-half header were enough for the hosts, despite Alex Samuel's consolation goal leading to a nervy finish.
Pompey are third in League Two but extended their advantage in the battle for automatic promotion to six points.
Newport remain six points adrift of safety with seven games remaining.
The Exiles headed to Fratton Park with three wins from three visits and no goals conceded since their return to the Football League, but this defeat could condemn them to a return to the National League.
In a week it was announced ex-Disney chief, Michael Eisner, is in talks to take over Pompey, Newport showed signs that they were ready to mount a Cinderella story by making a bright start.
They were angered not to be given a penalty in an even first period before Bennett put the hosts ahead on 42 minutes, finishing after Ryan Bird gave away possession.
Naismith's fifth of the season, headed home from Conor Chaplin's cross, looked to have secured the points, but Samuel also nodded home after good work from substitute Mark Randall to give Newport heart.
Forward Marlon Jackson missed a golden opportunity to earn a precious point late on.
Newport County manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales: "We gave ourselves too much to do, we didn't get going until 2-0 down.
"In saying that, we should have had a clear cut penalty at 0-0 and at places like this, you need that kind of luck.
"The effort was there, I think if the game had been ten minutes longer we would have drawn. We missed three big chances at the end.
"We are in a difficult situation, but we are still fighting."
