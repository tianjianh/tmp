A man is seen smashing the window of a shop on Hythe High Sreet and running off with Â£14,000 of jewellery.
But shop manager and former Folkestone rugby player Stefan Marco can be seen chasing the man and using his sporting skills to bring him down.
The antique jewellery is now back on sale and Mr Marco has been hailed a hero.
Kent Police said a 74-year-old man from Hythe had been arrested on suspicion of theft and released on bail pending enquiries.
