Sally Campion hammer murder seen by Bishops Stortford neighbours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The brutal hammer attack murder of a mother by her former partner was seen in silhouette by her neighbours, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Keough, 44, of no fixed address, admits murdering Sally Campion in Bishop's Stortford last July.
During sentencing, St Albans Crown Court heard residents saw Keough's attack on Ms Campion, 45, through her half-down bedroom blind.
Judge Andrew Bright QC will finish sentencing Keough on Monday.
Neighbours, the court heard, had come out into Bartholomew Street after hearing a series of loud bangs as Keough first tried to smash down the front door of Ms Campion's terraced cottage at night.
Next he smashed out the glass in the front window to clamber in.
Stuart Trimmer QC, prosecuting, said: "There were screams and shouting and someone was plainly in distress.
"The bedroom light was on and neighbours could see a silhouette of blows raining down."
Keough then walked casually out of the front door. He was tracked by two teenagers and arrested by police at Bishop's Stortford railway station.
Mr Trimmer told the court that Ms Campion's neighbours went into the house and found her lying on her bed completely covered in blood.
"There was blood on the walls and ceiling. Her right eye socket was sunken and hollow and one eye was missing."
She was pronounced dead at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge a few hours later.
Keough changed his plea to guilty of murder at a hearing last month. Previously, he had admitted breaching a restraining order made on 7 May last year banning him from contacting her.
