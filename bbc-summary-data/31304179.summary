England: Stuart Lancaster not planning big changes for Italy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England head coach Stuart Lancaster says he does not anticipate making "too many changes" for Saturday's Six Nations match with Italy.

Returning trio Geoff Parling, Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond will be available for the Twickenham encounter.
But Lancaster described England's victory over Wales in Cardiff as one of the greatest of his coaching career.
And he said: "Off the back of that performance I'll be surprised if there are too many changes."
The coach added: "We haven't made the selection yet, so we'll give one or two guys the chance to put their hands up in training, but we are trying to get some consistency."
Lancaster was delighted with the composure England showed at the Millennium Stadium in Friday's Six Nations opener, recovering from a half-time deficit to win 21-16.
However, he has warned his team that there can be no let-up against an Italy side comfortably beaten in Rome by Ireland.
"The pressure is still on against Italy, but in a different way," said Lancaster.
"For long periods of time the Ireland-Italy game was very close and it was the same when Italy played South Africa in November.
"So we need to be prepared and ready, and we need to show the same attention to detail that we did going into the Wales game."
Lock Courtney Lawes and flanker Tom Wood will not be available to face Italy because of injury, but may be in the mix for the match against Ireland in Dublin on 1 March.
Centre Manu Tuilagi is "still some way off playing club rugby" but Lancaster has not ruled out the Leicester powerhouse playing some part in the championship.
