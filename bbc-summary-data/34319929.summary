[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrong involvement of fixers 'would make Nama deal illegal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £1bn deal for Nama's Northern Ireland loan book would be rendered illegal if any third party "fixers" were wrongly involved, the High Court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawyers for businessman Gareth Graham told a judge investigations into the sale to US investment fund Cerberus are under way in three jurisdictions.
Mr Graham is a director and shareholder in property firms whose loans were among those transferred over to Nama.
He is challenging the appointment of administrators to his companies.
Contending that his businesses were financially strong and never missed a repayment, his legal team are set to claim that an improper motive was involved.
With the main case not due to be heard until January, administrators acting for Cerberus are now seeking to sell the Lyndon Court building in Belfast city centre.
Their lawyers argued that previously issued judicial directions only require that notification is given to the court.
However, Mr Graham is opposed to the deal going through without his consent or court order.
Mr Graham's barrister said the administrators had signed up to a restraint on any sale until after the court case.
She told the court: "The context we are dealing with here is a possible illegality... any possible illegality concerning the sale of the Northern Ireland loan book to Cerberus."
Pressed for details by the judge, she mentioned the potential involvement of third parties in the deal.
The barrister later referred to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama adviser who also worked for the Graham bookmaking business from 2005 to 2008.
Earlier this month Mr Graham told a Stormont inquiry the adviser was conflicted in his Nama role because he retained shareholdings in some Graham property companies that were moved into the "bad bank" category.
The barrister told the court on Monday that those shares amounted to 5%.
Mr Cushnahan has rejected the criticisms made at Stormont, saying that he gave up the shareholdings in 2009.
According to his account he would only remain on the share register if Graham companies have not provided the necessary updates.
The court was also told on Monday that investigations into the loan portfolio deal are now being carried out by authorities in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and the United States.
"One of the allegations is that there was corruption," the barrister said.
"For example, that £7m was paid to include third parties as fixers for that transaction."
She said that if any were involved, without declaring any necessary interest, "that would also render the sale illegal".
The case continues.
