Mr Passmore won the role after "second choice" votes were taken into consideration.

The second round was between Conservative candidate Tim Passmore and Labour candidate Cath Pickles.

Turnout in the election was higher than expected, with the figure at 24.47% over all, up from 16% in 2012.
As Mr Passmore did not secure a clear 50% of the vote, "second choice" votes had to be taken into account.
