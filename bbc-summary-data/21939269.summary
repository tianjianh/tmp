[SN]TITLE[SN]
Memorial planned for Isle of Wight WW II bombing victims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial to the victims of a World War II air raid on the Isle of Wight is to be erected 70 years after the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty people were killed when German planes attacked Newport with bombs and cannon fire in April 1943.
Christine Pascoe, 79, who was among the injured, had campaigned for the victims not to be "forgotten".
Isle of Wight Council said it would be erecting a plaque somewhere in the area which was targeted in the raid.
Mrs Pascoe, who was nine at the time, was in her family's home in Chapel Street when the house next door received a direct hit.
She was unconscious for a month. Her 36-year-old mother, Eva, and 18 other civilians along with one airman, lost their lives.
Welcoming the announcement, Mrs Pascoe said: "Now it's the 70th anniversary a plaque would mean a lot of me as I do think the victims have been forgotten.
"It's just to let people know the bombs did hit Newport."
A 70th anniversary memorial service is being held at St John's Church on Sunday, 7 April. The church itself was also damaged in the air raid.
