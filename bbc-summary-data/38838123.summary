Aaron Lewis, 26 and from Toxteth, was shot three times outside Anna Jungs in Grosvenor Road, Wavertree at about 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.
He was taken to Aintree Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
Merseyside Police believe the offender ran down the road towards the city centre and said the shooting was related to organised crime.
Officers said Mr Lewis was known to them.
At about 19:40, a 19-year-old man went to hospital with a gunshot wound to his upper body.
His condition is not thought to be life-threatening and detectives believe he had been with Mr Lewis.
The latest death follows the fatal shooting of Thomas Baker at Stanley Meat Market in Old Swan on Friday and highlighted a "serious escalation" of gang violence in Liverpool, police said.
Police said that while both deaths were related to serious and organised crime, the shootings were not linked.
In addition to Mr Baker and Mr Lewis, Mark Hillman and Blake Brown have been killed in the city.
A police spokesman said gun crime had increased in recent months after falling year on year from 2013 to 2016.
Since April, 78 firearms have been discharged, 18 more than in the whole of the previous 12 months.
An increasing number of new guns are being used, the spokesman added, and officers do not know how or where gangs are obtaining them.
Police said the majority of shootings this year were linked to organised crime and the victims will not co-operate with officers.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson and Wavertree MP Luciana Berger have joined forces with Merseyside Police to appeal for public help.
Ms Berger said: "We as a community need to work together to help end this violence on our streets."
Mr Anderson said: "By coming together as a city we can send out a powerful message to the perpetrators that they will be found and... punished."
A series of warrants are being executed across Liverpool as part of a planned crackdown on gun crime, but no weapons have been recovered.
