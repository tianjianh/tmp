Flooded Peebles nursing home shut for six months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents evacuated from a flooded Borders nursing home have been told it will be six months before they return.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some 25 pensioners had to be rescued from Peebles Nursing Home as the River Tweed overflowed into the streets.
They had to be re-housed about 18 miles away at the Waverley Care Home in Galashiels.
It has been confirmed that is where they will stay for six months while structural and interior overhauls take place on the building in Tweed Green.
The entire ground floor was damaged when water poured into the care home on the afternoon of 30 December.
Mountain Rescue volunteers along with fire and rescue teams took part in the rescue operation to get the residents to safety.
Nine of the 24 bedrooms are on the bottom floor as well as two lounges, a dining room, a kitchen and a laundry room.
Peebles Nursing Home manager Jane Rogers said she had experienced nothing like it in her 10 years in charge.
She said: "The water rose very quickly and there was a sudden surge of water which breached walls and our usually effective defences in a matter of minutes."
The residents were having lunch when the flood waters hit.
"By about 2.20pm a lot of water had come in but luckily by that time we had moved everyone upstairs," said Ms Rogers.
"All of the rooms on the ground floor are completely condemned.
"But before any of the restoration work even begins the building has to be completely emptied and then we have to leave it to dry out substantially which is going to take a while.
"So the residents won't be back in for approximately another six months."
Ms Rogers said the residents were happy and nobody had been upset by the move.
She added: "Our residents are still seeing the same staff which is comforting for them.
"And the families can be reassured that the level of care their relatives are receiving has not been affected."
Meanwhile, Borders Sport and Leisure Trust is unable to say when Peebles Swimming Pool will re-open - 10 days after the flooding.
Both boilers were seriously damaged and due to the heating being off there has been movement in the wooden ceiling above the pool.
