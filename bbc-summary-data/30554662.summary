Surrey Heath Museum shuts as staff go behind scenes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A museum will close for the whole of January while staff go behind the scenes to organise its collection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surrey Heath Museum will reopen in February for its 2015 events and exhibition programme.
Curator Gillian Barnes-Riding said staff had audited the collection but now wanted all the stores to be catalogued electronically.
A team of 20 or so volunteers will be helping staff to complete the work at the museum in Camberley.
Ms Barnes-Riding said the electronic catalogue would enable staff to find items more easily.
