Chelsea striker Didier Drogba says he is eager to be reunited with his former "partner in crime" Frank Lampard when the Blues take on Manchester City on Sunday.

Drogba and Lampard were team-mates at Chelsea from 2004 to 2012, winning three Premier League titles together.
"I will be happy to see him," Drogba said. "I think he still belongs to us.
"He is a Chelsea player, for what he did. For me, he is part of the history of the club."
Chelsea's record goalscorer Lampard, 36, left Stamford Bridge in the summer after 13 seasons. He signed for New York City FC before he was loaned to Manchester City in a six-month deal.

Meanwhile, Drogba, 36, rejoined the Blues on a one-year deal after leaving Turkish side Galatasaray.
The Ivorian says Lampard is guaranteed to receive a warm reception if he plays in Sunday's game at the Etihad Stadium.
"The supporters know what he gave for the club," Drogba said. "So I know, for sure, the reaction will be good."
League leaders Chelsea currently have a five-point advantage over Manchester City, for whom Lampard made his first appearance of the season in last weekend's draw with Arsenal.
