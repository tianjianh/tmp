The Queen frontman moved to the semi-detached home in Feltham, west London, after his family left Zanzibar in 1964 when Mercury was 17.
The singer was living in the house when he met two other members of the band - Brian May and Roger Taylor.
Kashmira Cooke, his sister, said he "secretly would have been very proud and pleased" to receive the honour.
Mercury's parents, Jer and Bomi Bulsara, decided to leave Zanzibar as the country was becoming independent from Britain.
They moved to 22 Gladstone Avenue in autumn 1964 choosing the area because Jer had a sister who already lived in Feltham.
Yet everything was not straight forward for the family.
"The house had no central heating... We were not familiar with coal fires and had to be shown how to light it," Kashmira Cooke said.
She said her brother spent much of the time in the house "sketching for his college art work" and "listening to music, particularly Jimi Hendrix".
"He spent hours in the bathroom grooming his hair. At the time I wasn't best pleased as there was only one bathroom," she said.
Away from the house he studied Graphic Art and Design at Ealing College of Art and worked in kitchens at Heathrow Airport.
Guitarist Brian May said he visited Freddie Mercury in Gladstone Avenue shortly after the pair first met.
"We spent most of the day appreciating and analysing in intimate detail the way that Jimi Hendrix had put his recordings together," he said.
The Blue Plaque was unveiled days before Mercury would have celebrated his 70th birthday on 5 September.
He died in 1991 at the age of 45.
