The Team Wiggins squad was among 50 UK professionals racing in Wales' only round of the Pearl Izumi Tour Series on Friday.
The competition began with a hill climb on Cliff Terrace on Friday followed by the main race in the evening.
Olympic champions Ed Clancy and Steven Burke were among the riders.
It is the sixth year the cycle festival has taken place in Aberystwyth.
The main race started in Pier Street, passing through Upper Great Darkgate Street, Seaview Place, Promenade and back onto Pier Street.
About 300 schoolchildren also took part in the closed-circuit town centre event earlier in the day.
Councillor Rhodri Evans, Ceredigion council's cabinet member with responsibility for lifestyle services, said the event was "a great opportunity to showcase Aberystwyth at its best".
