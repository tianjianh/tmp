Garry Ringrose ignoring Lions talk to focus exclusively on Ireland's tour

Garry Ringrose is refusing to get distracted by a possible British and Irish Lions call-up as he prepares for Ireland's three Summer Tests.

Lions coach Warren Gatland has name-checked Ringrose several times when asked about potential standby players.
But Ringrose says he is focusing totally on Saturday's encounter with the USA in New Jersey.
"I feel so lucky to go and represent Ireland for the next three weeks against USA and Japan," he said.
"This time last year I missed out on a summer tour (in South Africa).
"I appreciate the fact that I am pretty lucky, from where I have come from last year, to come and play on the summer tour.
"Hopefully we get the matches (in New Zealand) up on the projector and support the lads that are there."
The 22-year-old responded to his omission from the 41-man Lions squad by scoring a stunning display in Leinster's 27-22 defeat by Clermont in the Champions Cup semi-final.
Ringrose's solo score was reminiscent of Brian O'Driscoll's unforgettable effort for the Lions against Australia in Brisbane back in 2001.
The try continued Ringrose's breakout season which included winning his first cap against Canada in November a week after sitting on the bench during Ireland's brilliant victory over the All Blacks in Chicago.
After playing for most of the rematch in Dublin as the All Blacks avenged their Soldier Field defeat, Ringrose starred in Ireland's 27-24 closing Autumn win over Australia and the former Blackrock College student was ever-present during the Six Nations.
"I was involved in all of the Six Nations games, which was a big learning experience for me.
"And then getting a bit of disappointment with Leinster with the way we finished the year. A lot of rugby has been played since November."
After a long season Ringrose insists there will be no hint of complacency from Joe Schmidt's youthful squad as they look to seal victory in New Jersey this weekend before a two-Test series against Japan in Shizuoka and Tokyo.
"You always want to put on the best performance possible, individually and collectively, put the best performance forward and hopefully win.
"That will be our primary focus and we will do everything we can preparation-wise to ensure that."
Former Munster and Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara, now part of the coaching set-up at French club Racing 92, has been working with Schmidt's squad this week.
Munster assistant coach Felix Jones and Leinster backs coach Girvan Dempsey will also work with the squad during the two-week tour of Japan as Schmidt looks give some promising young coaches a taste of top-level Test experience.
"There are fresh faces in and around camp and they can offer a different perspective about things," Ringrose added.
"Anything they can see, or improvements they can give advice on, it's really beneficial no matter what position or number you are."
