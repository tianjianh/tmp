Flames were seen shooting into the air after the blaze started at Recycling Lives on the Redscar estate.
Lancashire Fire and Rescue said it was "a huge fire" and that it had 15 fire engines tackling the blaze in Longridge Road, with crews coming from neighbouring towns including Blackburn.
Emergency services were called to the estate shortly after 21:30 BST.
BBC reporter Steve Saul said roads in the area had been closed and 80 firefighters were at the scene.
The fire service said on Twitter: "The cause of the fire is unknown and firefighters will continue to work into the daytime on Friday to put the fire out."
