Chester: Jon McCarthy hopeful of being offered job after success as caretaker boss

Chester caretaker boss Jon McCarthy hopes that winning their last three games of the season will help him land the manager's job at Bumpers Lane.

The nine points they earned from their final three National League fixtures of the season saw the club to safety.
And it can only have strengthened the case of the 45-year-old former Port Vale, York City, Birmingham City and Northern Ireland international winger.
"What I won't do now is put any pressure on the board," said McCarthy.
"They gave me an opportunity and they have been great with me."
McCarthy has had experienced centre-half Ian Sharps as his assistant in his four games in charge since the abrupt sacking of Steve Burr.
And the popular, mild-mannered McCarthy's priority in that time has been to make it clear in the dressing room that he has what it takes to be the main man.
"I've been around the club for a while in a different capacity and it was just about changing the perception of me," Middlesbrough-born McCarthy told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"People who know me know what I was like but there were a lot of fans who didn't know who I was. But I have my vision and philosophy for the club, and I am grateful they have given me a chance and listened to what I have had to say."
McCarthy is understood to be on a four-man shortlist, all of whom are to be interviewed this week.
The first task for whoever gets the job will be to sort out a contractual situation which means that only four Chester players - goalkeeper Jon Worsnop, midfielder Tom Shaw, winger Craig Mahon and promising youngster Sam Hughes - are signed up for next season.
