Scot Burns, 32, is a former WBO super-featherweight and lightweight champion and took the WBO inter-continental lightweight title in November.
The bout at Glasgow's Hydro will be 33-year-old Di Rocco's first world title bid, the Italian having just one professional loss to his name.
Burns hopes "to make history" by becoming a three-weight world champion.
"It feels like a long time coming returning to Glasgow and I feel this is the perfect opportunity for me to grab another world title in front of my loyal supporters," added Burns, who has 39 wins from 45 professional fights.
"Di Rocco is a tough guy and he will bring the best out of me - but it's a fight I'm so confident I will win and give my fans a great show.
"There are massive fights for me at lightweight and light-welterweight - I've spoken to my trainer Tony Sims and we feel I can compete competitively at either weight class and this fight will lead on to great things for me."
