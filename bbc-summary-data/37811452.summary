[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Accra High Court has postponed the hearing of a $2m libel suit brought by the president of the Ghana FA, Kwesi Nyatakyi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nyatakyi is seeking damages from a Ghanaian broadcast company which allegedly called him "the head of a Mafia".
But the hearing has now been adjourned to 9 November after trial judge Daniel Mensah failed to turn up in court on Monday.
"I am not interested in money or punishment but to set the record straight," Nyantakyi, a Fifa Council member, told BBC Sport.
Nyantakyi, an executive committee member of the Confederation of African Football, claims Asempa FM - a local-language FM station owned by MBL - tarnished his image in a series of broadcasts involving two of their journalists.
Thadeus Sory, Nyantakyi's lawyer, told BBC Sport that his client was described as 'heading a mafia' and stealing money meant for the GFA.
"They've called me a 'thief', 'armed robber' and a 'corrupt' man," added Nyantakyi.
"I have sued them. I want to uphold standards in journalism in Ghana which have been thrown to the dogs."
"The allegations are defamatory. To call him the head of a mafia is to impute criminality," said Thadeus Sory, Nyantakyi's lawyer.
The GFA president's conduct has been under scrutiny since a government-instituted panel of enquiry recommended last year that he refund $412,000 budgeted for the 2014 World Cup, "which he has failed to account for."
Nyantakyi, who has led Ghanaian football since 2005, is challenging the enquiry's verdict in court.
Agyeman, one of the two journalists being sued, refused to be drawn on the libel suit when contacted by BBC Sport.
"My lawyers have advised me not to speak," he replied.
"We will show up in court on Monday, because we have been summoned to do so," Ekyi Quarm, MBL's Chief Executive Officer, told BBC Sport.
