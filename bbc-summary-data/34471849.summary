Syria crisis: Nato renews pledge amid Russia 'escalation'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nato has renewed assurances to defend allies in view of the "escalation of Russian military activities" in Syria, the alliance's secretary-general says.

Jens Stoltenberg said defence ministers had decided to boost response forces to be able to deploy troops speedily.
Nato member Turkey has complained that Russian jets have violated its airspace recently.
Russia has used cruise missiles as well as air strikes in Syria. The Nato chief said Moscow's position was "unhelpful".
Mr Stoltenberg urged Moscow to stop backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Moscow denies Western accusations that it has mainly targeted Assad opponents, insisting its strikes have hit the infrastructure of the so-called Islamic State (IS) and other militant groups.
IS militants have seized swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq.
A US-led coalition has been carrying out air strikes against IS fighters in both Syria and Iraq for months. But Western countries support rebels who have been fighting to oust Mr Assad since 2011.
Jens Stoltenberg spoke of "a troubling escalation in Russia's military activities in Syria". Moscow's support for the Assad regime, he insisted, was not a constructive policy. While there's been plenty of condemnation of Moscow here in Brussels, Nato has few options to influence Russian behaviour.
It stands ready to assist Turkey to maintain the integrity of its airspace if requested and Nato is reviewing its naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, where the Russians already have a small naval flotilla off the Syrian coast.
Vladimir Putin's more assertive stance - first in Ukraine and now in Syria - continues to worry Nato members who share borders with Russia.
The Russian air strikes had "weakened" IS, Syrian Army Chief of Staff Gen Ali Abdullah Ayoub said on Thursday, enabling the army to start a "big attack" to retake towns and villages.
Nato ministers met amid a deepening sense of crisis, says BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus.
They expressed their solidarity with Turkey as well as to address increased concern among Baltic member states following Russia's involvement in eastern Ukraine.
The UK is to station about 100 troops in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania amid tensions with Moscow. It is also sending 25 soldiers to a training mission in Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Russia said it had launched missile strikes against IS from warships in the Caspian Sea - about 1,500km (930 miles) away.
Russia's foreign ministry also said Moscow was willing to establish contact with the Free Syrian Army - a Western-backed rebel group - to discuss fighting IS "and other terrorist groups".
But US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said coalition forces fighting IS in Syria would not co-operate with Russia.
"We believe Russia has the wrong strategy," he said. "They continue to hit targets that are not IS."
Russia's air campaign in Syria has raised fears of accidental contact between Russian warplanes and those of the US-led coalition which have been targeting IS for the past year.
Pentagon officials revealed they recently had to carry out at least one "safe separation" manoeuvre to avoid a US jet coming too close to a Russian aircraft over Syria.
The Syrian civil war began with an uprising against President Assad in 2011 that was brutally put down.
It has since deteriorated into fighting between pro-government forces and various rebel groups - some of which also fight each other.
