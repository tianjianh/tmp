Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Reid has announced his retirement at the age of 34 after a succession of injuries.

The former Republic of Ireland international has not played a first-team game since injuring his groin against Derby County in October 2014.
Reid, who came through the Reds' youth system, moved to Spurs in 2006 for Â£4m and also played for Charlton, Sunderland and Blackpool.
He returned in 2011 and scored 42 goals in 290 games over his two spells.
Reid seemed close to a first-team return on a number of occasions, but was unable to regain his fitness despite a number of operations.
Former defender John Thompson played with Reid for both Forest and Republic of Ireland and says Reid's retirement is "sad news".
"He has done everything he could possibly do to get back," said Thompson. "It's a very sad day for him and for Forest.
"Andy is one of the best players I've played with and a fantastic player to have in the dressing room.
"Out on the pitch he's a brave player and always wants the ball - and wants to do something with it.
"He will be a big loss to Forest and a big loss to the game.
"He has been really top player in the Premier League and had two good stints at Forest and played a lot for Republic of Ireland."
Reid joined the club's coaching staff last season - as he tried to recover from his injury - when Paul Williams took over as manager from Dougie Freedman until the end of the season.
But new Reds manager Philippe Montanier does not see Reid continuing in a coaching capacity.
"I know Reid was a really good player for Forest," said Montainer.
"For me, all is okay with my medical and technical staff and I am very satisfied during pre-season. I don't need more staff."
