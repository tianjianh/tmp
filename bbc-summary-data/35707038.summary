[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roads have been closed, homes left without power and tiles blown from roofs after Storm Jake brought wintry showers and high winds to Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yellow Met Office "be aware" warnings of snow, ice and wind were issued for most of Wales for Wednesday morning.
Gusts reaching up to 70mph caused roof tiles to fall and trees to be blown over in Aberystwyth, with roads closed as a precaution.
Western Power Distribution said nearly all of the homes cut off now had power.
The Met Office warned people to be aware of difficult driving conditions due to snow in north Wales.
In Aberystwyth, police closed Terrace Road and Pier Street in the centre of the town and advised people not to drive or walk near the area because of falling roof tiles.
Trees have also come down in the Waun Fawr area of Aberystwyth, along with in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire. In Radyr, Cardiff, a tree fell on top of a car.
