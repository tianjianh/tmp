The 26-year-old left-hander from Perth was batting in the nets when she was struck on the back of the head by a ball from team-mate Rene Farrell.
A decision on her availability for the first one-day international at Taunton will be taken on Tuesday morning.
Bolton made 124 on her ODI debut against England in January 2014.
She averages 53.22 from 10 ODIs, having established herself at the top of the order over the past year.
The Age newspaper reports that Bolton, who was wearing a helmet when she was hit, is likely to be replaced by Jess Cameron if she is unavailable.
