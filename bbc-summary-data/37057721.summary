The multi-Oscar winner will discuss filmmaking at the event in October.
A number of other US citizens will be taking part in an America Uncovered strand of the annual event.
Elsewhere, footballer Joey Barton, illusionist Derren Brown and novelist Jilly Cooper are among those on the guest list.
Cheltenham Literature Festival attracts some of the biggest names from the world of culture, politics and sport.
Now in its 67th year, The Times and the Sunday Times Cheltenham Literature Festival is the UK's oldest literature festival.
Among more than 600 guests appearing will be comedians Ian Hislop, Alan Carr, Susan Calman, Armando Iannucci and Alexei Sayle.
Lionel Shriver, Sebastian Faulks, and Ian McEwan are among novelists on the programme, while politicians Ed Balls, Ken Clarke and comedian Reginald D Hunter will also speak.
Musician Wilko Johnson will explain how he beat cancer after being given 10 months to live, accompanied by his favourite musical tracks.
The festival will take place between 7-16 October at various venues around the Gloucestershire town.
Antonia Byatt, Cheltenham Literature Festival Director said: "In the run up to the American election we present a fascinating view of the USA from up-to-the-moment political analysis to a rich investigation of the nation's culture.
"The festival explores other pertinent issues of our times too and there is a chance to hear some of the best talent in fiction, poetry and spoken word."
