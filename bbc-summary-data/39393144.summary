The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) are set to take over the Dragons as well as their Rodney Parade ground, but the deal will not be completed until 1 July.
75% of Newport RFC shareholders must still ratify the deal which chairman Martyn Hazell called for them to back.
"Until something gets sorted above, we've got to get on with our jobs," Evans told BBC Radio Wales.
He continued: "The future for Dragons rugby is positive and as players we've got to make sure it happens on the field and whatever goes on off the field is down to the bigwigs.
"Whatever goes on at the top, hopefully it moves in the right direction and we get a positive future."
Evans made his 200th appearance for the region in their 17-27 Pro12 defeat by Ulster and is proud of his record.
"They all merge into one and it's something I'm proud of. Running out [against Ulster] was really emotional," he said.
"It's nice to be able to come out in the last game of the season at Rodney Parade which I was really looking forward to.
"I felt good going into this game and unfortunately it didn't quite go our way and I thought the performance was there.
"We want to play attacking and attractive rugby and get some wins."
