About 40 fans who bought coach and concert tickets to see the band at the Echo Arena on Saturday 17 March found their seats had already been taken.
Parents said they bought the tickets through Halton Community Trips (HCT).
A 35-year-old woman behind HCT has been arrested and released on bail until June.
The firm arranges affordable trips for families in the Cheshire area during school holiday periods.
Echo Arena Liverpool said it had not sold 40 tickets for either of the shows to HCT.
Cheshire Police said: "Cheshire Police have been made aware of allegations of fraud regarding the selling of tickets for short breaks and concerts via social networking and online auction sites, particularly in the Runcorn area.
"Police are currently investigating the allegations and are speaking with the victims concerned who have come forward."
A spokesman for the venue said: "Echo Arena Liverpool is extremely concerned to learn that a number of individuals who believed they had acquired tickets via HCT for the One Direction show were left to discover on the evening of the event that this was not the case.
"As a result of this incident, Echo Arena Liverpool has suspended the future sale of tickets to HCT for all events."
HCT could not be reached for comment.
