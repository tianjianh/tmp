[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Conservative MSP Bill Bowman takes his oath of allegiance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New North East regional MSP Bill Bowman has taken his oath of allegiance at the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Conservative replaced Alex Johnstone who died last week after being diagnosed with cancer.
Chartered accountant Mr Bowman stood for the Tories in Dundee City East at May's Holyrood election.
He came third in that contest, which was won by SNP MSP Shona Robison, and also just missed out on a seat from his party's regional list.
Following Mr Johnstone's death, Mr Bowman's name was next on that list and he was automatically made an MSP.
Kincardineshire-born former dairy farmer Mr Johnstone, 55, was the longest-serving Scottish Conservative MSP at Holyrood.
His funeral was held at Glenbervie Parish Church, Aberdeenshire, last week.
