Joshua Clarke opened the scoring before half-time for the hosts as he finished off a sweeping move with Lasse Vibe poking home a second soon after.
Defender Maxime Colin scored his first goal for the Bees to extend the lead to 3-0 following a neat one-two with Vibe.
Yann Kermorgant pulled one back from the spot for Reading but Scott Hogan slotted home as Brentford moved fourth.
Despite the hosts having just 37% of possession, it was their clinical finishing that proved the difference.
Clarke opening his account for Brentford as he ended a five-man move that began on the edge of Reading's box.
Leading goalscorer Hogan chased after a through ball and managed to pull it back from the byeline to give Vibe the easiest of goals.
The Bees continued the second half on top and with the away side's defence ball-watching, right-back Colin smashed the ball into the net.
Kermogant's cool penalty gave the Royals hope but Hogan's seventh goal of the season helped Brentford bounce back in style from their 3-1 loss at Wolves on Saturday.
