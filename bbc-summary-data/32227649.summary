Chris Coleman's side have risen 15 places thanks to their unbeaten start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
Scotland are up 10 places to 29th and England - the highest ranked of the home nations - are up three to 14th, with Northern Ireland up one to 42nd.
Wales' Euro 2016 qualification rivals Belgium are up to a best-ever third.
Wales topped Group B after beating Israel 3-0 in March but are now second on goal difference behind Belgium, who they face at home in June.
Wales' previous best ranking was 27th, when Terry Yorath's Wales side just failed to reach the 1994 World Cup, but in March 2011 they were as low as 116th.
"It's a fantastic achievement and if it's the highest ever then it shows we're doing something right," said Wales full-back Chris Gunter.
"Chris Coleman said last week that we've lost one game in 18 months so we probably deserve to be there and we're on a good run.
"But as high as we are in the rankings, we want to make sure that come next October we're where we want to be."
