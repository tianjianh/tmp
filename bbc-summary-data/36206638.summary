David Cameron has been urged to provide cash for improvements to a road which claimed the lives of a family of five.

Angela and David Cockburn, from Ouston, died on the A18 near Grimsby with daughters Carley Ann and Bethany and baby granddaughter Lacie.
Martin Vickers, Labour MP for Cleethorpes, said during Prime Minister's Questions that a coroner had demanded a safety review of the road.
He told Mr Cameron improvements costs would be significant.
"The council obviously wants to do all it can and has committed to carrying out the work in full, however the resources are very limited," he said.
Mr Cameron said: "I will look at what the Highways Agency has made available and whether there is real evidence that more can be done to make it safe."
Angela and David, aged 48 and 49, Carley Ann, 21, Bethany, 18, and her daughter Lacie, one, were travelling to a dance competition when their car collided with a lorry in April 2013.
An inquest into their deaths in March returned a narrative verdict but the coroner, Paul Kelly, demanded a review of the road's safety.
A North East Lincolnshire Council scrutiny committee was told in April the review required by the coroner would have to begin within two months and had to report back in a further six months.
The committee was also warned the ultimate costs of bringing the road up to modern standards would be "significant".
The Grimsby stretch of the A18 featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Killer Roads, in 2011.
