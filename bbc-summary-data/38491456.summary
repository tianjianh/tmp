[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old victim fell through the corrugated plastic ceiling of a kitchen annexe in a basement flat on Charles Road on New Year's Day.
He is thought to have fallen from a parapet after an incident in another flat, Sussex Police said.
Post-mortem tests confirmed he died from injuries sustained in the fall.
The matter has been reported to the coroner for East Sussex.
Det Ch Insp Mike Ashcroft, who is leading the investigation, said: "We are keen to talk to anyone who may have information about what happened.
"If they saw or heard anything suspicious, or may be able to help in any other way, I would urge them to contact us here quoting Operation Masefield."
Two men aged 35 and 29, and two women aged 29 and 24 - all from St Leonards - and a 26-year-old man from Tring, Hertfordshire, have been bailed until 2 March pending further enquiries.
