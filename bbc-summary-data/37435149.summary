Leicestershire snatched an unlikely County Championship victory on the third afternoon as Glamorgan lost their last six wickets for 10 runs.

The visitors looked set to win at the lunch interval, needing just 45 runs with six wickets in hand at Grace Road.
But Clint McKay and Charlie Shreck tore through the lower order, with four wickets falling in the space of seven balls at one stage.
Will Bragg was last out, caught in the deep for 65 as he ran out of partners.
It was Leicestershire's fourth Championship win of the season, having won only one of the previous 31 four-day matches at Grace Road.
Glamorgan ended the 2016 season with their eighth defeat of the campaign, having beaten champions Essex in their penultimate game.
Leicestershire captain Mark Cosgrove told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It was a weird game. To be bowled out for 96, and to fight back in the way we did, despite not really being at our best, was remarkable.
"Big credit to our bowlers, who kept steaming in and got us the win.
"Dieter Klein opened them up in the morning. At lunch I knew we only had one last crack but for Clint and Charlie to do what they did was incredible.
"We've played some pretty good cricket this year and, while the last month hasn't been great, to finish with a win confirms it's been a good year. We've come a long way in the last few years."
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"To be brutally honest we were a little bit weak there. We had a great opportunity to nail the game and Braggy played exceptionally well.
"It would have been nice to have one or two guys going through with him, but it sums up the way we've played this season - when we've lost wickets it's always been in clumps.
"That's something we need to address, although I'd be the first to put my hand up and say I haven't had the best season.
"It's not so much a question of technique. It boils down to character and it boils down to temperament. When a wicket goes down you come in, you get yourself settled, and we haven't been able to do that."
"The young players will learn from matches like this. I hope so, because it can't continue."
