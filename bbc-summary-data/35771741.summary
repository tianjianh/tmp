More than 20 Northern Irish sites feature in the HBO series to make the mythical worlds of Westeros and Essos.
Binevenagh mountain in County Londonderry, Ballintoy harbour in County Antrim and Tullymore forest in County Down are some of the places that have been used for filming.
The mobile app was the idea of the film agency Northern Ireland Screen.
It gives fans an interactive tour of the locations, as well as information about them and the show's scenes in which they featured.
A trailer for the sixth series of Game Of Thrones was released earlier this week.
Northern Ireland Screen's Richard Williams said "people will be surprised by the range" of locations the series uses for filming.
"This is a celebration of these locations in Northern Ireland," he added.
"Game of Thrones has now become a huge part of Northern Ireland culture and we know the appetite for information about the show is vast around the world."
John McGrillen, the chief executive of Tourism Northern Ireland, said the app would "enable visitors to make the link between the Game of Thrones fantasy and the spectacular real-life setting".
In January, a distinctive tunnel of trees at one of the show's Northern Ireland locations was damaged by high storm winds.
