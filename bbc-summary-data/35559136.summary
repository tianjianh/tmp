Great Britain gymnast Kelly Simm says a recent visit to Olympic training venues in Rio has been invaluable.

Simm, from Fareham, near Southampton, spent eight days acclimatising with other potential team members.
"Going out there definitely make you want to come back and makes you work harder," she told BBC Radio Solent.
The 20-year-old helped Great Britain win team bronze at October's World Championships in Glasgow, but still faces a fight for Olympics selection.
Only five places are up for grabs in the women's team, compared with six at the Worlds and the Commonwealth Games.

"It's going to be tough," Simm said. "Whoever is fittest and looking the best in competitions and in-house trials will go.
"The final decision probably won't be made until about a week before we go.
"Going out to Rio was incredible. We looked round the Olympic village and it gives you a taste of what it will be like.
"You try not to think ahead too much, but you definitely do and you get those butterflies and thoughts in your head."
