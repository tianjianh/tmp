Celtic may face SPFL investigation following reports of chants

Celtic could be the subject of an investigation following reports a section of the club's fans were heard singing pro-IRA songs at a recent game.

It is believed the match delegate included the chants in his report following last month's 1-1 draw with Hamilton Academical.
The match took place on the evening of Friday 26 February.
It is understood the matter will be discussed at the Scottish Professional Football League's next board meeting.
