[SN]TITLE[SN]
Warning over 'fragile and unsafe' former Denbigh hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public have been warned to stay away from a derelict and "unsafe" former Denbighshire hospital which is the subject of an ongoing legal battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Freemont, the owner of Denbigh's former North Wales Hospital, lost a High Court bid in March to overturn the local council's compulsory purchase order of the Victorian asylum.
While Denbighshire council is "one step closer" to owning the building, it does not belong to it yet.
It said it is "fragile and unsafe."
