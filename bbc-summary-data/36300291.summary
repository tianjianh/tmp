Donald Trump urges Muslims 'to turn people in'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The presumptive Republican candidate in the US presidential election, Donald Trump, has called on Muslims to work with the police and "turn people in".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In an interview with the UK's ITV, Mr Trump said he was not anti-Muslim, but "anti-terror".
He was reacting to remarks by UK Prime Minister David Cameron that his call for Muslims to be banned from the US was "divisive, stupid and wrong".
Mr Trump made the call last year, when he was not the party's front-runner.
He insisted that when he called for an immediate temporary ban on Muslims being allowed into America, there had been criticism only from politicians. Millions of people from all over the world had called in, he said, saying "Donald Trump is right".
Asked whether he would re-phrase those comments in the light of the controversy they caused, Mr Trump said: "It got people thinking. Whether it's good for me or bad for me, I don't really care."

"Something very bad" was going on that people pretended didn't exist, Mr Trump said.
The world had a tremendous problem with radical Islamic terror, the New York billionaire said.
"If you look at it world-wide, the world is blowing up. And it's not people from Sweden that's doing the damage, okay?"
It is up to Muslims to turn in people they suspected of extremism, he told ITV.
"They have to work with the police. They're not turning them in. If they're not playing ball, it's not going to work out."
Referring to Mr Cameron's criticism, Mr Trump also said it looked like he was not going to have a good relationship with the UK prime minister.
He also criticised the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan for calling him "ignorant".
