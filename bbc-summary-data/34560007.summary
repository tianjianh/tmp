PC Dave Phillips, 34, who was an Everton fan, died after he was hit by a vehicle in Wirral on 5 October.
His widow Jen and daughter Abigail, seven, received a tribute from fans on the pitch before Everton's home game with Manchester United.
An 18-year-old man has been charged with murdering PC Phillips.
Last week Tranmere Rovers held a minute's applause for the officer before the club's home National League game against Eastleigh.
Another man has been charged with aggravated taking of a vehicle and burglary while three people have been charged with assisting an offender.
