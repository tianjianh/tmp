More than 40,000 people fled their homes after Islamic State militants seized the city of Ramadi on Friday.
Many were stranded on open land until being allowed to cross a bridge over the River Euphrates on Wednesday.
The Shia-led government is concerned IS militants might hide among those fleeing the Sunni-dominated region.
But several people are reported to have died of dehydration or exhaustion while being kept away.
"The Iraqi government, they've established checkpoints at some of the main entry points into the city because they're very worried about the potential for hostile elements to enter Baghdad," Lise Grande, the UN Deputy Special Representative for Iraq, told the BBC.
"At one of the checkpoints on one of the entry bridges there are up to 6,000 people who have been forced to sleep outside," she added.
Athal al-Fahdawi, an Anbar provincial council member, later told the Associated Press that thousands of the displaced people were being allowed to cross a bridge in the Bzeibez area.
