Northern Ireland international Dean Shiels has signed for League of Ireland Premier Division champions Dundalk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old, son of Derry City manager Kenny Shiels, spent the last four years at Rangers where he played in two promotion-winning teams.
Previously he had spells with Hibernian, Doncaster Rovers and Kilmarnock.
The attacking midfielder from Maghera won the last of his 14 Northern Ireland caps in 2012.
Dundalk have also signed former Galway United and Sligo Rovers defender Alan Keane.
Shiels was released by Rangers in June at the end of his four-year contract.
He told Dundalk's website: "I want to win things. I have won trophies in Scotland, and Dundalk have won trophies over the last couple of years, so that's what I have come here for.
"I want to win as many things as possible and the lure of European football helped too."
Dundalk will be in Friday's Europa League draw, having lost to Legia Warsaw in the Champions League qualifying play-off.
