Worcestershire's overseas signing Mitchell Santner is to return to New Zealand after only two appearances for the county because of a finger injury.

The 24-year-old will not play again this summer following surgery on a finger he fractured last Friday.
Having suffered the injury in their T20 Blast opener against Durham, the club say "a complication in the healing process" made an operation necessary.
His only other appearance came in the Championship game against Glamorgan.
Santner had been due to play for Worcestershire throughout the entire group stage of the T20 competition.
"It is a massive blow," said Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes. "He is such an exciting talent in all formats of the game, but particularly T20.
"We were very optimistic he would come back from the injury but sadly he needed surgery."
Having only revealed the news of Santner's injury just before Friday night's T20 derby with the Birmingham Bears, Worcestershire went on to win without him at Edgbaston by five wickets, with five balls to spare.
Brett D'Oliveira starred with an unbeaten 62 off 47 balls, including a straight six to finish, after taking 1-17 in his four overs of off spin.
"Dolly was brilliant. He thoroughly deserved man of the match," said Rhodes. "In typical fashion, our youngsters have stood up and all pulled together,"
