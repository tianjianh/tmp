The man, who is thought to be a foreign national, was reported to have gone into the water from the Greig Street Bridge at about 17:20 on Sunday.
RNLI and coastguard crews searched the river and Inverness' harbour and marina after the report was made.
Police believe the man is in his 40s and was wearing dark clothing.
Insp Eddie Ross, of Police Scotland, said searches for the man were continuing.
He said: "Where weather conditions allow, we will continue to utilise all available resources for water and air searches, coordinated with our partner agencies.
"A key part to this inquiry is to establish the man's last movements and as such we would appeal to anyone who noticed a middle aged man in dark clothing on or near the bridge between 17:00 and 18:30 on Sunday evening to make contact.
"We understand the bridge was busy with pedestrians around this time so any information will be considered as we continue our search efforts."
