The diving duo bagged themselves two gold medals in the men's synchronised 3 metre springboard and Jack even got a silver in the men's single springboard.
Now they are back home and we invited them to the Newsround office to ask them some of your questions!
Check out the video to find out a little more about Jack and Chris.
