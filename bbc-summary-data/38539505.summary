Ross Forbes opened the scoring when his cross-cum-shot from the right bounced untouched into the Rovers net.
Aberdeen loanee Lawrence Shankland doubled the lead after half-time, heading home Mark Russell's cross.
The win moves Jim Duffy's men within five points of Dundee United - who sit second - with a game in hand.
Raith Rovers were the last side to beat Morton in Greenock in March last year, but there was never any danger of that result being repeated on this occasion.
It was a game of few real chances in the first half and while the visitors did most of the pressing, it was the home side who took the lead on 27 minutes with a somewhat fortunate seventh goal of the season for Forbes.
Always dangerous cutting in from the right with his left foot, the winger's cross-cum-shot missed its intended target of Shankland, deceived Raith goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert and nestled in the corner of the net.
Bobby Barr had the visitors best chance of the half, but his angled shot was well saved by Morton keeper Derek Gaston right on the interval.
Raith started the second half on the front foot and Morton's Russell had to clear off the line before keeper Gaston produced two decent saves to stop good efforts from Ross Callachan and Ryan Hardie.
But it was the home side who stretched their lead on 67 minutes when Russell's deep cross from the left was met by Shankland to head a debut goal for Duffy's side following his move from St Mirren earlier in the week.
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "We played well today; it was a tough match as they all are in this division. But it's only January and at this point the players are enjoying their football and we are winning matches, but we are looking up the way rather than down.
"Shankland is a terrific move for us and his goal today has added to our game. Overall I thought all the players did well. This is a club which works hard and even last season we had a terrific season and we are just carrying that on.
"The target is to get as many points as you can and if we are still in the mix later in the season let's see what happens and where we can go."
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "I am obviously disappointed with the result, but though we had dominated for large spells of the game, but just did not take our chances.
"We have obviously been on a poor run, but again it just shows you how tight the league is."
