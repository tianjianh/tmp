Ruth Patterson: Belfast councillor will not appeal DUP expulsion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast councillor Ruth Patterson has said she will not appeal her expulsion from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

Party leader Peter Robinson revealed on Saturday that DUP officers unanimously decided to expel her for allegedly bringing the party into disrepute.
The decision followed her public criticism of the selection of Emma Pengelly as an MLA for South Belfast.
Ms Patterson told the BBC she stands over her criticism of the party.
Ms Pengelly, a former adviser to Mr Robinson, was chosen by the party ahead of Ms Patterson in September to fill the South Belfast assembly seat vacated by Jimmy Spratt.
The party used the co-option system, which allows parties to replace departing MLAs with a party colleague without a by-election, to put Ms Pengelly in place.
Thirty days after her appointment as an MLA, Ms Pengelly was handed a role as a junior minister in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  She has defended the system that allows for co-option.
Ms Patterson also said she had major difficulties with the party's decision to return to the Northern Ireland Executive after the publication of a report on paramilitaries last month.
She confirmed she received a letter from the party on Friday telling her she had been expelled.
But she said: "I stand over my criticism over the appointment.
"I wanted to do the job and had hoped to get the seat.
"You have to earn your stripes in a political party."
Asked if he was concerned that Ms Patterson would join the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Mr Robinson said: "It might give the TUV some cause for concern."
But she said she intends to continue her political career on Belfast City Council as an independent unionist.
"A weight has been lifted. My spirit is free and the shackles that have bound me have gone.
"I bear no ill will to Peter Robinson or the party that I have loved for 20 years."
Ms Patterson said she does not intend to join the TUV or any other political party.
"I have always said that if I leave the DUP I will not be going anywhere else," she added.
"I will be an independent unionist until I decide to stand down."
