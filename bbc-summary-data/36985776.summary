The 26-year-old Brazilian's Bluebirds' contract included a release clause understood to be around Â£2 million.
"We'd like to take this opportunity to thank Fabio for his contribution during his two and a half years at the club and wish him the very best for his future," Cardiff said.
Bluebirds boss Paul Trollope confirmed yesterday a deal was close.
"He's in talks with them and within the next 24 to 48 hours that might be concluded," he told BBC Radio Wales after the 1-0 defeat by Bristol Rovers.
Cardiff chief executive Ken Choo has already said players are likely to leave the Cardiff City Stadium before others are brought in.
"We could see a lot of movement in the last week of August, when the transfer window is about to close," said Choo.
"Everything is still up in the air.
"We have a few targets to go but it really depends on players leaving as well, players who we feel should move on."
The Bluebirds are closing in on a deal to sign Wales midfielder Emyr Huws.
