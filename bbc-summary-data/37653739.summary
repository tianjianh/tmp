[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Parkes, 35, from Walsall, was banned from keeping dogs for a year after being convicted of fox hunting at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.
Police found a group of men and two dead foxes on waste ground off Goscote Lodge Crescent, Walsall, last November, the hearing was told.
Parkes, of Bloxwich Road, was also ordered to pay £270 in costs.
He denied fox hunting contrary to the 2004 Hunting Act and two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs and was prosecuted by the RSPCA.

Police officers came across a group of men who scattered leaving Parkes and another man at the scene holding shovels, the court heard.
Commenting on the court hearing, RSPCA inspector Rob Crutchley said: "The two dogs had nasty-looking wounds to their muzzles which a vet later confirmed were consistent with fighting with a fox.
"Likewise, the fox had injuries to his body which were consistent with being attacked by dogs, and a post-mortem examination confirmed this.
"This is a horrific case which not only caused suffering to a fox, but also to the two dogs as well."
