Sudan profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sudanese broadcasting is highly restricted and state TV and radio reflect government policy. Pre-censorship ensures that the news reflects official views.

Sudan ranked among the bottom 10 countries in the 2014 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index. "News is controlled, the media are under surveillance and journalists are harassed by the security forces," the watchdog has said.
Satellite dishes are a common sight in affluent areas and pan-Arab TV stations are popular.
Unlike in most other Arab countries, radio remains a major element in the news media environment. The state runs the main radio networks. There is a handful of private FM radios in Khartoum; most of them focus on entertainment or Islam. Dutch-based Radio Dabanga aims to reach listeners in Darfur via shortwave.
The private press carries opposition views, but the state uses its powers to influence what is published.
Sudan had 9.3 million internet users by July 2014, comprising around 24% of the population (Internetworldstats). Increased access to the internet and official curbs on traditional media have brought a rise in the use of social media.
According to web filtering monitoring body OpenNet Initiative (ONI), "Sudan openly acknowledges filtering content that transgresses public morality and ethics or threatens order." Blogging is "subject to scrutiny and can incur serious consequences".
