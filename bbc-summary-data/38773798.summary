The 25-year-old English left-back goes into Accies' squad for Saturday's league trip to face St Johnstone.
Hamilton have been short of options in that position since Lennard Sowah moved to Hearts earlier in January.
Accies' head of player recruitment David MacKinnon told BBC Scotland: "He's got a good pedigree with loads of experience in the English leagues."
Adams came through the youth ranks at Sunderland and played for Brentford, Northampton Town, Coventry City, Notts County and Mansfield Town.
He switched to League Two Cambridge last summer and made 12 appearances this season.
Accies player-manager Martin Canning has played 20-year-old Scott McMann in the first team and both Louis Longridge and Grant Gillespie have slotted into the left-back role.
