The woman said she had been at a nightclub opposite the restaurant in Albion Street, Leeds, and was barred when she went to get food.
She told the 999 call handler: "I went to McDonalds and they said I was too drunk to go in! I'd had two drinks, I'd like a police officer please."
The call handler said it was a matter for McDonalds and not the police.
