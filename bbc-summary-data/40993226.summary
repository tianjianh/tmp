GB scored 113.9 in Strzegom, Poland, with Germany (123.0) in second place and Sweden (148.4) taking bronze.
British rider Nicola Wilson, on Bulana, won bronze in the individual event, with Germany's Ingrid Klimke and Michael Jung taking gold and silver.
GB's Tina Cook was fourth, with Ros Canter fifth and Gemma Tattersall in eighth.
The German team had been in the gold medal position after the dressage event on Friday, before an impressive performance by GB in Saturday's cross-country saw them lead going into the final showjumping stage.
Wilson, Cook and Canter all put in clear rounds to secure GB's first European gold since the 2009 event in Fontainebleau, France.
"I think I'm still pinching myself. It's just been amazing," said Wilson.
Cook added: "We were really wanting that gold, it's been a few years and it's fantastic to be back in this position."
It was a spectacular start for new British performance coach Chris Bartle, the Yorkshireman who left his role with Germany earlier this year after masterminding Olympic, World and European gold medal successes.
"I can't put it into words how impressed I am - I just couldn't be more proud," he said.
"They all rode exactly as they trained and what they're capable of. We now want more golds, for as long as we can."
