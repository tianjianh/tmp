A friend who wished to remain anonymous confirmed to the BBC on Thursday that the family's grandfather NK Paliwal had died.
Australian restaurateur Rupendra Dutta, 48, remains in hospital and is reportedly suffering a spinal injury.
His wife Anamika Dutta, 45, their son and two daughters aged between 12 and 20, and Mrs Dutta's sister were killed.
Witnesses said the family's hired SUV was speeding before it hit a barrier and flipped on Sunday.
The family friend said Mr Dutta remained in recovery and had not been told about his family.
On Tuesday the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) confirmed only that five Australians were involved in a crash, and did not provide an update on Thursday.
The grandfather is not believed to have been an Australian citizen.
