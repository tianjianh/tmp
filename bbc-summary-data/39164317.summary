[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk closed the gap on Championship leaders Hibs to six points thanks to a brace from Nathan Austin against Ayr.

The Bairns took the lead when Austin netted following great work in the build-up by Luke Leahy and John Baird.
Fraser Aird went close moments later but they had to wait until Austin forced home his second.
Ayr reduced the deficit through Gary Harkins' close-range effort, but Falkirk added two late goals through Craig Sibbald and Aird.
It means Falkirk extend their unbeaten run to seven games.
Kick-off was delayed for five minutes to allow the large visiting support in the 1,614 crowd into Somerset Park and while it started brightly for Falkirk, the first half did not really live up to the pre-match expectations.
Almost from their first real attack though, the visitors took the lead when John Baird's pass sent Austin in on goal and after his first effort was saved by Greg Fleming, he followed up to bundle the opener into the net from four yards for his third goal of the season.
Austin's unorthodox style was causing problems for Ayr, but the youngster took the wrong option when he chose to shoot rather than set up Aird. Aird shared his frustration with the bench, before passing on further 'advice' with the youngster.
Ayr's best moment of the half had been a cross-cum-shot from Craig Moore which had flashed across the six-yard box with Harkins just missing out on a vital touch.
The second half did improve, but mostly for the visitors, with Austin extending the lead for Falkirk when Aird's corner was not cleared and the youngster drove his fourth goal of the season past Fleming.
Harkins gave the home side some hope, scoring a minute later, after substitute Alan Forrest's shot was saved by goalkeeper Danny Rodgers, but Falkirk sealed the points with late goals on the break from Sibbald and Aird.
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "That was very frustrating. We got caught twice at the end to put a different look to the game. The scoreline was incredibly false.
"We were better for a lot of the second half, but we have got to win games and while Dumbarton and Raith are not out of it for sure along with us and St Mirren, every game is vital now."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "I've said from day one that we should be a team that is in the play-offs and that is where we are at the moment. If I am honest, I would have to say that Hibs are in the driving seat as they are six points in front with a game in hand, but we are right there.
"We now go into two very tough games against Morton and Hibs, I would love to finish at least second if we are not going to win the title as that means less play-off matches and after what happened to us last season that is hugely important.
"Putting runs together is very important at this stage of the season and that is six points from two away games and very pleasing."
