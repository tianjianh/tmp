An alleyway off Usborne Way in Ibstock has been cordoned off, which police said is connected with Kayleigh's disappearance but officers would not reveal more.
Police activity has centred around Baker's Croft estate near Ibstock and also around the Sence Valley Forest Park.
The two men were arrested in the Coalville and Ibstock areas of the county.
Kayleigh, from Measham, is described as being a "bright, intelligent and popular girl" who is about 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, medium build, with mousey coloured long hair.
She had planned on a night away from home on Friday and on Saturday morning telephoned her parents but has not made contact since.
Det Ch Supt David Sandall said: "We don't know where she is and this is totally out of character for her.
"We have a dedicated team of officers carrying out enquiries to try and locate Kayleigh.
"It is now more than three days since she was last seen by her family and they, and us, are becoming increasingly concerned about her safety."
