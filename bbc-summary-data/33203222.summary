Vanessa-Mae: Violinist has four-year skiing ban overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Violinist Vanessa-Mae's four-year skiing ban has been overturned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old Thailand skier was suspended by the International Ski Federation (FIS) in November after results were manipulated to help her qualify for the Sochi Winter Olympics.
But the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) said there was no direct evidence to implicate her in the fixing.
However her 67th-place finish in the giant slalom will not stand because the qualifying events were "so defective".
The Cas panel said "a number of irregularities" occurred in the "organisation and management" of the four races which raised Vanessa-Mae's racer status.
Five officials involved in the qualifying event were banned by the FIS.
Vanessa-Mae, a British citizen, competed in Sochi for her father's native country under the name Vanessa Vanakorn.
She can now try to qualify for the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
