Corey Jones was fatally shot early on Sunday after his car broke down on a motorway ramp in Palm Beach Gardens.
Officer Nouman Raja was on duty but not in uniform when he approached Jones' car on the dark stretch of road.
Police said Officer Raja was "suddenly confronted by an armed subject" and fatally wounded the 31-year-old Jones.
"It would be premature to say we have all the facts and speculate as to what took place based on unconfirmed accounts," Palm Beach Gardens Police Chief Stephen Stepp said on Wednesday.
Jones, a drummer who worked as a public housing inspector, was returning home after performing at a local bar when his car broke down, his family said.
Police said they recovered a handgun at the scene. Records show Jones purchased the weapon legally a few days before the incident.
Jones did not have a criminal record and had been a volunteer for My Brother's Keeper, an organisation for black youth.
Officer Raja's car was not equipped with a dashboard camera and he was not wearing a body camera, police said.
He has been placed on administrative leave while the department investigates the shooting.
Jones' death is one of several cases under scrutiny in the US, in which a black person has died during an arrest or while in police custody.
The state's legislative black caucus called on the governor to launch an independent investigation by the state law enforcement agency.
Jones' family has hired prominent civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump who has represented the family of Trayvon Martin among others.
Civil rights activists - including the Reverend Al Sharpton - are planning a rally outside Palm Beach Gardens Police Department on Thursday.
