Matt Greenwood, 21, was given nine months to live in October after bone cancer in his hip spread to his lungs.
And despite having his leg amputated the engineering student and keen sportsman is learning to walk again with the aid of crutches.
Now his supporters are determined to help him complete his "bucket list".
Matt, from Walsall, in the West Midlands, said the support he had received from his friends and family had been "mind-blowing".
He said: "It's just incredible really, all the support that's been coming in, it's amazing and I'm so grateful to my friends.
"When you really, really need it in the crunch time, and when it kind of comes through for you, that's really special."
The St Edmund Hall student's friends and family broke their original JustGiving.com target of £10,000 in four hours and are now hoping to raise £75,000.
Matt's "bucket list" includes travelling to Rome and Athens, depending on which airlines will allow him to fly, taking a hot air balloon ride with his dad, and going skydiving.
His friend Ed Baker said: "There has been such a big response but Matt deserves it. If it was swapped round he would do the same for us."
Jeanne Ryan added: "He is such a character, everyone that has ever met him remembers him."
In a post on his Facebook page Matt said he was determined to "make the absolute most of every single minute that I have left".
