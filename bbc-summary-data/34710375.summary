Investigators are due to start examining flight recorders retrieved from the wreckage of a Russian plane that crashed in Egypt on Saturday.

Egypt says its experts will be joined by teams from Russia and also the Republic of Ireland, where the Airbus 321 was registered.
It crashed over the Sinai peninsula, killing all 224 people on board.
Egypt dismissed as "propaganda" claims that militants linked to Islamic State (IS) brought down the aircraft.
President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told the BBC that it was too early to say what had caused the crash.
The aircraft - flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg - is thought to have broken up in mid-air.
On Monday, Russia's Kogalymavia airline blamed "external influence" for the crash of its plane. But the head of Russia's aviation agency said such talk was premature and "not based on any proper facts".
Meanwhile, Russia's Interfax news agency on Tuesday quoted a source as saying the plane's cabin crew had not had any information about faults before the moment of crash.
"According to the recording of the conversations between the cabin crew and flight operations officers, the situation onboard four minutes before the aircraft disappeared from the radars was normal, the crew had regular conversations with flight operations officers," the source said.
"Nothing indicated any faults onboard. The crew did not report on them either," the source added.
Egypt's Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamal said the investigators would conclude their last field inspection at the crash site by the end of Tuesday and start working on the two flight recorders.
Mr Kamal was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that it "will take some time" to produce the final report and that the joint investigative committee "has all the tools and experts to deal with the investigation".
The experts hope the examination of the recorded onboard conversations as well as flight data will help provide clues as to what caused the crash.
During the BBC interview, President Sisi warned against jumping to conclusions. "When there is propaganda that it crashed because of Isis [IS], this is one way to damage the stability and security of Egypt and the image of Egypt. Believe me, the situation in Sinai - especially in this limited area - is under our full control."
The US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said there was no "direct evidence of any terrorist involvement yet" adding: "It's unlikely, but I wouldn't rule it out."
Militants launched an insurgency in the Sinai following the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. They stepped up their attacks after the military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in mid-2013.
A year ago the insurgents renamed their movement Sinai Province and pledged alliance to IS. Hundreds of police and soldiers have been killed.
After the crash Sinai Province issued a written statement and an audio message saying that it brought down the passenger jet.
However, experts doubt it possesses the weapons capable of bringing down an airliner.
The Airbus 321 had been carrying 217 passengers, including 25 children, and seven crew members. Most of those on board were Russians.
On Monday, the deputy director of Kogalymavia - which has just renamed itself Metrojet - ruled out a technical fault or pilot error.
"The only [explanation] for the plane to have been destroyed in mid-air can be specific impact, purely mechanical, physical influence on the aircraft," Alexander Smirnov said.
"There is no such combination of failures of systems which could have led to the plane disintegrating in the air," he added.
The US broadcaster CBS News reported that a US satellite had detected a "heat flash" over the Sinai at the time of the crash.
It said the data was still being analysed and that although the flash could have been caused by a bomb, a fuel tank or engine explosion was also possible.
It is believed to be Russia's worst ever air disaster.
The bodies of most those killed have been flown back to St Petersburg and identification is under way.
