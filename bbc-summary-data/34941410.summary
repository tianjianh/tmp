Benzema 'sex tape plot': Valbuena breaks silence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Footballer Mathieu Valbuena has spoken publicly for the first time about France team-mate Karim Benzema and an alleged sex tape blackmail plot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Benzema "indirectly" suggested he would need to pay blackmailers to get a tape back which purportedly contained sex scenes between Mr Valbuena and his girlfriend, Le Monde reported.
Mr Benzema is under investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail.
A lawyer for Mr Benzema insists his client is not guilty.
The scandal has damaged France's build-up to the European Championships, which the country hosts next year.
Sources have told French media that a relative of Mr Benzema was contacted by blackmailers in an attempt to involve him in the scheme against his teammate. There has been no confirmation from police.
The French Football Federation said on Friday that it was prepared to take "appropriate measures" in the case - including civil action - "depending on developments".  It had previously argued that French football had not been tarnished by the scandal.
A source close to the inquiry, quoted by AFP news agency, said Mr Benzema, 27, had told investigators he had approached Mr Valbuena, 31, about the tape on behalf of "a childhood friend".
In the interview in Le Monde, Mr Valbuena said Mr Benzema "was not aggressive in his manner of talking" and did not directly talk about money.  But he said that Mr Benzema was "insistent that I meet someone".
"I have never met anyone who is going to destroy a video for free just because they love me!" he said. "You shouldn't treat people like idiots."
After Mr Valbuena lodged his complaint, he said Mr Benzema had telephoned him and complained that he could not be "involved in stuff like this".
Sex, blackmail and French footballers
Mr Valbuena said he tried to reassure his teammate, but that deep down he still thought it strange Mr Benzema would try to get him to meet the people involved.
Mr Benzema's lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, has insisted his client took no part in the blackmail or blackmail attempts.
The striker has been placed under formal investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail and participation in a criminal conspiracy.
His case will be examined by a judge to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for charges.
Mr Benzema could face a minimum jail sentence of five years if he is convicted.
Three other men have been placed under formal investigation.
France coach Didier Deschamps left both players out of his squad for recent friendly matches.
