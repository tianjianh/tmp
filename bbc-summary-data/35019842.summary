The pair were struck by a car on the A4119 at Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, at about 00:30 GMT.
The 43-year-old father and his child were crossing the southbound carriageway, close to the entrance of Arthur Llewellyn Jenkins furniture store, when they were hit.
A 22-year-old driver of an Alfa Romeo has been arrested.

He believes they were trying to cross at a point where there is a footpath.
