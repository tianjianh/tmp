Darren Sammy's men produced a superb performance with the ball to restrict Sri Lanka to 122-9, with Samuel Badree taking 3-12 and Dwayne Bravo 2-20.
Only Thisara Perera, who hit 40 off 29 balls, offered any resistance.
Andre Fletcher - opening the batting in the absence of the injured Chris Gayle - blasted an unbeaten 84 off 64 balls in a largely straightforward chase.
Gayle left the field during the Sri Lanka innings due to a pulled hamstring, meaning he was denied the opportunity to bat.
It's a second victory for West Indies, who beat England by six wickets on Wednesday, meaning they will qualify for the last four if they beat South Africa on Friday.
But defending champions Sri Lanka face a battle to advance, and their match against England in Delhi on Saturday now looms large, with the loser likely to be eliminated.
After their batsmen put England to the sword on a flat track in Mumbai, the West Indies demonstrated great versatility to record a completely different type of victory on a more-spin friendly pitch in Bengaluru.
The Sri Lanka innings was evenly poised at 32-2 after the six Powerplay overs when leg-spinner Badree took over.
First of all he induced Lahiru Thirimanne to spoon a drive to point, then he enticed Chamara Kapugedera to come down the track and had him stumped.
The 35-year-old - who hadn't played an international match in almost two years before this tournament - completed a superb spell of bowling by having Milinda Siriwardana caught at slip.
With West Indies spinner Sunil Narine, the world's number one-ranked T20 bowler, not playing in this tournament, Badree could have a vital role to play if West Indies progress further.
Fletcher, 28, didn't play in the first game against England, but was brought into the side at the expense of bowler Jerome Taylor.
The Grenadian was slated to bat at four but was then moved up the order due to Gayle's injury.
Batting with a fluency that eluded everyone else, the right-hander struck six fours and five sixes, scoring predominantly in front of square on the leg side.
He weathered the loss of three partners in becoming the second West Indian opener in consecutive matches to bat through.
The West Indies selectors now face a dilemma if Gayle returns to fitness: whether to preserve the current opening partnership of Gayle and Johnson Charles or pair Fletcher with Gayle at the top of the order.
More to follow.
