[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20-year-old man has been convicted of murdering a Glasgow pensioner in his own home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slovakian Imrich Joni stabbed and strangled Gordon Bolam, 68, at the property in Pollokshields last summer.
He had denied the crime but he was found guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh, following a week-long trial.
Judge Lady Scott told Joni, who has previous convictions for violence and dishonesty, that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment.
He will be told how long he will have to serve in jail before being eligible for parole at a hearing next month.
The court earlier heard that Joni struck Mr Bolam with a knife before throttling him with a piece of fabric at an address in Kenmure Street.
He then concealed his victim's remains in a bedroom wardrobe.
In a bid to cover up his crime and destroy DNA evidence, the murderer then washed upholstery, floors and other surfaces.
He also got rid of his trainers and the clothing he was wearing on the day he murdered Mr Bolam.
But Joni was caught after detectives found his DNA around Mr Bolam's property.
Forensic scientists also discovered Joni's DNA on the ligature which was placed around Mr Bolam's throat.
Joni, who lived at various addresses in the south side of Glasgow, murdered Mr Bolam at a date between 29 June and 14 July 2016.
He was found guilty of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
Det Insp Mark Henderson, the senior investigating officer on the case, said: "This was a vicious and senseless murder of a vulnerable and friendly elderly gentleman who was well known in the community by an individual who was determined to end the life of Gordon Bolam.
"While the conviction today cannot begin to compensate those who knew Gordon for their loss, I hope that family and friends can take satisfaction in knowing that the man responsible has been held to account for his actions.
"Police Scotland and the Major Investigation Teams will not allow those who perpetrate such extreme violence of this type to go undetected for their crimes.
"This violent act also shocked the local community, who really came together in the wake of this terrible incident. The community played a large role in the investigation of this murder and I thank them for their support."
