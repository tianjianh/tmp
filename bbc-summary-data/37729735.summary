A hospital specialising in brain and spinal injuries has been praised by health inspectors for the "outstanding" care it offers to patients.

The Walton Centre in Liverpool was given the highest rating by the Care Quality Commission following an inspection in April.
Inspectors described the unit as a "centre of excellence, delivering state-of-the-art, world-class care".
Liverpool now has the only two top-rated specialist hospitals in the UK.
The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is the only specialist hospital trust in the UK providing comprehensive neurology, neurosurgery, spinal and pain management services.
Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said his team found the hospital "outstanding for being effective and caring".
"We were particularly impressed with the centre's attention to detail throughout the patients' journey through the hospital.
All of this demonstrates that this is one of the best specialist trusts in England and I congratulate all the staff on their outstanding rating."
The Walton Centre receives patients from Merseyside, Cheshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, the Isle of Man and North Wales, a catchment area with a population of 3.5 million people.
Chief Executive Chris Harrop said it was a "fantastic result".
"I am overwhelmed by the commitment our staff give so willingly to help patients and pioneer new ways of working so that patients can access the best care, the best treatments and have the best possible outcome."
Liverpool's Heart and Chest Hospital is the only other specialist hospital trust in the country to receive the CQC's "outstanding" rating.
