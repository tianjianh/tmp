[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 0-0 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby recorded their second successive goalless home draw in the Championship after being held by Aston Villa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Villa enjoyed the better of the first half and twice hit the woodwork through Ross McCormack and Gary Gardner.
Pierluigi Gollini saved from Tom Ince and Ashley Westwood cleared Richard Keogh's header off the line as Derby began the second half brightly.
Will Hughes also cleared off the line from Villa's Tommy Elphick but neither side could break through.
The result leaves both sides with five points from their opening four games, having each won one, drawn two and lost one so far.
And Derby are still waiting for their first home league goal this season after also drawing 0-0 with Brighton on the opening day of the campaign.
Villa, who are unbeaten in three, were unable to hand new midfielder Mile Jedinak a debut because the paperwork following his move from Crystal Palace was not completed in time but they looked solid throughout and had the better chances in the first half as McCormack's shot hit the bar while Gardner struck the post.
Derby looked a different side after the break but struggled to maintain the pressure after their early flurry as the game petered out to its conclusion.
