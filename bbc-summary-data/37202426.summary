[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 1-0 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sonny Bradley scored a stoppage-time winner as Derek Adams' Plymouth beat visitors Cheltenham in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Central defender Bradley headed home Oscar Threlkeld's angled cross from the right in the third and final minute of added time as Argyle made it four league wins in a row.
Town's Asa Hall had earlier smashed an 82nd-minute half-volley from substitute Amari Morgan-Smith's left-wing cross past goalkeeper Luke McCormick but against a post.
Bradley and Jake Jervis should have made more of close-range opportunities for Plymouth in the first half.
Bradley volleyed wide from a few yards out following Graham Carey's pinpoint free-kick to the far post from the right.
Forward Jervis should also have done better than slicing wide when another Carey free-kick was headed into his path by Yann Songo'o.
Substitute Arnold Garita then set up strike partner David Goodwillie, whose low drive from inside the box was deflected over the bar by keeper Russell Griffiths' feet.
Griffiths made a brilliant low save at the foot of a post to scoop out Garita's close-range volley before the late drama.
