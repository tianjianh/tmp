Ashley Taylor, 32, died in the crash near Watton, Norfolk, in January 2014.
Capt Alison Dray, 31, from Rochester, Kent, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for nine months at Norwich Crown Court.
The Royal Logistics Corp member served in Afghanistan and defused 60 Taliban bombs.
She was in Norfolk for training when her hire car hit Mr Taylor on the A1075 near Watton on 8 January.
The court heard she had used her iPhone "extensively" in the moments leading up to the crash, and her car had mounted the kerb, killing Mr Taylor instantly.
Prosecutor Christopher Morgan told the court Dray had accessed a website with details of a hotel in Switzerland and had taken a screenshot on the phone.
Judge Anthony Bate said Dray, who received a Queen's commendation, was a "decorated soldier of previous exemplary character".
He had no option but to jail her, he added.
"You have served our country bravely and with distinction. It is plain that your remorse is sincere and profound - you have an intelligent and heartfelt understanding of the misery several seconds of inattention has brought on this family," he said.
