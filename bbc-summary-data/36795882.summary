[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Foley, who practised in Pembury, near Tunbridge Wells, touched some female clients without consent, Maidstone Crown Court heard.
He also filmed some of them getting undressed, the court was told.
Foley, 67, of Highfield Close, Pembury, admitted five sexual assaults and 11 voyeurism charges and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.
Judge Philip St John-Stevens said Foley, who also admitted a charge of possessing extreme pornography, should serve half the term in custody and spend the other half doing community service.
He also made an order banning him from working with children and made him the subject of a sexual harm prevention order lasting 10 years.
Statements from some of Foley's victims revealed they had experienced flashbacks, felt embarrassed, violated and scared since learning what had happened to them during their treatments between 2011 and 2013.
Judge St John-Stevens told Foley he had abused the trust of his patients.
Police said Foley was arrested after receiving a complaint from a woman who noticed a small camera in the room where she was undressing.
Det Con Wendy Thatcher, of Kent Police, said after the case: "Foley knew that his victims had put a great deal of trust in him and he chose to repeatedly exploit this for his own gratification.
"As a result he has left a number of women feeling violated, embarrassed and betrayed."
