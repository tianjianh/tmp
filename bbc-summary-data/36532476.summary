Carl Baker: Portsmouth sign former MK Dons midfielder on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth have signed midfielder Carl Baker on a two-year deal after his contract expired at MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baker, 33, follows defender Matt Clarke and midfielder Danny Rose as new additions to Pompey manager Paul Cook's squad for next season.
The former Morecambe and Coventry player scored 15 goals in 72 games during his two seasons with MK Dons.
He was offered a new deal by the club at the end of last season, but opted to join Portsmouth instead.
Baker's move to Fratton Park will become official on 1 July, a club he admitted he nearly joined two years ago.
"It's lovely to finally arrive on the south coast," he told the club's website.
"Since then I've kept a close eye on their results and another big factor in me coming here is that Paul Cook was my boss at Southport, where I started out."
