Bradford Bulls centre Adrian Purtell has been given the final go-ahead to return to first-team action 10 months after having a heart attack.

Purtell, who was given the all-clear to resume training in December, suffered the attack after a defeat by Leeds Rhinos at Magic Weekend.
The 28-year-old could feature in Sunday's game against Hull KR.
"I'm delighted with the verdict of the specialist and can't wait to pull the shirt on," he told the club website.
The Australian admitted in September last year that he was unsure if he would be able to take play again.
And he added: "I'd like to thank all the medical staff, both at the club and at the various hospitals that I have attended, for their care and also the club for their continued support throughout the past 10 months.
"I just want to put this behind me now and concentrate on my career."
The Bulls have won three and drawn one of their opening six Super League fixtures this campaign and head coach Francis Cummins believes the prospect of Purtell's return will be a further  boost to all concerned.
"It's fantastic news for Adrian, the Bulls and the game," he said.
"It will be like having a new player on board and I am really looking forward to seeing Adrian playing the game he loves again."
