As many as 30 youths were involved in what police described as a "pre-arranged" disturbance in Inverurie on Friday 5 May.
Police have stepped up patrols in the town this weekend and said Friday night passed without incident.
In addition to the 18 people charged, six fixed penalty notices have been handed out.
Officers from Police Scotland's Alcohol and Violence Reduction Unit as well as community and road policing officers have increased their presence in Inverurie, Kintore, Kemnay and surrounding areas.
Sgt William Murdoch said: "Although reports were that there was to be an arranged disturbance, Friday night went without incident.
"Support from members of our public has been fantastic with a high number of calls alerting us to potential incidents.
"We've made it clear to those previously involved and those planning to take part that they will face court.
"Our support to the area won't stop and our patrols will continue so that we are in a strong position to reduce the risk from anything further by taking action against those set on violence."
Mr Murdoch said local officers would be stopping cars and checking trains and buses to make it harder for groups to descend on towns and villages.
