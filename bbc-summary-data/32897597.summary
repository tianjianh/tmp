Plymouth Albion boss Graham Dawe is considering moves to sign some of Cornwall's county side.

Dawe needs to revamp the squad after Albion were  and is also coach of the Duchy's team.
"That could be a strong possibility," he told BBC South West.
"The way they've showed up in the County Championship means they've certainly got the enthusiasm for rugby, and that's what we want at Plymouth."
Most of the players in Cornwall's team are drawn from the county's National Two South clubs Redruth and Launceston.
But Dawe warned that making the step up to the third tier of English rugby would not be easy for the Cornish players:
"National League One's a brutal league because you have to go so far north for some of the games and there's a lot of good teams that are settled with settled players, settled game plans and settled coaches.
"It'll be a good challenge, but we've somehow got to put a team together to meet those challenges, and if it's a Cornwall player or 15 Cornwall players that'd be great," he said.
