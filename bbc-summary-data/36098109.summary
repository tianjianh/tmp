English duo Peaty and Guy will make their Olympic debuts in Brazil, as will Welsh Commonwealth champion Jazz Carlin.
"I want to make Britain proud," Peaty, 21, told BBC Sport.
Scotland's Hannah Miley, 26, and Robbie Renwick, 27, will compete in their third Games.
However, former world champion Liam Tancock and ex-European gold medallist Lizzie Simmonds - who both raced at Beijing 2008 and London 2012 - miss out.
European Games medallist Georgia Coates, 17, who finished third in the 200m freestyle final, is the youngest member of the Rio swimming squad.
Who else has made GB's squad for Rio?
What's happening in Olympic sport this week?
Team GB swimmers failed to achieve their Olympic medal target of five at London 2012, winning one silver and two bronzes. However, a record-breaking 2015 World Championship has given the squad cause for optimism with world medallists Peaty, Guy, Carlin and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor among their ranks.

Peaty, who won three world titles in Kazan, is aiming to be the first British man since Adrian Moorhouse in 1988 to win an Olympic swimming gold medal.
"It's Olympic year so you never know who's going to appear, but I'm definitely the strongest I've ever been," Peaty said.
"It has been a long time [since the 1988 gold], but I like the pressure because it leaves me with nowhere to hide."
Miley has won World, European and Commonwealth honours in an impressive career, but hopes Rio will finally allow her to realise her lifetime ambition of an Olympic medal.

"It's another fantastic opportunity to put myself out there against the very best in the world," she said.
"It's the biggest event in the world - and hopefully I can come out on top."
Tim Shuttleworth (1500m), Chloe Tutton (200m breaststroke), Max Litchfield (400m individual medley) are among a group of exciting youngsters to claim breakthrough British titles last week and secure surprise Olympic selections.
"The team has been refreshed as a result of a series of great performances from some of our Podium Potential youngsters," British Swimming performance director Chris Spice said.
"Athletes have done a good job to make the team, but our primary focus is to improve performances in Rio."

Scottish Commonwealth champion Dan Wallace has been given a reprieve despite a disappointing performance at the trials last week which saw him fail to attain the qualification standard in any of his three strongest event.
He, Cameron Kurle and Ieuan Lloyd are the 'wildcard' picks, reserved for those swimmers that the GB selectors feel could act as relay alternates to key athletes who have large competition schedules at August's Games.
The British swimmers who missed out on selection for Rio - despite victories at the Olympic trials - were Roberto Pavoni, Luke Greenbank, Alys Thomas and Adam Mallett.
James Guy, Adam Peaty, Max Litchfield, Jazz Carlin, Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, Andrew Willis, Hannah Miley, Ben Proud, Chloe Tutton, Ross Murdoch, Stephen Milne, Robbie Renwick, Duncan Scott, Craig Benson, Fran Halsall, Molly Renshaw, Chris Walker-Hebborn, Tim Shuttleworth, Aimee Willmott, Eleanor Faulkner, Georgia Coates, Camilla Hattersley, Georgia Davies, Cameron Kurle, Ieuan Lloyd, Daniel Wallace.
