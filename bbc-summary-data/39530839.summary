A message on Bradley Lowery's Facebook page said the treatment had been his "last option" and at this stage they would continue "creating memories".
Bradley, who has neuroblastoma, was due to attend Saturday's Grand National race.
His family said they were "heartbroken" at the news.
Bradley had just been signed up to take part in a new therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital.
The statement said: "Scan results show treatment that Bradley has been receiving is not working, this means we will not get him cancer free as this was our last option.
"We can still go to London and receive the trial there however this a phase one trial and hasn't shown any success in neuroblastoma up to now.
"We are understandably heartbroken about the recent news, hearing this type of thing never gets easier.
"We don't know how long it will be before the cancer wins, but what we do know is that we will continue to make memories and enjoy our super hero every second of the day."
At Christmas Bradley received thousands of cards of support from all over the world.
Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has been a regular visitor to his hospital bedside and recently led Bradley out as the England team's mascot at Wembley and Sunderland's mascot at the Stadium of Light.
Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer with an unknown cause that affects babies and young children.
