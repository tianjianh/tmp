Former England captain Jamie Peacock is coming out of retirement to play for Hull KR for the rest of the season, he has announced.

The 38-year-old retired at the end of last term after helping Leeds Rhinos win the treble, becoming head of rugby at the Lightstream Stadium.
However, injuries have prompted the prop to return as a player.
"Although my family don't quite understand it, this feels like the right decision," Peacock said.
"The time has come for me to put my boots on again," he told the club website.
"Physically, it may take me some time to get back up to speed, but I've been preparing as best I can and mentally I'm in a good place."
Peacock, a multiple Super League, Challenge Cup and World Club Challenge winner who was crowned Man of Steel in 2003, could make his return against London Broncos on Sunday.
He will also continue in his off-field role at Hull KR, who are currently fourth in the Qualifiers, with only the top three guaranteed Super League status next season.
"I understand my decision will be a big talking point but as far as I'm concerned I'm just focusing on training as hard as I can and getting back out there on the field as quickly as possible.
"With the loss of three more players to injury against Leigh on Saturday and Maurice Blair returning home to Australia temporarily this week, we are now down to the bare bones in terms of the squad.
"Unfortunately, salary cap restraints meant we were limited in terms of bringing in reinforcements before the deadline but we explored the option of using somebody internally and I was officially registered as a Hull KR player with the RFL in case of emergency."
