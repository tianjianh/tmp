Liam Fee murder trial: Nyomi Fee made 'terrible mistake' neglecting child

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the women accused of murdering toddler Liam Fee accepted she made a "terrible, terrible mistake" by neglecting him, her lawyer told a jury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Stewart QC said Nyomi Fee accepted she made mistakes in her treatment of Liam but that did not make her guilty of murder and said there was no evidence she ever injured the child.
He said another child had been assaulting Liam before he died.
Nyomi and Rachel Fee deny murdering the toddler in March 2014 near Glenrothes.
They also face charges they neglected the two-year-old and abused two other children.
The pair blame one of the other children in their care for killing Liam.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
In his closing speech, the defence QC for Nyomi Fee said: "There's not one piece of evidence offered to you that Nyomi Fee ever inflicted injury on Liam Fee at all.
"The fact that Nyomi Fee accepts that she made a terrible, terrible mistake in respect of Liam Fee does not automatically mean that she is someone who should be condemned as guilty of other aspects.
"In this case I don't suggest for one minute that you should sympathise with Nyomi fee, not for one minute.
"Evidence which the Crown hope they might have, wish they might have, suggest they might have, is actually missing and it cannot be replaced by conjecture and assumption. I intend to put before you facts."
Mr Stewart said she now accepted her guilt for neglecting Liam and could offer no excuse for what had happened.
He told the court: "It was a dreadful thing to do. It was a catastrophic mistake and a catastrophic failure of care.
"It's capable of any form of description people want to apply to it: it's unforgiveable, it's cruel, especially when you consider the consequences and the full extent of that injury is known.
"That's what happened and she accepts any description that people place upon it."
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
