Northampton's lead came after just seven minutes when Paul Anderson weaved his way into the box before his low cross found Harry Beautyman, who slid in from close range.
Swindon almost levelled the scores in the 29th minute after four quick-fire attempts but Adam Smith made an excellent double save before his defenders blocked the following two.
John Obika had a chance to equalise for the home side on the stroke of half-time but fired his shot over the bar from close range.
Substitute Sean Murray got Swindon back into the game after 66 minutes as his effort from outside the area rifled into the back of the net.
Northampton regained the lead in the 76th minute after O'Toole headed in from a Matt Taylor corner.
Kenji Gorre killed the game off for the Cobblers in the 82nd minute after an Alex Revell dummy left the substitute with a simple finish.
