Serbia profile - Media

Television is, by far, the main source of news and information. The flagship public network, RTS1, is among a handful of outlets that dominate the market.

There are more than 90 TV channels and the average viewer spends more than five hours a day watching television, the highest figure in Europe.
Six TV stations are licensed to broadcast nationally; 30 have regional licences. The national TV broadcasters attract around 70 per cent of the audience.
RTS1 is the most popular channel in Serbia, attracting up to a quarter of the audience and providing strong competition for commercial stations, including leading commercial network TV Pink.
Media freedom issues mainly relate to the judiciary, often seen as incompetent and corrupt, being unable to protect journalists. In 2014, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Serbia 54th out of 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index, ahead of most countries in the region. Some cases of journalists being threatened and intimidated have been recorded.
There were 4.7 million internet users by July 2014 (Internetlivestats). Latest figures show the number of Facebook users tops three million. Internet access is unrestricted, NGO Freedom House says.
