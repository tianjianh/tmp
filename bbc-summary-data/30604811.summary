Manager Louis van Gaal revealed Di Maria had suffered the injury in training on Christmas Eve.
The Dutchman, whose side visit Tottenham on 28 December, does not know when his Â£59.7m record signing will return.
"It is not a muscle injury," he said. "It is more the pelvis does not have the right relationship with the leg."
Van Gaal added: "We will have to wait and see for the analysis."
Di Maria, 26, only returned to the United side at Aston Villa on 20 December after a three-week absence with a hamstring tear.
