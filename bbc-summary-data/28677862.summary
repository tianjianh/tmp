Glasgow City Council chief executive George Black retires

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of Glasgow City Council is to retire after 11 years in the job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Black, who reportedly earned close to Â£170,000 a year, is expected to leave by the end of 2014.
Mr Black, 61, took responsibility for some of the preparations for the Commonwealth Games but also had to deal with the impact of tight council funding.
The process to recruit his successor will now get under way.
Mr Black has been with Glasgow City Council - and its predecessor before the current local government structure took effect - for more than 20 years.
Before his move to Glasgow, the qualified accountant worked for the Hydro Electric Board and several other councils.
In a note to staff, Mr Black said:  "I have worked at a senior level in Glasgow for over 20 years and have witnessed first hand the improvements in the city.
"However, much still remains to be done and I believe now is the right time for a new chief executive to manage the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
"It has been a great privilege to have been chief executive at such an exciting time and I have been fortunate to have had the support of so many dedicated colleagues."
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "I want to thank George for his exceptional work on behalf of the city."
