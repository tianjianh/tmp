Cala is waiting for EFL clearance to purchase Abdulrahman Al-Hashemi's stake in the club's owners, G50 Holdings.
But Diego Lemos, who bought a share in G50 in September, has obtained a court order preventing the sale.
"I remain committed in my plan of purchasing Morecambe Football Club," confirmed 56-year-old Cala.
He said he wanted the League Two club to become "a stable, self-sustaining, transparent model that sets new standards within the EFL" and "see the brand grow towards a global audience putting the small town of Morecambe on a world map".
Players and some staff at the Shrimps have not been paid on time because the takeover has not been completed.
Brazilian Lemos bought a controlling stake in Morecambe in September and claims he owns G50, despite 99% of that share being transferred to tax consultant Graham Burnard on 11 January.
Burnard also claims he is the club's owner.
Lemos' spell at the Globe Arena has been criticised by the club, who claimed he had not been present for 10 weeks.
Companies House records also show that his shares in G50 Holdings, which were used to purchase the club, had been transferred.
Cala, who tried unsuccessfully to buy Portsmouth in 2012, wants to purchase Qatari businessman and former Morecambe co-chairman Al Hashemi's stake in G50.
