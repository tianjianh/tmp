Georgie Hermitage added 400m gold to her 100m title as she stormed to T37 victory in a new world mark of 1.00.43.
Elsewhere team-mate Hollie Arnold won F46 javelin gold with a 43.01m world record on her final throw.
Wales' Rob Davies clinched class one table tennis gold as he overcame South Korea's Young Dae Joo by three games to one in the gold-medal match.
Great Britain have won 31 golds at the Games so far.
Hermitage, who quit athletics as a teenager before London 2012 inspired her to return, had been tipped to possibly lower the world record beneath the 60-second barrier.
But in 36C heat and without competition to push her along the home straight, the 27-year-old cerebral palsy athlete from Guildford could not quite match those expectations.
"Everyone was expecting me to win this one and I did feel the pressure - I always do, I think I'm a natural worrier," she said.

"It's also because of my age I'm more aware of how everything is such a big deal.
"I'm getting better at coping though and for me the London 2017 world championships will be my London 2012 - that'll be the real test."
Hermitage could land a third gold in Thursday's 4x100m relay.

Arnold is competing in her third Paralympics at the age of just 22, but the first in which she came into the Games as favourite for gold.
The world number one and 2013 and 2015 world champion justified her status, twice breaking the previous world record of 41.15m as she held off the challenge of New Zealand's Holly Robinson.
"I've been injured for two months but coming here has been a clean slate and I just went out there with nothing to lose," she told Channel Four.
"I actually thought I had one more throw! When my coach told me I had won gold I just burst into tears. I didn't expect to break the world record by that much."
Davies,  showed steely determination to close out victory after a shaky opening couple of games.

"I must thank everybody for their support. We've been working hard behind the scenes and it has paid off. I'm chuffed I managed to keep it together," he said.
"I haven't beaten any of the Koreans for a while so to do it on the biggest stage is brilliant. Come on!"
GB's Stephen Miller picked up bronze in the F32 club throw. The 36-year-old, who won the title at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Paralympics, secured the final spot on the podium with a season's best throw of 31.93m.
Andy Lapthorne and Jamie Burdekin took bronze in the men's quad doubles wheelchair tennis, beating Israel's Itai Erenlib and Shraga Weinburg 3-6 6-4 7-6 over a gruelling four-and-a-half hours.
Ellie Simmonds won through to tonight's S6 400m freestyle final (21:41 BST) with victory in her heat, where she goes up against Ellie Robinson, the 15-year-old she inspired to take up swimming after her success at London 2012.
Piers Gilliver is guaranteed either silver or gold after winning through to the men's wheelchair fencing Epee A final.
