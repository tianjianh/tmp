[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A DUP MLA who has been battling bowel cancer will leave the Northern Ireland Assembly at the end of September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jimmy Spratt, the party's South Belfast assemblyman, has spoken publicly about his illness and is to retire on health grounds.
He was elected in 2007 and has been a member of the Policing Board and chair of the regional development committee.
DUP leader Peter Robinson said Mr Spratt had been a "vital part of the DUP team".
Mr Spratt said it had been an "honour and privilege" to represent his constituents.
"Whilst I am sad that the public representative chapter of my life is now closing, my health must take precedence over the unrelenting nature of an MLA's schedule," he said.
"To make a full recovery it is essential that my workload is lessened."
Mr Robinson added that he wished his "friend and colleague" well as he steps back from public life.
