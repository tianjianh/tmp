Officers have spent two nights at a house in Pagham, West Sussex, after receiving reports of "threatening behaviour" at 16:10 BST on Sunday.
The man left the house at 08:42 BST and was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.
Ambulance and fire services were on standby earlier after he threatened to set fire to the house in Harbour Road.
The man had been alone in the property after a woman known to him left shortly after police arrived.
A cordon was put in place and the road closed while officers negotiated with the man by megaphone.
Acting Assistant Chief Con Steve Whitton: "This was a long, complex and challenging negotiation, but I am delighted to say that it has ended peacefully and safely as this was always our absolute priority.
"It has resulted in considerable disruption for residents in the area."
A police presence will remain at the house but most officers have been stood down.
Harbour Road sits on a dirt track between the seafront and a nature reserve.
Landscape gardener Trevor Hawkins, 54, said he could see four police officers from his home, which has been taped off as part of the cordon.
He said: "Down this street, on the whole, everybody is quite friendly and says good morning so for something like this to happen is totally out of the ordinary."
