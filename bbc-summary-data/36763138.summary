The Hawk Racing BMW rider finished more than 12 seconds ahead of runner-up, Lincolnshire's Ivan Lintin, on the RC Express Kawasaki.
Manxman Dan Kneen was third for the Mar-Train Yamaha team on his return to action after injury.
The race was initially red-flagged on the first lap when Dean Harrison crashed out unhurt at Ballakeighan.
The Bradford rider did not compete in the re-start which was run over a reduced distance of six laps of the 4.25-mile Billown circuit, near Castletown.
For 27-year old Dunlop the victory represented a repeat of his success in the same race last year.
"We'd been having some trouble with the bike for a couple of days but the boys worked really hard to sort it," said Dunlop after his triumph.
"I pushed on early in the race but was able to back off on the last couple of laps."
Jamie Coward, Dan Hegarty and debutant Alan Bonner made up the top six, with James Cowton best of the 600s.
Another newcomer, Darryl Tweed from Ballymoney romped to victory in the 400cc/125cc race.
The pole position man led throughout and won by 17.6 seconds from Manxman Dan Sayle, who was riding a Moto3 machine.
Sayle came home just 0.03 seconds ahead of Adrian Kershaw, who completed the podium positions.
Adam McLean from Magherafelt was the first 125cc finisher.
Racing continues on Wednesday evening, followed by a busy programme on Thursday morning and afternoon.
Guy Martin, Solo Champion for the past three years, is missing this week's event.
The Lincolnshire rider informed the organising club last weekend that he had not sufficiently recovered after completing the gruelling Tour Divide cycle race in the United States.
William Dunlop is also absent as he awaits the birth of his first child, due this week.
