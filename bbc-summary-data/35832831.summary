Manager Craig Hignett says the togetherness of the Hartlepool United squad has made leaving players out easy to cope with during an unbeaten run.

Pools have won two of the past three games, and moved eight points clear of the relegation places after Tuesday's draw at Newport County.
Hignett, 46, has lost only one of his five matches in charge since replacing Ronnie Moore in mid-February.
"The lads can't have any complaints at the moment," he told BBC Tees.
"They've just got to bide their time, be patient, but make sure when their time comes they're ready."
Form has dictated team selection, although Hignett admits the situation has provided him with welcome quandaries as players look to impress.
"They've all showed me something that I like," the former Middlesbrough, Barnsley and Crewe midfielder added.
"I'm the manager I have to make decisions, we're on a really good run and the lads who have the shirts now, have them and it's up to them to keep them.
"The other lads have to train well and play well when they get the chance."
