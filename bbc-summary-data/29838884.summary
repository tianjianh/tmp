[SN]TITLE[SN]
Suffolk farmer Eric Moss of ARP Farms kept dead cattle on land

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer who had decaying corpses of dead cattle on his land has been fined and given a suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inspectors found the dead animals during two visits last year to Botany Farm in Farnham, Suffolk, Ipswich Crown Court heard.
Eric Moss and his company ARP Farms admitted 10 offences under livestock legislation. He was fined Â£33,200.
Last year the 72-year-old was fined for unlawfully slaughtering cattle and illegal selling of meat.
In his latest case, in addition to the fines, he received a four-week jail term, suspended for 12 months, for failing to register animals with the government. He also has to pay Â£14,000 costs.
The prosecution followed an investigation and visits by Suffolk County Council Trading Standards and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency.
Trading Standards said the carcasses had not been stored or disposed of in line with legislation aimed at preventing the spread of diseases.
The charges included failing to keep correct identification for animals, such as ear-tags, and failing to notify the authorities about the death of animals or record a death in an animal passport.
Despite the fact Moss reoffended just a year after previously being fined, Councillor Colin Spence, Suffolk County Council's cabinet member for public protection, claimed: "The court has sent out a clear message that anyone who continues bad practices will be dealt with severely.
"When a farmer has received repeated advice and warnings, but has chosen to ignore animal health legislation that could potentially put animals and humans at risk to disease, Trading Standards has no option but to take robust action," he added.
