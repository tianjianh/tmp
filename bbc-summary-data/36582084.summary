[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan take a lead of 91 runs over Kent into day four, after the visitors matched Welsh efforts in fighting back through the lower order.

Kent slumped to 85-5 before batting became easier as the ball grew older.
Sean Dickson made 75 and Adam Rouse a gritty career-best 65 despite a broken finger, which forced him to retire briefly, as Kent posted 282 all out.
Timm van der Gugten was the pick of Glamorgan's attack with a county-best 5-79, before the hosts ended 22-0.
Australian fast bowler Michael Hogan claimed his 200th first-class wicket for the home county in three and a half seasons, and conceded just 24 runs in 18 overs.
Rouse batted for around two and a half hours as he passed 50 for the first time in the Championship, but handed over wicket-keeping duties to Tom Latham.
A draw remains the most likely result after more than a day's play was lost to rain.
Glamorgan fast bowler Timm van der Gugten told BBC Wales Sport: "I thought it was a pretty even day to be fair, we bowled well in clumps but when the ball goes soft, it's quite nice to bat out there, but we stuck at it and hopefully we can build a good lead.
"Before I came here, I'd only played three or four first-class games (in Australia and for the Netherlands) and it's been a good learning curve, playing a lot of cricket with not much recovery, and chopping and changing between the formats has been different as well, but the hard work is paying off.
"I think there's a bit of rain around (on day four), so it'll depend on that and how we start. Potentially we could set up the game for a good crack at them."
Kent wicket-keeper Adam Rouse told BBC Radio Kent: "My hand's in a bit of bother, I'm going to have an X-ray to see how it is but last night's X-ray shows it (my finger) is fractured.
"The coaches left it up to me how much I played and it wasn't too bad keeping (in the first innings), I got five catches which is nice.
"It's definitely going to be one to remember (making a first 50) with everything that's gone on, but credit to the physio for keeping me out there and the boys for showing their appreciation which makes it a lot easier.
"We're still in a good position, ninety-odd behind, if we sneak four or five wickets early we could be right in the game- we've done it before this season at Derby."
