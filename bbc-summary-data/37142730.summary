"Irish MMA fans are among the most passionate that we've seen anywhere in the world," said James Elliott, general manager of UFC EMEA.
"They have long been asking for the UFC to return.
"We look forward to delivering an unforgettable event for the city of Belfast, one which will be remembered for years to come."
Ireland's Conor McGregor, the UFC featherwight champion, has boosted the popularity of the sport in recent years.
A line-up of fighters for the November showdown has yet to be confirmed.
"It goes without saying that Ireland is a key market for us, and the popularity of MMA amongst Irish fans continues to grow exponentially year on year," added Elliott.
