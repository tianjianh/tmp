Striker Peter Odemwingie has called his move to Rotherham a "no-brainer".

The 35-year-old Nigerian joined the Championship strugglers on a short-term deal on Monday.
The former West Brom and Cardiff frontman was a free agent after leaving Stoke City in the summer.
"I was close to signing for Bolton but the Championship is a higher league and it's a good league for me. I didn't need to think for long about the move," he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"It's a short-term deal but if things go well then we can talk about a longer deal closer to Christmas.
"I know it's a difficult situation but I've been in these positions before and done quite well and I think they bring out the best in me."
The Millers, who appointed Kenny Jackett as manager on Friday after the sacking of Alan Stubbs, are eight points adrift of safety.
Odemwingie, who also played in the second tier with Bristol City last season, believes Rotherham are capable of turning their season around.
"It's a huge task but you expect teams around you to have a dip in form as well and what you need to do is have a run of games where you pick up points," he added.
"November and December are always big months in English football. The objective is to not look too far ahead of ourselves and try to pick up as many points as we can."
