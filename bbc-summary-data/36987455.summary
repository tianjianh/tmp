His club-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, who helped Portugal win Euro 2016, and France and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann are also contenders.
Barcelona's Lionel Messi, who won the award for a second time last year, was fifth in the previous round of voting.
Journalists from Uefa's 55 member associations will vote for their best player on Thursday, 25 August.
Bale, 27, has enjoyed yet another memorable year for club and country.
He scored in a penalty shootout as Real beat city rivals Atletico to win the Champions League.
The former Tottenham player then netted three times to help Wales reach the last four of Euro 2016 in France.
