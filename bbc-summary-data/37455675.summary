Chhokar murder trial: 'Box of knives' not in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Surjit Sing Chhokar murder trial has heard how a box of knives allegedly discarded by the accused is not among the Crown's court productions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trial has heard allegations that Ronnie Coulter asked a woman to dispose of a bag containing the box and wet clothes the day after Mr Chhokar died.
The retired police inspector who recovered the bag in 1998 said he had "no idea why" it was not in court.
Mr Coulter denies murdering Mr Chhokar and has blamed two other men.
The 48-year-old, from Wishaw, denies stabbing the 32-year-old in Garrion Street, Overtown, North Lanarkshire, on 4 November 1998.
Mr Coulter has lodged a special defence blaming his nephew Andrew Coulter and another man, David Montgomery.
On Friday, retired police inspector David Aitchison gave evidence at the end of the third week of the trial.
He told the High Court in Glasgow that on 9 November 1998 he was given information by a man called John Joseph Buchanan, who was known as Jo-Jo.
Mr Aitchison told prosecutor Alex Prentice QC that after a meeting, he and a colleague, and Mr Buchanan, drove down a single track road to a dirt road.
The witness said that Mr Buchanan told them to stop and added: "Mr Buchanan jumped out and disappeared into the undergrowth and returned with a black bin bag.
"He was away for a couple of minutes. I was upset as ideally I would have preferred to have the bin bag photographed in situ."
Mr Aitchison told the jurors that there was a hole in the black bag and he could see that there were wet clothes and a box of kitchen utensils inside.
The court heard that the black bin bag was put in the boot of the police car and taken to a police station.
Mr Aitchison said he later discovered that one of the knives - the smallest - was missing from the box.
Defence QC Donald Findlay asked if the box was a production in court and discovered it was not.
The jury has been shown a photograph of a similar box.
He then asked Mr Aitchison: "Do you know where the box is," and he replied: "I have no idea why it is not here."
Another retired police officer, Stuart Murdoch, told the court that Ronnie Coulter went along to Wishaw police office on 9 November 1998.
Mr Murdoch was asked if Mr Coulter had any injuries and replied: "Yes. A small cut to his left hand near the bottom of the pinkie, a small cut to his left middle finger and a small cut to his right ring finger."
Prosecutor Mr Prentice asked: "Was Ronnie Coulter cautioned and charged that day with murder," and Mr Murdoch replied: "Yes."
The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues.
