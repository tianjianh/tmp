The woman, from Plymouth in Devon, blamed a "lapse in memory" when she called the police early on Friday.
It followed claims that the man was a burglar who took a photo of himself using her mobile phone.
Plymouth Police said: "We want to apologise to anyone who has been distressed by initially reading this story."
The man was pictured in the woman's Barbican flat apparently taking a "selfie" on the mobile phone.
The unidentified woman had claimed she was unaware the man had been in her home until she discovered the photo.
And she reported that crisps had been reported stolen in the incident, which happened some time in October.
A police spokesman said: "We've had contact from the woman this morning whose phone the image was on, to say she now knows who the man in the picture is and that he was in her house legitimately.
"We are therefore assured this has been a mistake, the man in the photo is not a suspect of any crime and we will be making further contact with this person shortly to learn more.
"We assume this was a genuine lapse of memory by this woman and we want to apologise to anyone who has been distressed by initially reading this story."
The identity of the man who was using the woman's phone remains unclear.
