She has been running marathons for "30-odd years" and took part in the first London Marathon in 1981.
"At that time I was a long-distance walker and thought I can cover that because I could do 20 miles in a day, so that's what made me apply and get a place - and it went from there," she says.
"At the end I burst into tears and said 'I can't believe I did that'."
Her advice for the day?
"A good pair of shoes, nice comfortable clothes and start as slowly as you can - not much more than a fast walk - and then build it up from there."
