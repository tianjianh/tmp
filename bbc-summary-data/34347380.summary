Carla Whitlock, 37, says her life is "changed completely" after she was attacked in Guildhall Square, Southampton, on Friday night.
Hampshire Constabulary is hunting two brothers from London in connection with the assault.
Officers raided properties in the Medway area of Kent in a bid to trace Billy and Geoffrey Midmore, 22 and 26.
Ms Whitlock said: "It's painful. My eyes are swollen at the moment. It's going to get more painful before it gets better. It just feels like someone is stabbing me in the eyeball all the time.
"I can pretty much see everything out of my left eye but I cannot see anything out of my right eye.
"It has changed my life completely. I'm coping with it as best as I can."
She also thanked staff at the Turtle Bay restaurant in Guildhall Square who administered first aid after she was attacked at about 21:00 on Friday.
"The efforts that they went to is why I've got sight in my left eye now," she said.
Det Insp Will Whale of Hampshire Police warned the Midmore brothers "there is no hiding place".
He said they were caught on CCTV in a McDonald's in the Swathling area of Southampton on Monday looking "relaxed, confident and smirking".
Mr Whale added: "The victim is now out of hospital, but her injuries are life-changing and horrific.
"So far the public has been fantastic in coming forward with information to help us,  but we need you to help us find these men who we believe were involved in this horrendous attack."
Billy Midmore is white, stocky, 5ft 8in (1.7m), with blue eyes and a scar on his left arm.  He speaks with a London accent.
Geoffrey Midmore is white, stocky, 5ft 1ins (1.5m), with green eyes, a scar on the right side of his face, and a tattoo on his hand.
Det Insp Whale added: "Anyone who is harbouring the Midmores or has assisted them since the weekend will be found."
Earlier, police said they were investigating if the victim had previously reported she was worried for her safety.
A force spokesman said: "We have instigated a review in relation to any previous reports made by the victim to the police."
