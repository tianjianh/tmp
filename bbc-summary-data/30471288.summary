More than 2,000 people dressed as Father Christmas have taken part in a fun run in Lincoln to raise money for local charities.

The festive runners donned Santa suits to complete the course around the city's cultural quarter on Sunday.
Organisers, the Rotary Club of Lincoln Colonia, said they hoped to raise more than last year's total of Â£80.000.
One of the charities to benefit is the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Air Ambulance.
Six other charities will also share the proceeds from the run, which started a decade ago with just 500 runners.
A spokesperson for the Rotary Club said it looked as if 2014 could be a record year and said he was hopeful last year's total would be beaten.
The annual race sees each competitor awarded a bespoke medal following the three-kilometre (1.8-mile) run/walk around uphill Lincoln.
Dogs are also allowed to take part in a special "Doggy Dash" event.
Liverpool currently holds the record for the most Santas taking part in a run, with 8,500 attending its 10th annual Santa Dash.
