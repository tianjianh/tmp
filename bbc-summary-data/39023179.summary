The Frenchman, seeded sixth, beat Belgian third seed Goffin 4-6 6-4 6-1 in just under two hours.
Tsonga, 31, will move up to 11th in the world rankings on Monday.
Goffin, playing his second ATP final in a row after losing in Sofia to Grigor Dimitrov, is set to become the first Belgian man to enter the world top 10.
"I'm really happy," said Tsonga. "The last couple of months, I put in a lot of effort to come back to this level.
"It's a huge reward for me and it gives me new expectations for the rest of the year.
"I changed my serve and worked a lot on my backhand and my returns. I also changed my strings. There were many things to improve my game."
