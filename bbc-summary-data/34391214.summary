[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultant failed to arrive after being called three times to attend a baby's breech birth, a coroner has heard.

An Ipswich Hospital midwife gave evidence at the inquest into the death of Bonnie Strachan who died soon after delivery in January.
Her parents, from Framlingham in Suffolk, said there was "utter panic" in the hospital delivery room.
The inquest in Ipswich is due to conclude on Wednesday.
Emma Strachan, 29, said after talking to doctors she had proceeded with a breech birth, where the baby's feet come out before the head.
The inquest heard she chose not to try and have the baby turned into the head-first position during pregnancy and had decided against a caesarean birth because she had had previous health problems including diabetes.
During the birth on 24 January, Ms Strachan and her husband James felt that, after her feet emerged, their daughter had been "left hanging" for several minutes before her arms and head followed.
The inquest heard Bonnie was "pale and floppy" and could not be resuscitated despite doctors trying for 29 minutes.
Pathologist Zoe Mead told the court she found evidence of asphyxia and hypoxia associated with low oxygen levels.
Ms Strachan said the room had been "too relaxed" ahead of the birth.
"It was a jovial atmosphere. The midwife commented that everybody wanted to watch a vaginal breech delivery saying 'we could sell tickets'.
"We do not feel we had properly been made aware of the risks of vaginal breech delivery."
She said staff seemed underprepared and did not have the right sized forceps available.
Midwife Suzanne Kelly said she was aware of guidelines which said a consultant should be present at breech deliveries.
She said one had been called three times, but did not arrive.
The family had instructed a medical negligence law firm to represent them.
