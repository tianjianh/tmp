Tickets for inconsiderate parkers in Scarborough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers caught parking inconsiderately will be given warning notices as part of a scheme to tackle the problem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scarborough Council's 'Considerate Parking Initiative' will see PCSOs and council officers hand out tickets asking motorists to be more thoughtful.
The council hope it will lead to a drop in drivers in the town blocking driveways, parking on grass verges or parking too close to road junctions.
The scheme has been backed by North Yorkshire Police.
Andrew Backhouse, the council's cabinet member with responsibility for parking, said: "By highlighting the issues and asking motorists to be more considerate, we hope the need for further regulation and enforcement can be avoided."
Inspector Mike Fenton said difficulty in finding a parking space was "no excuse to park inconsiderately or dangerously".
He said: "Drivers must remember that parents with buggies and wheelchair users need to be able to use the pavement.
"There's also the danger that bad parking can create a blind spot or obstruct sightlines, especially when parked near a junction."
