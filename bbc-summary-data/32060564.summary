A "loo with a view" overlooking the Cornish coast has sold at auction for £115,000.

The 502 sq ft (46.64 sq m) public toilet block had provided ladies and gents facilities for visitors to St Austell Bay, Cornwall.
Auctioneer Graham Barton said the plot had "huge potential" to become a "fantastic family or holiday home."
It also includes land to the front of and opposite the main block, with possible permission to extend.
Mr Barton said the final selling price had been "a breathtaking outcome".
"It was a spectacular lot, I haven't seen something with so much potential in as long as I can remember," he said.
However, some expressed concerns at the loss of toilet facilities in the popular Charlestown beauty spot.
One local resident said: "I can see why they are being sold off as they have a fantastic view but you do need public toilets.
"I hope they build new ones somewhere else nearby."
