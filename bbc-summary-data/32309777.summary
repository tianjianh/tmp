Repairs are being made to stabilise the abbey's collapsing floor and use Bath's hot springs as under floor heating.
The donor said he was "much impressed by the care and consultation, which has been put in by the abbey".
Bath Abbey said it was very grateful for the "amazingly generous gift" which came in an "ordinary-looking envelope".
The donor, who wants to remain anonymous, went on to say the abbey was "a vital part of Bath's future".
He added: "This generation has a solemn duty to ensure the abbey is fit and able to carry out its service to the city and community for the next hundred years."
The abbey needs to raise £7.1m in order to receive the full match funding amount of £10m from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
So far, including the mystery donation, £2.6m has been raised for the Footprints Appeal.
Appeal director Laura Brown said: "We are very grateful for this amazingly generous gift from one remarkable individual.
"It came in an ordinary-looking envelope, without pomp or fanfare, but the contents were just astounding.
"It clearly demonstrates the strength of feeling that the abbey and its ministry inspires in people."
