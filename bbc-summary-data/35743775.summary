[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council considers early retirements

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council is being asked to consider allowing staff early retirements to generate annual savings of more than £250,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report to the local authority said there would be one-off costs of more than £300,000 associated with the move.
It said the fact that those would be covered in a little more than a year made it an "attractive proposition".
The council is being advised to approve the six early retirement/voluntary severance requests.
If agreed, the staff severance costs associated with each application would range from from £9,000 up to £57,000.
The council would also need to cover "lost" pension payments of about £160,000.
However, it has been estimated that the losses would be covered within about 15 months.
