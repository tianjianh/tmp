Jamille Matt: 'Nothing' incident led to Portsmouth boss Paul Cook's dismissal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth striker Jamille Matt says the off-the-ball incident which led to Portsmouth boss Paul Cook being sent to the stands in the League Two play-off semi-final was "a bit of nothing".

Cook and Argyle coach Paul Wotton were both dismissed after coaching staff from both sides reacted when Matt and Michael Doyle clashed in the 2-2 draw.
Matt appeared to push his head into the back of Doyle's during the first half.
"I think it was a bit of nothing," said Matt, who scored both Argyle goals.
"Me and 'Doyley' have had a few battles before so I think he's tried to rile me up, I've tried to give him a little bit back. I don't think it was anything malicious."
TV replays suggested that referee Oliver Langford appeared to see the incident, and no action was taken against Matt, so it is unclear whether he will face any retrospective action.
"The referee said 'no red card', he said it was nothing. I agree with him and we'll see what happens," said Matt.
Both managers were circumspect when asked about the on and off-field incidents.
"I get in enough trouble, don't I?," said Cook. "I can't behave on the sidelines, so the more I say about the referees the worse I get into trouble.
"Their bench obviously thought we were trying to get the boy sent off, we get disappointed with the referee, I'm sure you guys have watched it so you'll be able to tell me if it was a sending off or not."
Plymouth manager Derek Adams told BBC Radio Devon: "The fourth official will be able to tell you and I think that's as much as I would like to say, as the fourth official knew what happened."
Argyle came from an early goal down to lead 2-1, before being pegged back by a second-half penalty after Peter Hartley fouled Marc McNulty.
"It was a terrific performance from the players, I thought they were excellent, coming away from home, scoring two goals," Adams added.
"We've given Portsmouth two goals that they really haven't had to work for and that's probably the disappointment of the night."
