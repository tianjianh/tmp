Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have announced the biggest-ever study into depression in Scotland.

They said they plan to involve 20,000 people in the project, which aims to find out what makes some people vulnerable to the illness.
It will also look at other people who experience stressful events without becoming depressed.
Those carrying out the research said it may help people avoid depression, or receive more appropriate treatment.
Kerry McIver had to give up her musical career after experiencing severe depression.
She said: "I spent most of my 20s in hospital. I think for the first year I wasn't (in hospital) but then it was in and out, in and out.
"I'd be in for six months then out for six weeks, and I'd be back to square one again.
"I does rob people of their lives and it robs people of their vitality.
"Even now, although I consider myself much better, my motivation to do things - my get and up and go - it's not what it used to be."
Depression is a very common disease. At least 12% of the population can expect to become clinically depressed at some point in their lives.
The Scottish study will be led by Dr Andrew McIntosh.
"We're going to invite them to answer questions about depressive symptoms they may have suffered from, some life events and coping strategies they may have had," he said.
"We're also interested in people's resilience to mental health problems.
"So we're actually going to ask individuals whether they've faced adversity in the past and faced perhaps some very severe forms of life event that might reasonably have been expected to cause depression in many people, but for some reason they've managed to negotiate these changes and not develop depressive illness as a result."
Researchers say the term "depression" covers a wide range of conditions and in order to treat them a wide range of factors have to be analysed.
Organisations campaigning for greater understanding of illnesses like depression have said they hope the study will help their work.
Alex Stobart, of Action on Depression, said: "It could be that one can draw links between other conditions in other ways that the brain behaves as the brain reacts and thereby persuade a wider and deeper approach to tackling this issue.
"It could very well be that we discover families and we discover people and reasons for depression occurring and then are able to understand what a better treatment might be that we can offer.
"But it's a long way to go."
