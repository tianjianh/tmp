[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The relegated Villagers made a vibrant start to the match, having good spells of possession but failing to create all-important clear-cut chances.
Aldershot capitalised on the half-hour when Nick Arnold crossed for Mensah to flick a header in at the back post.
The striker notched his second after the interval when substitute Scott Rendell glanced on to set up a close-range finish, just after the hour mark.
