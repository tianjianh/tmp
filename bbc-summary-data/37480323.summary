[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 0-1 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Jones' second-half effort proved enough as Gateshead edged out Tranmere at Prenton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Interim Rovers boss Paul Carden handed home debuts to Mitchell Duggan and Elliot Osborne and the latter went close from long range midway through the first half.
Visiting goalkeeper Dan Hanford also kept out a dangerous effort from Jake Kirby and then denied Jay Harris, while Gateshead came close through Wesley York at the other end as the tide began to turn.
The away side took the lead six minutes after the break as Jones tapped home York's cross from close range for his side's first goal in almost seven hours.
Kirby came close to grabbing an equaliser just after the hour mark but his effort was blocked by midfielder Paddy McLaughlin as the Heed held on.
