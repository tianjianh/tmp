Oliver Scullion died at the Hilden Brewery in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Thursday. It is understood the boy was crushed under a metal tank.
His grandfather said: "Oliver was a beautiful child, full of life and enthusiasm for everything he did."
The family announced the cancellation of a planned beer festival at the site.
In a statement released on behalf of the Scullion-Hanna family, Oliver's grandfather Seamus Scullion thanked "all who are supporting us at this heart-breaking time".
"It is difficult to come to terms with life without him. We will miss him more than words can express," he added.
"Under the circumstances, we regretfully have to cancel the Hilden Beer and Music Festival, due to take place on 28, 29, 30 August."
Oliver was the son of brewery manager Owen Scullion, who was also hurt in the accident.
The family have appealed for privacy.
The Health and Safety Executive said on Thursday that it had been notified of the child's death and was investigating the circumstances.
