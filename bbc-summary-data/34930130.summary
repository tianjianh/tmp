Police received a warning on Tuesday night that a device had been left on the Carnanbane Road near the village of Feeny.
A controlled explosion was carried out on Wednesday, and police confirmed that the device was a viable bomb.
The alert ended on Thursday and all roads have been reopened.
Earlier, Supt John Magill has called on the "reckless individuals" responsible to "give the community a break".
"This is the second security alert in the area since mid-November," he said.
"Again, we have had road closures and disruption caused to a rural community.
"People are trying to go about their day to day lives. They are trying to get children to school, visit elderly relatives and go about their working week.
"The last thing people need is the recklessness and disruption created by these incidents."
Earlier this month, there was a three-day security operation after a viable explosive device was left in Drumsurn, near Limavady in County Londonderry. Dissident republicans later said they had left it there.
A controlled explosion was carried out on that device.
