In a statement on the 'Wear Blue for Stu' Facebook tribute page, his family has asked those attending to wear blue in his honour.
The 27-year-old entrepreneur from Plymouth ran the Isle of Man-based Bluewave telecommunications company.
He died from natural causes on 30 July at his home in Douglas, police said.
The service will be held at St Ninian's Church, Douglas on Friday 21 August.
In the statement, his family said "We have been overwhelmed by the amount of love and support we have received.
"We would kindly request everyone to wear blue - dark, light, bright, jewel, any shade will do.
"As a family we would like to say thank you to everyone for your kind words and thoughts at this tremendously difficult time."
Baggs launched his company Bluewave Communications in 2007 and, days before his death, had held a press conference to launch his latest product.
When he was aged 21 in 2010, he became the youngest ever candidate to appear on the BBC One show The Apprentice.
Baggs, who was fired in the semi-final, became famous for his one-liners which included "Everything I touch turns to sold" and "I'm Stuart Baggs the brand".
