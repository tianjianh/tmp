Second-seed Gilmour, 21, had eased past Denmark's fourth seed Line Kjaersfeldt in the semi-finals but lost 21-15 21-18 in the 44-minute final.
Goh had come through qualifying and won seven matches on the way to her first senior title.
"I'm a little disappointed not to come away with a win," said Gilmour.
"I thought I played well. She was very solid and I made some poor decisions at some crucial points."
The Commonwealth silver medallist from Hamilton was appearing in her first final since retaining her Swedish Masters title in January.
