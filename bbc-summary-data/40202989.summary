England have made it through to the football Under-20 World Cup final for the very first time.

They beat Italy 3-1 in the semi-finals and will play Venezuela in South Korea on Sunday.
Previous under-20 sides hadn't won a single game in the tournament for the last 20 years!
By getting through to the final, they will either finish first or second in the tournament.
This will be the best performance for England's under-20 team since it came third back in 1993, when it lost in the semi-final to Ghana.
The under-21 boss Aidy Boothroyd praised the team, saying: "They are a group that can score goals in a variety of ways."
