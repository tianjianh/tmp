Boxer Tyson Fury has revealed that he has ambitions to be the next MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale.

The heavyweight boxer is hoping to fight for the constituency, currently held by Conservative David Morris.
He told the BBC it was a genuine ambition and he would stand as an Independent.
Mr Fury said there was too much focus on immigration and not enough on "our own brothers and sisters who are on the streets and abusing drugs and alcohol".
"I want to make a change for the better for the place I live," he said. "I believe that I will succeed because of the influence I have over the people from the town."
He said he had been thinking about entering politics over the past month or so.
The political ambition was separate to his dressing up as Batman last week for his heavyweight title fight against Wladimir Klitschko, he said.
Fury was due to take on the Ukrainian boxer, 39, for his WBA, IBF and WBO titles in Dusseldorf, Germany, on 24 October before the champion pulled out with an injury.
Fury said he now planned to meet David Morris and Lancashire County Council to discuss his political plans, and said: "I should be elected in five years' time."
Despite his roots in the travelling community, which is often said to be subject to abuse and discrimination, he said he believed there was too much focus on immigration.
"What about people who are born and bred here?" he said. "We need to build on the foundations we have steadily to make change."
Fury said he had no political experience, and no views on previous political scandals involving expenses.
"I feel that coming from a travelling background, I am used to politics and arguing," he said. "My opinions on travellers are different to refugees - we are not talking about people coming over from Romania - they are British people."
On the economy, he said it was "slightly better" than it had been over the last three years in terms of unemployment and people having more spending power, "and coming back to pubs and bars".
He said he did not want the UK to be part of the European Union, citing what he said were the financial problems of Spain, Greece and Italy.
