Djokovic beat the Frenchman 6-4 6-3 7-6 (7-5) in two hours and four minutes.
The 29-year-old Serb has now won 30 successive Grand Slam matches and currently holds all four titles.
Djokovic will next face the winner of the match between 28th seed American Sam Querrey and Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil.
Querrey was leading their second-round match 6-4 5-2 before play was suspended for the day on the outside courts because of rain.
"I do have a lot of expectation of myself, but I'm very grateful that I can play at such a high level consistently," Djokovic told BBC Sport.
"Grand Slams are what matter the most in our sport. The future is something we can't predict, but certainly I will continue playing with lots of passion and see how it goes."
Mannarino, 28, was broken just once in the first set, and it came following a successful Djokovic challenge that allowed him back into the game after his forehand was called long.
Djokovic then won five games in a row to take the first set and establish a three-game advantage in the second.
World number 77 Mannarino had five break points at 1-1 in the third, only for Djokovic to recover on each occasion and take the set on a tie-break.

Earlier on Wednesday, 10th seed Tomas Berdych progressed to round two with victory in four sets over Ivan Dodig.
The Czech won 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 6-1 7-6 (7-2) in three hours 24 minutes against the 31-year-old Croat.
Dodig, ranked 76th, fired 18 aces, but Berdych, a Wimbledon runner-up in 2010, broke serve seven times.
Berdych, 30, will now face Benjamin Becker in the second round after the German's straight-set victory over Facundo Bagnis on Tuesday.
Bernard Tomic and Fernando Verdasco also returned on Wednesday to complete their first-round tie, with the Australian winning in five sets.
Tomic, the 19th seed, lost the first set but recovered to win 4-6 6-3 6-3 3-6 6-4 and will face the winner of the match between Gastao Elias and Radu Albot.
Eighth seed Dominic Thiem is another to reach the second round, he saw off Germany's Florian Mayer 7-5 6-4 6-4 in one hour and 36 minutes.
The 22-year-old Austrian will face Czech Jiri Vesely next.
The rain rarely relented on the third day of action at Wimbledon, meaning several matches will have to be completed on Thursday.
Among those still to finish is David Ferrer's match against France's Nicolas Mahut, with the 13th seeded Spaniard 3-1 down before the covers came on.
Meanwhile, American John Isner, the 18th seed, will resume his first-round tie against Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus trailing 3-1 in the second set after winning the first 7-6 (7-2).
