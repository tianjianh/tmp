[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Gale's late drop-goal helped Super League leaders Castleford earn a thrilling victory at Wakefield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two Liam Finn penalties and tries from Ben Jones-Bishop and Kyle Wood put Wakefield 16-0 ahead at half-time.
Castleford hit back, with Greg Eden, Grant Millington and Mike McMeeken crossing to give them an 18-16 lead.
David Fifita's try put Wakefield back in front, but Jake Webster brought the visitors level before Gale's kick won the game.
Daryl Powell's side are now 10 points clear at the top of the table, with only two games left to play before the start of the Super 8s.
Wakefield stay fifth in the table, one point behind fourth-placed Hull FC, having lost both their games against Castleford this season.
The Tigers had struggled to convert opportunities before the break, with Webster spilling the ball as he dived over the line, before Eden had a try ruled out for obstruction.
But the visitors were much improved in the second half, with Gale's drop-goal from in front of the posts earning them a 10th straight victory in the league.
