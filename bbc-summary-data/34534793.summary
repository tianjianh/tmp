Jayne Hickey, 29, and her son were both shot at their home in Gillingham Road at around 21:25 BST on Monday when two men knocked at the front door.
She sustained two gunshot wounds to the leg and is critical in hospital, her son was shot in the left leg.
Police have linked shooting to armed feuds between gangs.
Greater Manchester Police said the boy had surgery on Wednesday to remove a bullet and was interviewed by detectives. They hope to speak to his mother on Thursday.
The force has issued descriptions of the two men responsible: the first is around 19 or 20 years old, of a "chunky" build and with a local accent, the second man is only described as white.
Both men are believed to have been wearing baseball caps.
Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe said: "It will be a long road to recovery for the boy and he will be having a further operation tomorrow, but he has been well enough to be interviewed by officers."
She said her officers are "still being met with a wall of silence" in the community.
She added: "These sickening attacks are putting children and innocent people at risk and we need the people of Salford to stand with us and tell us what they know."
