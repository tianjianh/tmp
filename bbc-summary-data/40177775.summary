Having slipped back to 12th after Leigh Centurions won on Thursday, Widnes started poorly at the Totally Wicked Stadium and trailed 10-0 at half-time.
Mark Percival, Regan Grace, Alex Walmsley, Ryan Morgan and Theo Fages all went over for the in-form Saints.
Vikings did cross through Ryan Ince and Danny Craven after the break, but they still suffered a 13th loss from 18.
Percival successfully kicked at goal three times for the hosts to add to their tally, on the night of former Harlequins prop Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook's 300th career appearance.
Vikings had got back to within six points of Saints when Ince finished in the corner shortly after half-time, but Craven missed the conversion and the hosts soon extended their lead.
Victory was the hosts' eighth of their league campaign so far, moving them to within five points of fifth-placed Wakefield.
St Helens head coach Justin Holbrook:
"I was really disappointed last week in what we didn't do against Castleford and this week we really improved and that's what really pleases me as a coach as we've worked on a few things.
"We have a good squad and everyone needs to know they need to play well to keep the jersey.
"We executed really well. A lot of that was Jonny Lomax coming into it but our middle was excellent. It was a real combination of everyone coming together.
"Regan (Grace) and Percy (Mark Percival) are putting a real combination together and it was great to see."
Widnes boss Denis Betts:
"We got beaten by a better side and sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say that. We just didn't have enough to get over the line.
"They took their opportunities, we didn't take ours. In the second half we didn't have any ball and did an awful lot of defending. It was one of those times where they built pressure and got the job done.
"It's disappointing as we had turned a corner in the last month or so. I don't want to make excuses. They manufactured two quality tries in the second half."
