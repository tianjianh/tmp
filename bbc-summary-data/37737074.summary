[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-3 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Tisdale got the better of the battle between the Football League's longest serving managers as Exeter inflicted Morecambe's sixth successive home defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tisdale's side were given a flying start by David Wheeler's fourth-minute goal and they wrapped up a 3-0 win before half-time with further strikes from Joel Grant and Lee Holmes.
The opener came when Alex Whitmore's poor clearance gave Holmes space and time to run on goal and the former Derby midfielder produced the perfect through ball for Wheeler to drill a low shot past Barry Roche from the edge of the area.
Lloyd James fired wide but the Grecians did not have to wait long for a second as, on 16 minutes, Reuben Reid did well to hold off his man on the edge of the area before teeing up Grant, who drilled a low left-foot shot in off the right post.
Jim Bentley's men hit back, with Tom Barkhuizen volleying Michael Rose's corner straight at Christy Pym and Cole Stockton heading weakly at goal from a second set-piece, before Exeter scored an all-too-simple third.
Holmes was allowed to run into the Morecambe area and without any challenge was able to stab a left-foot shot with the outside of his foot past the helpless Roche from 12 yards out.
Morecambe started the second half strongly, with Stockton firing over from close range, and they dominated from then on without being able to pull a goal back.
Substitute keeper Bobby Olejnik saved superbly from Lee Molyneux's sweetly-struck shot, Pierce Sweeney cleared Ryan Edwards's shot off the line and Whitmore also went close.
