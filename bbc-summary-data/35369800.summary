Mohammed Nisham drove his Hummer into his guard Chandrabose, pinning him against the wall, before attacking him with a metal rod last year.
Nisham, 38, supposedly attacked Chandrabose because he had been slow to open the gate to his apartment.
Chandrabose, aged 50, died after spending two weeks on life support.
On Wednesday, the trial court had found Nisham guilty of murder.
The prosecution had sought the death penalty and is expected to appeal against Thursday's verdict in the high court.
Nisham was charged with murder following the attack in Thrissur city in January last year.
Earlier, his bail plea was rejected by the Supreme Court which said the case was "an example of how the rich have become entirely egocentric and megalomaniacs".
Nisham faces a second court case over an incident in 2013 when he permitted his then nine-year-old son to drive his Ferrari.
Indian media say Nisham has had other brushes with the law.
In 2013, they reported that he locked a female police officer in his Rolls Royce because she asked him to pull over.
It is believed that Nisham has a taste for luxury cars, additionally owning a Bentley, an Aston Martin and a Jaguar.
He is believed to have made his fortune selling tobacco and through jewellery and hotel businesses in the Middle East.
