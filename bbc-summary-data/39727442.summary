Jazz Carlin says Chloe Tutton's failure to earn a Great Britain swimming team place for the World Championships will provide the perfect motivation ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

20-year-old Tutton came very close to winning a medal in the 200m breaststroke final at Rio 2016.
She has not been selected to go to the Worlds in Hungary after coming third in the event at the British Championships.
"She's in a really tough event," fellow Welsh swimmer Carlin said.
Carlin continued: "Unfortunately on the day she was third and they've taken the top two swimmers.
"She'll be disappointed but I definitely think that will be good motivation for her going into Commonwealth Games year."
Tutton finished fourth in 200m breaststroke final in Rio after winning gold at the British Olympic trials in 2016.
At the recent British Championship in Sheffield, however, she was third behind Jocelyn Ulyett and Molly Renshaw and will not be part of Britain's squad at July's World Championships in Hungary.
Carlin, who won two Olympic silvers at Rio 2016, has been included in the 29-strong British Swimming team.
The 26-year-old failed to achieve the qualifying time in her three freestyle events despite retaining her 800m British title and has been selected on a discretionary basis.
"After my performances last year I thought that would put me in a better position," Carlin told BBC Wales Sport.
"I always want to qualify the right way. I don't want to be the person that doesn't swim well - I always want to be on my best form.
"I know I wasn't on my best form so it's obviously nice to be selected and put on the team.
"I'll definitely be getting my head down and working hard towards the World Championships in July.
"There's a lot to work on and I'll sit down with my coach and work out ways we can improve and keep moving forward."
