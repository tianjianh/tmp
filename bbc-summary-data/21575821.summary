[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A test for the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is to be included within the Isle of Man's cervical cancer screening programme, says the health department.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The aim of the new programme is to reduce the number of Manx women who develop cervical cancer.
The additional test would mean more focussed treatment for "higher risk" individuals.
A spokesman said abnormalities caused by HPV can easily be treated before becoming dangerous.
He added: "With the discovery that HPV causes the majority of cervical cancers and following research and trials over many years, it is now possible to screen for high risk HPV as part of the existing cervical screening programme.
The test for high risk HPV is done on the cervical screening sample, which means that women will not notice anything different when they have their regular cervical smear test.
All women in the Isle of Man between the ages of 25 and 49 are called for cervical screening every three years.
Those between 50 and 64 are called every five years.
