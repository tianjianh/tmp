The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has been discussing the matter with the other home associations.
They fear a GB side could damage Wales' place as an independent football nation with the sport's governing body Fifa.
Fishlock said her priority is always Wales, but added: "I get why there is no Team GB, but women's football in the UK needs a Team GB."
"[But] I don't think they'll be one again," Fishlock added.
"The only way it's going to change is if governing bodies come out and say it doesn't matter if you have a Team GB, nothing will change with regards to the Euros or the World Cup.
"But the reality of it is if I went to a major tournament I would want to go and play for Wales."
Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford confirmed the informal get together between the four home associations at the extraordinary Uefa congress, in Athens.
Great Britain teams played at the 2012 Olympics and five Welshmen, including Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy, were included in the men's squad.
After taking part at London 2012, the four national football associations could not agree on sending a British women's team to the Rio Games, after a place was earned by England finishing third in the 2015 World Cup.
Fifa said it would need the agreement of the ruling bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who were against it.
British Olympic Association vice-chairman and former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson believes politics has denied the women's game a perfect platform to build on the interest it received at London 2012.
Seattle Reign's Fishlock, 29, who missed out on GB selection in 2012, says having a British women's team at the Olympics would lift the game's profile.
"You see the exposure it gets, you see how supportive people are of the Olympics," Fishlock added.
"Do I wish that there was a team GB? Absolutely, I think it's great. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
"I do believe that if Team GB did get together there would be so much support for it.
"I believe a team GB would be successful as we have a lot of talented players in that pool.
"I hope the governing bodies really look at it and change it but until that happens Team GB is in the rubbish for me.
"Wales is our number one focus, it always has been."
England manager Sam Allardyce would welcome Team GB entering football teams at future Olympics but Wales counterpart Chris Coleman dismissed the idea.
"Anything that could put what we've got here, what we've built here, in jeopardy, we would not be for that," Coleman said.
"We've always had a stance that we don't agree with it, and that hasn't changed."
