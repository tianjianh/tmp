QPR chairman Tony Fernandes believes he has got his "dream manager" to replace Harry Redknapp, who resigned last week.

The 50-year-old businessman said no announcement was imminent and it would "take a while" to complete the deal.
Tim Sherwood was contacted about the job, while Derby manager Steve McClaren and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement were also in the frame - links apparently dismissed by Fernandes.
"Still a bit to go but I'm very happy," the Malaysian wrote on Twitter.
"Think I have got my dream manager. Not what anyone thinks. Press all wrong."
Interim boss Chris Ramsey said after leading the side to their first away win of the season that he would be willing to take over if he was "the right man".
"If the job's available and I'm the right man, then I'll do it," he told BBC Sport.
"The club's been really good to me and whatever is going to happen will happen."
Asked if he could be Fernandes's "dream manager", Ramsey replied: "I've got a lot to do to be a dream manager."
Academy coach Ramsey and director of football Les Ferdinand took temporary charge after Redknapp, 67, stepped aside on 3 February, saying imminent knee replacement surgery was going to stop him giving 100% to the job.
QPR's 2-0 victory against Sunderland enabled them to climb out of the relegation zone - into 17th place - for the first time since 10 January.
