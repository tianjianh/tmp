Scot Higgins, 19, started his youth career at Celtic before moving to Dens Park and made four appearances for Dundee last season.
Former Republish of Ireland Under-21 player Power, 29, leaves English League Two club Lincoln City, where he made over 250 league appearances.
Both players have agreed two-year contracts with the Rugby Park club, with Power's move subject to clearance.
"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction," Higgins told Kilmarnock's website.
Manager Lee McCulloch said Higgins fits Kilmarnock's philosophy of developing young players.
"He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through," said McCulloch.
"For the second half of last season he gained experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club."
And Power said: "I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started. The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make."
McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season and said of Power: "Alan played in all of those games and was the cub captain.
"He has an aggressive style of play, has a hunger to get better, and has great experience that he can pass on to the younger kids."
Kilmarnock begin their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on 5 August.
