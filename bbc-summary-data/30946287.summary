Dustin Diamond, 38, pleaded not guilty to charges resulting from a bar fight in Wisconsin in December.
He was charged with recklessly endangering safety, carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct at the time.
The incident is said to have happened in Port Washington while Diamond was with his fiancee, Amanda Schutz.
Both Diamond and Schutz appeared in Ozaukee County Circuit Court on Thursday.
Crime reports say the pair had been to several bars before they got into a row with two men and another woman on Christmas Day.
The man who was stabbed was injured in the armpit - but is not thought to have been seriously hurt.
Schutz, who also faces a charge of disorderly conduct, pleaded not guilty.
Diamond has been free on bail since December.
Saved by the Bell aired during the 1990s and followed the lives of a group of high school students.
Since the show ended, Diamond has appeared on reality TV shows like Celebrity Big Brother, made a sex tape and a documentary called The Unauthorised Saved by the Bell Story.
