The A6079 on Hexham's railway bridge will close to vehicles from Monday to allow Network Rail engineers to carry out extensive improvement work.
A spokesman said although it would be "highly disruptive", it would ensure it remained in service for years to come.
Work will include repairing the steelwork and masonry on the bridge, repainting it and resurfacing the road.
Northumberland County Council said the A6079 road would be closed to vehicles from the junction with Alemouth Road to Tyne Mills roundabout. Alemouth Road and the roundabout will remain open throughout.
Pedestrian access will be maintained over the bridge.
A Network Rail spokesman said: "The nature of the road network in this area means that our diversion is a long one and we are sorry for the disruption this will cause.
"Our project team is aware of this and will complete the work as quickly as it is safe to do so."
