Trojan Horse inquiry: Teachers' bans quashed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lifetime bans handed to two teachers after the so-called "Trojan Horse" inquiry have been quashed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inamulhaq Anwar and Akeel Ahmed were banned from teaching in February.
It followed allegations the former workers at Park View secondary school in Birmingham had imposed "an undue amount of religious influence in pupils' education".
A High Court judge has now ruled they were treated unfairly.
The February bans came after a panel concluded pupils had been "immersed in orthodox Islamic doctrine" through measures including the use of the school loudspeaker system to broadcast a daily call-to-prayer to Park View's pupils.
But giving his ruling in Birmingham, Mr Justice Stephen Phillips voiced "considerable doubt" about the fairness of the original hearing.
He allowed the appeal because of the failure to disclose or order disclosure of key evidence to the men's lawyers.
A Department for Education spokesman said they were "disappointed" with the judgement and were considering options.
"In light of the fact that the judge has found against us on a technical, procedural point, we intend to ask for a re-hearing," the spokesman said.
The "Trojan Horse" inquiry centred around anonymous allegations which claimed there was a plot by Islamist hard-liners to take control of several Birmingham schools.
The allegations sparked investigations by several agencies, including the Department for Education and Ofsted. Park View Academy was among the schools placed in special measures.
The school has since been renamed Rockwood Academy.
