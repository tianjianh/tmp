Shaw has chosen to name an extended panel for the competition, which also features Germany, China and Korea.
The Green Army will use the tournament to prepare for World League 3, which takes place in Johannesburg in July and the Eurohockey Championships in August.
Shaw will wait until after the matches in Berlin before announcing the travelling squad for South Africa.
The 4 Nations tournament begins on Thursday, 15 June, with Ireland, who are in 15th place in the world rankings, going up against three sides in the top ten.
They will face the host nation, who are ranked 7th, on the opening day.
Their match against China, ranked 8th, will take place on 16 June and their final game against Korea, ranked 9th, is on 18 June.
"We have decided to bring 20 players to Berlin for the 4 Nations due to the tightness of the selection for World League 3 in South Africa," Shaw said.
"Germany, Korea and China provide ideal opposition in preparation for WL3," he added.
The Irish team will depart for World League 3 in Johannesburg at the end of June with the tournament beginning on Saturday, 8 July.
