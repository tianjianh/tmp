The 22-year-old made her debut against Italy in the 2015 championship and featured as a replacement against Spain in November.
Number eight Jade Konkel returns to the Scotland side after missing the 64-0 hammering by England.
Sarah Bonar and Lindsey Smith drop to the bench.
The inclusion of full-time player Konkel means a reshuffle, with Bonar making way for an all-Hillhead Jordanhill back row including Jemma Forsyth and Louise McMillan.
Scotland go into the game at Broadwood Stadium, Cumbernauld, seeking their second win in the tournament following their one-point victory over Wales.
Italy are yet to win a match in this year's competition.
Scotland head coach Shade Munro said: "We are aiming to end this year's Six Nations campaign on a positive note with a strong performance against Italy.
"It's been pleasing to see the squad improve in many aspects, but there is more work to be done to reach our full potential.
"We need a consistent and solid performance at Broadwood as Italy are a very good side and have been improving with every game in the tournament."
Lichfield hooker Rachel Malcolm returns to the bench after recovering from an injury picked up in the opening match against Ireland.
Melrose wing Lauren Harris also comes on to the bench.
