The Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) said the funds would be used to support UK suppliers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable described the project as "innovative".
The centre works in partnership with Rolls-Royce, who today announced it would be working with Hitachi as part of a deal to build nuclear reactors.
Mr Cable said: "Our energy sector is a vital part of our economy. This is an innovative Regional Growth Fund project, which will help businesses win new orders, both here and abroad."
Operations Director at the Nuclear AMRC, Prof Stephen Court, said: "We work with supply chain companies to enhance their technical capability to compete on cost, quality and delivery.
"We also give manufacturers clarity and knowledge on nuclear codes and standards, which helps them to meet and exceed the demanding requirements of this industry."
The centre's main facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in South Yorkshire was officially opened by the Duke of York in May 2012.
