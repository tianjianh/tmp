Kaikai, 19, scored in his only Palace appearance to date, a 3-2 League Cup loss to Newcastle in September.
Atkinson, 20, who plays at right-back, signed his first professional contract with Albion in May this year.
"I struggled to sleep last night, I was both excited and nervous thinking about what it is to come," said Atkinson.
"My main aim is to help Cambridge, play well for them and show the fans what I can do."
