Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi told the BBC that the Daughters' Day and the Daughters' Week were aimed at reducing female foeticide, improving India's skewed sex ratio and educating girls.
"We are asking people to celebrate the young women and girls in their lives," Mrs Gandhi said.
"The time has come to celebrate women. Women are doing much better now, there's more confidence in them. We want to spread the message that the girl child should be valued," she added.
To kick-off the campaign to mark Daughters' Day on Thursday, she tweeted a photograph with her daughter-in-law and granddaughter.
