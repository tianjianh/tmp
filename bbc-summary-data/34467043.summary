A baby died after being born into a hospital toilet by a 41-year-old woman who did not know she was pregnant, an inquest has heard.

Medical staff failed to recognise Diane Thomas was eight months pregnant and in labour when she suffered "horrendous" stomach cramps, the inquest was told.
She was admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital but gave birth before getting access to an ultrasound scan.
The hospital said it was reviewing the hours scanning was available.
The inquest at Truro City Hall was told doctors believed Dianne Thomas, who was overweight, was experiencing a miscarriage when she reported suffering bad stomach cramps for two days.
She was admitted to a gynaecological ward the Royal Cornwall Hospital on 30 March but could not access an ultrasound scan until the following day.
In a police interview, Ms Thomas, from Madron, Penzance, said the following morning she reported "really bad pain" but a nurse had told her "if you were in that much pain you would be rolling around on that bed".
She said she went to the toilet and said within 15 minutes she gave birth to Ellie Nicholls in what she described as "a bad shock, like it was all a dream".
Nurses and a doctor described in statements how the baby had been initially stuck in the toilet and had then survived "for a few minutes" but resuscitation efforts failed.
The gestation period was believed to have been between 31 and 33 weeks.
Expert paediatrician Prof Peter Fleming said there was a chance Ellie Nicholls could have survived if her mother had been on a labour suite, but it was "very unlikely" as she had suffered a "very severe infection".
Karen Watkins, a consultant obstetrician from the Royal Cornwall Hospital told the inquest "the hospital recognised, if there had been access to a scan when Diane was admitted, the correct gestation may have been detected".
She said the hospital was looking at extending those scanning hours.
The coroner for Cornwall, Dr Emma Carlyon, concluded that Ellie Nicholls died of natural causes.
