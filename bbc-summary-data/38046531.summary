The 20-year-old finished on a tournament record 19 under par to beat South Korea's Ryu So-yeon.
Hull started the final round with a one-shot lead ahead and shot six birdies in her bogey-free round for a six-under-par 66 at the Florida course.
"It's wicked to do it at 20," she said. "It feels good to be joining the winners this year."
World number one Lydia Ko was tied for 10th, while England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff finished tied for 36th.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew finished in 46th place.
Hull had been tied with Ryu after 16, but the Korean missed her par putt on the 17th as Hull birdied the hole to take the lead and complete a two-shot swing.
Both players then parred the last as Hull took the title, in the final tournament of the season.
The world number 29, who finished seventh at the Rio Olympics, had a bogey-free weekend, with 12 birdies and 24 pars in her final 36 holes and wins $500,000 (Â£404,891) in prize money.
"I just feel pretty good where I am at the moment," added Hull.  "I feel like I am mentally good. I feel relaxed. I think that's the key for me.
"If I come into a week relaxed I feel good. This week it happened for me. I'm confident. I'm happy."
It is Hull's second title since turning professional in 2013, having won the Lalla Meryem Cup on the Ladies European Tour in 2014.
