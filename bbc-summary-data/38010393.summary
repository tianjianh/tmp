Joey Barton gambling charges: Ex-Rangers player given one-match ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joey Barton has been given a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling.

The former Rangers midfielder attended Thursday's hearing at Hampden and admitted to the charge of placing 44 bets between 1 July and 15 September.
SFA disciplinary rules prohibit players, coaches, club officials and referees in Scotland from betting on football anywhere in the world.
Barton, 34, had his Rangers contract terminated earlier this month.
He played just eight games for the Ibrox club after his summer switch from Burnley before a training ground row led to a falling-out with manager Mark Warburton.
However, the former Manchester City and Newcastle United player may be offered the opportunity to train with Burnley.
"If he felt he needed a base to get fit, among many other players I've helped out, I'd listen," manager Sean Dyche told Burnley's website.
The ban will apply should he find another club in the United Kingdom because of an agreement between the home nations.
Before Barton's release by Rangers, Dyche had praised, in a BBC interview, Barton's behaviour while at Burnley but would not comment on the possibility of re-signing the English midfielder.
"The rest is for the future," he again stressed on his club website. "That's not for now.
"Myself and my staff have helped out young players, old players, phone calls to other clubs. If Joey requires our support here, he'd get that.
"That's if he requires that. If he doesn't, he'll move forward to where he needs to move forward to.
"It's a situation where, if he called me and said 'can I train?', we'd help him out the best we could.
"If there's any guarantee beyond that, that's for the future, not for now."
