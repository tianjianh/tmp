Lee Westwood had 'doubts' before impressive Masters display

Former world number one Lee Westwood says he had doubts about his ability to compete for majors again before his runner-up finish at the Masters.

Westwood, 43, tied second with Jordan Spieth last month, three shots behind fellow Englishman Danny Willett.
Westwood quit the PGA Tour last year following his divorce, dropping as low as 67th in the world before Augusta.
"Playing well at the Masters was a kick I really needed," he said before this week's PGA Championship at Wentworth.
The Nottinghamshire golfer won the Indonesian Masters in April 2015 but slipped down the rankings during the rest of the year.
He only qualified for the Masters by sneaking into the world's top 50, who are automatically invited to Augusta, ahead of the cut-off point at the end of last year.
But after missing the cut in three of his four warm-up events, Westwood found himself in contention for his first major before playing partner Willett pulled clear in the final three holes.
"When you haven't played well for a long time, then you do start to have doubts in your mind," said Westwood, who has moved back up to a ranking of 35.
"But it never takes long for golfers to snap out of it, really. We're only one good shot, really, from a comeback."
