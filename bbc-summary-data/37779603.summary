Keith Earls: Ireland wing banned for New Zealand Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland wing Keith Earls will miss the Test against New Zealand on 5 November after being suspended for two weeks following his red card on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earls was dismissed for a dangerous tackle on Fraser Brown playing for Munster against Glasgow Warriors in the European Champions Cup.
A "timely" guilty plea and expression of remorse helped in an initial four-week ban being reduced by half.
Earls is also suspended for Munster's Pro12 match against Ulster on Friday.
Referee Jerome Garces dismissed Earls 19 minutes into the Pool 1 game at Thomond Park.
The game in Limerick was Munster's first since the death of head coach Anthony Foley in Paris.
Earls was cited under the law for "lifting a player from the ground and either dropping or driving that player's head and/or upper body into the ground while the player's feet are off the ground".
An independent disciplinary committee found that the offence was at the low end of World Rugby's sanctions and selected four weeks as the appropriate entry point for a suspension.
"As there were no aggravating factors, the committee then reduced the sanction by a maximum of two weeks due to Earls' timely guilty plea, expression of remorse and clean disciplinary record before imposing a suspension of two weeks," the committee said.
Ireland take on the All Blacks in Chicago and Earls, who has the right to appeal the decision, will be available for the Test against Canada on 12 November in Dublin.
