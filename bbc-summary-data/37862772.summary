In October, the Dutchman said McCarthy, who has been struggling with a hamstring injury, was "massively overloaded" by the Republic.
O'Neill said this week that Koeman was "bleating" about the matter.
Now Koeman has advised McCarthy not to join the Ireland squad, saying: "The player is not fit."
On Wednesday, McCarthy was named in the Republic's provisional 35-man squad for the World Cup qualifier on 12 November.
In the previous international window in October, McCarthy played one full game and around 80 minutes of another, despite having not featured for Everton since 23 August because of a groin problem.
He has since made one substitute appearance for Everton, but has missed their last two games and will sit out Saturday's trip to Chelsea.
"I think to have a call-up, he needs to be close to being fit, but it is a little bit the same story as what happened last time," said Koeman.
"We spoke to James and my advice to him is to stay here, do training and be fit as soon as possible - but the final decision is by the player."
Asked if he had spoken to O'Neill about the situation, Koeman added: "No, it's not necessary, because we have the contact between the medical staff.
"If the manager does not take the right decision, maybe he can take the good advice of the medical staff."
