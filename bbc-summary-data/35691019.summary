[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is American hip hop artist Fatman Scoop, who has been taking part in Sport Relief's Battle of the Five-A-Sides.
During the match, Fatman Scoop had a few words to say about one game in particular this weekend. He told BBC Sport: "Arsenal are going to get beaten so bad, it's going to be disgusting."
Robbie Savage and Alan Shearer have kicked-off a 57-hour five-a-side game for Sport Relief.
The match, between BBC Radio 5 live and Match of the Day, was being played outside BBC MediaCityUK in Salford.
Also up against Lawro this week is 1Xtra DJ Nick Bright.
