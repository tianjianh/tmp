Delray Beach Open: Kyle Edmund through as Adrian Mannarino defaults

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number three Kyle Edmund went through at the Delray Beach Open as Adrian Mannarino became the Briton's second opponent in succession to default following an angry outburst.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edmund, 22, led 6-3 5-0 15-0 when the Frenchman was penalised a game for smashing a ball out of the court.
Mannarino had earlier kicked a chair, and hit a ball towards a ball boy.
Edmund's previous match, against Dennis Shapovalov in the Davis Cup, ended with the Canadian being defaulted.
The 17-year-old angrily smashed a ball which hit umpire Arnaud Gabas, who later required surgery to repair a fractured eye socket.
Edmund, the world number 49, had lost to 60th-ranked Mannarino in straight sets at Wimbledon last year, and the Yorkshireman goes on to face American Bjorn Fratangelo or Yen-Hsun Lu of Taiwan in the second round.
Canada's Milos Raonic, the world number four, is the top seed at Delray Beach and a potential quarter-final opponent for Edmund.
Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro is making his first appearance of 2017 after extending his off-season following victory in the Davis Cup in November.
