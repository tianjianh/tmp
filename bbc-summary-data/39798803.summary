Bedene, 27, took the opening set against last year's Wimbledon finalist, who was playing for only the second time since February due to injury.
But the 26-year-old world number six eventually won 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 7-6 (7-3) in just over two and a half hours.
He will now face Australian sixth seed Bernard Tomic in the quarter-finals.
Bedene reached Sunday's Hungarian Open final where he was beaten by Frenchman Lucas Pouille.
