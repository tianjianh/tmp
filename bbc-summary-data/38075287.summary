The 38-year-old told reporters he had played his last home game for the club following their 3-2 win against Toronto FC in the first leg of the Eastern Conference finals.
The ex-Chelsea striker came on as a 71st-minute substitute in front of a sell-out crowd of 61,000.
Kick-off was delayed by 30 minutes after it was discovered the 18-yard boxes were too narrow.
The white lines had to be repainted and fans cheered as each new line was drawn.
Montreal led 3-0 after 53 minutes, but two late goals by Toronto may prove crucial in the second leg, which will be played on 30 November.
The winner will progress to the MLS Cup final in Seattle or Colorado on 10 December.
Former Ivory Coast international Drogba, who joined Montreal from Chelsea in 2015, has scored 27 goals in 33 games.
Asked about his future after Tuesday's win, he said: "There's still one or maybe two games to go. Next week's game is more important than if it's finished or not.
"Everyone knows it was my last game here. Now let's focus on the semi-final."
Montreal posted a video of Drogba's highlights on their Twitter account and wrote 'Merci, Didier'.
Drogba, who has also played for Marseilles, Galatasaray and Shanghai Shenhua, has not said if he has signed for another club.
