A pair of newborn twins have been named after two players of a Wembley-bound rugby league club.

Ellis and Taylor Welburn were born at 05:20 BST in Barnsley Hospital after mum, Rachel Carr, was moved from Hull.
The boys were named after Gareth Ellis, captain of Hull FC, and fellow forward Scott Taylor.
The twin's father, Lee Wellburn, 31, from Hull, said he was delighted the boys had arrived to allow him to attend Saturday's cup final.
Hull FC and Warrington Wolves are to meet in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium.
Mr Welburn said mother and babies were doing well and hoped to go home to Hull on Tuesday. The twins were born two weeks prematurely.
Mr Welburn said the couple had had difficulty finding names for the babies during the pregnancy until they struck on the idea of Hull FC players.
A life-long Hull FC fan, he admitted some of the players' names had "worked less well" but the choices of Ellis and Taylor "just seemed to work", he said.
Mr Welburn said the birth of the twins had made him even more confident of the outcome of the game in London.
"I've got two good luck charms now", he added.
