Pokemon Go controversy has struck again, this time in Cambodia, after people were seen playing in one of the country's most notorious prisons.

An estimated 15,000 prisoners are believed to have been tortured to death at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum during the Khmer Rouge regime.
Survivors of the Khmer Rouge said playing the game at the site, which is now open to visitors, was an insult.
Pokemon Go launched in several South East Asian countries last weekend.
It has already been a huge success in others areas of the world.
The Khmer Rouge regime, in power from 1975-1979, claimed the lives of up to two million people, one of the worst mass killings of the 20th Century.
Photographs of many of the victims who were taken to Tuol Sleng in Phnom Penh - also known as S-21 - are now on display in the rooms in which they were tortured.
Officials and tour guides told local media they had seen people playing inside the prison grounds.
Bou Meng, 76, one of a handful of people to survive Tuol Sleng, told news agency AFP: "It is a place of suffering. It is not appropriate to play the game there.
"It is an insulting act to the souls of the victims who died there."
He called for the museum to be excluded from the game's maps.
Pokemon Go, which sees players hunting virtual monsters in the real world through phones, finally launched in 15 countries in the region last week.
In Taiwan, officials say more than 1,200 people have been caught playing Pokemon while driving, leading to the National Freeway Bureau asking game creator Niantic "not to place any Pokemon treasures" on highways and rest stops.
Taiwan's railway authorities have also said they would look into removing station and trains from the game.
And Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission said that it had plans to make places such as the Royal Palace grounds, Buddhist temples and hospitals off limits to Pokemon players.
