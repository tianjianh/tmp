[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Zebra-style' crossing for 'unfamiliar' Gloucester space

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new crossing for pedestrians is to be added to a "shared space" in Gloucester that has been the subject of criticism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The system relies on pedestrians and motorists mutually agreeing to give way to each other and was adopted in Southgate Street in May 2011.
Within days, some groups claimed it would only be a matter of time before someone was seriously injured.
Gloucestershire County Council said the system had a good safety record but people remain unclear on how it works.
In September the authority had 265 responses to a consultation about it, with 68% agreeing a pedestrian crossing was needed.
A spokeswoman for the council said: "Traffic surveys show that the shared space has a good safety record with vehicles sticking to a 20mph limit during peak times.
"However, it is understood that people are still unfamiliar with how the space should be used and who has the right of way."
The "zebra-style" crossing is expected to be added before summer 2015.
