No legal action against firm behind Zano mini-drones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No legal action will be taken against a Pembrokeshire firm behind a failed Zano mini-drone project, an official investigation has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pembrokeshire council investigated Torquing Group after complaints were made against the project.
About 12,000 backers lost money after more than Â£2m was invested in the initiative, based in Pembroke Dock.
But the council said there was "not enough evidence to justify a successful criminal prosecution".
Backers lost their money, which was invested through crowd funding, when the firm went into voluntary liquidation in November.
Following complaints, the council's trading standards team launched an investigation relating to the advertising and sale of the Zano drones.
On Thursday, Huw George, cabinet member for environmental and regulatory services, said: "Over the past six months we have carried out a thorough and exhaustive investigation into the Zano project.
"We have concluded that there is not enough evidence to justify a successful criminal prosecution on several grounds - including that there was insufficient proof that the drone was incapable of carrying out the functions advertised at the time of the launch."
