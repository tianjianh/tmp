New Swindon Town manager David Flitcroft says he turned down a job in the United States to take charge of the League Two-bound Wiltshire club.

The 43-year-old has replaced former head coach Luke Williams.
"I'm in America currently," Flitcroft told BBC Wiltshire. "There was an opportunity to come to America to do some work with the American Federation.
"But chairman Lee [Power] talked me out of that to take this opportunity, so I'm grateful for that."
The former Barnsley and Bury boss had been out of work since leaving the Shakers - a side he led to promotion to League One in 2014-15 - in November last year.
Flitcroft's appointment follows Williams' departure in May, having won only two of his final 11 League One matches in charge on the way to relegation.
"I'm absolutely delighted to be boss of a fantastic football club," Flitcroft continued. "It's an opportunity I've been waiting for.
"In the lower leagues, I've got fantastic contacts, I'm going to utilise them. Lee is a winner, I'm a winner and the football team will certainly carry that mantle on."
In May, chairman Power - who had been heavily involved with transfers in the past - confirmed to BBC Wiltshire that the new manager would have 100% responsibility for player recruitment.
Asked if he was happy to have full control over transfers, Flitcroft explained: "That was the delay. When the Swindon Town chairman makes contact with you, you do your research.
"I wanted all that to be right. Recruitment is something I enjoy and embrace. We had a chat a couple of weeks ago and I asked the chairman certain things I needed to know.
"I'll come in and see what's in the academy. I only what to work with people who will work harder than anyone else.
"Every player that's currently contracted to Swindon will get a fair opportunity to show me they've got the required character to get out of the league.
"If they don't, then we move on, and we look for players that certainly want to compete every single day."
Swindon - who finished 22nd in League One in 2016-17 - will be playing in the fourth tier for the first time since 2012 next season.
