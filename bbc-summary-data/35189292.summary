The 35-year-old announced his retirement in September because of injury problems.
Falcons have also signed scrum-half Justin Booth, 21, on a three-month deal from New Zealand side Manawatu Turbos.
Goode and Booth will provide cover for Mike Delany and Ruki Tipuna, who are both injured and not expected to play again until the spring.
Both newcomers may make their debuts in the Premiership against Bath on 2 January.
"We're delighted to welcome Andy and Jamie to Kingston Park, although there is obviously disappointment that they come through injuries to Mike and Ruki," said Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards.
"With those two unavailable to us for the immediate future, the opportunity to bring in additional players of the quality of Andy and Jamie, to supplement what we already have here, was a great opportunity."
Goode, who won 17 England caps, has played 229 games in the Premiership and scored 2,228 points.
In December 2014, he equalled the Premiership record for the most points in a single game with 33 for Wasps.
He moved to London Irish in the summer, but did not play a single game for the club because of persistent injuries, which prompted his retirement.
