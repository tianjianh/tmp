He admitted fives offences under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.
Howard Jones, RSPB investigation officer, said Mr Beaton had shown a "a worrying trend" of targeting rarer species in recent years.
He added: "The conservation impact of these actions cannot be underestimated and the public should be aware of people behaving suspiciously around nest sites during the breeding season."
The eggs will be sent to Natural History Museum.
