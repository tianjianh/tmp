BBC News takes a look at how other famous items of clothing fared when sold at auction.
The white dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch sold for $4.6m (£2.8m) at an auction in Los Angeles.
The dress was part of a collection of film memorabilia collected by actress Debbie Reynolds over four decades.
She had hoped to house them in a museum but the project never came to fruition.
The trademark bowler hat worn by Charlie Chaplin in several films, including The Little Tramp, reached $135,300 (£89,000).
It was sold at the same auction as Marilyn Monroe's dress in 2011.
A leather jacket worn by US singer Michael Jackson in his renowned Thriller video sold at auction in California for $1.8m (£1.1m) in 2011.
Jackson wore the jacket in the 1983 video in a scene with a troupe of zombies who rise from their graves and break into a dance routine.
It was bought by a Texas commodities trader who said he planned to use it to raise money for children's charities.
