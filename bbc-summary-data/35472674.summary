Wales Under-20 have named eight uncapped players to start against Ireland U20 in their Six Nations opener in Dublin on Friday.

Tom Williams has withdrawn through injury, while scrum-half Reuben Morgan-Williams and prop Robert Lewis come in.
Scarlets flanker Tom Phillips leads the side, with coach Jason Strange praising the balance of his squad.
"The side is boosted by the regional experience of some of our key players," he explained.
Strange feels Donnybrook is a venue that will suit Wales' style of play.
"We want to play a fast, attacking style of rugby that will pose questions of the opposition and the 3G pitch at Donnybrook will suit that approach," he said.
"Donnybrook is a traditional destination for Welsh rugby fans on a Friday night during international weekends and we hope a good crowd will turn out to support the boys."
Ireland head coach Nigel Carolan has named a largely inexperienced side at international level with just three players from last year's campaign.
Front-rowers Andrew Porter (Leinster), Adam McBurney (Ulster) and Conan O'Donnell (Connacht) are the survivors from 2015.
