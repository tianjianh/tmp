A giant comic strip has been created to celebrate designs such as Harris Tweed, the Falkirk Wheel and Dundee-based game developer Guerrilla Tea.

The artwork has been unveiled at the waterfront construction site of the V&A Museum of Design Dundee.
Comic illustrator Will Morris and graphic designer David Mackenzie were commissioned to design the 492ft (150m) long strip.
Called Adventures in Design, it tells its story in three sequences.
Tara Wainwright, of V&A Dundee, said: "Comic illustration is such an integral part of Dundee's creative history that we immediately understood the appeal for local audiences.
"Equally we hope this approach will inspire and excite audiences nationally, and around the world.
"It's essential to us that we engage our communities in the story of design. The comic strip provides an unusual and memorable way of starting to explore some of the ideas and themes we'll look at in the new museum."
Lorna Macaulay, chief executive of the Harris Tweed Authority, said her organisation was "honoured" that the Western Isles-made fabric was a feature of the comic strip.
She added: "If this is the level of creativity on the building site, I am deeply excited for what's to come inside the building when its ready."
Steve Dunlop, chief executive of Scottish Canals, which operates the Falkirk Wheel, said: "As the world's only fully-rotating boat lift, the Falkirk Wheel is a towering symbol of the legacy of innovative engineering that can be seen along Scotland's 250-year-old canal network.
"We're delighted that its iconic design has been celebrated by this new comic strip."
Guerrilla Tea's chief creative officer Matt Zanetti said: "Guerilla Tea is very humbled to have our story told in such a creative manner by an institution as prestigious as V&A Dundee."
Construction of the ??45m V&A Dundee museum is under way on the banks of the Tay, with the Kengo Kuma-designed building due to be completed by the end of 2017.
