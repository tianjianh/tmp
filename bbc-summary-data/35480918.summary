Swansea City coach Alan Curtis has praised the deadline day signing of Netherlands midfielder Leroy Fer.

The former Norwich midfielder joined the Swans on loan from QPR hoping to avoid an unwanted record of three successive Premier League relegations.
Former Wales striker Iwan Roberts believes the midfielder "goes missing" when the going gets tough.
But Curtis has lauded the signing, telling BBC Radio Wales: "He'll be a great addition."
Fer's track record since arriving in English football from FC Twente in 2013 gives ex-Norwich forward Roberts cause for concern as Swansea prepare to battle the drop.
Roberts, a fan favourite at Carrow Road where he played from 1997-2004, believes Fer represents a luxury that Swansea simply can't afford.
"He was a big summer signing for Norwich a few years ago, had a great start and looked a good player," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"That was in the first half of the season, when things got tough, he went missing, he was anonymous.
"I don't think he's the kind of player you'd want to be in the trenches with, at Norwich (he seemed) more concerned with staying fully fit and playing in the World Cup, rather than keeping Norwich in the Premier League.
"Had Swansea signed him this time last year, I'd have thought 'that could work' chasing a top half finish and a record points tally.
"But in a battle, in the position they are in, he's not a sitting midfielder, he's one paced, not the quickest, it'll be interesting to see what Swansea are planning to do with him."
That negative view of Fer is not shared by Swansea coach Curtis, who enjoyed a temporary spell in charge of the Swans this season following the sacking of former boss Garry Monk.
The Swans are now three games unbeaten in the Premier League and Curtis believes Fer can further aid their bid to avoid the drop.
"Leroy is a player we remember for scoring a great goal against us," Curtis explained, referring to Fer's long-range strike against the Swans on 1 January, 2015.
"He's a player we remember from Norwich and QPR and he gives us something different in midfield.
"He knows how to score from distance and he'll be a great addition between now and the end of the season. I'm sure of that."
