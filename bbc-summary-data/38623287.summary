Ed Sheeran says he is 'incredibly chuffed' after his two new singles entered the UK singles chart at number one and number two.

The songs went straight to the top, and Ed said "Both tracks mean a huge amount to me so it really is amazing to see them go to the top of the chart together."
The Official Charts Company says that Ed is the first artist in history to take the top two chart positions with brand new songs.
The singer released 'Shape Of You' and 'Castle On The Hill' after a year out of the spotlight, when he stopped using social media so that he could concentrate on his third album.
Well done Ed!
