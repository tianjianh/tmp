Despite being branded as Britain's most disappointing tourist attraction, Dismaland has sold out everyday for five weeks and attracted thousands of people to Weston-super-Mare.
The exhibition at a derelict seafront lido featured work by famous artists including Damien Hirst.
The attraction has proved to be the mysterious artists biggest show yet.
