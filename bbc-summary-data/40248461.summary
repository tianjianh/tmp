Details of a Â£3.6m business investment in Hawick aimed at creating about 55 jobs have been revealed.

The funding was awarded last year in response to a series of employment setbacks in the Borders town.
An "incubator centre" will help businesses in the area to "establish themselves and grow".
The money will also help develop four industrial units on the edge of town and upgrade existing facilities at Tower Mill.
The funding has also secured a commitment from Scottish Borders Council to fund and undertake feasibility studies for regeneration of two further redundant mill buildings to inform potential investors.
Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "Supporting economic growth in the south of Scotland is a priority for this government, creating and protecting jobs and enabling local businesses to flourish.
"The business incubator in the former Armstrong's building will give new and rapidly-developing companies the opportunity to come together and grow.
"The new and upgraded business infrastructure in and around Hawick will encourage entrepreneurs, generate start-ups and ensure that the region can meet all the business needs that expanding companies may have."
Mark Rowley, SBC's executive member for business and economic development, said the investment could have a significant impact.
"These projects will not only provide new job opportunities in Hawick but will hopefully act as a catalyst for further property redevelopment and inward investment in the town in the future," he said.
"Redeveloping the former Armstrong's building will deliver new, small office units suitable for start-up firms and existing businesses in the town centre and will also bring life back to a building which has been empty and derelict for many years."
