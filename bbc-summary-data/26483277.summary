The sketch show, which featured Meera Syal, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir, explored the collision of British and Indian cultures.
Goodness Gracious Me aired on BBC Two from 1998-2001, after starting life on Radio 4 two years earlier.
The show's regular characters included Smeeta Smitten, the Competitive Mothers and Mr Everything Comes From India.
An advertisement for people to feature in the audience of the London filming revealed that the original cast would be back for an episode of the "ground-breaking British Asian sketch show, featuring new characters alongside some favourites from the original series in a wealth of brand new sketches".
Both Bhaskar and Syal went on to star in The Kumars at No 42, with them playing chat show host Sanjeev and her the grandmother Ummi.
Wadia spent five years playing Zainab Masood in EastEnders, before leaving the soap last February.
Mock the Week host Dara O Briain will front another of BBC Two's anniversary celebrations, in the form of a quiz called All About Two.
Also featuring Richard Osman from Pointless, the show is described as "part quiz, part silliness, part discovery and all love".
