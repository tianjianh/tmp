Helen Wilson was struck by the vehicle on Tuesday, just moments after stepping out of her own car, but escaped with a few minor bruises and a rip in her jeans.
Mrs Wilson said: "It's frightening to think about what could have happened but I try to focus on the good side that I'm still here.
"It was a very lucky escape. People keep telling me to buy a lottery ticket."
