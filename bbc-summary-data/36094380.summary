[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspect in the Brussels bombings of 22 March has been charged with involvement in last year's Paris attacks, Belgian prosecutors say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Osama Krayem, a 23-year-old Swedish national, was arrested in Brussels earlier this month.
The Belgian judge responsible for the Paris attacks investigation has charged him with terrorist murder and participating in a terrorist group.
He is suspected of buying the suitcases used to carry the Brussels bombs.
Osama Krayem was also caught on CCTV with metro bomber Khalid el-Bakraoui shortly before he blew himself up.
He is already facing terrorism charges in relation to the Brussels attacks.
The Belgian federal prosecutor said that Osama Krayem was picked up in Ulm in southern Germany by a hire car rented by key Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam and had travelled to Belgium.
"The investigation showed that [Krayem] could be placed in different safe houses used by the terrorist group," the prosecutor said, including a location in Schaerbeek.
Osama Krayem grew up in Malmo in south-west Sweden.
A relative said her nephew "just disappeared" and later phoned his family to say that he had left to join the so-called Islamic State.
His lawyer told reporters last week that Osama Krayem was co-operating with authorities.
In the Brussels attacks in March, three suicide bombers killed 32 people at Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station.
The attacks took place just days after the arrest in Brussels of Salah Abdeslam, who had been on the run for four months.
The Paris attacks of 13 November killed 130 people.
