Lancaster and Furness patients urged to stay away from A&E; 'unless serious'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patients are being urged to stay away from Accident and Emergency (A&E) units at Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital unless they are seriously ill.

There are no beds available at either site due to "a significant surge in demand," University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust said.
It is asking those with minor illnesses to use other healthcare services.
The trust issued similar advice in March following "increased pressure".
In a statement, a trust spokesperson said: "Patients are likely to experience long waiting times, whilst those who need urgent treatment are seen first.
"Please help us make sure our staff are free to treat those most in need... If you do attend, please be patient with staff who are doing their best in difficult circumstances."
