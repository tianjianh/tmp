Bill Cosby: Judge delays wife's deposition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bill Cosby's wife will not have to give evidence on Wednesday in a defamation case filed by seven women accusing the comedian of sexual assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week a judge rejected Camille Cosby's attempts to avoid testifying, after she claimed she was protected by a marital disqualification law.
But on Tuesday, he agreed to a postponement, saying it would be unfair to deny her the right to appeal.
However, if the appeal fails, a hearing should happen soon after, he added.
A lawyer for the women said he expected to eventually be allowed to question Mrs Cosby, who has been married to the comedian for more than 50 years is also his business partner.
Mr Cosby's accusers' legal claim alleges he and his representatives sought to tarnish their reputations after they went public with their claims of sexual misconduct.
The star has filed a counter legal claim, contending the women are "engaged in a campaign to assassinate" his reputation and character.
The 78-year-old is also seeking unspecified monetary damages and said the women inflicted emotional distress.
He has denied the accusations.
Last week, prosecutors in Pennsylvania charged the comedian with an alleged sexual assault in 2004. It is the first time Mr Cosby has been charged with any offence after months of accusations by dozens of women.
He is currently on $1m (Â£675,000) bail.
