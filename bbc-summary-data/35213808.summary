Hundreds of patients are being sent outside their health board areas to receive mental health treatment every year, according to new figures.

Almost 1,500 adults were sent to another area in 2014-15 as an outpatient or day patient.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats, who released the data following a Freedom of Information request, warned there was a "struggle" to cope with demand.
The Scottish government said mental health was an "absolute priority".
The figures also suggested that more than 150 children under 18 were also sent outside their area last year.
Jim Hume, health spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: "Whilst there are sometimes good reasons behind why a patient is sent out of their health board for treatment, it's clear that mental health units across the country are struggling to cope with demand on their services.
"It is welcome to see that the number of under 18-year-olds receiving mental health treatment as inpatients outside their health board of residence dropped last year.
"But there are still far too many young people having to travel away from home for treatment."
He added: "We know that last year there was an increase in the number of adult inpatients sent to other health boards compared to the previous year.
"We know there are no dedicated mental health beds for young people north of Dundee.
"We know that the proportion of NHS spending on mental health has dropped.
"We know units such as the one at Stracathro Hospital for out-of-hours emergency mental health assessments have had to close due to lack of staff.
"What we don't know is when SNP ministers are going to start taking mental health seriously."
Mental Health Minister Jamie Hepburn said: "Last month's budget included an extra £50m for mental health over the next five years - increasing the mental health fund from £100m to £150m to extend capacity, improve access to services and promote innovation and new ways of treating people.
"Demand for services is increasing significantly. The number of people seen by child and adolescent mental health services has risen by 27% in the last year - more than 900 extra patients in the quarter ending September 2015."
He said the government was "investing heavily" in the workforce in response but added: "However, on occasion people will be treated outside their board areas. Care and support is provided in the most appropriate environment, regardless of board boundaries.
"In some cases it can be appropriate for a patient to travel outside their health board area where specialist or urgent care is required.
"Such circumstances are kept to a minimum and always dictated by clinical need and benefit to the patient."
