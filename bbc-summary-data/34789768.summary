Bijan Ebrahimi murder: PCs 'failed to act on victim's complaints'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three police officers and a PCSO failed to act on complaints of a disabled man just two days before he was brutally murdered by a neighbour, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, was killed in a vigilante attack in 2013 after he was falsely accused of being a paedophile.
Bristol Crown Court was told PCs Kevin Duffy, 52, Leanne Winter, 38, Helen Harris, 40, and PCSO Andrew Passmore 55, saw Mr Ebrahimi as "a nuisance".
They each deny a charge of misconduct in public office.
The trial follows an investigation by the police watchdog into his death.
Opening the case for the prosecution, Crispin Aylett QC described the events leading up to the murder.
Mr Ebrahimi called the police on 11 July 2013 to report he had been attacked by his neighbour Lee James, 26, who suspected him of being a paedophile.
James, who later admitted murder, was described at the time by PC Winter to be "foaming at the mouth" and vowed he would "do time to protect his children", the court learned.
Mr Aylett said James was with a crowd who all took his side and "vigilantism was in the air".
Following the episode, Mr Ebrahimi was arrested but James' threats were overlooked, the court heard.
Mr Ebrahimi was released by police the following day, 12 July, and after returning to his home on Capgrave Crescent, Brislington, Bristol, made 12 calls to the police in the hope PC Duffy, the local beat manager, would intervene.
The prosecution claimed the officer regarded Mr Ebrahimi as a "liar and a nuisance" and the defendants were "not interested" in his complaints.
The court heard PC Duffy asked PCSO Passmore to patrol the area and Mr Passmore claimed to have spent an hour in the area.
"The truth is that he can only have driven up and down the road," Mr Aylett said.
"Had something been done, Lee James would have at least known the police were keeping an eye.
"This was a toxic situation that required proactive policing," he added.
"Instead we allege that these individuals failed Mr Ebrahimi. It's not just incompetence - we suggest they disliked Mr Ebrahimi."
Two days later James attacked Mr Ebrahimi outside his flat then, with help, set fire to his body.
He pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence. Accomplice Steven Morley was sentenced to four years in prison for assisting an offender.
Earlier, PC Duffy told the court Mr Ebrahimi's complaints about various neighbours were always met with counter-allegations.
After Mr Ebrahimi's death, the police watchdog interviewed PC Duffy. He told them his "experience" of dealing with Mr Ebrahimi "taught" him to "evaluate all information" and "seek other accounts" before filing a report.
Prosecuting, Mr Aylett added that PC Duffy's "starting point" was to "disbelieve" Mr Ebrahimi unless it was corroborated.
The trial continues.
