Seven hundred and seven students at Wellington College lay down to represent the number of the school's former pupils who died in the war.
Head boy Harry Randall described the two-minute tribute as "such a moving experience".
The school is hosting a conference on public schools and World War I.
Many Wellington College pupils went to join the fighting in the trenches in France straight after leaving school.
Harry said: "At the start of the First World War, people our age were preparing to go to war - and that's a scary thought. They'd be sent off in charge of a squad of 30 men.
"We lay down for two minutes, but for the men who gave their lives and paid the ultimate sacrifice - they never got up."
