Ethan Ampadu: Wales senior call-up 'won't surprise many' - Exeter City boss Tisdale

Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale says it is only a matter of time before 16-year-old defender Ethan Ampadu is given his first senior Wales call-up.

Ampadu, who is still at school, is one of 11 players on a standby list for Wales' World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on Friday.
Wales already have Liverpool forward Ben Woodburn, 17, in their squad.
"When he eventually does get included in a Welsh senior team, there won't be too many surprised," Tisdale said.
"I think he's in their picture going forward so if it's not this time, it'll be another time.
"He's got a big future ahead of him, I don't think he's a one-hit wonder - I don't think he's going to be in [the squad] one minute, out the next."
Ampadu made his professional debut in August and has represented Wales up to Under-19 level, but is also eligible to play for England.
He was named Wales' young player of the year in November, but will only be drafted into Chris Coleman's squad if there are injuries among the 23 players initially called up.
"I think the Welsh FA have appreciated, and decided early, that he's going to be a very important player for them over the coming years and I think this is the first of many situations," Tisdale added to BBC Radio Devon.
"I'm philosophical about it all - I'm very happy for him and he wants to be involved with Wales."
