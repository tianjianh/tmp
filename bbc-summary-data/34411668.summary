A 33-year-old man was targeted as he collected a child from St Helen's Primary, Bishopbriggs, on 24 September.
Another man shot him with a hand gun in Dornoch Place at about 15:10 before making off towards Ronaldsay Drive.
A burnt out stolen Volkswagen Golf was found nearby. Police hope Thursday's operation will provide new information.
The gunman is described as being in his mid-to-late 40s, about 5ft 10in to 6ft tall, with a heavy build.
He was seen wearing a high-visibility reflective yellow jacket with the hood pulled up and was armed with a silver hand gun.
Det Supt Stephen Grant said: "By re-visiting the scene, we hope to jog people's memories before, during and after the incident.
"Perhaps you saw the Volkswagen Golf in another street or saw something suspicious which you didn't think was before.
"We suspect this car has been involved with the shooting incident and I would ask anyone to get in touch who may know something."
The burnt-out grey Volkswagen Golf - registration FR12 PYB - was found shortly after the shooting in nearby Wood Lane. It was reported stolen in March.
Police said a major incident room has been set up at Kirkintilloch Police Office and detectives were following a number of lines of inquiry.
They also reiterated that this was an isolated incident and everything possible was being done to reassure the local community.
Ch Insp Craig Smith, the local area commander said, "We have increased our policing presence in the local community to reassure the public and again, I would encourage people to approach my officers with any concerns.
"My campus police officer, who is well known to pupils will be in the local primary school this week to engage with pupils and provide reassurance.
"We are working very closely with East Dunbartonshire Council and the school to provide support to pupils and their families in order that the children can get back to their daily school routine as quickly as possible."
He added: "This has clearly impacted on the local community but please be assured that my officers alongside the team of dedicated detectives are working round-the-clock to find who is responsible."
