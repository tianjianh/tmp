Are shrunken homes the answer?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An average earner in Cambridge will have to part with more than 40% of their salary if they want to call even a basic studio flat their home. But the situation here is far from unusual. Could smaller homes be the answer?

Alison Smith's home is only a little larger than a pair of prison cells.
For the time being, she says, her £510-a-month rented en-suite room (which has a shared kitchen) in a former hotel in Cambridge offers enough space.
"But I wouldn't want to go all that much smaller than this," she said. "I did see some smaller rooms than this one and I would struggle to live in that.
The white-walled former hotel is now home to about 20 residents following conversion by developer and letting agent Terry Lucking.
"Space is running out," says Mr Lucking. "Prices are high. Never mind buying a house, renting a room is going to cost you at least £500 a month.
"I passionately believe that we should be providing smaller accommodation - not necessarily because that's what people want to live in, but from the reality of the situation.
"The only way for many people to afford to live in Cambridge is to live in a smaller unit, but these smaller units shouldn't be built in a way where they are unattractive."
Building rooms such as Ms Smith's could soon be outlawed in Cambridge under new "minimum internal space" standards proposed by the city council.
Faye Colgate is 22 and works in Cambridge. She wants to live in the city.
"After my car and my car loan and my mobile phone I'm probably left with £700 a month"
If she paid the average £667 monthly rent for a studio, she would be left with just £33 each month for everything else.
"I honestly didn't think it would be any more than £400 just to rent with a friend a 2 bed flat. I think I was a little unrealistic."
Under those proposals, a studio apartment would have to be at least 398 sq ft (37 sq m) - more than twice the size of Ms Smith's studio, which is 173 sq ft (16.1 sq m).
The council said it wanted to prevent battery farm living becoming the norm.
Kevin Blencowe, of Cambridge City Council, said: "There are concerns coming through about various aspects of housing provision and planning issues in the city and one of them has been in recent years the prevalence of small rooms within housing developments."
He said some developers had turned to "cramming as many rooms into a development as is possible".
"We have decided as councillors, as responsible representative that actually we want to put down a minimum standard that future developments have to meet."
But what will that mean for those struggling to find a place to live?
Mr Lucking said: "A studio no smaller than 37 sq m - that's double the size I think single people can easily live in.
"And it'll mean double the rent."
Dr Mike Page, head of research and consultancy at the University of Hertfordshire's psychology department, shares the council's unease at the idea of "crammed" development.
But he does not believe minimum living standards are the answer either.
Dr Page, who designed the Cube micro and carbon-neutral home, believes the success of a small living space depends as much on design as dimension.
"Space standards are a bit of a cleft stick and it is always the people who live in big houses who complain about things being too small.
"We didn't want to make something that people would be forced into, but something people would opt into."
The second version of the Cube home is 9ft x 12ft x 9ft (3m x 4m x 3m). Another single-storey version has movable walls which means residents can extend the floorspace of the room they are in at that time.
"It is an example of what you can do with fun and simple space design," he said.
Although talks are under way with an undisclosed London council for Cube accommodation for about 150 people, to date not a single Cube has been sold.
The reason, according to Dr Page, is that prospective buyers need planning permission land to put it on.
But the interest, he says, is there.
"Young people don't really need a lot of mortgage baggage or space they won't use," says Dr Page.
"I used to have my record collection lined up along the wall. Young people today have their entire music collection on their phone. And with a laptop, they can pretty much do everything."
Small, he says, can be not only affordable, but cool.
