The electricity supply to Loch Ossian Youth Hostel has been improved following its connection to a nearby hydro electric scheme.
As well as bringing to an end years of cold showers, this means the building now has a fridge and electric heaters.
The hostel can only be reached by travelling by train to Corrour Station and then walking for about 20 minutes.
Corrour - the highest mainline railway station in the UK - is well-known for featuring in 1996's hit film Trainspotting.
Scenes for the forthcoming Trainspotting 2 were also filmed at Corrour.
The youth hostel is popular with hillwalkers.
The hostel's manager, Jan Robinson, said: "We are really excited to be connected to hydro power generated locally on the Corrour Estate.
"We have been able to upgrade our facilities, offering our guests much more comfort, especially hot showers after a long day on the hill."
