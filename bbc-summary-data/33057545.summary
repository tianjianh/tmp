Liverpool still need proven striker - John Aldridge

Liverpool need to sign a "finished article" striker this summer as well as buying Burnley's Danny Ings, according to former Reds forward John Aldridge.

Ings, 22, is out of contract at Turf Moor and will move to Anfield on 1 July, subject to a medical.
"It's a no-brainer. He looks a threat and the lad's got great potential," Aldridge, a Liverpool title winner in 1988, told BBC Radio 5 live.
But he added: "We need a really big marquee signing."
England Under-21 international Ings scored 11 goals in 35 Premier League appearances for relegated Burnley in 2014-15.
With 21-year-old Belgium forward Divock Origi due at Anfield after spending the campaign on loan in France at Lille, and England's Daniel Sturridge expected back in September after a series of injuries, Aldridge believes his former club are moving in the right direction.
But the scorer of 63 goals for the Reds between 1987-89 insists Liverpool need another experienced striker after the side managed just 52 Premier League goals this season, compared with 101 in 2013-14.
"It's not happened for Mario Balotelli or Fabio Borini - Rickie Lambert is not getting any younger," said Aldridge.
"They have been very conservative in their dealings and they still have a lot of money in the account ready to spend.
"You need a striker who guarantees 20 goals a season and they don't come cheap."
