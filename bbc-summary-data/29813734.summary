Just some of the reactions to 24-year-old Shoshana Roberts as she was filmed walking around New York city for 10 hours.
And since the video was posted, she's suffered rape threats and abuse online.
Wearing a plain T-shirt, jeans and trainers, she was "catcalled" 108 times, and it was all caught on a camera hidden on her male friend's backpack.
Watch the video on the Hollaback blog.
One man repeatedly asked: "You don't wanna talk? Because I'm ugly?".
Some followed her for several minutes.
The footage was captured in August by Rob Biss, who was inspired by his girlfriend after she got similar unwanted attention in the street.
The film's now being used by the campaign group Hollaback! which has highlighted the impact of what it calls "intimidating street harassment".
The organisation says that includes everything from verbal harassment to stalking, groping, indecent exposure and assault in public places.
In British law, harassment includes "repeated attempts at unwanted communications" and "contact" with a victim that's "likely to cause distress or fear".
Shoshana said: '"This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?"
The Hollaback! movement's been set up in 26 countries and 79 cities, including Birmingham, London and Edinburgh.
The organisation estimates between 70% and 90% of women are harassed while walking down the street at some point in their lives.
It claims it can discriminate in many ways including sexism, racism and homophobia.
