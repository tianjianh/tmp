Dawid Malan: England batsman 'knew' form would 'turn around' after making 65

England batsman Dawid Malan said he "knew" his form "was going to turn around", after scoring his maiden Test half-century against West Indies.

The left-hander made 65 as England declared on 514-8, which featured 243 from Alastair Cook, on day two of the inaugural day-night Test at Edgbaston.
Malan scored only 35 runs in four innings in his debut series against South Africa this summer.
"I didn't look like scoring a run against South Africa," he said.
"It was nice to hit a few in the middle today. I feel a bit more composed at the crease."
West Indies were 44-1 in reply - trailing by 470 - when rain ended play in the final session.
The match is the first of three in the series, England's last Test assignment before they travel to Australia for this winter's Ashes.
Middlesex batsman Malan hit 10 fours in his 186-ball innings before edging off-spinner Roston Chase to slip on the stroke of lunch.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: "He will be delighted, but 65 isn't enough to guarantee his place on the plane to Australia.
"Today was a perfect opportunity for him to get a big score. There were runs there for the taking."
The Ashes start in Brisbane on 23 November, but Malan said he is not "thinking that far ahead".
"You never know when your last game is going to be," he added.
Malan added 162 for the fourth wicket with opener Cook, whose dismissal prompted England's declaration before tea.
"Alastair didn't look like he strayed once from the first over of the game to when he got out," Malan said.
"To watch how a master goes at his work, watching him compile his runs, shows you what you need to do to be successful at this level."
