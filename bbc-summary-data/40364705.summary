Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is known to be interested in the 34-year-old, whom he knows from their time together at Barcelona.
Speaking to Italian media on Wednesday, Juventus chief executive Beppe Marotta said that Alves had "expressed a desire to try a new experience".
Marotta said Juventus hoped to reach a "mutual termination" with Alves.
He wished the Brazilian good luck for the future.
Alves has only been with Juve for a year, winning Serie A and reaching the Champions League final.
Prior to that, he had spent eight seasons at Barcelona. The first four of those were under Guardiola, a period when the pair shared in two Champions League triumphs and won La Liga on three occasions.
City do not have an experienced right-back after releasing out-of-contract duo Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna.
Guardiola has been linked with Tottenham's Kyle Walker as well as Alves, who he bought for Barcelona from Sevilla for Â£23m in 2008.
