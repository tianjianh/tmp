A man who stabbed his ex-wife and her new partner in a Luton office, has been convicted of attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fatmir Mula, 39, who lives in London, knifed ex-partner Elena Melnyk in her armpit, Luton Crown Court heard.
Mula, a Kosovo national, stabbed her boyfriend Nicholas White, who suffered a lacerated liver and a deflated lung.
He went to the office last July at a centre used to facilitate contact between families after relationships have broken down, the jury was told.
Mula, who lives in Newham, denied attempted murder and possessing an offensive weapon, but the jury found him guilty.
The court heard Ms Melnyk was waiting in an office at the centre when she was given the message her ex-husband wanted to speak to her.
He appeared in the doorway and the centre manager ushered them into a kitchen area where Mula suddenly produced a kitchen knife from his rucksack.
After stabbing his ex-wife in the armpit, he stabbed Mr White twice in the chest and once in the neck, injuring him so badly he had to be airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, the court heard.
Mula ran away from the centre by climbing out of a window, but was arrested the following day.
He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.
