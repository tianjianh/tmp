Police lead search for missing hillwalker in Tyndrum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police and mountain rescue teams are searching for a hillwalker from East Dunbartonshire who disappeared in the Stirlingshire hills on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Bennett was last seen in the Green Welly Stop at Tyndrum just before midday on Saturday, and was thought to be walking in hills in the area.
The 43-year-old has not made contact with friends or family since.
He is described as being 5ft 8in tall, with short brown hair and blue eyes, and was carrying a rucksack with him.
Ch Insp Lynn Raycliff appealed for other hillwalkers and members of the public look out for Mr Bennett, who is from Bishopbriggs and works as a software developer at Durham University.
She said: "Daniel is an experienced hillwalker and is always properly equipped, however the length of time he has been away without making contact with anyone is becoming increasingly concerning.
"The support we get from the public in response to our missing person appeals is invaluable and we'd appreciate anyone in the Tyndrum area keeping a lookout for him. However, and I can't stress this enough, please do not stray from the safety of your pre-planned route.
"We are working very closely with the mountain rescue team, who are professionally trained and equipped for such searches, and are currently carrying out various lines of inquiry to help us trace him."
