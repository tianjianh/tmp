Young Sports Personality 2016: Amy Tinkler Q&A

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gymnast Amy won a bronze medal for her floor routine at the Rio 2016 Olympics in August, becoming the first female British gymnast to medal in the event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amy, 17 was the youngest member of Team GB at the 2016 Olympics, and only the second British woman to win an individual artistic gymnastics medal, after Beth Tweddle's bronze at London 2012.
She has also competed at the World Championships but withdrew from the European Championships earlier this year in order to concentrate on her A-Levels.
Here, Amy answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
What or who made you get into sport?
I first got into gymnastics when I was two - my Mum took me along to baby gym sessions!
Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
As I am still at Sixth Form, training from day to day varies.
A normal day training is about six hours split over the day, with in that we do a few hours conditioning, stretching and working in skills and routines.
What keeps you motivated to train?
I think my motivation to train is the fact that I love competing, I love performing in front of big crowds and that really is a huge part of sport.
What do you eat in the day to keep you fuelled for training?
Generally, I start the day with a bowl of porridge to help maintain my energy throughout the morning.
For lunch I generally have a small number of carbs such as pasta or rice, some protein and some vegetables or salad.  And for dinner I would eat no carbs - protein and vegetables or salad only.
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
I think the biggest myth would be if you are talented it's easy. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard!

What is your favourite subject at school and why?
For me PE is my favourite subject. I really enjoy being able to relate it to my gymnastics training and learning about the history of sport.
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
I wouldn't say I have a certain ritual before a competition - I like to keep everything the same as what I'd do at home. I eat the same foods, sleep at the same time, etc.
But I wouldn't really say I do anything in particular before a competition.
What kind of support network do you think you need in the sports industry?
I have a big support network around me which I think would be good if it was available to all athletes - a Nutritionist and a Psychologist, Physios, Doctors and it goes without saying my coaches, family and friends are extremely important in my network.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career
I think my golden moment so far is definitely winning the bronze medal on floor at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
What advice would you give to other young people wanting to get into competitive sports?
I would say just go for it!
And enjoy it!
