English Football League cancels talks over 100-team plan for five divisions

Plans for a shake-up of English football to create 100 teams in five divisions have been cancelled after talks between the English Football League and the Football Association broke down.

The EFL said in May it wanted to create an extra division and have 20 teams in each from 2019-20.
The plans required the English football authorities to find additional weekends for league football.
The FA says it is no longer viable.
The EFL, which currently has 72 teams - 24 each in the Championship, League One and League Two - said the move would tackle fixture congestion and boost the finances of its members.
The rescheduling would have involved moving FA Cup fixtures into midweek slots, but the FA has informed the EFL it is no longer prepared to consider such a move following a new international broadcasting deal - reported to be worth Â£820m.
"If the weekend slots are not available, then there is simply no way we can meet the financial conditions as outlined at the very outset," said EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey.
"The stance the FA has adopted has brought the discussions to a premature end, before fully understanding what the financial outcome from the creation of a new distribution model could be. "
Harvey said the EFL would still welcome a change in the FA's position.
"We are, of course, open to re-engaging in what is a hugely important debate that was designed to help shape the future of football in this country," he added.
The EFL believed the move, which Harvey said had been backed in principle by the Premier League and the FA, would help:
For the proposal to be approved they would have needed the backing of 65 EFL clubs (90%) at next year's annual general meeting.
Currently, the bottom two teams in League Two are relegated from the EFL to the National League, but the plans proposed scrapping those relegation spots in the 2018-19 season.
Six other clubs - in addition to the two clubs already promoted from the National League - would have then joined the EFL.
Scottish Premiership sides Celtic and Rangers have long been linked with moving into the English pyramid, and such a move had not been ruled out by Harvey.
EFL clubs would have seen their number of league matches reduced from 46 to 38 per season.
Despite the potential of losing revenue from three fewer home matches, Harvey had asked the 72 clubs to take a "broader view of English football".
He also said long midweek trips across the country for fans would "in the main" disappear, but that Saturdays would become "more special and more important".
Exeter City chairman Julian Tagg: "People were very uncomfortable with it, and as a result were watching very carefully and trying to understand the nuances and reasoning behind it.
"Many fans across the country didn't like the idea of change and I think that was the same with our club. I think there'll be a little bit of a sigh of relief.
"As you go down the pyramid the more you're reliant on your gate receipts, unless you have some kind of philanthropic chairman who's going to throw money in, which we don't."
