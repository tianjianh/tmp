The Ulster Hospital and Antrim Area Hospitals were also under pressure.
The BBC understands that at about 20:00 GMT, 100 people were waiting to be seen at the Ulster's ED in Dundonald.
A spokesperson for the Belfast Health Trust said EDs across Northern Ireland had a high number of patients and that less urgent cases would have to wait.
On Tuesday  morning, the trust said the situation was better.
"Thanks to the hard work of staff it is an improving picture this morning," the statement said.
"While some patients are still in the department waiting to be seen, most are moving through the system to receive the appropriate care and treatment."
Earlier this week, Health Minister Simon Hamilton pledged Â£30m in funding to tackle hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland.
