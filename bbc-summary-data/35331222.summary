The home side threatened early on, with Sam Johnson forced to tip Giuseppe Sole's free-kick over the bar.
Woking's Chris Arthur was sent off for a two-footed tackle, but the hosts took the lead through Bruno Andrade's superb solo run and calm finish.
Walker responded before half-time with a curled free-kick into the top corner to claim a point for his team.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"The referee has made a decision [to send off Chris Arthur] and it was in front of the opposition dugout.
"They were very persuasive and surrounded the referee to put him under pressure.
"The lads have done well to play for 70 minutes with ten players and show that kind of character, commitment and discipline to restrict them to limited opportunities.
"I can't be disappointed with the result but it was a frustrating afternoon."
