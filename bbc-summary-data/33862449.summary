[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral of a seven-year-old boy who died on a building site near Barnsley has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conley Thompson died after entering a vertical pipe on the construction site near his home in Worsbrough on 26 July.
His body was found the following day after a search involving 50 police officers. His death is not being treated as suspicious.
Hundreds of mourners lined the streets around St Thomas and St James' Church, Worsbrough to pay their respects.
They were asked to wear bright colours and superhero t-shirts in Conley's memory.
The youngster's coffin arrived at the church in a white horse drawn carriage and a dove was released at the end of the service.
An appeal launched to help pay for the funeral raised Â£2,890.
A little boy arrived at church in a white coffin, emblazoned with superheroes. A large green fist of the Hulk on the coffin stood out, its impact never more strong as it was today.
Carrying the coffin was a white carriage drawn by two white horses - on any other day it would have seemed bizarre to see Spider Man sitting next to the driver, but today it was perfect.
The superhero theme of the funeral was adopted by many of the hundreds of people who turned out to line the streets.
His family said they have to somehow come to terms with his loss. Unthinkable for anyone, and given his age, all the more laden will their hearts be.
Conley was reported missing about four hours after leaving his home in Underwood Avenue.
South Yorkshire Police is continuing to piece together his last known movements.
His family said: "To describe Conley you would have to say he was cheeky, mischievous and loud, but also loving and caring, with a heart of gold.
"As with most boys his age, Conley lived life large and loud, with a zest for adventure and curiosity."
