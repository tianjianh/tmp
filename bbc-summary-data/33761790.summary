[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Community Health Council (CHC) wants to hear about people's experiences of in-patient services.
It comes after a report into care at the Tawel Fan ward of Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, said patients were "kept like animals".
The first public sessions are at Cefni Hospital on Anglesey on Tuesday.
Chief officer for the North Wales CHC, Geoff Ryall-Harvey, said: "One of our roles is to keep an eye on the health services in north Wales. We hope that the results of this survey will provide us with a clear picture of people's experiences."
