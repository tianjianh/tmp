A choir-master is spending four days locked in a hotel room listening to nothing but Rick Astley's 1980s hit, Never Gonna Give You Up.

Jack White, 23, will hear the song, which famously became the focus of an internet prank, 2,500 times on repeat.
He started at midday, and is set to finish 75 hours later at 15:00 BST on Monday.
"I'm not really much of a Rick Astley fan and I definitely won't be after Monday," said Mr White, of Southampton.
Mr White, who has vowed not to desert his task, has taken on the charity challenge in support of his nephew, who has type 1 diabetes.
The rules require the self-confessed chatty man to say goodbye to speaking and humming for the duration of the task.
He is living on a diet of porridge, rice and water and will not wash during the ordeal, which is being streamed live on YouTube.
Supporters of Mr White selected Astley's trademark hit via an online poll of the "three most annoying songs in the world" - the other contenders were Let It Go from the film Frozen and viral sensation Trololo by Eduard Khil.
The singer's 1987 opus was part the "Rickrolling" phenomenon, where millions of people were duped into clicking on a web link directing them to a video of the song.
Before starting the challenge, Mr White told BBC Radio 5 Live that the people who voted for Rick Astley were "quite cruel really".
He added: "All I get is basically rice and porridge and then water. The idea behind not washing is the fact that it'd give me something to look forward to, something to break up the day - have a bath, relax. There is no enjoyment. I've basically got to stare at the wall for four days."
Mr White, who is staying in a room at Highfield House hotel, is hoping to raise Â£2,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
He said: "I've worked really closely with a psychotherapist who donated her time and it has helped me to know how to be still, because I don't know how to do that - I'm always doing something and always talking."
"Rick Astley is probably not going to be my best friend by Monday afternoon," he added.
