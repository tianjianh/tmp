[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aabid Ali, from Wrexham, was charged with the offences under Section One and Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Mr Ali, originally from Manchester, will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Friday.
The 48-year-old, previously known as Darren Glennon, was arrested on 10 November.
He was detained by officers working as part of a pre-planned operation between Wales Extremism Counter Terrorism Unit (WECTU), North Wales Police and West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU).
Police said there was no threat to public safety.
North Wales Police Ass Ch Cons Richard Debicki said: "Extremism and radicalisation is something that we continue to be constantly vigilant about.
"We also work hard to ensure that efforts to victimise or commit hate crime against Muslim communities across North Wales are met with a no tolerance approach. It is crucially important that this work continues.
"Nobody is better placed to detect something that is out of place in their communities than the people living in them. To effectively combat the terrorism threat the police, businesses, government and the general public need to work together."
