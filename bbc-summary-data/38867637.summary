More than 50 firefighters tackled the blaze in Beaumont Street, Southwick, in Sunderland, on Friday.
The roof collapsed into the street and roads around the building were cordoned off as a safety precaution. It is not believed anyone was inside.
A man and a woman are in custody and helping with inquiries, Northumbria Police said.
