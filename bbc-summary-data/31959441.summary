Two men deny murder of off-duty Liverpool PC Neil Doyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have denied murdering an off-duty police constable who was killed during a night out with colleagues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Neil Doyle, 36, died following an attack in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of 19 December.
Christopher Spendlove, 30, and Andrew Taylor, 28, pleaded not guilty to his murder when they appeared at Liverpool Crown Court earlier.
Both men were remanded in custody and told they will face trial at the same court on 22 June.
PC Doyle and two other off-duty officers were attacked near the Aloha Club, in Colquitt Street.
Spendlove, of Brandearth Hey, Stockbridge Village, and Taylor, of Cherry Tree Road, Huyton, Merseyside, also deny causing grievous bodily harm with intent to PC Doyle's colleagues.
A post-mortem examination revealed the constable died from bleeding around the brain.
His colleagues were treated in hospital for facial injuries.
A third man, Timmy Donovan, 30, originally from Huyton, was arrested in Germany in January in connection with the murder.
The court heard extradition proceedings against him have begun and he is expected to be brought to the UK within the next 10 days.
