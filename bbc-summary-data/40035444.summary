[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old was Harriers' top scorer last season, scoring 15 goals for the National League North side.
Joining League One side Town will be Gnahoua's first move to an EFL club.
"Hopefully I can get the chance to prove I can play at this level," he said. "It's going to be hard work and a faster tempo than before."
