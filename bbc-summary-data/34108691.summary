Hosted by BBC Wales and Sport Wales, The Wales Sport Awards recognise the achievements of elite athletes and those involved at grassroots level.
Members of the public can get involved by nominating their local sporting heroes from 1 September.
The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Cardiff on 7 December, alongside the BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year prize.
BBC Wales director, Rhodri Talfan Davies, said: "The Wales Sport Awards event is an opportunity to look back on the year and recognise the dedicated individuals on all levels who have contributed to make Wales a sporting nation that punches well above its weight."
Sport Wales chairwoman, Prof Laura McAllister, added: "Sport is part of the fabric of Welsh life and recognising the impact of people who often go unnoticed is vital if we are to cement our importance at the heart of communities in Wales."
The categories up for public nomination until 25 September include:
Also awarded at the ceremony is the BBC Get Inspired Unsung Hero prize with the Welsh representative going on to compete against winners from the English regions, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Nominations for this category close on 22 October and the overall winner will be announced at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year programme in Belfast on 20 December.
More details on the categories and how to nominate and vote are available at the Wales Sports Awards website.
