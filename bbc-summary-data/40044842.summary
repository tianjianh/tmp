Senegal hopes take a knock with US loss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senegal's hopes of qualifying for the second round of the Fifa Under-20 World Cup took a knock on Thursday after a 1-0 defeat to the United States.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 34th-minute strike by Joshua Sargent settled this Group F encounter in Incheon.
The 17-year-old's third goal of the tournament sent the Americans top of the group on four points with the Senegalese in second place.
Having won their opening game against Saudi Arabia, Senegal's destiny is still very much in their own hands.
Victory in their final group fixture against Ecuador will send them through. Even a draw might be enough depending on results elsewhere.
In the group's other game, Saudi Arabia beat Ecuador 2-1 to take all three point and move into third place.
