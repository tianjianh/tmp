Jersey Reds secured their eighth consecutive win with a hard-fought victory over Rotherham at St Peter.

The Titans were 6-0 ahead at half-time thanks to the boot of fly-half Lee Millar.
But Jersey forwards Simon Kerrod and Nick Haining both went over to claim tries in the second half.
The Reds climb to fifth in the Championship table, two points outside the play-offs while Rotherham remain one point off bottom.
Jersey had gone into the game having not lost since New Year's Day, but struggled to find much fluidity in the first period, playing into a strong wind.
Prop Kerrod, who is set to join Worcester next season, scored the opening try from close range soon after the break to put the islanders ahead for the first time.
Replacement kicker Caolan Ryan edged Rotherham in front again before Callum Sheedy's penalty from near halfway gave the hosts a 10-9 advantage.
Back-row Haining stole the ball at a line-out deep in Rotherham's half and a few phases later he powered over by the posts for Jersey's second try.
The visitors showed some late fight but could not salvage even a losing bonus-point from their trip to the Channel Islands.
Reds head coach Harvey Biljon told BBC Radio Jersey:
"I think Rotherham came with a game plan, they pushed the boundaries around the set piece and the breakdown and gave it everything and I think it was a great result for us to weather the storm and come through.
"There were two or three moments in the first half that we should have capitalised on and come away with a few more points so we need to go and look at why we didn't take those points.
"The second half was just about controlling the pitch, controlling the territory - we had the wind at our backs and it was just about making sure pressure would eventually turn into points."
