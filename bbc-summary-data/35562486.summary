England women: South Africa level one-day series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa beat England in a one-day international for the first time since 2004 to level the series at 1-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts' five-wicket win in Centurion sets up a decider on Sunday.
Heather Knight top-scored with 61 and captain Charlotte Edwards made 45, but Sarah Taylor was out for a duck in her 100th ODI as England scored 262-9.
In reply, Laura Wolfvaardt (55) and Trisha Chetty (66) put on 113 and Lizelle Lee (69) and Marizanne Kapp (44) 112 as the hosts sealed victory.
England now need to win the final game to emerge with a victory from Mark Robinson's first series as head coach.
Knight and Edwards rebuilt England's innings with a stand of 78 after South Africa took three early wickets, including Taylor for a second-ball duck.
Edwards was dismissed by leg-spinner Sune Luus, who took a tough caught-and-bowled chance.
Knight smashed the first six of the innings after reaching her half-century but was soon out for 61.
England were still struggling to reach a par score but Danielle Wyatt, who hit a six in a 27-ball 40, and Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole added 94 from the last 10 overs.
Star bowler Brunt, who went into the match on 99 ODI wickets, was able to bowl just five overs because of a back spasm and the Proteas took advantage as 16-year-old Wolfvaardt and wicketkeeper Chetty both made half-centuries.
Knight eventually made the breakthrough, having Wolfvaardt caught by substitute fielder Kate Cross, and when Hazell removed Chetty and Mignon du Preez with successive balls England fancied their chances.
But Kapp and Lee tucked into some average bowling in Brunt's absence, and although both fell late on, Dane van Niekerk got the hosts over the line with seven balls to spare.
Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special:
"South African cricket is really on the up. They've had success in Twenty20 but to do it in 50-over cricket as well is different. This is a massive result for them because England have the better resources.
"England were outplayed in all facets. South Africa started and finished the game with a bang and looked the better team.
"England couldn't take wickets. They bowled tidily but there was no potency which is a concern for the side.
"They want to impress because they have a new coach but for the bowling to get taken to the cleaners, I think this will really hurt England."
All three matches count towards the ICC Women's Championship which determines qualification for the 2017 World Cup.
