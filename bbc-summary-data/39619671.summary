Inverness Castle Viewpoint allows for 360 degree views of the city and many of the famous landmarks in the surrounding area.
Highland Council, which owns the tower, said it was the first phase in transforming Inverness Castle into a major tourist attraction.
The 175-year-old castle is currently the base for the city's courts service, which is to be moved to a new building.
Tickets should be booked in advance through Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.
Highland Council, Inverness Common Good Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have all contributed to the cost of the North Tower project, which includes new access, a shop and a stairway to the roof and viewing platform.
Highland Council's director of development, Stuart Black, said more than a million visitors came to the city each year.
"Scenery and castles are the two main things they come for," he said.
"So it's really been important to open the castle.
"This is just the first phase, with the courts moving out in two years time we'll get the whole castle.
"We're going to turn it into a spectacular visitor attraction."
