Labour doubles its MEPs in London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has doubled its number of MEPs in London after winning half of the region's eight seats in the European election.

It topped the poll with 806,959 votes, while the Conservatives won two seats with 495,639 votes.
UKIP and the Green Party each retained one seat with 371,133 and 196,419 votes respectively.
The Liberal Democrats, who came fifth overall, lost their MEP in London, with the Tories also down one.
Before the results were out and the sitting Lib Dem MEP Baroness Sarah Ludford lost her seat, she seemed to sense the party may not do well.
She said: "It's nobody's fault, I don't think. I am certainly not blaming anybody, I am not going around asking for anybody's head.

So, for the first time in 15 years, the Lib Dems have no London representative at the European Parliament.
Baroness Ludford bowing out at City Hall last night capped a miserable couple of days for the party here in the capital, with Londoners turning against the party in both the town hall and European elections.
The scale of their demise is hard to exaggerate. The Lib Dems now have no local councillors on 18 of London's 32 boroughs.
On half a dozen more, they have just one councillor. In total across the capital, they lost half of their local representatives and now have just over 120 councillors.
They run just one London council, Sutton.
This of course, on the back of their disastrous mayoral election campaign in 2012, when their candidate Brian Paddick polled less than 5% of the vote and lost his deposit.
Coalition it seems, has not served the Lib Dems well when it comes to getting votes in the capital.
If that's bad enough news now, there will be several Lib Dem MPs looking nervously at the results ahead of next year's general election.
International Development Minister Lynne Featherstone will have noted that the Lib Dems lost 14 councillors in Haringey, Justice Minister Simon Hughes saw a dozen go from his local authority Southwark, and former Education Minister Sarah Teather (who is standing down next year) saw the party down to just one councillor in Brent.
Energy Secretary Ed Davey will no doubt ponder the fact that the Lib Dems lost control of Kingston, in his backyard.
The capital's Lib Dems won't have long to reflect on the past few days - they will have to start preparing for equally tough battles ahead.
"I am proud of the campaign we fought, I am proud of Nick Clegg taking on Nigel Farage and his divisive fear-mongering, whipping up prejudiced attitudes, I am proud that we have fought a pro-European campaign."
Later she added: "I think it's a great shame that Europe's premier city does not have an MEP now from the pro-European party the Liberal Democrats."
Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said: "Deeply disappointed, for me and the party, but particularly for people like Sarah Ludford, who has been a tower of strength in the European Parliament, highly regarded, taken a particular interest in human rights, and represented the people of London in a wholly effective and well-judged way."
Labour candidates Claude Moraes, Mary Honeyball, Lucy Anderson and Seb Dance all took seats.
Mr Moraes said Labour's performance was an "extraordinary result" which "bucked" the national trend.
He said: "It's our best result in London in the European elections since the PR system began.
"Labour is generally a pro-European party but sees London's future as an internationally outward-looking city, at ease with itself and at ease with the kind of issues UKIP's scaring everyone about... but also bread and butter issues that we were not afraid to talk about on the doorstep, like the cost of living."
They will be joined by Charles Tannock and Dr Syed Kamall for the Conservatives, Gerard Batten for UKIP and Jean Lambert for the Green party.
After his win Mr Batten said: "In London my only regret is that we didn't get our second candidate elected, Paul Oakley, but we did double our share of the vote and in a number of boroughs I believe we either came second or first, in one at least. That's been a fantastic achievement."
Dr Kamall said: "Over the next few years we will continue as Conservative MEPs to stand up for London, its financial sector, its creative industries, its wonderful diversity.
"In Britain we have a long-term plan to fix the economic mess that we inherited and in Europe we will continue to build the coalitions across parties... to make sure we deliver the reform that we need."
Prof Tony Travers, the director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics said: "There is some evidence from opinion polls that Londoners have a different view, more optimistic and more positive about the EU than the country as a whole.
"In some polls, interestingly, London and Scotland have a similar view about Europe and it is more positive than the other parts of the UK.
"It's the proximity to Europe on one hand and the particular make up of London's population I think [which] makes it more positive about Europe and less likely to vote UKIP."
Seats in the European Parliament are allocated according to the D'Hondt system, a type of proportional representation.
