Witnesses described hearing an "enormous bang" as it collapsed on to 10 acetylene cylinders at the dockside at about 09:00 BST.
A firefighter suffered minor injuries while assessing the scene.
A 200m exclusion zone was set up over fears the cylinders could explode after the collapse, which was initially treated as a major incident. The cordon was lifted at about 13:00.
There were no other injuries.
Sarah Lucy, who lives in Cliff Road, Falmouth, said she was woken up by an "almighty crashing and rumbling sound".
"Immediately the air raid siren started and then there were loads of sirens," she added.

The Royal Navy Lookout Twitter account, an unofficial local account, said the crane collapsed with an "enormous bang".
Cornwall Fire Service said its response was in line with how it would plan for this type of incident.
Assistant chief fire officer Phil Martin said: "Incidents involving acetylene cylinders require a well-managed response and the cordon is put in place to ensure the safety of members of the public.
"I am pleased to report that the firefighter who was injured suffered only minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution. We do of course wish him a speedy recovery."
A&P Group, which owns the docks, said a full health and safety investigation would take place.
A statement from A&P said: "No-one was injured in the incident, however, all personnel have been temporarily evacuated from the docks whilst an assessment of the area is made.
"Personnel will return to work as soon as possible."
