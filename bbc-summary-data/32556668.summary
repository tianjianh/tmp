Resorts World Birmingham: Behind the scenes of the build

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Resorts World Birmingham - a behemoth housing 17 bars and restaurants, 50 shops, an Imax cinema, a casino, spa and luxury hotel - is entering the final stages of construction.

It is the project of Malaysian conglomerate the Genting Group, which owns and runs more than 40 casinos in the UK.
Due to open "towards the middle to end of summer", the seven-floor 538,000 sq ft (50,000 sq m) building cost Â£150m to build, will take 1,200 staff to run, and will be able to accommodate at least 12,000 people at any one time.
Roughly based on the shape of a cruise ship, the resort is the first of its type in the UK, according to operations manager Barry Clemo, in that visitors will not have to leave the building.
"In this country people don't understand what a resort like this is. Visitors will be able to come here, shop, drink Champagne, go to the cinema or casino and if they want, stay the night."
Built on the NEC site, it is next to the newly-named Genting Arena - formerly the LG Arena.
The cavernous interior has double-height ceilings, which take the seven floors of the building to the height of a 12-storey one, Mr Clemo said.
Mr Clemo said the resort was aimed at people "too young to sit at home watching telly, and too old to push through the crowds in the city centre.
"I envisage it to be the sort of place where parents have a babysitter arranged and want to have a night out. Most of our clientele will be within an hour, or hour-and-a-half, radius."
Mr Clemo said: "Everything is here, next to each other. It's not like if you go into the city centre, and have to get from A to B.
"You may want to go to a restaurant and then a bar and the hassle of getting from one place to another sometimes means you just don't bother with the bar and you go home - but then feel like you've missed out.
"But here, you can tailor your own experience, go to the World Bar, or the New York Lounge or the sports bar. And you don't need to leave the building."
