He is possibly the last surviving actor in India who plays female characters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chapal Bhadhuri was the "leading lady" for decades in jatra - a three-centuries-old travelling theatre tradition hugely popular in the eastern state of Bengal.
He began his career with a leading jatra group in Kolkata (Calcutta) in 1958 on a salary of 75 rupees a month
"It was the usual practice [in those days] when females rarely stepped into theatre or jatra and male performers would enact female characters too," he told an interviewer once.
"With time I got used to it and I also realised that mentally and psychologically, I was more woman than man."
Bhadhuri's life and career has inspired a slew of films, including a 44-minute documentary, which, according to director Naveen Kishore, is about a "man who is wonderfully talented, but slightly out of sync with the times".
The roles began drying up after women arrived on the stage in the late 1960s.
Bhaduri, 77, has seen his best days behind him, but he still soldiers on, doing an occasional female role.
