[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Craig Gordon is determined that Celtic will not just return to the Champions League next season, but become a major threat in the competition.

The Scottish champions' tournament ended with an encouraging draw at Manchester City.
"We've been a work in progress this season but I think you can see an improvement there," Gordon said.
"We've done well since the manager's come in, he's changed quite a few things that can make us better."
Gordon, playing in his maiden Champions League campaign at the age of 33 this season, believes the side have now set a standard they must uphold if they manage to negotiate the three qualifying rounds next summer.
The Scotland keeper also sounded an ominous warning to the rest of Scottish football as their focus now turns solely to the domestic game in which they are unbeaten.
"The last two away performances (against Borussia Monchengladbach and City), it's two good draws," Gordon told BBC Scotland.
"Hopefully we can take that forward and try and give it an even better go next year.
"We have to keep the standards high as we've performed well here and in Germany and you have to perform to your very best to get anything away from home.
"We've managed to do that in those two. We've come across a way of playing that enables us to do well away from home.
"This is where you want to play, the highest level of club football.
"I've enjoyed playing and trying to play the way we want to play and I think we'll get even better over the next six months.

"It really is a team ethic we have. We work together to do the best for the team and that's the reason we've come away with the draws that we have and hopefully we'll stick together and turn those into wins."
Gordon's team-mate Patrick Roberts - who is on loan from Manchester City - admits his opening goal against his parent club was a special moment for him personally.
"That was the plan and it went quite well," he said. "Of course I enjoyed it, it's not every day you score in the Champions League against a team like that.
"It was very pleasing, I had lots of family at the game so it was good.
"That's why I came to Celtic, to play in games like this, the opportunity to play in the Champions League, that was the main goal.
"The manager has been good, he talks to me every day and just wants the best for me."
