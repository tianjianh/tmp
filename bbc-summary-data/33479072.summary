A blaze ripped through the building and destroyed the roof on 14 April.
Three boys, all aged 17, and a 15-year-old girl have been released on bail and are due to appear at Halton Youth Court on 29 July.
No further action will take place against two boys and a girl, all aged 17, who were also arrested in April, Cheshire Police said.
At its height, 70 firefighters tackled the fire at the premises on Wilson Patten Street.
No-one was injured in the blaze at the former nightclub, which closed in 2010.
Mr Smiths was a regular setting for the ITV Granada show The Hit Man and Her, which was presented by Pete Waterman and Michaela Strachan between 1988 and 1992.
