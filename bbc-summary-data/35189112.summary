Tim Brown from Lagan Search and Rescue is providing cover over the Christmas break onboard the Topaz Responder.
He will be working alongside volunteer rescue swimmers from the Emergency Response Rescue Corps of Malta.
The vessel's crew is searching for people making the treacherous trip by sea to Europe.
The Belfast man said he was out on routine patrol when the rescue operation began.
"We were in communication with other craft involved in rescues and one was the Swedish coastguard and liaising with them we brought on 18 males on board," he said.
"Their boat had taken on a lot of water and basically they were very wet and cold.
"We've got a lot of medical capacity on board so we took them on board to look after them."
He said conditions in the Aegean Sea were very different to those in Belfast.
"I guess the whole surroundings. You have to get to know the area as well," he said.
"Generally it's a lot colder this time of year over here, but not as cold as the Lagan.
In total 59 migrants were rescued during the operation.
"There were 18 men who got on on the first occasion and later we rescued another 41, including woman and children," Mr Brown said.
"Some of them were students who are studying abroad and they were having to escape.
"One of the guys said 'this sea is dangerous but not as dangerous as Iraq or Syria or the places we have come from'.
"They were very relieved just to come on board and just so thankful for our help."
He explained their role in assisting migrants.
"Our duty is just to rescue them from the sea and then we bring them to the authorities," he said.
"There'll be a process they will go through and they'll be transported and dealt with accordingly.
Tim joined the boat on 20 December and will remain on board until 4 January.
It meant he was spent the festive period away from his family.
"To be honest Christmas day was very different on board because usually there's a big anticipation and celebration, but basically it was just another day of duty on board," he said.
"Our Filipino chef put on a very good lunch. He put on two turkeys and a lot of other international cuisine which I had never tried before.
"It was really nice to have the multi-national crew coming and having a great lunch together."
