Victor Valdes: Man Utd keeper joins Standard Liege on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes has signed for Belgian side Standard Liege on loan until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Valdes signed an 18-month contract with the Premier League club a year ago.
However, the former Barcelona and Spain keeper, 34, has appeared just twice for Louis van Gaal's team.
He was left out of the club's pre-season American tour with the Dutchman claiming Valdes had refused to play in a reserve game.
A three-time Champions League winner with Barca, Valdes was also part of the Spain squads that lifted the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 trophies.
He has not trained with United's first team since his fall out with Van Gaal.
After a proposed move to Besiktas fell through in August, Valdes' agent indicated the player would move on in January.
