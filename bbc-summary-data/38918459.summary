[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Wrong blood' death nurse given suspended sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse whose patient died after she gave him the wrong type of blood has been given a suspended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lea Ledesma made a series of mistakes which led to Ali Huseyin, 76, being given type AB blood rather than type O at London Heart Hospital.
The 49-year-old confused his details with that of another patient with a similar name, then tried to blame a colleague for her mistake.
She was given an 18-month suspended sentence at Southwark Crown Court.
Ledesma was convicted of unlawful manslaughter by gross negligence in an earlier trial.
Mr Huseyin had been in her care after a successful heart bypass operation in May 2014.
The court heard the nurse, who had worked at the hospital since 2001, got his details confused with that of another patient called Hussain while checking computer records.
It was one of the errors which led to Ledesma choosing the wrong blood from a vending-style machine. Mr Huseyin died following a transfusion.
She initially tried to pass off the error as a colleague's mistake and only admitted to being distracted and flustered while checking the patient's details when pressed further.
Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said:  "It's still a mystery to me as to how and why you came to behave in the way that you did, and you remain certain that the details of the other Mr Hussain were shown on the deceased's monitor and I cannot exclude that as a contributory factor."
Ledesma, of Stevenage in Hertfordshire, wept and hugged her family following sentencing.
They formed a prayer circle in the courtroom and could be heard praising God and thanking Jesus.
