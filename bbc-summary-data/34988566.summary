First Minister Carwyn Jones has criticised David Cameron for branding MPs opposed to air strikes in Syria as terrorist sympathisers.

Speaking to The Wales Report on the BBC, Mr Jones said such statements did not "add to the debate" on how to tackle Islamic State jihadists.
"Regardless of how MPs vote, their views should respected and they shouldn't be abused," he said.
Air strikes on targets in Syria were approved by a large majority of 174.
It followed an all-day debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Mr Jones told the programme: "I'm not against airstrikes in principle but if you want to bring peace to Syria then you've got to have a plan.
"How do you bring peace to Syria? Which ground forces do you support in order to do that? And if you do that, then what air strikes do you need?
"None of that's been done.
"At the end of the day, my greatest fear is that we'll end up with air strikes and the whole thing will be forgotten about.
"Nobody will do the work that's needed to bring peace and security to the people of Syria."
