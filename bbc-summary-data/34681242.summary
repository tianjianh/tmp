[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public consultation is due to take place over a planned new Â£11.8m link road which is intended to tackle congestion in Greater Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wigan Council wants to build the road between central Wigan, the M6 and the M58.
The 1.4mile (2.2 km) stretch would connect the M58/M6 junction at Orrell through to Billinge Road and on to Pemberton Business Park.
A drop-in consultation session will take place on Tuesday in Pemberton.
A new section of road would also be constructed near to the eastern end of Leopold Street through to Billinge Road.
Following the consultation, a planning application will be submitted in which views can also be put forward.
Councillor David Molyneux said: "It's crucial for the growth of the local economy and for all of us in the borough that we have a transport infrastructure that is fit for the future and works for us all in the years and decades ahead."
