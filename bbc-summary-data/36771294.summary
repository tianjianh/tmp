Swedish furniture retailer Ikea has extended a recall of its popular Malm chests of drawers to China following pressure from regulators.

Some 1.7 million drawers made from 1999 to 2016 will be recalled over safety concerns, China's regulator said.
The decision comes after six children were crushed to death in North America when the chests toppled on them.
Ikea recalled 36 million dressers in the US and Canada last month and has since stopped selling the drawers.
China's official Xinhua news agency criticised Ikea last week for showing "arrogance" after it initially refused to extend the recall.
"The potential danger to household safety from furniture toppling over is a serious problem for the entire homewares industry," Ikea said on its website.
"Ikea promises to serve as a model in responding to this challenge."
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission found the Malm drawers can topple over and crush children if not anchored to the wall with screws.
Ikea has warned customers to ensure the drawers are properly fixed to walls and last year launched an awareness campaign.
However, the firm refused to extend the product recall to China, the UK or the EU, saying the products met local industry standards.
Following an online backlash in China over the issue, Ikea offered free home installation and an optional refund.
China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, the safety watchdog, said Ikea had changed its mind after a meeting with them.
