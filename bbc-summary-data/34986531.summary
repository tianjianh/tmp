Sammy Wilson says Nama inquiry 'Mickey Mouse exercise'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former finance minister Sammy Wilson has described an assembly committee's inquiry into the sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property loans as "a Mickey Mouse exercise".

The finance committee is investigating the £1.2bn sale of assets owned by Nama to US investment firm Cerberus.
On Thursday, Mr Wilson accused the inquiry of being "incompetent and biased".
He said the inquiry had not separated out fiction and prejudice from fact.
This would be seen as a reference to evidence the committee had previously taken from the loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.
Mr Wilson said he had told the committee in August that he would be happy to give evidence to it.
"Had I known subsequently how this committee was going and had I not made the promise, I doubt very much if I would have come along to grace the kind of Mickey Mouse exercise that has been undertaken with credibility," he said.
Mr Wilson added that Northern Ireland had gotten a very good deal out of the Nama sale.
Defending the committee's work, its chairman Daithí McKay of Sinn Féin said: "We have uncovered a great deal of evidence that has been useful."
Nama - the National Asset Management Agency - is the Republic of Ireland's state-owned so-called 'bad bank'.

The eventual deal to sell its Northern Ireland portfolio has since been the subject of claims involving fixer payments.
The finance committee has heard an allegation that five individuals were to benefit from the sale, including one politician, First Minister Peter Robinson.
He has denied the claim as "scurrilous and unfounded."
