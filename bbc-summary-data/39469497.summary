Houston Open: Sung Kang leads Rickie Fowler by three in Texas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Korea's Sung Kang holds a three-shot lead over America's Rickie Fowler going into the final round of the Houston Open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sung, the world number 202, carded a one-under-par 71 to end the third round at 17 under.
Fowler started the day seven shots behind Sung, but his five-under-par 67 brought him back into contention.
Englishmen Justin Rose and Andy Sullivan both finished on five under, 12 shots off the lead.
Fowler and Sullivan carded the joint-second lowest scores of the day with their five-under rounds, this was despite the American dropping three shots in the final two holes.
Sung has missed the cut in five of his nine PGA Tour events in 2017, but a win in Houston would see him claim his first PGA Tour victory and also secure him a place in next week's Masters at Augusta.
