Philae comet professor: I'd compare this with the joy of having our son

Most couples say that the birth of their first child is the happiest day of their life.

Not for Professor Monica Grady from the Open University.
On Wednesday after the European Space Agency's (ESA) Philae probe landed on a comet hurtling through space, she was filmed jumping for joy, cheering and shouting "fantastic" over and over again.
Her reaction went viral and she says it is now the best day of her life.
"We have one son. Sorry Jack, I would compare this with the joy of actually having our son. It was just one of those sorts of moments," she told Newsbeat.
"We heard that the Philae lander bounced and it went a kilometre up in the air and I think I was almost a kilometre up in the air when I was bouncing with joy when we heard the first announcement."

The mission to land a probe on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, was launched in 2004.
It should help us learn about the origins of the Solar System.
"We're going to analyse the comet," says Monica.
"We're going to sniff it. We're going to melt some of it. We're going to burn some of it.
"The biggest thing we'll learn is what comets have to do with life on earth. One of the most important things that space missions do is bring to people's attention how exciting it is, what a challenge it is."
The robot probe is the size of a washing machine.
It was dropped from the Rosetta satellite and spent seven hours travelling down to the comet.
"If one person is inspired to go into science because of seeing what Rosetta has been doing, seeing the excitement of Philae, then it's worthwhile," says Monica.
The comet is about 300 million miles away (500 million km), far beyond Mars and is racing through space at about 34,000 mph (55,000 km/h).
