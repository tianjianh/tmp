Kyriakos Papadopoulos had headed the visitors into a deserved half-time lead as Barca struggled to find fluidity without the injured Lionel Messi.
But Sergi Roberto turned in a rebound with just 10 minutes left before former Liverpool striker Suarez smashed home.
The victory sees Luis Enrique's side leapfrog their German opponents to go top of Group E.
However, midfielder Andres Iniesta suffered a hamstring injury and was withdrawn after 60 minutes.
"These are thorns in our side we have to shake off," said Enrique of Barca's latest injury.
"It was a tough night - the second game without our best player and our second win. My players deserve a huge amount of credit."
With Messi out injured Barca boss Luis Enrique gave a start to 20-year-old forward Sandro alongside Suarez and Neymar.
Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez forced Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen into a good save as the away side started the stronger.
Papadopoulos put Leverkusen ahead from a Hakan Calhanoglu corner, beating Ter Stegen from a tight angle at the near post.
But Barca rallied late on as Roberto scored his first European goal before Suarez powered the ball high past Bernd Leno.
Elsewhere, BATE Borisov of Belarus pulled off a surprise home victory over Serie A club Roma.
Two goals from full-back Filip Mladenovic and one from Ihar Stasevich had put the home side 3-0 up after just 30 minutes.
Wojciech Szczesny, the Arsenal goalkeeper on loan at Roma, seemed to lose sight of Mladenovic's first, a speculative effort.
Former Gunners striker Gervinho got one back for Roma before substitute Vasilis Torosidis gave the away side hope of a draw.
But the Belarusians hung on for a win that sees them climb to third in Group E, level on points with second-placed Leverkusen.
