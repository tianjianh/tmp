Slovakia midfielder Filip Kiss believes nothing less than a win over Scotland can keep his country's hopes of World Cup qualification alive.

Slovakia recorded a second successive 1-0 defeat as they lost in Slovenia, leaving them pointless in Group F.
The former Ross County player was an unused substitute in Ljubljana and admits the team could now struggle to reach Russia 2018.
"We have to beat Scotland now, 100%," he told BBC Scotland.
"Otherwise it will be really difficult for us to make second place.
"The two results we've had have made the group very difficult for us. We've lost six points from our first two games which isn't a good start.
"If we're to have any chance of qualifying we must get three points against Scotland and that's what we'll be aiming for.
"We'll have to produce our maximum to do it but that's what we need now. We've lost the first two games 1-0 - tight games and we lost both by late goals. But now we need to win to stay in the group.
"We want to have something to play for until the end of the qualifiers. That means winning against Scotland. Realistically, nothing else will do."
Kiss admitted Scotland's inability to beat Lithuania at home had come as an unexpected bonus for them.
"Hopefully that will turn out to be a good result for us," he added.
"If they had won in Glasgow, as everyone expected them to, we would have been six points behind them and that's a lot to turn around.
"It means that Tuesday is a massive game. They'll come aiming to win and open up a gap between them and us so it's going to be a massive match."
Kiss, now playing in Norway for Haugesund, believes the return of the Slovakian captain Martin Skrtel - suspended against Slovenia - will give them a lift against Scotland.
And he admits he would relish the opportunity to add to his nine caps against the country he called home for 18 months.
"Of course I would love to play some part against Scotland," he added.
"I was about to go on on Saturday then when we conceded the goal the coach decided to make a different change. So if I get the chance against Scotland I will be ready. It would be special for me."
