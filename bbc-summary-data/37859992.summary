The Black Stars captain is not expected to recover in time from the knock he picked up while training with his UAE club, Al Ahli on Tuesday.
The 30-year-old is Ghana's all-time top scorer with 48 goals but has had a rough time with injuries recently.
Black Stars coach Avram Grant was hoping to have Gyan back for the must-win game against the Pharaohs.
The Israeli coach has called up Andy Yiadom from English Championship side Barnsley. Yiadom has been in terrific form for the Reds this season.
Egypt will host the Black Stars at Alexandria's Borg El-Arab Stadium.
Ghana were held to a goalless draw by visiting Uganda in their opening Group E World Cup qualifier in October while Egypt's 2-1 win away in Congo Brazzaville leaves them top of the table.
Uganda will host Congo on 12 November in Kampala - only the group winners will qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
