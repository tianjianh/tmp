More than 2,000 people have signed up to take part in a mass nude gathering art event being staged in Hull for its UK City of Culture year in 2017.

Internationally-renowned artist Spencer Tunick is photographing participants on 9 July, with the resulting work to be unveiled next year.
The Feren's Art Gallery announced the Sea Of Hull project on Wednesday.
It said the public response had been "absolutely overwhelming, far surpassing our expectations".
Participants are to be covered in cosmetic body make-up, before assembling to form the multiple colours of the sea and create abstract shapes for the camera.
Kirsten Simister, curator of art at Feren's, said: "The people of Hull have truly embraced the opportunity to be part of this bold project, which has put the city under the national and international spotlight in the most fantastic way.
"The number of participants registering is amazing and we're absolutely confident there will be enough people for Spencer Tunick to create whatever he envisions for his art installation."
Organisers are still encouraging people, aged 18 and over, to strip off and become part of the work.
New York-based Tunick has created more than 90 similar human installations worldwide, including at the Sydney Opera House, Place des Arts in Montreal, Mexico City and Munich in Germany.
His work in the UK has used places including Gateshead and Folkestone as backdrops.
The artist is to also create a second installation on 10 July inviting a select group of participants to take part in another event in North Lincolnshire.
