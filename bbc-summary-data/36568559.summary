Victory in the top-of-the-table clash gave More the lead on goal difference but they have four games in hand.
Oban Camanachd compounded Glenurquhart's relegation miseries 2-0 at Mossfield and stayed third.
Kyles Athletic overwhelmed Lovat 5-0 to move above them into fourth while a late surge from Kingussie saw them defeat Lochaber 4-2.
Skye came from behind against hosts Glasgow Mid Argyll for a 2-1 success at Yoker which earned a Camanachd Cup quarter-final tie at Newtonmore.
Goals from Conor Jones and Evan Menzies put Newtonmore 2-0 up after the first quarter but Keith MacRae soon brought the score back to 2-1. In the second half, Norman Campbell won back the two-goal gap before MacRae's second made a game of it again for the last quarter-hour.
Lorn Dickie and Daniel MacVicar both scored against Glenurquhart in the first half to put Oban Camanachd behind Shiel only on goal difference, but with three games in hand. This leaves Glen even more exposed in the second relegation place.
The game at Tighnabruich was all over by half-time when a Sandy MacKenzie double and goals from Innes MacDonald, Gordon Whyte and Robbie MacLeod gave Kyles a 5-0 lead which Lovat were unable to reduce in the second half.
Savio Genini got Kingussie's opener at Spean Bridge but Kevin Ferguson and Ben Delaney made it 2-1 Lochaber at the interval. However in the last 16 minutes, Genini completed his hat-trick with goals on either side of one from James Hutchison, which sent the points to Badenoch.
In the Camanachd Cup replay, Euan Ferguson got the breakthrough for Mid Argyll in the opening minute of the second half but Jordan Murchison equalised and Will Cowie won the tie for Skye.
Balliemore Cup holders Beauly were cruising at 4-1 up after 23 minutes at home to Kilmallie in their semi-final but then suffered a spectacular collapse.
Kilmallie ran riot in the second half and hat-tricks from Liam MacDonald and Duncan Rodger forged an 8-4 victory. In the final, on 16 July, Kilmallie will meet Caberfeidh, who beat Strathglass 3-1.
After well over a season, Ballachulish gained their first ever National Division victory with a 4-1 home success over Bute, which included a goal in each half from John MacDonald.
