A businessman in eastern Canada is launching an Uber-like snow plough business - Plow Me Out.

Sean Griffith, of New Brunswick province, is connecting customers with a dozen snow plough operators, who can click on his site to accept a job.
Canada's Atlantic provinces see as much as 322cm (127in) in the average winter.
Mr Griffith, who is launching the service in Halifax, Moncton and other eastern cities in January, says he plans to expand across the country.
"You set your alarm for 4am because you know it's going to take you two hours to shovel 30cm of snow before you can get your car out," he told the BBC.
"And then you have to go to work - tired."
Mr Griffith says he got the idea for Plow Me Out last year, when the winter in Atlantic provinces was particularly severe.
The average price for ploughing is between $30-45 (Â£20-30).
An American app, called PlowMe, offers a similar service in Massachusetts.
