[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mother and father from King's Lynn, Norfolk, were questioned in March 2014 over the care of their 11-year-old son.
Norfolk Police said intervention at this level was "very rare" and the couple had been released from bail.
At the time of the arrests, the boy was 5ft 1in (1.56m) and 15 stone (95kg) with a body mass index (BMI) of 41.9.
Children with a BMI score of 40 or above are among the most overweight in the country.
"The child's welfare is of paramount importance and our priority has always been - and remains - the safety and protection of the child," the police said.
The arrests had been based on criteria set out by the Norfolk Safeguarding Children Board, he said.
These include the child's weight increasing disproportionately to age and the parents failing to take action.
"Following detailed inquiries and Crown Prosecution Service advice criminal proceedings are now closed," the spokesman added.
The safeguarding policy outlines the requirement for childhood obesity to be managed by parents and carers with support from health organisations and children's social care.
The family nor the child were identified and the investigation of the 50-year-old man and 45-year-old woman was in accordance with the Children's Act 1933, police said.
