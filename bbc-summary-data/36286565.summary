Gareth Delve: Ospreys release Wales number eight a year early

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys have released Wales international number eight Gareth Delve from his contract a year early.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delve, 33, joined from NEC Green Rockets in Japan on a two-year deal in 2015.
But he made just two appearances for Ospreys, with his last - as a replacement against Treviso - in October 2015.
Cardiff-born Delve won 11 caps for Wales while playing for Bath and Gloucester.
He became the first Welshman to sign for a Super Rugby side in 2010, joining Melbourne Rebels where he became captain.
