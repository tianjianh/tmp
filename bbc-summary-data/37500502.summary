Bristol scrum-half Martin Roberts will be out for 12 weeks after dislocating his elbow, says the Premiership club's director of rugby Andy Robinson.

The 30-year-old former Ospreys, Bath and Northampton Saints player has made two appearances for Bristol in the top flight this season.
"It is really unfortunate for Martin," Robinson told BBC Radio Bristol.
Roberts could miss as many as 12 Premiership, European Challenge Cup and domestic cup games.
Meanwhile, Robinson said the club are still waiting for news on how long versatile back Gavin Henson will be sidelined for.
Henson, 34, has not played since having to be withdrawn during Bristol's opening game of the season on 3 September, following a collision with Harlequins' Joe Marler.
"Gavin has got a bruising of the bone and it's very difficult to treat," Robinson explained. "So we're waiting still.
"It's frustration for everybody involved, but most importantly for him, because he wants to get out there and show everybody what he can do.
"When he's unable to do that because of injury, it's disappointing for him."
