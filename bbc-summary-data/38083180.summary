Alberto Cavasin: Leyton Orient sack manager after seven weeks in charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Leyton Orient have sacked manager Alberto Cavasin following a run of eight defeats in 10 games in all competitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 60-year-old Italian was only appointed by the O's, who are 22nd in the table, on 2 October.
Cavasin was the eighth man to take charge of Orient since the club were bought by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti in the summer of 2014.
Assistant boss Andy Edwards has been put in charge to the end of the season.
Edwards, 45, had a two-game spell as caretaker manager earlier this season before Cavasin took over and he will be assisted by Danny Webb.
Cavasin had never managed in England before joining the O's and his appointment came five years after he left Sampdoria following their relegation from Italy's Serie A in 2011.
Orient were 17th in League Two when Cavasin was appointed but, after five defeats in seven league games, they are only above the relegation zone on goal difference.
After losing 1-0 to Exeter on Tuesday, the east London side became just the second club in Football League history to lose nine of their first 10 home league games in a season, matching Newport's run in 1970-71.
Cavasin also oversaw a 6-0 defeat at Sheffield United in the first round of the FA Cup, and two losses in the EFL Trophy.
Andy Edwards is the ninth different manager to take charge of Leyton Orient since Becchetti took over the club:
