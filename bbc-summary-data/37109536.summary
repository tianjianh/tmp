260 jobs Cross Hands retail park plans approved at third try

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a new retail park in Carmarthenshire have been approved at the third time of asking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conygar wants to develop land at Cross Hands West with a variety of shops, a food store, pub, restaurant and 521-space car park.
But its application has been deferred twice this year by Carmarthenshire council's planning committee.
Conygar said the retail park will create 260 full-time jobs and more than 100 jobs during construction.
The application was first deferred after a last-minute intervention by the Co-op, and then again last month after Conygar challenged an application by Leekes to build a shop alongside its Cross Hands store.
The Cross Hands West site was previously earmarked for a Sainsbury's store, but the supermarket pulled out and sold the land to Conygar in 2015.
