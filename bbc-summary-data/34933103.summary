On 13 November, 130 people died in attacks across Paris, with three suicide bombs outside the Stade de France where France took on Germany.
French league games went ahead the following weekend without away fans.
The Interior Ministry has extended the ban due to a "lack of police forces available" during the ongoing state of emergency and upcoming climate summit.
A French League (LFP) statement said no away fans would be permitted at the 15th round of Ligue 1 matches and 16th round of Ligue 2 matches this weekend.
It added another order would be issued soon applying the same provisions to all top football games in the country until at least the final round of Europa League group-stage matches on 10 December.
Monaco have said they will prevent fans of Belgian side Anderlecht from attending their Europa League meeting on Thursday.
The United Nations climate summit is being held in the French capital from 30 November until 11 December.
