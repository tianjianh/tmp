Prior to his maiden tournament win, US-based Knox was 85th in the standings.
Making his WGC debut as seventh reserve, the 30-year-old from Inverness finished 20 under par in China to lead the field by two shots.
Marc Warren (66) and Richie Ramsay (92) are the other Scots in the current top 100.
Stephen Gallacher, who started the year ranked 34th, is down to 107th place following a miserable season that has included nine missed cuts.
Knox can now look forward to a Masters debut in 2016 and entry into the game's most important events.
Meanwhile, Jordan Spieth is back in the number one spot after finishing in a tie for seventh in Shanghai, with Jason Day second and Rory McIlroy third.
