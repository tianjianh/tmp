Danny Cipriani and Mike Catt argument confirmed by RFU

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England coach Mike Catt and fly-half Danny Cipriani had a training-ground incident before the World Cup but the Rugby Football Union denies there was almost a mutiny among players.

The clash happened hours after Cipriani was told he would not be in the 31-man squad for the tournament, but before the selection was announced in August.
The Sun broke the story and said senior players had to step in after Catt threatened Sale's Cipriani, 27.
But the RFU said this was untrue.
Other reports suggested 2003 World Cup winner Catt, 44, told Cipriani he would "end his England career".
An RFU spokesman said: "Danny and Mike were involved in a robust conversation on the training pitch following a misunderstanding around a training drill instruction.
"Both shook hands afterwards and the incident played no bearing on selection."
Stuart Lancaster's men are already eliminated from the tournament after losing to Wales and Australia, and face Uruguay in their final Pool A game on Saturday.
