Prince George joins royal balcony tradition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It has long been a tradition for royal children to join the rest of the family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace following the pomp and pageantry of Trooping the Colour.

Now, Prince George has fulfilled this royal rite of passage on the Queen's official birthday.
Here are some pictures of other first appearances for royal youngsters on the famous balcony.
Princess Elizabeth was just 14 months old when she appeared for the first time on the palace balcony in June 1927.
She appeared with her parents, then known as the Duke and Duchess of York, and her grandparents, George V and Queen Mary, following Trooping the Colour.
In 1937, when her father was crowned King George VI, Princess Elizabeth and her younger sister Princess Margaret took to the balcony to wave at the crowds with their parents.
The Duke of Cambridge - Prince William - made his debut on the balcony for Trooping the Colour when he was about to turn two in 1984.
His son, Prince George, wore the same outfit his father wore more than 20 years previous.
In 1985, Prince Harry made his first appearance at the Queen's Birthday parade when he was only nine months old.
Harry was carried by his parents while William, now nearly three, stood much taller above the edge of the balcony.
When Harry was three, he was photographed sticking his tongue out as he was carried by his mother after the 1988 parade.
Some youngsters have found the noise of the crowds and the flypast too much to bear.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's bridesmaid Grace van Cutsem put her hands over her ears and frowned during her balcony appearance on the royal wedding day in 2011.
