In an emergency statement to MSP at Holyrood, the SNP MSP detailed his plan to combat passenger dissatisfaction.
He said: "Passengers want to see action now to strengthen the reliability of the rail infrastructure across the network.
"Sixteen million of investment is being brought forward, over and above what we have planned to already upgrade key junctions, track and signalling equipment."
