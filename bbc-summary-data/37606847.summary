A giant pumpkin which set a new record for the UK's heaviest to be grown outdoors is to be turned into a boat.

Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) expert Matthew Oliver grew the gourd from a seed which cost Â£1,250 and came from the current world record holder.
His pumpkin's weight was confirmed as 95st (605kg) at the weekend.
"Unfortunately giant pumpkins are not known for their culinary properties," a spokeswoman for the RHS said. "So we will be making this one into a boat."
Horticulturalist Mr Oliver, from Essex, said he was "over the moon" at the weekend when his fruit's credentials were confirmed at the Autumn Pumpkin Festival in Southampton.
The spokeswoman for the RHS said the pumpkin would be on display at Hyde Hall, near South Woodham Ferrers, where Mr Oliver works, between 22 and 30 October before its floating credentials were tested.
"We will cut a lid off, hollow it out, pop an external motor on it and send Matthew Oliver into the middle of the lake at the RHS Garden Hyde Hall," she said.
The parent pumpkin was grown in Switzerland in 2014 by Beni Meier, who still holds the world record for the heaviest gourd, at 166st (1,054kg).
Mr Oliver's pumpkin seed, which was bought by Ipswich-based seed company Thompson and Morgan, was planted in mid April. He said it took six days to germinate before becoming a "vigorous grower".
