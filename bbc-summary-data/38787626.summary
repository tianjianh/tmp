Police said the burglary happened between 04:00 GMT and 07:00 at Bedford Care Home on Battersby Street, Leigh, Wigan.
The victim was treated for minor injuries "but her injuries could have been much worse", police said.
CCTV footage of the suspect riding a bicycle near the scene has been released by police.
Three rooms were broken into during the burglary.
Ch Supt Stuart Ellison, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP): "How someone could sink so low as to break into a care home is beyond me.
"We are keen to identify the man in the CCTV... seen riding a bicycle and carrying a suitcase that we believe was stolen from one of the rooms."
He urged any witnesses to contact GMP.
Police patrols have been stepped up in the area.
