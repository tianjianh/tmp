[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rochdale 0-4 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United ended Rochdale's run of 10 straight league wins at home with an emphatic 4-0 victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxford took the lead after 18 minutes, with Marvin Johnson's shot from the left-hand side of the box taking a slight deflection on its way post Rochdale goalkeeper Conrad Logan.
The visitors doubled their lead on 29 minutes when Johnson turned provider, superbly backheeling the ball into the path of Rob Hall, who tapped in from close range.
Rochdale were lively at the start of the second half with Ian Henderson threatening, but they were then forced to defend once again when Jimmy McNulty's attempted backpass bobbled over the foot of Logan and behind.
Oxford took full advantage of the gifted opportunity, as the resulting corner from Hall was turned home by Ryan Taylor on 53 minutes.
Logan's afternoon was soon made worse when his poor free-kick went straight to Ryan Ledson, who lobbed into an empty net from around 40 yards out to grab Oxford's final goal on 73 minutes.
