The caller mistakenly phoned emergency services in Massachusetts to report the erratic driving and crash near Muddiford on Monday at 15.55 BST.
The call lasts for more than two and a half minutes before American officer Mark McWilliams realised the woman was calling from England.
He tells her the response time "will be more than six hours".
