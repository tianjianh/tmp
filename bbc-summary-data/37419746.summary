The two sides have already met to decide a final place this season, with Hull beating Wigan on the way to winning the Challenge Cup.
George Williams scored two of Wigan's six first-half tries to put them 36-4 up in their final regular-season match.
Smith then added a brace to help ensure Wigan finished second in the table.
Victory sees Shaun Wane's Warriors leapfrog Hull and secure home advantage in the last four, with Friday's home defeat by Warrington also seeing Hull miss out on the League Leaders' Shield to the Wolves.
Anthony Gelling gave Wigan the ideal start, collecting his own ricocheted kick to grab the game's first try inside two minutes.
John Bateman and Josh Charnley also touched down, while Joe Bretherton went over for his first senior score.
With the last play of the first half Vincent Duport reduced the arrears for the Dragons, who finish the season 10 point adrift of the play-off places.
Smith scored Wigan's only points after the break against a Catalans side that battled back with tries from Justin Horo, Lucas Albert, Richie Myler and Jordan Sigismeau to add respectability to the scoreline.
For Wigan, it is familiar territory of play-off rugby league with the Warriors reaching the penultimate stage of the competition every season for the past 10 years.
Their semi-final tie will be played on Friday, 30 September.
They have gone on to contest the Grand Final four times, winning it in 2010 and again in 2013 before losing back-to-back deciders in 2014 and 2015.
Defeat officially marks the end of a number of Dragons careers, with former Australia international Glenn Stewart and France hooker Eloi Pelissier among a host of players leaving the club.
There is also doubt over the futures of star Australian pair Dave Taylor and former Dally M medal winner Todd Carney, who has been linked with a return to the National Rugby League.
Wigan Warriors coach Shaun Wane: "It was satisfying. If someone had given me that scoreline before the game I would have absolutely snatched their hands off - Catalans had nothing to lose and they have some impressive individuals.
"I'll look at it in more detail tomorrow and get stuck into the players a bit.
"I've played in those sort of games and it's very hard when you score in the first set and it's 30-0 in no time - it is hard, although I expect and demand better."
Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous: "It was a poor first half - really, really poor. We were better in the second half but we lost it in that opening 40.
"We didn't win the ruck for 40 minutes, it's always hard to come to a place like Wigan if you don't bring the right attitude.
"We were better in the second half, I cannot say that is pleasing but at least we gave an answer."
