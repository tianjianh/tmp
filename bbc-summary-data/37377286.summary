Four men are being questioned in Italy in connection with the suicide of a woman who battled for months to have a viral video that showed her having sex removed from the internet.

The 31-year-old, identified as Tiziana, sent the video to her ex-boyfriend and three others, who put it online.
More than a million people watched it, and she became the subject of jokes and abuse.
Tiziana killed herself in her aunt's home in Mugnano near Naples on Tuesday.
Local prosecutors have opened an investigation into her death, which came more than a year after the video was circulated on Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media.
The four men are being investigated for defamation.
How Italy viewed Tiziana Cantone's death
After the video went viral, Tiziana left her job, moved to Tuscany and was in the process of changing her name, but the story kept following her.
The words "You're filming? Bravo", spoken by her in the video, have become an online joke and the phrase has been printed on T-shirts, smart phone cases and other items.
In a court case, Tiziana won a "right to be forgotten" ruling, ordering the video to be removed from various sites and search engines, including Facebook.
But she was also ordered to pay 20,000 euros (Â£17,000; $22,500) in legal costs, which local media have called a "final insult".
Italy has reacted to Tiziana's suicide with a mixture of shock and shame. Her death has provoked a debate about the corrosive effects of the public shaming of young women.
"As a government, there's not a lot that we can do," said Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. "It's mainly a cultural battle - also a social and political battle. Our commitment is try to do everything we can... Violence against women is not an ineradicable phenomenon."
The procession of the hearse carrying Tiziana's body was broadcast live. A reporter offered commentary in a hushed voice as the vehicle drove by, followed by dozens of mourners.
The woman who wanted to be forgotten is now remembered across the country.
The woman's family have called for justice and for an end to shaming.
"Now we call for the justice system to act so that her death was not in vain," the family said, quoted by Italian media.
