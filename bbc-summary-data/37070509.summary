Swan pedalo completes 100-mile journey down the Thames

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Scout leaders have ridden 100 miles along the Thames in a swan shaped pedalo.

Colin Dippie, Jane-Louise Bassett and Ash Wilson set off from Oxford but were 10 miles shy of getting to the Isle of Dogs in London.
The trio had stopped in Richmond after one of the pedals broke, but travelled 102 miles over seven days.
So far they have raised Â£1,500 for the Young Epilepsy charity and guide dogs for the blind.
The pedalo had an average speed of two miles an hour, meaning the three scout leaders had to peddle at least eight hours a day to reach their goal.
Ms Bassett said: "It's amazing how the swan has survived."
On the first day the excursion was put in jeopardy as the pedalo, called the Pokeswan Go, sprung a leak.
The 47-year-old added: "I'd quite happily do it again, I don't think Colin and Ash quite fancy it at the moment.
"Colin thinks the next project should be dragging the thing up Everest, not sure I'd be up for that."
The pedalo will be transported to a scout meet to raise more money for charity.
