[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From a TV to a pot of colouring pencils, loads of you have been sending in drawings of what enchanted objects you'd be in your home.

Well, this is what happened when we showed them to the stars of Beauty and the Beast!
The live action remake of Disney's classic animation is in cinemas this week.
In case you don't know the story, it's about Belle (played by Emma Watson), who is taken prisoner by a beast (played by Dan Stevens) in his castle.
She befriends the castle's enchanted staff and learns to see beyond what the beast looks like to fall in love with the prince that's on the inside.
It looks like some of the actors fell in love with your drawings!
