The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who lives in Birmingham, confirmed the news in a tweet congratulating all students getting their results on Thursday.
She will be studying philosophy, politics and economics at Lady Margaret Hall.
The 20-year-old was nearly killed by the Taliban in Pakistan for campaigning for girls' rights to education in 2012.
In March, she revealed she had received an offer to study the three subjects at a UK university, on condition of achieving three As in her A-levels.
She will be studying the same course at the same college attended by Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani Prime Minister.
