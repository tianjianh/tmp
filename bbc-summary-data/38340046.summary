Director of rugby Steve Diamond confirmed the Bolton-born prop had agreed a new deal on BBC Radio Manchester's Rugby Union Extra.
The 24-year-old has progressed through the Sharks' academy and played for England Saxons in the summer.
He has joined Josh Beaumont, Will Addison, Mike Haley and Sam James in signing a new three-year deal.
Diamond, 48, also spoke on a number of issues during the hour-long show, including:
Sale could look to leave their home at AJ Bell Stadium, where they share with Super League's Salford Red Devils, if the infrastructure around the ground is not improved.
The club moved to the stadium in Barton in 2012 after nine years playing at Edgeley Park in Stockport.
"If it is not fit for purpose where we want to take the journey then we will have to look at options," said Diamond.
"It is a fantastic facility but it is one road in and one out and it is difficult.
"We need to come up with plans of how we improve that facility or, when we have a release, which we do in four years' time, we'll move."
The Sharks have struggled for form of late with eight defeats in their last 10 games and there could be new additions in 2017 to help the squad.
"The targets have been identified," Diamond added. "We are looking at one or two additions to come in in the new year but it is getting the compliance right.
"I'm pretty confident of pulling through this period as I've always done. You have your rough times and you knuckle down and get on with it."
