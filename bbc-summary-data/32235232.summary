Muriel Sim is alleged to have set up a plan with Michael Leith, 47, to abuse the child.
The pensioner and Mr Leith are charged with "conspiring to rape and sexually assault" the girl between July 2013 and July 2014 in Dunfermline.
The accusation includes a claim the pair exchanged text messages to attempt to "arrange a time or times" for them to "be alone" with the child.
Prosecutors claim they also plotted to take indecent photos and videos of the girl.
Ms Sim  - who also uses the name Melville - and Mr Leith also face a separate charge under the Communications Act of sending messages that referred to them "participating in the rape of young children".
Ms Sim is further accused of sexually assaulting the child between July 2013 and April 2014.
The OAP is also charged with four allegations of child sexual abuse.
Ms Sim and Mr Leith, who appeared at the High Court in Glasgow, will stand trial on 25 August.
The case, at the High Court in Edinburgh, is expected to last about four days.
