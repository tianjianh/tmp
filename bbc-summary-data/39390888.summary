Huddersfield Town 0-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Jackson Irvine scored an injury-time goal as Burton boosted their hopes of avoiding relegation with victory at third-placed Huddersfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Wagner's Terriers dominated possession, but were unable to break down a determined Burton defence.
Marvin Sordell forced a good save from home keeper Danny Ward after the break.
And Town defender Dean Whitehead was sent off for a second yellow card before Australia international Irvine converted Sordell's cross to win it.
The defeat means Huddersfield are now nine points adrift of Brighton in second, after the south-coast club defeated Blackburn, while Burton moved up to 19th, four points clear of the relegation places.
Wagner made five changes after a 4-0 defeat by Bristol City and the home side had 73% of possession in the opening 45 minutes, but although Burton goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin had to push away an angled shot by Jack Payne, they carved out few clear-cut chances.
Ward had to be alert at the other end to deny Sordell after the forward cut inside, prompting Huddersfield to send on Nahki Wells and Elias Kachunga to boost their attack.
It was Michael Hefele, however, who came closest to a goal when his header was cleared off the line before Whitehead was dismissed after a clash with Tom Flanagan.
Irvine then compounded their frustration as he followed his first goal for Australia against the United Arab Emirates in midweek with a crucial winner for Burton.
Huddersfield manager David Wagner: "It's disappointing, not just because of the result but because of our performance, especially with the ball and in the final third.
"We showed a lack of quality and we have made too many wrong decisions.
"Against a difficult opponent an early goal would have helped. In the end wegave them a few counter-attacks and they have scored. The players tried everything."
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "There's a lot of euphoria in the dressing room. I don't think anyone gave us a chance.
"It's a big win but by no means a defining win which means we will stay up.
"It's a great start to the week when we said anything we got from these next three games would be a bonus."
