On St Piran's Day, this is how Cornwall could govern itself

The people of Cornwall are celebrating St Piran's Day.

The English county has its own flag, language and its own special day but do people there want their own political powers?
Lib Dem leader and deputy PM Nick Clegg is in Cornwall outlining a new assembly promising more local control of areas like housing and education.
Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow says the idea is "ill considered" and "nonsense".
Some other critics see it as another layer of government taking responsibility away from the local council, which is the area's biggest employer.
All the main political parties are offering devolved powers hoping to win votes in Cornwall.
It is especially important for the Lib Dems because the area is seen by some as a stronghold for them.
But the Conservatives won three of the county's six parliamentary seats in the last election.
On St Piran's Day, Mr Clegg said that if the assembly was established, Cornwall could choose to have different rules to the rest of England in areas including second home ownership, academy schools and bus services.
Northern Ireland and Wales have assemblies but the idea an English region could have their own is not new.
Back in 2004, a referendum on creating England's first regional assembly in the North East saw the idea rejected.
BBC Radio Cornwall broadcasts a news bulletin in Cornish every Sunday night at 17:00 GMT.
