[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire sixth form shake-up plans go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bid to stop proposed changes to sixth form education in Pembrokeshire has failed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is to reorganise secondary schools to improve standards, deal with ageing school buildings and increase Welsh language provision.
Opposition councillors lost a vote to stop the plans at an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday by 22 votes to 29.
Earlier, about 150 protesters gathered outside the council's Haverfordwest office.
Parents and students from action group Save our Sixth Form fear a lack of continuity could be harmful to the prospects of some pupils.
Kay Dearing, a parent governor at Tasker Milward School, told BBC Radio Wales: "I feel very strongly that no-one has yet demonstrated that the proposed model is to the benefit of the pupils."
Changes include closing three sixth forms with pupils attending a new centre in Haverfordwest, along with merging two schools and building a new Welsh medium secondary school.
A consultation on the proposals ends on 5 May.
