Electric Circus, on Market Street, had been expected to stay open for another two years while plans for Fruitmarket Gallery were developed.
However, Electric Circus operators said, in light of the "eventual closure", they would close on 25 March.
City of Edinburgh Council owns both buildings and last year announced plans for the expansion.
A post on the Electric Circus Facebook page said: "It is with a very heavy heart that Electric Circus has decided to close.
"We would first like to say the biggest thanks to all of you; to the staff who have worked with us past and present, to all the promoters and bands we have had the pleasure of hosting over the past seven years.
"To the incredibly loyal customers, from karaoke, club and gig-goers - without you we wouldn't be here today, you have all been a joy.
"The decision to close was not an easy one but we feel that due to the recent news regarding the eventual closure of the venue and the expansion of the Fruitmarket Gallery we feel, as a business it is best if we go out with a bang.
"Our last day of business will be Saturday 25 March and we hope that over the next few weeks we will see lots of familiar faces come down to celebrate the last days of Electric Circus."
City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of the leaseholder's decision to retire and close Electric Circus.
"They have sought consent from the council to assign the lease to the Fruitmarket Gallery, which has ambitious plans to develop the premises as an exciting new gallery space.
"While new clubs have been opening elsewhere in the city, we know the closure of an established venue is of concern to the live music community.
"The council's culture service is continuing to consult with musicians and promoters on the future development of the city's live music scene and the impact of changes like this."
