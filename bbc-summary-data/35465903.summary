[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County have signed striker David Goodwillie from Aberdeen after Wales international Simon Church moved to Pittodrie from MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Church, 27, has scored three goals in 23 appearances for the English Championship side this season.
However, starts have been hard to come by for the former Charlton forward.
Goodwillie, 26, has featured in 25 matches for Aberdeen during this campaign, scoring twice, and his switch is also on a loan basis.
However, the striker will be ineligible for County's League Cup final meeting with Hibernian as he has already featured in the competition for the Dons.
Capped three times by Scotland, Goodwillie had started the last two matches for the Dons.
After five years at Dundee United, he moved to Blackburn in 2011 for a fee in excess of Â£2m.
He failed to establish himself at Ewood Park and signed for Aberdeen in 2014 after loan spells at Crystal Palace, Dundee United and Blackpool.
Church has 33 caps for Wales and was used four times as a late substitute last year in their successful Euro 2016 campaign.
