A hen party which helped a man whose car had become stuck in mud has been called 'heroic' by the driver.

Journalist Richard Chambers was making his way to Letterkenny in Donegal when his car aquaplaned to the side of the road and became stuck in mud and gravel.
He was unable to push his car free - until a mini-bus carrying a hen party from Northern Ireland pulled up.
Dressed in pink feather boas the hens helped push the car back onto the road.
Mr Chambers' car skidded to the side of the road outside Ballybofey when he drove over a large amount of surface water which was lying on the road.
He told the Good Morning Ulster programme, "I tried to reverse it out, but it was stuck so I called the AA and they said they would be about an hour and a half.
"A helpful fellow from Cork pulled up and offered to help with a push. The pair of us macho clowns really couldn't shift it at all."
The bypasser told Mr Chambers that he didn't think the car could be moved without a tow-truck.
At this point the journalist said, "I had resigned to my fate."
However, much to his surprise a mini-bus carrying a hen party from Northern Ireland stopped to lend a hand.
"They got straight out of the bus with pink feather boas and all that sort of stuff and said 'We'll push it out'. I was like, we'll give them a go anyway, you know?
"Within minutes this gang of women, about five or six of them' were pushing. (They) all pushed the car, and that was the job done!
"One of them came out with a face full of mud from a bit of reversing, but the photos I'd say will be great fun for them," Mr Chambers added.
He says he hopes to find the women as he is "eternally thankful" for all that they did.
