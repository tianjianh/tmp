UK relaxes Kenya travel warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK government has lifted its warning against travelling to part of Kenya's coast, including Mombasa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Foreign Office previously warned against all but essential travel to almost all of the country's Indian Ocean coastline.
Warnings remain in place for part of the coast and anywhere within 60km (37 miles) of the border with Somalia due to a "high threat from terrorism".
Warnings also remain in place for areas including Nairobi's Eastleigh suburb.
The BBC's Jonathan Chapman said coastal resorts had seen a "dramatic drop" in tourist numbers - and the Kenyan government had blamed this on travel advice from several governments including Britain and the US.
The Foreign Office says the "main threat" of terrorism - including kidnapping - in the warning areas comes from "extremists linked to al-Shabab", a militant group which has carried out attacks in Kenya in response to Kenya's military intervention in Somalia.
There have been several attacks in Kenya recently, including the killing of at least 148 people at Garissa University College 2 April 2015.
In 2011, Somali pirates killed David Tebbutt, from Hertfordshire, and kidnapped his wife Judith at a villa on an island in Kenya's Lamu archipelago - which is still part of the area Britons are advised not to visit.
In 2013, 67 people were killed during a four-day siege which began when al-Shabab attacked the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi.
