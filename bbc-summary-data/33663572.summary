Suffolk homes and roads flooded in 24-hour deluge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Homes in Suffolk were left flooded as four inches of rain fell in 24 hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The downpours also left several roads in Lowestoft and Carlton Colville under water and near impassable.
Water poured into homes on Aldwyk Way causing serious damage to ground floor and ruining furniture.
Police are advising motorists to drive carefully in places where water has gathered and has still not drained away.
Although conditions have improved, community station Lowestoft Weather said it does not rule out the chance of further showers.
