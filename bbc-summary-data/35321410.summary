Tributes have continued to be paid to actor Alan Rickman following his death from cancer at the age of 69.

Juliet Stevenson, Rickman's co-star in Truly Madly Deeply, told the BBC he was "blissfully funny" and could make "a whole room collapse with laughter".
"I think pretty much everyone who came across him fell in love with him," she told Radio Four's Front Row.
Kate Winslet has also paid tribute, remembering her Sense and Sensibility co-star as "a warm-hearted puppy dog".
"He was loved enormously by so many," continued the actress, who was directed by Rickman in 2013 in his film A Little Chaos.
"He was an exceptionally warm and giving man and an utterly phenomenal actor and gifted director."
Hugh Grant, who was in Love Actually with Rickman and who also appeared in Sense and Sensibility, said he was "extremely funny, kind, loved and respected".
Rupert Grint joined his Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson in paying homage, saying he felt "so privileged" to have worked with him.
"Even though he has gone I will always hear his voice," he continued - a reference to the actor's distinctive and much-imitated baritone.
The Die Hard and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves star has also been remembered by Rada's Edward Kemp as "hugely loved and highly regarded".
Kemp, director of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, told BBC Breakfast its London base had been "in an intense state of grief" following Thursday's announcement.
Rickman studied at Rada from 1972 to 1974 before going on to work with the Royal Shakespeare Company in such plays as Les Liaisons Dangereuses.
Gregory Doran, the RSC's artistic director, praised his "forensic intelligence, precision and brilliant comic timing" as well as his "integrity and generosity".
The cast of the current London production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses - led by actress Janet McTeer - paid their own on-stage tribute after their final curtain call on Thursday.
Hugh Jackman posted a picture of himself with his "dear friend" on Twitter, while Cher remembered him as a "Brilliant Actor" who would "ALWAYS B WITH US".
Flowers and tributes have also been left at King's Cross station in London at the area designated "Platform 9Â¾", after the Harry Potter books and films.
US actor Neil Patrick Harris said he was "stunned" to hear of Rickman's passing, describing his Tony-winning performance on Broadway in Noel Coward's Private Lives as "a master class".
Sigourney Weaver also expressed disbelief at the news, saying her Galaxy Quest co-star had "infused every character he played" with his "enormous strength of character".
"Alan Rickman was an actor's actor; courageous, generous, witty & surprising," tweeted Susan Sarandon. "When he laughed he lit up a room."
Author Kathy Lette, meanwhile, described her late "pal" as "dear, loving, loyal [and] kind," adding that she preferred to think of him "wearing Harry [Potter]'s invisibility cloak" rather than deceased.
In a statement released on Thursday, Rickman's family said he had "died from cancer at the age of 69... surrounded by family and friends."
It was recently revealed that he and his long-term partner, Rima Horton, had married in secret last year.
