Opener Lauren Winfield is the only player in the current squad for the upcoming T20 series in South Africa not to be chosen in the 15-strong party.
Brunt, 30, will miss the T20s in South Africa after suffering a back spasm in the one-day international series.
Her replacement, left-arm seamer Natasha Farrant, is called up for an ICC world event for the first time.
"We are all looking forward to testing ourselves against the very best cricketers from across the world," said head coach Mark Robinson.
"Tash really impressed during the training camp to Sri Lanka before Christmas, and adds a different dimension to the bowling attack as a left-arm seamer."
England, who won the inaugural event in 2009 and have been runners-up on the last two occasions, begin their campaign against Bangladesh in Bangalore on 17 March, followed by matches against hosts India, West Indies and Pakistan.
England squad: Tammy Beaumont (Kent), Katherine Brunt (Yorkshire), Charlotte Edwards (Kent, capt), Georgia Elwiss (Sussex), Natasha Farrant (Kent), Lydia Greenway (Kent), Rebecca Grundy (Warwickshire), Jenny Gunn (Nottinghamshire), Danielle Hazell (Yorkshire), Amy Jones (Warwickshire, wk), Heather Knight (Berkshire, vice-capt), Natalie Sciver (Surrey), Anya Shrubsole (Somerset), Sarah Taylor (Sussex, wk), Danielle Wyatt (Nottinghamshire).
