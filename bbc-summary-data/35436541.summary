NIE Networks has restored supply to 10,000 customers but about 3,000 remain without power.
The worst affected areas are counties Tyrone, Londonderry and Antrim.  The strongest wind recorded was 85mph.
A number of roads across Northern Ireland are also closed due to fallen trees and flooding.
NIE Networks emergency crews and engineers are working to restore power to the remaining customers and the firm has opened its main incident centre in Craigavon, County Armagh, to co-ordinate its response.
The firm's communications manager, Julia Carson, said: "We have been in regular contact with the Met Office and had mobilised NIE Networks emergency crews, engineers and call handlers in preparation for any damage the severe weather may cause
She also advised the public:  "Put safety first and if you do see any trees down across power lines or broken electricity poles, keep away and call NIE Networks immediately."
Electricity customers who have lost supply in Northern Ireland should call NIE Networks' customer helpline on 03457 643 643 or report the fault online using their website: nienetworks.co.uk
