Park's said the acquisition would add a further 12 dealerships to the group and take the number of franchise partners to 23.
Macrae and Dick runs dealerships in Stirling, Perth, Inverness, Elgin and Aberdeen.
Hamilton-based Park's already operates in Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Glasgow, West Lothian and Fife.
Park's director Ross Park said: "We are moving in to new territory and we cannot wait to get started.
"The acquisition was assisted by the support of the Bank of Scotland, in terms of funding, and that of our current partners, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover and Honda who were all supportive of increasing our representation of their brands.
"We are also delighted to forge new relationships with fantastic brands such as Ford, Toyota and Mazda."
Macrae and Dick chairman Francis Hamilton said: "When we decided we were to sell the business we sought out a motor group in Scotland which was similar to our own and one which likewise expresses commercial competence, courtesy to its customers and concern for its staff."
