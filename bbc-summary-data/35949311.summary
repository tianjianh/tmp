[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea City 1-0 Chelsea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City claimed an impressive first Premier League win against Chelsea to all but secure their top-flight survival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Swans seized on a tepid Chelsea display to dominate the first half and lead through Gylfi Sigurdsson's volley.
The visitors enjoyed more possession after the break but were stifled by the hosts, who are now 13 points clear of the relegation zone.
Chelsea stay 10th after a first league defeat under manager Guus Hiddink.
The reigning champions had been unbeaten in 14 Premier League games under the Dutchman, though they surrendered that record meekly at the Liberty Stadium.
Swansea, by contrast, produced what was arguably the most accomplished performance of head coach Francesco Guidolin's tenure.

Starting the match 10 points above the bottom three and with survival all but guaranteed, the Swans selected a more attacking team with Jefferson Montero the orchestrator of a vibrant team display.
With injury and a loss of form curbing his progress after a sparkling start to the season, the Ecuadorian winger was making his first start under Guidolin.
Montero probed menacingly at Chelsea's defence and created the game's first chance for Sigurdsson, whose firm shot was palmed away by Asmir Begovic.
It was the same formula which produced the opening goal, as Montero's cross was only half-cleared into the path of Sigurdsson, who guided a left-footed volley into the bottom corner.
Montero ran relentlessly on Swansea's left flank, as Chelsea defenders Cesar Azpilicueta and Matt Miazga were both booked for fouls on the 26-year-old.
Miazga was substituted at half-time, and Chelsea were fortunate not to be further behind at the break as Sigurdsson and Andre Ayew both had shots saved by Begovic.
It was a ragged display from the visitors, who were playing their first game since confirming Italy manager Antonio Conte would take over at Stamford Bridge after Euro 2016.
The former Juventus boss is likely to have been unimpressed by Chelsea's sloppy defending in south Wales, while their efforts in attack left much to be desired.
Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato was underwhelming on his first start, looking short of match fitness and squandering two promising chances.
Chelsea began to control possession as the match wore on, with Swansea dropping deep as they sensed a precious win was within their grasp.
Despite keeping the ball for long periods, however, Chelsea seldom troubled Lukasz Fabianski in the home goal.

Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin: "This is the first victory in the Premier League for Swansea against Chelsea and I am happy and proud. We played very well in the first half, we deserved to score other goals.
"It's a very important win for our fans. It's a good afternoon for our players, our club and our fans. Jefferson Montero is an important player for us. Safety is almost real, but I hope to take other points in the next weeks because it's important to finish well."
Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink: "Every defeat hurts but everyone knows the situation we are in, so there's a positive side to bringing in youngsters and seeing what they can do. We defended poorly and gave Sigurdsson a very free chance. We were attacking, attacking, but in the final third we were not sharp enough."
