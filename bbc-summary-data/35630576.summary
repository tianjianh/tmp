The facility produces Potassium Clavulanate which is used to treat conditions such as pneumonia, bronchitis and infections of the skin.
The expansion will help meet growing demand from developing countries.
GSK is receiving a Â£1.5m Scottish Enterprise Regional Selective Assistance grant towards the cost.
The grant was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the official opening ceremony.
She said: "GSK is a global leader in the development of medicines and a great example of a highly-innovative company that is benefiting from what Scotland has to offer as an attractive location of choice for global life sciences companies.
"Their further investment in Scotland is testament to our thriving life sciences industry and its position as a key growth sector for the Scottish economy."
GSK also operates a plant in Montrose, Angus, which produces ingredients for medicines used to treat respiratory diseases and HIV/AIDS.
The company's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said: "We're delighted to be opening a new facility in Scotland, where we have a long-standing commitment to manufacturing, which will continue in the near and distant future.
"The impact of this new facility will be felt here and abroad, with more antibiotics produced for people in countries where this sort of medicine is desperately needed."
