Millwall manager Neil Harris says the margin of their 3-0 win over Premier League Bournemouth in the FA Cup third round was no more than they deserved.

The League One side progressed thanks to goals from Steve Morison, Shaun Cummings and Shane Ferguson at The Den.
Harris named an unchanged side for the fifth straight game, while Cherries boss Eddie Howe made 11 changes.
"We knew Bournemouth would make changes but we knew they would play the same style," Harris told BBC Radio London.
"Whatever 11 they put out there was going to be expensive and talented.
"The scoreline certainly didn't flatter us at all. A couple of players are disappointed they didn't add to the tally today.
"We rose to the occasion. We knew we'd have to fight and defend really well but we knew we were capable of scoring goals today.
"Eddie will say he picked a team that was comfortably good enough to win the game. They just maybe got outperformed."
