Viewers will see 12 amateur bakers trying to impress judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood when the new series begins on BBC One on 24 August.
Last year's winner Nadiya Hussain was a big success and Hollywood said this year's crop had felt the pressure.
"Nadiya went to a whole new level... it put pressure on them more," he said.
"I think we felt it in the tents as well. They started quite nervously, but once they settled down they got into it."
Berry concurred, saying: "They know the standard that it is, which is now pretty high. And I think they were slower to bond this year than they were in the past."
A teacher, a student and a garden designer are also among the hopefuls. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins will return to host the show.
