Police have recovered drugs including cocaine, diamorphine and cannabis after raids in the north of Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three people were arrested after officers searched four addresses on Friday.
Two of those arrested - a 28-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman - are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday.
A report on the third person, a 31-year-old man, is being prepared for the procurator fiscal.
Ch Insp Jimmy Jones said: "We've been listening to residents and recognise the profound impact drugs have on our communities.
"As a result we've carried out this latest action to disrupt the drug local network and remove these harmful substances from our streets.
"We will continue to work alongside our communities in order to address the crimes and issues that have the greatest impact on people."
