The Liberal Democrats are promising young people still living with their parents a loan to help pay for a deposit on a rented home of their own.

Party leader, Nick Clegg, said the Help to Rent policy would help what he called the "clipped-wing generation".
The plan would mean working people in England aged between 18 and 30 could use a low-interest loan to fund the deposit needed to rent a property.
Tenants would be able to borrow up to £1,500 or £2,000 if in London.

"So we have a very simple idea which is in effect to extend a system of government loans."
He added that it was "simply unfair" that thousands of hard-working young people still have to live in the same bedroom they lived in when children.
"When you get your own job, you want to stand on your own two feet, have your own space and not have to rely on the bank of mum and dad. "
Senior Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes said the policy would not cost much.
The government would set aside £50m as a contingency against any tenants who failed to repay their deposit, he said. Beyond that, the pay-outs would not count as public expenditure because the money gets paid back.
