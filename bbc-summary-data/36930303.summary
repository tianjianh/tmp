Stevenage 1-2 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second-half goals from Ryan Lowe and Alex Kiwomya earned Crewe victory at Stevenage on the opening day of the new League Two season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors grabbed the lead on 63 minutes when substitute Kiwomya's defence-splitting pass released captain Lowe, who coolly tucked his effort beyond Jamie Jones.
A brilliant double stop from Jones prevented Stevenage from falling two behind, as the Boro keeper stopped Billy Bingham's 25-yard strike before reacting well to keep out Chris Dagnall's close-range effort.
An inspired Stevenage goalkeeper then denied Kiwomya and John Guthrie in quick succession, as the hosts struggled to deal with Crewe's attacking threat.
After creating the first, Chelsea loan man Kiwomya doubled the lead with a brilliant solo goal 10 minutes from time.
The 20-year-old picked up possession midway inside the Stevenage half before jinking onto his left foot and dispatching his shot beyond Jones.
Charlie Lee fired home a late consolation for the hosts in injury time, but it proved too little too late.
