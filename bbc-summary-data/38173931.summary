The news isn't always doom and gloom. Here are some of your favourite "nice news" stories from around Scotland this week.

When Romanian photographer Alex Galmeanu discovered an undeveloped film inside a camera he bought online, he set about processing it.
From the aging film, he was intrigued to find a selection of mysterious black and white wedding photos.
In one, a handsome groom sporting a kipper tie and his bride, wearing a stylish trouser suit, were being showered with confetti.
Mr Galmeanu turned detective in a bid to track down the couple.
Believing the wedding took place in Scotland, he posted the images and some snippets of information on his blog and appealed for help in tracing the family.
But when BBC Scotland ran the story of his appeal, our readers quickly helped to solve the mystery. Read the full story here.
When Laura Marriner announced she was swapping her comfortable suburban life in the south of England for a remote Hebridean island, she admitted some people thought she was "a bit bonkers".
With her husband and two young sons, she left her home and her job in Hampshire to take up a post as a schoolteacher on the tiny island of Muck.
But in an interview with BBC Scotland shortly after taking up her post, she revealed she is loving her new life.
"I love it. I'm so happy here. I keep waiting for the day when I don't feel like that anymore," she said.
"But even on the days when we've had really difficult experiences, behind that has still been this complete joy at what we're doing and being here. It's just wonderful."
On Facebook, Sabine Lubeck wished her luck: "It takes courage to make such a move! So, wishing them all the best, especially now in the tough winter time..."
The pupils of Bearsden Academy proved a hit on social media this week, when they staged a giant ceilidh to mark its annual social dancing season.
For many Scottish school pupils, traditional dancing lessons replace typical physical education classes in December.
Mavis Coull wrote on Facebook: "I remember getting dancing at school and I loved it, our daughters got it too.
"I remember being at a wedding and an elderly couple couldn't believe our girls knew all the steps to the dances!"
Agnes Tougher McFarlane admitted he didn't like the classes at school - but he learned a useful life skill.
He said: "Mostly hated at school even to this day, but it I can't remember how many weddings and ceilidhs I've been to over the years that this awkward social dancing has been worth it's weight! Brilliant to see these high school pupils embracing it."
It also gets the thumbs up from PE teacher Susie Hubbard. She said: "Brilliant! Well done. As a PE teacher I have seen the joy and also the utter painful experience that comes with social dance!
"Proof that educating on the social and emotional comes before the physical! #lovesocialdance."
Fancy a day out? Why not take a walk through the best park in the UK?
For that is the honour scooped by Rouken Glen park in East Renfrewshire this week.
The award was made by Fields in Trust and its chief executive described the historic site as "a beautiful green space and well-deserving of the accolade".
Over on Facebook, Betty Stewart agreed. She said: "Lovely Rouken Glen Park my mother took us all when we were young I took my children and grandchildren. Still go walking there. Love the Boaters Cafe."
And Margaret Taylor Wilkins said: "Many a day I've spent in that lovely park with my grandchildren!"
It is more than 70 years since Heinrich Steinmeyer was captured in France during World War Two.
As a 19-year-old German soldier, he was transported to Scotland where he was held in a prisoner of war camp at Cultybraggan, by Comrie.
Despite the passage of time, Mr Steinmeyer never forgot the kindness he was shown by the people of the village.
And it has now emerged that the former PoW, who died in 2013 aged 90, left more than Â£300,000 in his will to benefit the village's "elderly people".
His extraordinary gift was broadly welcomed on social media.
Sandra McRitchie said: "The elderly of our village remember stories of the camp and the friendships forged that lasted a lifetime. Heinrich's generous legacy is wonderful, he is and will continue to be remembered fondly."
And Cat Mitchell posted: "What a lovely story. Shows people of Scotland were kind and decent to people who were in exactly the same situation as our boys abroad!"
