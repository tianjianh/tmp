Sukhjit Singh, from Derby, was found dead in his bed while on holiday in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
His wife Ramandeep Kaur Mann is facing charges of plotting the killing with his childhood friend Gurpeet Singh.
Police claimed the pair are lovers but her family has denied the charges and said it is launching a legal battle.
Friends in Derby said the news came as a shock and their priority was the couple's young children, who remain with their grandmother in India.
The family were visiting Sukhjit's mother in Banda, about 450km (280 miles) south east of New Delhi, and were due to fly home earlier this month.
Local police said the Derby man was found dead in his mother's house with his throat slit and having sustained head injuries on 1 September.
They accused Ramandeep and Gurpeet of being lovers and arrested Gurpeet as he attempted to board a flight to Dubai.
Gurpal Singh worked with Sukhjit at the National Sikh Museum in Derby and saw the family the night before they flew to India.
"We all really want to know the truth. All we've heard are reports in the media and we are concerned the story is being repeated without a proper investigation," he said.
"We are all in shock. They are a lovely family - he was a devout and humble man. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong at home.
"I'm not questioning what the Indian police have said but we would all like to see a proper investigation of what has happened."
The Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to a British national who had been detained and to the family of Sukhjit Singh.
Prayers will be said at the Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Derby later and for several days next week.
