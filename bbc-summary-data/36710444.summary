Led by drummers, the players made their way through the city in an open-top bus to the hill of Arnarholl, where fans greeted them with wild cheers.
Iceland's first major tournament ended on Sunday when the tiny nation, one of Europe's smallest, lost to France.
But not before they had dumped out the England side in the round of 16.
The Iceland team were beaten 5-2 by tournament hosts France on Sunday, but their exploits at Euro 2016 had already captivated the fans back home.
Coming from a population of just 329,000, they defied the odds to qualify from the group stage and then see off England.
On their way to the last eight of the European tournament, they had also beat Austria and, in qualifying, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the Czech Republic.
