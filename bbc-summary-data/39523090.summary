Nottingham Forest have defender Danny Fox available after suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Centre-back Jack Hobbs has returned to training, with manager Mark Warburton needing to decide if he persists with a three-man defensive line-up.
Blackburn are likely to remain without defenders Charlie Mulgrew and Darragh Lenihan (both ankle), who are not fit.
As Rovers bid to end a run of three straight losses and seven games without a win, striker Danny Graham (hip) will be assessed after picking up a knock.
BBC Radio Lancashire's Andy Bayes
"By Tuesday morning, Blackburn Rovers' destiny will be clearer than ever. An inept display last time out against Barnsley has left them playing catch-up. Four points to make up from five games remaining games is a tall order.
"Tony Mowbray's task hasn't been made easier by injuries, with the likes of Mulgrew, Lenihan, Greer, Evans and Graham all missing matches.
"Ever-present goalkeeper Jason Steele has also picked up an injury, that could open the door for David Raya to play his first Championship match in 20 months.
"Six changes were made for the last match. I expect plenty more for the visit to the City Ground."
