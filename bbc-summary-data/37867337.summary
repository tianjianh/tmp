Hall shares second place with fellow English player, Holly Clyburn - after two rounds at Saadiyat Beach Golf Club.
The pair are three shots behind Iceland's Olafia Kristinsdottir, who added a 66 to her opening 65.
Dorset's Hall, who fired eight birdies to finish 10 under par, said: "I didn't think of my score at all, I was just trying to make birdie after birdie."
