More than 7,800 people were killed in the disaster on 25 April, and thousands more were injured.
An appeal was launched last month by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which which is made up of 13 UK aid charities.
A total of £47m has been raised across the UK. The funds will be used to bring aid to an estimated 310,000 people.
It will help with emergency supplies, including food, shelter, water and sanitation kits.
DEC said it was working in some of the worst-affected parts of the country.
Neil Mathers, chairman of the Scottish appeal, said: "Despite the immense challenges facing those affected and relief efforts, the response continues to grow day by day.
"We are now delivering more aid to some of the worst-affected areas, and our members are expanding their efforts into remote regions."
He said teams were working round the clock to provide aid.
"A huge amount of work remains to be done before the monsoon rains make the response even more difficult and the risk of disease outbreaks increase," he added.
"The overwhelming generosity people in Scotland, and indeed all over the UK, will help families get through the next few months and rebuild their lives over the coming years."
Donations to the appeal are being accepted via the DEC website and the 24-hour donations line 0370 60 60 900.
