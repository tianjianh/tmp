[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers full-back Luke Dorn will retire at the end of the Super League season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian has made more appearances for a British club than any other foreign player, over 250 so far.
Dorn, who scored a hat-trick in Castleford's thumping 52-12 win over Leeds on Thursday, has also played for London Broncos and Salford.
"It will be with a heavy heart when I finish here, but it's a great club I am finishing at," the 33-year-old said.
"It's a completely different club from when I was here the first time and I think we've all played a part in where the club is at now.
"I think leaving at the end of this year, I'll be leaving this club in a good place."
