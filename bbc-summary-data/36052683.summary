The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir's song A Bridge Over You topped the chart in 2015 ahead of Bieber's Love Yourself.
The deal with Decca Records will see them release their debut album Something Inside So Strong next month.
Decca is part of Universal Music, which is also home to Bieber.
The choir won the Christmas battle after the Canadian pop singer urged his 72 million Twitter followers to "do the right thing" and help the charity single get to the top spot.
Choir co-ordinator Caroline Smith, who works as a children's physiotherapist, said "I'm delighted to be able to represent and support the NHS with such a special album. When everyone comes together in the choir it's really powerful, I've never experienced anything quite like it."
The album, out on on 27 May, includes 12 songs including Bill Withers' Lean On Me, Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud and Carole King's You've Got A Friend.
Its release also marks the 70th anniversary of the passing of the NHS Act of July 1946.
The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust have directed that a minimum of Â£40,000 from the sale of the album are paid to its charitable funds.
The choir, which features physiotherapists, porters and administrators as well as doctors and nurses, were runners up on Gareth Malone's BBC Two show Sing While You Work in 2012.
