[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Rasche, 24, confronted Jordan Brimacombe at Deja Vu nightclub after the pair fell out over a girl.
The pair started fighting in the club and continued the brawl in the street after they were thrown out.
Police found part of Mr Brimacombe's ear on the ground and it had to be re-attached by surgeons.
Rasche, a prisoner at HMP Perth, pleaded guilty to a charge of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
His defence advocate Paul Parker Smith said: "He says that when the fight was on-going he was bitten on the finger and he reciprocated by biting the most convenient point - which was on his ear.
"It was all over a young lady. He throws himself on the mercy of the court."
Sheriff Tom Hughes jailed Rasche for two years and four months, telling him: "You don't need me to tell you that you have a bad record of previous convictions including one on indictment for assault.
"It is completely unacceptable and you have left your victim in this case with some disfigurement as a result."
