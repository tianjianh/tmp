British Cycling begins search for new performance director

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Cycling has begun searching for a new performance director.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Dave Brailsford, the last person to fill the role, left in April 2014 to focus on Team Sky, with head coach Shane Sutton moving into a new role as technical director.
Sutton left 100 days prior to the Rio Olympics amid allegations of sexism, though he denied the "specific claims".
Programmes manager Andy Harrison, who took on Sutton's responsibilities, could be a candidate for the role.
The national governing body has had a testing year,  and its headquarters were visited by UK Anti-Doping officials this month as part of an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport.
Despite the upheaval off the track, British cyclists won 33 medals across this summer's Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games, 18 of which were gold.
In a statement, British Cycling said appointing a performance director would enable the team to build on those successes "and provide greater support to performance staff and athletes".
Stephen Park, who manages Britain's Olympic sailing team, has already said he would consider a move to British Cycling, but added he would give consideration to a role at "any of the top sports".
Australian Sutton, 59, has always denied any wrongdoing and should the independent review commissioned to look into the allegations find in his favour, there may be calls for his reinstatement.
