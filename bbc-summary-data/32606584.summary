Offshore industrial action talks being held in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks aimed at preventing potential industrial action by offshore workers are set to take place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two unions - Unite and the GMB - claim there has not been enough consultation on moves by members of the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) to change rota patterns in a bid to cut costs.
The OCA said its members needed to make changes in the face of lower oil prices.
The talks are being held in Aberdeen.
