Resuming on 363-4 on day three of the second and final Test, Australia posted 505, a lead of 135 despite Neil Wagner's 6-106 at the Hagley Oval.
New Zealand reached 121-4 by the close as James Pattinson took 3-29.
Kane Williamson, unbeaten on 45, is the hosts' best hope of salvaging anything other than defeat.
Australia, who lead 1-0, need only draw this match to regain the number one Test ranking.
McCullum, who scored the fastest Test century in the first innings, was superbly caught by a diving David Warner at mid-wicket as he charged at Josh Hazlewood.
The 34-year-old's last Test runs came from a characteristic six - the 107th of his career, more than anyone else in the format.
He received a standing ovation from the crowd at the start of his innings and again after he was dismissed.
McCullum, who made his debut in 2004, will retire with 6,453 Test runs at an average of 38.64 from 101 matches, a tally bettered only by Stephen Fleming.
Earlier, left-arm seamer Wagner claimed his second Test five-wicket haul as Australia lost their last five wickets for 39 runs.
