[SN]TITLE[SN]
A beginner's guide to culture in Hull

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull has won the title of UK City of Culture 2017. The city is not often associated with its cultural pedigree - but has a rich history of nurturing artists and artistic movements. The highlights include:

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Larkin
Paul Heaton
EBTG
Hull Truck Theatre
Mick Ronson
William Wilberforce
One of the most celebrated poets of the twentieth century,  Larkin moved to Hull after graduating from Oxford and worked as a librarian for 30 years at the Brynmor Jones library, where he produced most of his published work. A statue of Larkin, who died in 1985, stands in Hull train station.
Lead singer of The Housemartins, Paul Heaton, moved to Grafton Street in west Hull in 1983 after a brief stop in the city. He lived there for 20 years and went on to find more success with the band Beautiful South, while bassist Norman Cook found fame as DJ Fatboy Slim.
Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt met at university in Hull and took their band name from Turners, a furniture shop on Beverley Road which had the slogan, Everything but the girl, posted above its shop window.
The company was formed in a squat in a terraced house close to the station, the office was a phone box nearby. It is now in a £15m purpose-built theatre – just a mile down the road. The company flourished under playwright John Godber, but recently it has struggled financially.
The legendary guitarist once worked as a council gardener at Queen’s Gardens.  He performed as one of the Spiders From Mars with David Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust album. He died of liver cancer in 1992 and his widow is supporting a campaign to raise money for a statue to place in the gardens in his memory.
Described as Hull’s most famous son, politician William Wilberforce is best known as a pioneering anti-slavery campaigner. He led the movement against the British slave trade until it was abolished in 1807 and continued to support the campaign to free all slaves in the British Empire, which finally became law in 1833.
