Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal found a unique cooking analogy to explain the difficulty of replacing injured players.

Wednesday's Championship campaign has been disrupted by the loss of key players in recent months.
"When we lose players who link the game at the same time, we miss something in the team," said the 51-year-old.
"You can't cook well if you don't have fish, and you eat potatoes, it's completely different."
A run of one win in seven matches, including a 1-1 draw with Barnsley on Saturday, has seen the Owls side drop out of the Championship play-off places.
"People ask me why we have changed a little the style of last season," added Carvalhal, who has been in charge at Hillsborough since the summer of 2015.
He told BBC Radio Sheffield: "When we look to the team [who lost the play-off final to Hull City in May 2016], we have been a long time without Tom Lees, Ross Wallace, Kieran Lee, Sam Hutchinson, Fernando Forestieri and Gary Hooper.
"These are players that connect things, and we need these specific points to play the football we like and the fans like.
"If we will cook something, you buy good tomatoes, good potatoes, and good rice, but if don't have the fish, you eat more potato.
"A potato cannot play the role of fish."

"When seagulls follow the trawler it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea." Eric Cantona, after winning his appeal against a two-week prison sentence for kicking an abusive spectator.
"Shall I grab you by your hair? What is your reaction when I grab your hair? Only with sex masochism it is allowed, but not in other situations." Louis van Gaal, complaining about Robert Huth's treatment of Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini.
"Paul Furlong is my vintage Rolls Royce and he cost me nothing. We polish him, look after him, and I have him fine-tuned by my mechanics. We take good care of him because we have to drive him every day, not just save him for weddings." Ian Holloway, on his veteran striker during his first spell as QPR manager.
