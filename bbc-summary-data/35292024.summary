Pilot scheme finds 'blatant misuse' of Oxfordshire blue badges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to clamp down on blue badge fraud in Oxfordshire found many were being misused, including one belonging to a dead person.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers from the county and city councils checked 200 badges over three days in Oxford, Bicester and Banbury.
They reported that 10 had to be seized for "blatant misuse".
This included cases where the badge holder was not present, drivers using out of date badges and even someone using the badge of a deceased person.
All of these cases are now being considered by the county council for possible legal action against the drivers responsible.
During the scheme the local authority's officers also moved on a number of cars parked in disabled parking spaces without any badge.
Helen Dolphin, a disabled motoring campaigner who writes for Disability Now magazine, said: "In so many areas the scheme is not policed. It doesn't take some drivers long to realise that."
Misuse of a blue badge can result in prosecution and a fine of up to Â£1,000 from the county council.
Figures obtained by BBC South Today found that about 1,000 motorists were penalised last year, not including fines handed out by the city council.
The county council was contacted for comment.
