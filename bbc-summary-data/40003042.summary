[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South African born forward, 26, has been added to the panel that was named last week by head coach Joe Schmidt.
Roux won his only Ireland Test cap against the Springboks in June 2016.
The 32-man squad will play their opening Test against the USA Eagles in New Jersey on 10 June before flying to Japan for two Tests against the 2019 Rugby World Cup host nation.
The matches against Japan, on 17 and 24 of June, will give the Ireland players and coaches a chance to run the rule over the Brave Blossoms, who they have been drawn against in Pool A of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
Roux is one of just four specialist second rows included in the squad alongside Devin Toner and the uncapped pair of Kieran Treadwell and James Ryan.
John Cooney, Dave Heffernan, Rory O'Loughlin, Andrew Porter, Rory Scannell and Jacob Stockdale are the other uncapped players in the travelling squad.
Ireland are without 11 senior players for the June tour because of their involvement with the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.
