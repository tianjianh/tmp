Eighteen cats have become ill after a spate of suspected poisonings within a few streets of each other.

Volunteers at Japers Alley Cats shelter in Southport said all of the animals were rescued in the Birkdale area.
A further six pet owners have reported people attempting to snatch cats from outside their properties within the last 48 hours, the shelter said.
The shelter has urged anyone with information to contact Merseyside Police.
Volunteer Christine Bennetts said pieces of salmon had been found doused in weed killer.
"We've also had antifreeze in two tins of tuna," she told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"It's a horrible slow death. Some of them are foaming at the mouth. It's in a very particular area, in a very particular row of blocks."
It is not clear how many of the cats rescued by the shelter are strays, and how many have owners.
