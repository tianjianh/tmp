Motorists will soon be limited to 20mph in parts of Cardiff after the council revealed plans to slash speed limits in residential areas.

A map reveals zones will be introduced in Riverside, Canton, Gabalfa, Grangetown, Plasnewydd, Adamsdown, Penylan, Splott, and Butetown by 2021.
A pilot scheme in Cathays will also be upgraded.
Cardiff Council hope the scheme will improve public safety and encourage walking and cycling.
Councillor Ramesh Patel said the 20mph zones aimed to make residential streets less attractive as short cuts.
"Cardiff's population continues to increase so we have to plan for this growth by encouraging more people to leave their car at home and consider using public transport, cycling or walking," he said.
Main roads in the areas affected will remain at 30mph, with residential areas reduced to 20mph zones.
A consultation into the plans will take place with residents.
