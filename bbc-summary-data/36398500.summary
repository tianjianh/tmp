Man faces trial over mosque vandalism in Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who struggled with worshippers in a mosque and smashed framed prayers will stand trial after claiming he was not responsible for his actions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Skene admitted carrying out the destruction at the Taj Madina Mosque in Dundee on 11 December last year.
Mr Skene faces a charge of acting aggressively by repeatedly struggling with members of the congregation.
He also attempted to smash a glass cupboard containing copies of the Koran.
Defence solicitor Kevin Hampton told Dundee Sheriff Court: "The entire Crown case can be agreed.
"It would appear that the defence is his state of mind at the time - his actings are not in dispute."
Depute fiscal Joanne Smith said: "The incident is more or less captured on CCTV."
Mr Skene, 38, from Dundee, pleaded not guilty to charges of breach of the peace, vandalism and resisting arrest.
Sheriff Alastair Brown continued the case to a trial date in June.
