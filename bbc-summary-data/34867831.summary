Scott Vineer attack: Ryan Craig jailed for five years for GBH on teenager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-year sentence for a County Antrim man who attacked an autistic teenager and left him with brain damage is too lenient, his victim has said.

Ryan Craig, of Ashmount Gardens in Lisburn, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to Scott Vineer in 2012.
The 20-year-old will spend five years in prison with the remaining five years on supervised licence upon his release.
Mr Vineer was found with severe brain and head injuries near a disused warehouse in Lisburn after the attack.
His family were told at the time that he was unlikely to survive.
The judge at Craigavon Crown Court told Craig that Mr Vineer would "never be released from the imprisonment you subjected him to".
After the sentencing on Wednesday, Mr Vineer said: "I'm scared of what will happen when he gets out."
He added that he was "halfway between annoyed and relieved" with the sentence.
Craig was due to go on trial for attempted murder in June, but he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge.
Mr Vineer was 17 at the time of the attack and spent three months in a coma.
He returned home from hospital six months after the attack.
Mr Vineer's mother, Helen-Louise Doney, said that when she arrived at the hospital a doctor told her she should "be prepared to say our goodbyes".
She said she was disappointed that Craig did not get a 15-year sentence.
"He knew what he was doing, he knew it was wrong. He deliberately kept details away from anyone that could help Scott," Mrs Doney said.
"He should've been given the maximum, as far as we're concerned."
During sentencing, the judge said Mr Vineer has still has "significant, ongoing physical limitations" three years after the attack.
He added that while it had to be accepted that Craig did not inflict the "major injuries", he was a "willing participant" in the assault.
Craig had "clearly and deliberately involved himself" in the attack, the judge added.
Craig's barrister said his client was remorseful for what he had done.
But the judge said Craig's criminal behaviour since the assault, including a petrol bomb attack on police, would suggest otherwise.
Mr Vineer, who was best man at his mother and stepfather's wedding in August, said he is determined to live a normal life.
He said he plans to leave home in the coming years so that he can live independently.
