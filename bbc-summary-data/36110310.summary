The Toffees, who have not won in seven Premier League games, lost 4-0 at Liverpool on Wednesday, a result Martinez described as "horrific".
His side face Manchester United in Saturday's Wembley FA Cup semi-final.
He said: "I wouldn't be professional if I was wasting my time talking about what people think about the manager."
He added: "When you get bad results, you will face scrutiny. We don't accept mediocrity and are not happy with our performances in the league."

Spaniard Martinez, 42, has faced growing hostility from Everton supporters in recent matches after a series of disappointing performances.
Last Saturday's 1-1 draw with Southampton ensured this will be the club's worst season at home in their 138-year history.
They have managed only 17 points at Goodison Park, thanks to eight defeats, five draws and four wins.
Martinez said he is not thinking about the league form and is focused on Saturday's game, which will be shown live on BBC One and the BBC Sport website (kick-off 17:15 BST).
He added: "Since the quarter-final against Chelsea, the results have not been good enough and that's something we will look at next week.
"At the moment, everything's about being together in the FA Cup semi-final."
Asked whether there was a sense of dejection after the Merseyside derby, he said: "I wouldn't use the word dejection. We carry hurt.
"We need to forget about the league. We have put in strong work for 10 months and want to repair the hurt everyone at the club is feeling, from the fans to the players."

Right-back Seamus Coleman will miss the semi-final with the hamstring injury he suffered against Southampton last Saturday.
Club captain Phil Jagielka, fellow centre-back John Stones and midfielder Gareth Barry face fitness tests.
Jagielka has not played since injuring a hamstring at Watford on 9 April, Stones was substituted at Anfield with stomach cramps and Barry was replaced at half-time in the same game with a groin injury.
Martinez said "we are quite positive about John" and added of Jagielka: "Knowing Phil, he is desperate to play but we are not going to say no and we are going to [look at] his feelings rather than the injury."
