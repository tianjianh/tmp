An 18-year-old student has been jailed after he admitted killing a man during a confrontation in Oxford city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eamonn Anderson, 56, was attacked in High Street on 25 October 2016 and later died in hospital.
Iman St Clair, of Kestrel Crescent, Oxford, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Oxford Crown Crown last month.
He has been sentenced to four years in prison, reduced by 112 days for the time he has already spent wearing a tag on bail.
Mr Anderson died in hospital after St Clair kicked him in the head near St Mary's Church on High Street.
Prior to the assault, the court heard verbal exchanges took place between Mr Anderson and a group including St Clair, in Oxford city centre.
Then a dog Mr Anderson had been walking, chased St Clair's friends down Queen Street, the jury heard.
Mr Anderson and St Clair met again at 23:30 BST in High Street, when a bus driver witnessed St Clair performing a "powerful scissor kick" on Mr Anderson.
The 56-year-old suffered a head injury and died in hospital on 11 November 2016.
Andrew Hall defending said St Clair had not meant to kill Mr Anderson and had accepted responsibility.
The defendant had been studying for his A and AS Levels and was normally "hard working" and "placid", Mr Hall said.
Judge Zoe Smith said Mr Anderson was a much loved son, brother and uncle.
His mother, Edith Anderson, said life would never be the same again.
Judge Smith said she had taken St Clair's youth and character into account in her sentence.
