At a trial of issue at Sheffield Crown Court, Thorpe said she and Mr Poole had been drinking throughout the day.
She said that Mr Poole had accused her of seeing another man and became violent.
"He pulled me by the hair and said, 'You're a slag, I'm going to kill you'.
"He was pointing the knife at my throat," she said.
"I punched him and he fell backwards on to the settee, dropping the knife.
"He pulled me down with him [and] kept hitting me in the back of the head.
"I picked up the knife and stabbed him in his leg."
She told the court that she had stabbed Mr Poole "so he would get off me".
Thorpe said she removed the knife from his leg and threw it into the kitchen before calling for an ambulance.
The court heard Thorpe initially told police she had found Mr Poole outside her house and did not know how he had come to be stabbed.
She admitted lying and said: "I was scared. I've never been locked up."
After sentencing, Det Chief Insp David Stopford, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Her original account blaming an unknown third party was disproved by the investigation."
