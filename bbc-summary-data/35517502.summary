The New Zealander was happy with the way his side fought back from 13-0 down to lead 16-13 with eight minutes remaining.
But Johnny Sexton's late penalty spoiled what could have been a good day for Wales.
"I'm not satisfied at all - I'm feeling pretty flat at the moment," said Gatland.
"It's disappointing that you've played one game and even though it's not a loss you've taken a couple of trophies out of the cabinet already.
"You can't win the Triple Crown and you can't win the Grand Slam so that's disappointing."
Wales took the lead for the first time in the 72nd minute when substitute fly-half Rhys Priestland - on for the injured Dan Biggar - kicked his third penalty to make the score 16-13.
But a miscued clearance kick by another replacement - scrum-half Lloyd Williams - led to a Welsh infringement which saw Sexton fire over his third penalty to draw Ireland level.
"We didn't start well, but got ourselves back in the game, dominated territory and possession," Gatland said.
"And then to get in front and obviously not execute an exit play accurately enough was disappointing.
"We possibly should have come away with a win but maybe a draw was a fair reflection of the game."
Wales, who name their team to play Scotland next weekend on Wednesday, will have to wait to know the extent of Biggar's injury.
The Scots are coming off the back of their Calcutta Cup defeat against England and seeking a first win in Cardiff since 2002.
Gatland says he is looking forward to the challenge but hopes they will agree to the roof at the re-named Principality Stadium being closed for the match.
"With the weather we have had hopefully they'll agree to close the roof so we can play a little rugby," he added.
"It is the situation - it is our stadium but we do not decide if the roof is closed. It is up to the Scots."
Before kick-off the visitors were forced into a late change by Gareth Anscombe's hamstring injury.
Travelling reserve Liam Williams went into the starting line-up.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was asked whether he thought Wales' late full-back switch was 'gamesmanship'.
Schmidt replied: "Undoubtedly. But it is one of the things that sometimes happens.
"We have to adjust and be ready to go no matter who the opposition are."
After the match Gatland offered his explanation of the late Wales change.
Gatland said: "Gareth's hamstring was tight on Friday so he pulled out of training on Friday so Liam ran at full-back in training and flew over with us.
"Gareth did the captain's run and came through that, but the tightness was still there so the medical decision was made Saturday night that it wasn't worth the risk of starting with Gareth particularly as we didn't have a huge amount of full-back cover and one of our 10s was going to have to go back there."
Gatland added the risk of aggravating or causing further injury was also a factor in leaving Anscombe out, saying a hamstring tear would have been "a six week injury".
