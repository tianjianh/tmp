Morgan, 20, has been out since suffering a shoulder injury in Wales' World Cup quarter-final defeat by South Africa in October.
He is set to return in the Pro12 against Edinburgh in Newport on Sunday.
Asked if Morgan is good enough to challenge British and Irish Lion Davies, Jones replied: "Yes."
Former Wales flanker Jones told BBC Radio Wales: "Jonathan is a very good player, experienced and has different strengths to Tyler.
"But I think Tyler has something as a player that can add to a team at the 13 position.
"So he has a long way to go yet. He's still very young and we don't want to paint people to be something they're not quite at the moment.
"The potential is there, but potential doesn't earn you a living."
Davies, the 27-year-old Clermont Auvergne centre, was absent from the World Cup because of a knee injury.
Morgan benefited with a tournament call-up to take his caps tally to three.
"Well we've all seen the potential with Tyler," added Jones.
"His last game of rugby was against South Africa and he did really well that day."
Jones hopes Morgan can thrive in the latter stages of the Dragons' season to earn a place on Wales' three-Test tour to New Zealand in June.
"I think it's important for him - he's 50 games away from becoming the standard of player he wants to be.
"And in those 50 games he's got a lot of errors to make and a lot of rugby to play.
"How nice would it be that he could go down to New Zealand and to challenge Jonathan Davies for that 13 shirt.
"And that's what the national selectors will be looking for.
"Tyler is desperate for a run of games and we sincerely hope that he can start that on Sunday against Edinburgh."
