The CCTV stills were taken in Nottingham city centre, where Samantha Baldwin, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, was last seen on Monday.
The 40-year-old is believed to be with Louis Madge, 9, and Dylan Madge, 6.
Police said the case was being treated as abduction and confirmed Ms Baldwin did not have legal custody of the boys.
Police earlier revealed they had extended their search to Europe and were "open minded" about whether she had left the UK.
The CCTV images were captured in the waterfront area of Nottingham at about 11:00 BST on Monday and in Cheapside about 30 minutes later.
Supt Rich Fretwell said: "In light of the recently released footage, I would urge people to cast their minds back to Monday 27 March.
"Did you see a woman in a red coat walking in the city? We would like to hear from you if you did."
The family has connections to Lincolnshire and Manchester.
It is not known what clothes the boys, who also use the surname of Taylor, were wearing.
Two women, aged 62 and 36, have been released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.
