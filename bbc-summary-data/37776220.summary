James Hudson: Gloucester forward retires because of injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester second-row forward James Hudson has retired after failing to recover from a serious knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hudson suffered the injury in a pre-season game against fellow Premiership side Exeter in September 2015.
The 34-year-old, who signed for the Cherry and Whites from Newcastle in March 2013, made 146 career Premiership appearances in spells with four clubs.
He will now join Gloucester's training staff as the club's performance nutritionist.
"I feel proud and very lucky to have been able to play for 15 years as a professional and always knew that it would come to an end one day," he said.
"I am now looking forward to starting a new chapter and am delighted that part of that will be with Gloucester."
