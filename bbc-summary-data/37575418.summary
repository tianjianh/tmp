The black and white male has been nicknamed Henry, after King Henry VII who was born at the castle in Pembrokeshire.
The RSPCA said it was a horrible ordeal for Henry, who was very frightened.
He was given antibiotics and pain relief by a vet, and is recovering well.
RSPCA animal collection officer Ellie West said: "It was just by chance someone saw the kitten struggling on the wall. The poor little thing was so frightened. We don't know how he got there.
"He is very sore and bruised and he has torn a bit of his skin on his thigh which should heal. But he is doing really well and is now recovering from his ordeal in our care.
"He's eaten well overnight which is good as he's actually a little skinny under all that fur."
It is believed Henry is a stray cat, but the RSPCA has appealed for information in case he has an owner.
