Police have issued images of two men they want to talk to after a video of anti-Semitic chants before Manchester City's game with Tottenham went viral.

The abuse, which was apparently directed at Spurs fans, took place at about 17:10 on 21 January on a tram heading towards City's Etihad stadium.
A group of men chanted about gas chambers in reference to the Holocaust.
A Manchester City spokesperson encouraged fans with any information to come forward.
The club said it "strongly condemns the use of any anti-Semitic language and we have been working, and continue to work closely, with Greater Manchester Police on this disturbing case".
A 59-year-old man had already been interviewed under caution, police said.
Det Insp Rebecca Boyce said: "The tirade of abuse that was chanted has immensely impacted not only the people at the match, but members of the wider society and we will do everything in our power to make it known that hate crime is absolutely unacceptable."
Most Tottenham fans are not Jewish, but the club has a historical association with London's Jewish community.
