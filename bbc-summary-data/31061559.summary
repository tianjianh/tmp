Wrexham's super-prison's £23m for local economy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The "super-prison" being built in Wrexham will bring £23m a year to the local economy and 1,000 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ministry of Justice and the Wales Office said a total of £30m will also be spent on local businesses as the new £250m prison is built.
They said £1.1m had already been committed to companies in north Wales.
Work started on the prison at Wrexham industrial estate in September and is due to be completed in 2017. With 2,000 inmates it will be the UK's largest.
It is being built on the site of the former Firestone tyre factory.
The construction company Lend Lease, which has been selected to build the prison, is holding a meeting to determine how best to deliver its promises to the community during the construction.
The commitments include 100 new apprenticeships and 500 work placement days per year.
