[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 3-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mansfield Town manager Steve Evans was sent off as his 10-man side were soundly beaten at Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Calum Dyson double and first-half goal from Chris Clements saw the home side ease to their first win in five League Two games.
The Mariners took the lead when a scramble in the penalty area resulted in Tom Bolarinwa's header being cleared off the line, but only to former Stag Clements who bundled the ball home.
Sam Jones had a great chance to double the advantage after the break when Mansfield goalkeeper Jake Kean missed Clements' long ball forward, but Rhys Bennett got back just in time to block the midfielder's shot.
But Grimsby got their second when Dyson took the ball out on the right before charging his way into the box and finishing superbly beyond Kean.
Things went from bad to worse for the visitors when Evans was sent to the stands where he clashed with Blundell Park security staff.
Hayden White then saw red after bringing Bolarinwa down in the box, with Dyson converting from the spot to secure the home side's victory.
