The 34-year-old midfielder left Turf Moor in May, and joined Scottish club Rangers on a free transfer for two years in the summer.
But he had his contract with the Ibrox outfit terminated following a training-ground altercation in September.
Barton was Burnley's player of the year as they won the Championship title last season.
He's not with the first team, he's doing background fitness work with the sports science team
"I said last week if he needed us and wanted to come in he'd be more than welcome, which he is - he's been training with us for a number of days now," said Clarets boss Sean Dyche.
"He's not with the first team, he's doing background fitness work with the sports science team. That's an ongoing thing until things change in the future.
"He's just enjoying being back in and getting himself fit. He was generally fit of course but he's just topping up."
Former Manchester City and Newcastle United player Barton was given a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling during his time north of the border.
The ban will apply should he find another club in the United Kingdom because of an agreement between the home nations.
"He'd had an indifferent time with being away from the club and different things going on in Scotland, so it's about getting him fit and sharp," said Dyche.
"That's good for him, who knows about us? We'll take that on when I see fit."
