The 22-year-old joins from Dutch second-tier side FC Dordrecht following a short spell training with the Royals towards the end of the season.
His move to the Championship club is set to be completed when the transfer window opens on 1 July.

The Netherlands youth international has also played for Universitatea Cluj in Romania and NEC on loan.
"Danzell is a player capable of playing in various positions, with an awful lot of potential," Reading manager Brian McDermott said. "I'm delighted to have secured his services so early in the summer."
