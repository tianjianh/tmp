The partial solar eclipse - which occurred when a new moon hides part of the Sun - was widely visible from Canada and the US, as well as from parts of Mexico.
The event started to unfold near the Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia at around 19:37 GMT.
In the eastern US, the event occurred near sunset (local time).
Between 45% and 64% of the Sun's diameter was covered, depending on where the event was viewed from in the US.
The point of greatest eclipse occurs was 21:44 GMT in Canada's Nunavut Territory near Prince of Wales Island.
2014 had previously witnessed two solar and two lunar eclipses.
