Jordan Thomas, 22, was shot twice in the chest on Derek Dooley Way, Sheffield, on 21 December 2014.
Drug dealer Jama Ahmed, 26, of Broomhall Place, Sheffield, was jailed last month for life for his murder.
Mohammed Ali, 29, Jamal Ali, 26, Saeed Hussein, 26, and Ahmed Warsame, 27, may hold vital information, police said.
Detectives believe all four men, who were living in Sheffield at the time of the shooting, were involved including "a number" of others.
Jama Ahmed was sentenced to a minimum of 36 years for murder and the attempted murder of Neshaun Ferguson, the driver of the car, who was also shot.
Det Ch Insp Victoria Short, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "One man has been held to account for what happened to Jordan, but there are a number of other people who we believe were involved who are evading arrest.
"Jordan was killed by the actions of a group of people working together. Jordan's family were left utterly devastated when Jordan was killed in a pre-planned attack.
"It is our duty to get justice for them, and we continue to search for the other people involved.
"If you've seen them, or know where they are, you should call police and not approach them directly."
Ms Short said people had "gained the courage to come forward with information" after Ahmed's conviction.
"It's fair to say there was a fear of coming forward around what happened to Jordan, but we've certainly seen that people are now increasingly coming forward to help the police since Ahmed was found guilty and jailed for his involvement."
