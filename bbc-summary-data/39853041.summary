Goalkeeper Craig Samson remains out, along with Stephen Pearson, Stephen McManus, Richard Tait, Jacob Blyth, Ross MacLean and Jack McMillan.
Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd will miss the final two games of the season after undergoing knee surgery.
Scott Boyd and Rory McKenzie remain out but defender Greg Taylor returns after serving a one-match ban.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: "Saturday [1-0 win at Hamilton] was a relief more than delight because we knew how important the game was and it was a scrap and a battle, it wasn't the prettiest game in the world.
"What is was though was three points towards our ultimate goal of staying up and we know that we need to follow that up.
"We just have to focus solely on us and put the same level of commitment in to the game that we did on Saturday and add a little bit of quality to that, which I believe will be different being on our home patch."
Kilmarnock interim manager Lee McCulloch: "It will be a hard game, The formation they play can be 3-6-1 at times so there will not be a lot of room in the middle of the pitch. We will need to pass the ball well.
"With the situation they are in, it will be a great atmosphere under the lights.
"It's my old club so I know the Motherwell fans can get behind their club very well.
"We discussed the atmosphere. We're going to have to deal with it, we're going to need to deal with the pressure they put on us so the quicker we can pass the ball the better."
