Protesters have unveiled a seven-mile "peace scarf" as part of a protest in Berkshire against replacing the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.

The scarf, which took thousands of hours to knit, was stretched from the Atomic Weapons Establishments in Aldermaston to Burghfield.
It was created from hundreds of pieces of knitting made across the world and took about five hours to assemble.
Campaigners have spent the past eight months making the scarf.
Police closed several roads for about five minutes at 13:00 BST, to enable all of the pieces of material to be connected for the whole seven-mile distance.
The sites in Aldermaston and Burghfield provide the warheads for the submarine-launched missile system.
Symon Hill, from Action AWE, said: "It's a creative way of making a point that is shared by millions of people around the world, which is concern about the impact of nuclear weapons if they're used.
"It costs Â£100bn to renew Trident at a time when we are experiencing cuts to public services and the welfare state that we need."
The scarf was assembled by hundreds of people on the morning of the protest using ribbons and safety pins.
The demonstration was organised by Action Atomic Weapon Eradication (AWE) and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).
A final decision on whether to renew Trident, the UK's nuclear deterrent, is due in 2016.
