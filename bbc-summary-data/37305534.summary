Bronze book stolen from Borders poet's memorial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bronze book has been stolen from the top of a memorial cairn between two Borders villages.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was taken from the top of the monument honouring poet William Henry Ogilvie some time between 27 July and 24 August.
The cairn is situated next to the B711 in the Horn Hill area between the villages of Roberton and Ashkirk.
Police said they were keen to return the "distinctive item" to its "rightful place".
"I'd urge anyone who may have information on its current whereabouts to get in touch," said PC Lesley Shiell.
"Likewise, anyone who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in the area during this time is asked to come forward."
Ogilvie was born in 1869 near Kelso but moved to Australia in 1889 before returning to Scotland in 1901.
He published numerous poetry collections and enjoyed great popularity in both countries.
He died on 30 January 1963 at Ashkirk near Selkirk.
