[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sussex Police said a man from Shrewsbury was being held over allegations of rape and sexual assault on a teenage girl in West Sussex.
The alleged incidents are said to have occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
A 65-year-old man was also arrested in North Yorkshire over the case.
A letter has been sent home to parents of pupils at the school informing them of the man's suspension.
In a statement the school - whose former pupils include Charles Darwin, Michael Palin and John Peel - said it was fully co-operating with the police investigation.
"At present, there is no indication that the investigation involves any activity during the individual's employment at Shrewsbury School and there is no suggestion that pupils at the school have been put at risk or harmed in any way," it said.
"Nevertheless, the school is committed to taking all necessary measures to protect pupil welfare and is taking a number of steps to support pupils who may be concerned and to minimise any disruption caused by the suspension."
A spokesman for Sussex Police, which is leading the investigation, said its enquiries were ongoing.
