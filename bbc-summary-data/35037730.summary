Go Kids Go, in Raw Dykes Road, Leicester, was shut down by the city council due to an "imminent risk of injury" after an inspection last week.
Environmental health officers said they were satisfied steps had been taken to stop mice moving around the building.
In a statement, the business said the centre was now "safe to operate".
