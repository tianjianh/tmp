Social Bite said 10 homes would be built in Granton to provide a low cost, safe environment for up to 20 people.
The social enterprise said it wanted to create a model to end the "vicious cycle" of homelessness.
Work on the village is expected to begin in early 2017, with the first residents expected to move into their homes by the summer.
Social Bite is working with EDI Group, City of Edinburgh Council and other homelessness charities on the project.
Residents will stay for 12 months each and live in a "managed environment" where they can learn new skills. The site will not be open to people with serious addiction problems.
After a year they will move onto permanent accommodation and be offered employment by Social Bite or the company's partners.
The firm's co-founder Josh Littlejohn said: "The Social Bite Village plan hopes to create a full-circle solution to the issue of homelessness - from housing to support to employment.
"In doing so we hope to alter the course of some of Scotland's most vulnerable people for the better - swapping a destiny of poverty and exclusion for one of compassionate support and inclusion."
All the units being built in the village are transportable and could be moved to another site in the future.
The structures will be based on the modular "NestHouse" developed by Jonathan Avery Tiny House Scotland. Each house is expected to cost about Â£30,000.
Councillor Joan Griffiths, vice convener of health, social care and housing at City of Edinburgh Council, said: "Tackling homelessness remains a priority for the council and we work closely with our third sector partners to provide services for people who are homeless.
"Josh and the Social Bite team do so much good work for homeless people across the city already and we look forward to working with them on their plans going forward."
