Marcus Rashford has done his chances of making England's final Euro 2016 squad "no harm" with his performance against Australia, says manager Roy Hodgson.

The 18-year-old striker started in the 2-1 win and became England's youngest player to score on his debut.
"It was fantastic, he did very well and I am pleased for him on his debut," said Hodgson. "He would not be out of place in anyone's 23."
Hodgson has to trim his squad from 26 to 23 by Tuesday, 31 May.
Rashford played because injury-prone forward Daniel Sturridge was sidelined with a calf problem, although Hodgson played down the prospect of the Liverpool striker missing out unless he fails to recover.
England play Portugal in their final warm-up match on Thursday, 2 June before their first game at Euro 2016 against Russia on 11 June.
"He has a minor injury and we hope it will settle down," said the England boss.
"He'll be throwing his hat into the ring. If it turns out his injury would keep him out the Euros or he would be unfit when we play Russia, that might make a difference.
"But I have no indication the seriousness of the injury is such it is putting his chances in jeopardy at all."
Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere both started against Australia following lengthy injury absences.
Liverpool's Henderson has only recently returned from five weeks out with a knee injury, while Wilshere made his only start of the season against Aston Villa in Arsenal's final game of the Premier League campaign.
"I don't think it's fitness dependant (with them)," said Hodgson. "We've had two matches and plenty of training matches so wouldn't be using that as an excuse.
"Both have proved, with their performances in training and by getting through one-and-a-half games, they are ready and will be more ready as we move forward."
England have beaten Turkey and Australia in their two friendly games in the build up to Euro 2016 in France.
Hodgson has already indicated midfielder Fabian Delph will be left out and now has to leave out two more players.
"It isn't just a question of quality of player but it's also about the balance of the team," he said.
"There's a lot of factors to consider and we've been doing that non-stop in the build-up and playing two different teams has given me a chance to test some things out."
