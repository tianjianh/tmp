For many people like Sam Smith, who took home four trophies, the Mobos were a highlight of the year.

But for some viewers watching at home, the event was labelled a "shambles" on social media sites like Twitter.
Others also criticised the number of white award winners at an event that celebrates "music of black origin".
Complaints were made about the sound, while some people said the hosts seemed to have trouble with the autocue and pronunciation.
Skepta said he had to find his own way of getting into the Mobo ceremony.
And another nominee in the best grime category, Sox, also claimed earlier in the day that he hadn't been given a ticket to attend the event, held at Wembley Arena.
Mobo organisers have told Newsbeat that inside the venue the sound quality was good but they are looking into whether there were any technical issues.
They also said tickets for nominees are usually handled through the artist's record label.
Hosted by The X Factor co-stars Mel B and Sarah-Jane Crawford, performances on the night came from Nicole Scherzinger, Professor Green & Tori Kelly, Tinie Tempah and Candi Staton.
Other winners included Jessie J, who picked up best female act, while best hip-hop act went to Krept & Konan.
The best grime act, in association with 1Xtra, was won by Stormzy.
Speaking about his four wins at the ceremony, Sam Smith said: "It's surreal.
"I came last year and really wanted to win best newcomer but didn't and to come back and win four awards is ridiculous. I am overwhelmed."
He took home best R&B/soul, best male, best song and best album.
Smith joked: "I don't know what to do with my awards. I need to get a cabinet."
Idris Elba, Beyonce and Ella Eyre also won trophies at the Mobos, which first launched in 1996.
Organised by Kanya King, the annual event "is about the celebration and influence of black music, regardless of race, nationality or heritage".
