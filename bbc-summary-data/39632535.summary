A Fife man has been convicted of a series of sexual and domestic abuse crimes which began when he was aged 10.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Wayne Watt, 46, was found guilty of rape and violent offences against women and children in the Kirkcaldy area over a 37-year-period.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard he also assaulted a female police officer while being interviewed in custody.
Several women said they were attacked by Watt between 1979 and 2016 in Kirkcaldy.
Det Insp James Leeson, of Police Scotland, said: "The suffering that Kenneth Watt inflicted on his victims over the largest part of his life is deplorable.
"His arrest came as a result of a thorough police investigation.
"However, I want to commend the courage of the women who were brave enough to come forward and give evidence against him which has been crucial in securing this conviction.
"I would like to thank each of these individuals for all of their assistance and support throughout our inquiries and the subsequent court trial.
"I hope that they can take some comfort following today's verdict and begin to move forward with their lives."
