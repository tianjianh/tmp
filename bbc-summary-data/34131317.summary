Texas authorities say a new video shows that a man killed by police officers was holding what appears to be a knife when he was shot.

An earlier video taken by a bystander shows Gilbert Flores, 41, with his hands up before being shot, though one of his arms is obscured from view.
Police said the second video shows Flores with his hands up but also shows him holding what looks like a blade.
Officials did not release the second video or disclose the source.
San Antonio police officers Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez were responding to a call about a domestic dispute on Friday when they confronted Flores outside his home.
The officers said a woman inside the house had a gash to her head and was holding a baby who appeared to be injured.
Sheriff Susan Pamerleau would not say whether investigators recovered a knife from the scene after the shooting.
Mr Vasquez and Mr Sanchez have been placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated by the sheriff's department.
"Certainly, what's in the video is a cause for concern," said Ms Pamerleau, adding that the investigation must be allowed to run its course.
Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood said on CNN that both deputies have only given statements and he has not spoken to either of them about what happened.
"It was a volatile situation ... it would be premature to make a conclusion," he said.
The initial video was recorded from some distance.
The fatal shooting a year ago of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by a white police officer sparked protests and a national debate about racial bias and the use of force by police.
