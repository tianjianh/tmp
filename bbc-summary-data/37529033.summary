A large nest of invasive hornets - which kill honey bees - has been removed and destroyed.

Last month a single Asian hornet was found near Tetbury, Gloucestershire - the first time the species had been seen in Britain.
Since then a nest was found nearby at the top of a 55ft (16.8m) conifer tree.
A spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Agency said no more live sightings had been made in the area after the nest was removed.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had previously set up a three-mile (5km) surveillance zone following the original find.
It said it had been anticipating the hornets' arrival "for some years" and had a "well-established protocol in place to eradicate them".
The Asian hornet is now common across Europe after being accidentally introduced to France in 2004 in a shipment of pottery from China.
In the summer, the non-native species was discovered in the Channel Islands of Jersey and Alderney for the first time.
