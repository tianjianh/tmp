The Murray brothers, so successful in Great Britain's Davis Cup triumph last year, are expected to team up again at the Games in Rio.
Fleming, 31, is looking for a strong showing at the French Open to be considered as a partner for Dom Inglot.
"If I could enter with Dom that would be a dream come true," Fleming told BBC Scotland.
"Dom will probably be hoping someone gets up the rankings enough to have someone to play with because he deserves to be there."
Englishman Inglot is currently 29th on the ATP list, with Fleming 61st in the standings.
Fleming and his Israeli partner Jonathan Erlich are through to the second round of the French Open, where they will meet 14th seeds Daniel Nestor and Aisam Qureshi.
The Scot has reached the last eight at Grand Slam level twice - with Ross Hutchins and Jonathan Marray,
Fleming and Hutchins also qualified for the London Olympics in 2012 but suffered a first-round loss.
With Inglot doing well and Australian Open champion Jamie Murray ranked in the world's top three, Fleming missed out on Britain's 2015 Davis Cup victory.
"I had about five years as pretty much a mainstay of the team," he said. "Those are times I'll never forget, they were always the highlights of the year.
"I always said when I was in the team that it was something you need to go out and earn on the court.
"Jamie and Dom have been doing great and they're ranked above me. They deserve to be in the team.
"It's something I'd love to do again but I need to get my ranking up."
Meanwhile, Jamie Murray and his Brazilian partner, Bruno Soares, kept their winning grand slam run going with victory in the first round of the French Open.
The Australian Open champions are the fourth seeds in Paris and defeated Russian pair Evgeny Donskoy and Andrey Kuznetsov 6-3 6-3.
