Officers also found an AK47-style assault rifle after they were called to reports of a fight in East Street, Bromley, at about 04:30 GMT.
Up to 10 men were involved in the brawl which was spotted by CCTV operators, who traced a man to a Bromley address.
Two men, aged 32 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences.
Officers said the three weapons found at the property were not capable of firing and were decommissioned.
In a statement, the Met Police said: "The group fighting had dispersed upon arrival of officers at the scene but using CCTV, the man with the suspected firearm was traced to a nearby address in Market Square, Bromley.
"Although the weapons were not capable of firing, the presence of firearms in a public place causes panic and fear of violence."
