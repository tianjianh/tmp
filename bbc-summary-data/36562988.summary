Police said it was "unbelievable" Gavin Collett, of Bramber Road, Broadwater, West Sussex had not "killed himself or anyone else".
He sped past red lights, into oncoming traffic at "ridiculous speeds" and along a pedestrianised street.
He was first spotted speeding on the A24 north of Findon on 10 March.
He crashed at a junction with the A27 near Worthing, continued riding without a helmet between Brighton and Hove before crashing at Churchill Square car park.
He was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court to 18 months for dangerous driving and to three months each on two charges of failing to stop after a road traffic collision.
Officers had tracked him by helicopter but decided it was too dangerous to pursue him on the road without risking others.
Collett had fled on foot in Brighton, but handed himself into police at Portsmouth three days later.
PC Ben Henwood of Sussex Police's road unit said: "Collett showed a blatant disregard for anyone else's safety and it's a miracle no one else was hurt.
"He went straight across the flow of oncoming traffic at ridiculous speeds, he went through the fully pedestrianised area of Montague Street in Worthing, he mounted pavements to undertake cars when pedestrians were present, and he travelled at breakneck speed between Goring and Ferring when there was no margin for error at all.
"He's lucky to be alive."
Collect received no penalty on a further charge of driving while disqualified or without insurance.
Judge Jeremy Gold told him: "At the moment your behaviour is putting yourself and more importantly the public in danger. This is an extraordinarily bad case of dangerous driving.
"Only you can change your life," he added.
The 32-year-old had admitted all the charges at an earlier hearing.
Collett was also disqualified from driving for three years.
