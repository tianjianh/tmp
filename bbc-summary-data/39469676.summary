Only four other managers have achieved the feat - Pep Guardiola, Guus Hiddink, Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti.
"Sometimes you have to pinch yourself in terms of the names being mentioned," Shakespeare, 53, said.
"To be mentioned in the same breath as them, it makes me very proud."
Saturday's 2-0 win over Stoke lifted the Foxes above West Ham and Burnley and into 13th place.
The defending champions are six points clear of the relegation zone, with nine games left.
When Shakespeare took charge following Claudio Ranieri's sacking at the end of February, Leicester were only a point above the bottom three, had lost five league games in a row and were yet to score a league goal in 2017.
Since then, they have beaten Liverpool, Hull, West Ham and now the Potters, scoring 11 goals and conceding four.
Shakespeare, who has also guided the Foxes into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, will make it five league wins in a row if his side beat bottom side Sunderland at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday (19:45 BST).
