[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahmed, who joined the BBC in 2014, said he was "delighted and privileged to be moving to this new, connected, role".
Formerly business editor of the Sunday Telegraph, Ahmed has also worked for The Guardian, The Observer and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.
James Harding, the BBC's director of news, said he would "bring intelligence and insight" to his new position.
The business editor role has been vacant since ITV appointed Peston as its new political editor.
According to the BBC, Ahmed "will lead the BBC's economic coverage and will have a broad remit on finance policy stories".
Ahmed's own replacement will be appointed "early in the New Year".
