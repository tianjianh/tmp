Federico Macheda: Cardiff striker joins Nottingham Forest on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest have signed Cardiff City striker Federico Macheda on loan, subject to international clearance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old ex-Manchester United forward will stay at the City Ground until the end of the season.
Macheda has not started a Championship match this season, with all but one of his eight appearances for the Bluebirds coming as a substitute.
Meanwhile, Forest midfielder David Vaughan has signed a one-year contract until the summer of 2017.
But Andre Moritz, who Forest were chasing, will not be joining the club.
The deal for midfielder Moritz fell through because of complications getting him released from his contract with Thai Premier League side Buriram United.
Macheda began his career at Old Trafford and played for QPR, Stuttgart, Doncaster Rovers and Birmingham City on loan before joining Cardiff in May 2014.
He has only started 13 league games for the Welsh side and boss Russell Slade said they wanted him to "go and get a few games" - but confirmed there would be a 24-hour recall clause in any deal.
