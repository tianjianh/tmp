Falkirk 3-0 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk moved to within three points of second-placed Dundee United with an emphatic win in Saturday's only Scottish Championship fixture.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Baird's early headed opener was added to by Aaron Muirhead's penalty, which followed a foul by goalkeeper Luis Zwick on Nathan Austin.
And James Craigen struck the home side's third on the hour mark.
Austin also had a headed effort ruled out for a foul in a dominant Falkirk display.
Falkirk started strongly and took the lead with a goal which flowed from an excellent piece of refereeing by Euan Anderson.
Anderson did really well to waive play on when Myles Hippolyte was being fouled as he charged forward from midfield and from his pass Lee Miller crossed to Baird, who headed his 10th goal of the season.
Muirhead then had a header from a corner well saved by Zwick as the home side continued to press.
United captain Willo Flood was perhaps lucky to escape with just a yellow card for a crashing foul on Craig Sibbald on the half-hour mark.
The Tangerines' Blair Spittal had a shot deflected for a corner from which Thomas Mikkelsen's header floated on to the top of the bar.
Falkirk doubled their lead when substitute Austin was brought down in the box by Zwick, who was booked, and Muirhead blasted home.
The home fans wanted Zwick ordered off for the challenge but they forgot all about that minutes later when the keeper lost a cross from the left and Craigen was on hand to grab a decisive third goal.
Austin also found the net but was penalised as United remained six points behind Hibernian.
Falkirk are level on points with Greenock Morton with a superior goal difference but Morton have a game in hand.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "We are absolutely delighted with that win, we got off to the perfect start with the goal and our keeper never really had to make a save in the game.
"It was a big result for us and that is 13 points out of the last 15 available, so we are getting a level of consistency that we were not achieving earlier in the season. It also puts us nine points clear of Queen of the South and that is also important.
"The play-offs are the target, that is where we should be and this gives us a big lift towards that."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "That was a massive disappointment - this as a real opportunity to put some pressure on Hibs and we failed miserably.
"That performance was not nearly good enough, it was unacceptable and I can only apologise to our fans. I really felt for the fans as that was the most inept we have been all season, particularly after we did well last week.
"The two goals we lost in the second half were comical, especially the third where we had three people in the box who failed to clear the ball. It was just not good enough."
