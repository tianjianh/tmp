Experts hope to catch polecats, weasels and otters on camera as well as foxes and badgers in a bid to understand the wildlife diversity in an official area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB).
A similar project in parks in February caught 37 species on camera in north east Wales.
Films will be published online by project organisers, NatureSpy.
The cameras, which are about the size of a person's hand and can run on a set of AA batteries for up to a year, will cover a mix of suburban and isolated countryside.
They are triggered by a passive infrared sensor which detects when something warmer than the surrounding environment passes by.
NatureSpy wildlife biologist James McConnell said: "We're hoping to collect data on the variety and numbers of species in the AONB, where they live, how they move around the area, and crucially, the difference in their behaviour according to the proximity of human activity.
"For example we already know that rural foxes are much more cautious than urban foxes, who have lost much of their natural inhibition and are more boisterous, and we're keen to discover if there are similar differences in other species."
