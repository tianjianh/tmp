[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Golding won 10 of the last 11 games to beat German Gojowczyk 6-4 6-1 and end a five-match losing streak.
The world number 352 needs two more wins to make in the main draw at Wimbledon for a second time and meets Swiss Marco Chiudinelli next.
The only other British winner was Brydan Klein.
Klein, 24, prevailed against Belgian Maxime Authom, who retired injured after losing the first game of the second set. Klein took the first 6-3.
Golding, who won the US Open junior title in 2011, played at Wimbledon in 2012 after being given a wildcard.
He is joined in the second round by Aljaz Bedene, who is hoping to change nationality from Slovenian to British, after he beat Ireland's James McGee 6-4 6-4.
Another man who progressed is Belgium's Steve Darcis. He caused one of the biggest shocks of last year's tournament by defeating Rafael Nadal in the opening round.
