Hull City fined £20,000 by FA for failing to control their players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull have been fined £20,000 by the Football Association after admitting a misconduct charge for failing to control their players in a Premier League game against Arsenal.

The charges relate to a 55th-minute incident in Hull's 2-0 defeat at Emirates Stadium on 11 February.
Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs was booked for a foul on Hull winger Lazar Markovic.
Hull were charged with failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.
The away side's frustrations began in the 34th minute when the ball appeared to come off Alexis Sanchez's hand and ended up in the net.
After consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal.
Hull were then chasing the game in the second half when Gibbs, who was the last defender, brought down Markovic, who would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.
When Clattenburg produced a yellow card for the incident, the Hull players surrounded the referee.
It could be Clattenburg's final English top-flight game, as he is  quitting his job as a Premier League official to become Saudi Arabia's new head of referees.
