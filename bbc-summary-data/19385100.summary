A pair of Elvis Presley's underpants are expected to reach up to £10,000 when they are sold at auction.

Unwashed and still soiled with stains, the pants were worn beneath one of Presley's famous white jumpsuits during a performance in 1977.
The light blue briefs will go under the hammer at an auction of Elvis Presley pop memorabilia in Stockport, Greater Manchester, next month.
Presley died 35 years ago this month, on August 16 1977.
There is expected to be a lot of interest in the auction from his fans from across the globe.
The singer did not want any lines visible while he was on stage and this pair of underwear was obtained from the estate of Vernon Presley, the star's father.
Also up for sale is his personal Holy Bible, which is expected to raise up to £25,000.
The bible was given to Presley on his first Christmas at Graceland in 1957 and used throughout his life.
It contains his handwritten notes, thoughts, annotations and underlining throughout.
Poignantly, one of the many lines emphasised by the entertainer states: "What is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away."
Also on sale is 16mm film footage taken from Priscilla Presley's own personal home movies of the singer, especially of their holidays and their daughter Lisa.
It also includes footage of their wedding and the very first time Elvis and Priscilla brought their daughter home to Graceland from the hospital, Christmas inside Graceland and other special family moments.
The auction will be streamed live from the Omega Auctions website on 8 September.
