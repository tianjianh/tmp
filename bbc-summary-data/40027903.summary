The 25-year-old Romanian tore an ankle ligament during the Italian Open final.
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed," said Halep, the beaten finalist at Roland Garros in 2014. "Doctors say it's 50-50 at the moment but it's made good improvement since Sunday."
British number four Tara Moore will not be in Paris after losing 6-2 7-5 in qualifying to Taiwan's Kai-Chen Chang.
