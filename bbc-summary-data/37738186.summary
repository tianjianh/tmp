[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: Dundee United 1-0 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Durnan's first goal of the season eight minutes from time was enough to give Dundee Utd a win that keeps them three points behind leaders Hibernian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender got forward to do what the strikers couldn't by forcing the ball past Falkirk goalkeeper Danny Rogers from eight yards.
That was particularly tough on someone who had made some important saves, including twice from Tony Andreu.
He also denied Scott Fraser with a fine block, but the winner was deserved.
United manager Ray McKinnon would be as relieved as he was pleased after seeing his side lose to late goals when the teams met at the Falkirk Stadium last month.
They haven't looked back since then and are now unbeaten in their last five league matches, taking 13 points in the process.
That has seen them significantly narrow the gap on Hibs at the top in recent weeks and McKinnon is determined to keep up the pressure on Neil Lennon's side.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston was disappointed to see his side lose for the second successive week but was much happier with the performance than they produced in defeat against Raith the previous Saturday.
In fact, if full back Luke Leahy had shown more composure when one-on-one with Cammy Bell in the second half, they might well have left with a win.
Houston is a realist, though, and he knows that if they can stay in contention for the promotion play-off places then they could yet play in the Premiership next season.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "We have gradually got ourselves into contention in this league.
"It has been a stop-start time with a lot of new faces and people gelling, but when we got into second place, we didn't want to give that up.
"We want to keep moving forward as a team and you could tell by the players' reactions at the end that it was an important victory."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "If we are being honest, a club this size is fighting for a play-off place as we can beat anyone in a two-leg game.
"We have beaten Dundee United 3-1 at the Falkirk Stadium and lost to them here with a late goal.
"That shows we are not too far away from a club that has got far bigger resources, far bigger budgets and can bring more quality in."
