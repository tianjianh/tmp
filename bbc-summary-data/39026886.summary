Mystery ashes abandoned on Brightlingsea promenade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A box containing the ashes of someone called Rupert has been found on a seafront, prompting a police appeal for the owner to come forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wooden box, which appears to have been abandoned, was found on Brightlingsea promenade in Essex earlier this month.
It is inscribed: "In loving memory of our special friend Rupert, 1978-2003."
Essex Police said they had no idea whether 25-year-old Rupert was a person or a much-loved animal.
If no-one comes forward, the force said the ashes would be interred by the police chaplain.
