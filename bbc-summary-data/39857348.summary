On 14 April 2014, 276 schoolgirls, aged 16 to 18, were kidnapped as they were preparing for their exams in a boarding school.
They were in the north of the country, an area called Chibok, Borno state. Parts of that area are dangerous because of fighting between the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram and the government of Nigeria.
Boko Haram took the girls because they are against children - especially girls - getting an education, like they do in the UK.
At the time people all over the world who were shocked by the story and they started a campaign called #BringBackOurGirls.
Many of the girls have managed to escape or been freed since then, but more than 100 are still missing.
