Halloween: Snapchat, Conchita and last minute costumes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You've put off planning Halloween and now you have less than 24 hours to cobble together a costume.

Fear not.
These ideas may be basic, but your friends will applaud your creativity.
Plus, these costumes are quick, easy and cheap to make.
You need: A sheet, scissors. Optional extra: Yellow face paint, yellow washing up gloves, red and black marker pen.
How to: Take the sheet and cut out holes for eyes. For a Snapchat ghost, cut your sheet to ankle length, make the edges more frilly and then pop over your head. Make sure you wiggle up and down, like the bouncy Snapchat ghost upon arrival at the party.
Optional extra: Use face paint to colour the area around your eyes yellow and draw on a smiley mouth with the marker pen. Wear yellow washing up gloves.
You need: Grey paint colour sample chart, sticky tape. Alternatively just wear lots of grey. Grey hat, grey gloves, grey socks.. (you get the picture).
How to: Wear the grey outfit. Tape the paint samples to you. Voila! You are fifty shades of grey.
You need: A smart suit, a wolf mask.
How to: Put on the mask and the suit. Keep asking for directions to New York.
Remember the launch of the iPhone 6? Well it wasn't smartphones that stole the show, it was Tommy Krul, or as Twitter nicknamed him: Scarf Guy. His appearance on stage saw rumours sweep across social networks about the meaning of the purple scarf. There were even parody twitter accounts made. When Krul isn't transfixing Twitter, he is co-founder and chief technical officer of gaming company Super Evil Megacorp.
You need: One long purple scarf. One pale purple shirt. One apple.
How to: Throw scarf casually over shoulder until it's almost completely around your shoulders. Talk about wearables and Silicon Valley. Take bite out of apple.
Spoilers, when you give away the plot of a film or TV show, have been more prevalent than ever in 2014. With people on Twitter and Facebook as well as media outlets clamouring to be the first to break the news of the finale, it's hard to avoid finding out what happens too soon.
You need: Sticky notes, sticky tape, intimate knowledge of popular TV shows and films.
How to: Write spoilers for shows such as Breaking Bad, Sixth Sense, Star Wars. Tape to body. Be prepared to incur rage.
The Austrian Eurovision winner has become a global star since the international singing concert in May. She has spoken out against homophobia and battled prejudice in Russia as well as attracting millions of fans who love her singing. Her look is sheer, unashamed glamour.
You need: A flowing dress, make up and a hairbrush (for the microphone).
How to: Dress yourself as glamorously as possible, then if you're not lucky enough to have a beard, draw one on. Sing Rise Like A Phoenix.
There have been a whole host of apologies this year, from the less formal (Bono apologising for U2's iTunes album release) to the very formal (David Cameron apologising to the Queen for being indiscrete about her reaction to the Scottish referendum).
You need: A suit with a tie, bowtie or sparkly dress. Formal clothes essentially. Cardboard, string or a ribbon. A black marker.
How to: Puncture two holes in cardboard. Write "Sorry" on the cardboard and make a loop with the ribbon. Hang around neck.
How to: Dress like a jogger. Try and avoid bumping into important people.
