The intrepid reporter and his faithful dog Snowy are starring in an open-air opera in Belgium.
The Castafiore Emerald, a musical adaptation of the 1963 adventure by Belgian author Herge, made its debut on Thursday at the Chateau de la Hulpe.
Produced by Belgium's Opera For All, the lyrical comedy features characters including Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins.
The plot features opera diva Bianca Castafiore, during a visit to Marlinspike Hall - Captain Haddock's country retreat - and the subsequent theft of her jewellery.
It is noted for being the only book in the Tintin series where the characters remain at Marlinspike Hall.
"I've always found it the most musical of Herge's books," director Francois de Carpentries told AFP, adding that turning Tintin into an opera "is a childhood dream come true".
The musical's dialogue is set to some of opera's best-loved tunes.
Tintin was adapted into a live action film by Steven Spielberg in 2011, while David Greig and Rufus Norris adapted Tintin in Tibet for the stage in 2005, with Russell Tovey in the lead role.
The Castafiore Emerald runs for 10 days at Chateau de la Hulpe, with expectations that it will tour thereafter.
