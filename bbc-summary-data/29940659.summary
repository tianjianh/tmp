World's End: Sinclair's version 'does not fit' evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The World's End trial has heard that the accused's version of events does not fit with forensic evidence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angus Sinclair, 69, denies raping and murdering 17-year-olds Helen Scott and Christine Eadie in October 1977.
He is accused of carrying out the attacks along with his late brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton.
Scientist Andrew Davidson said Mr Sinclair's version of events did not fit the DNA evidence on Ms Scott's coat.
Mr Sinclair said he had consensual sex with the girls and blames his brother-in-law for the teenagers' murders.
Mr Davidson, a forensic scientist who works for the Chorley-based organisation Cellmark, co-authored a report on the findings with forensic scientist Geraldine Davidson, the jury was told.
The High Court in Livingston has already heard six days of evidence from Ms Davidson about the results contained in the report.
Mr Davidson carried out DNA analysis on various items of clothing found on the bodies of Ms Eadie and Ms Scott, including tights and belts used as ligatures to bind the girls.
He said he considered potential time frames after he became aware of Mr Sinclair's version of events.
He said Mr Sinclair's claim that he had consensual sex with the girls in his caravanette in Holyrood Park in Edinburgh, and then drove to East Lothian where he left the girls alive and unharmed, did not tally with the DNA evidence matching Mr Sinclair that he saw on Ms Scott's coat.
He said it was more likely to have been deposited closer to the time her body was left in a field in East Lothian.
The Lord Advocate also said the court had previously heard evidence that Ms Scott had walked in the field.
Christine and Helen, both 17, were last seen at the World's End pub in Edinburgh on October 15 1977.
Ms Eadie's body was found the following afternoon at Gosford Bay in Aberlady, East Lothian, while Ms Scott's body was discovered a few hours later in a wheat field near Haddington.
The jury has heard a defence report detailing Sinclair's version of events, in which he claims he and Hamilton had consensual sexual intercourse with both girls in a vehicle in Holyrood Park, after which Sinclair left to go fishing.
He claims the girls were "alive and unharmed" when he left their company, and he has lodged three special defences of consent, alibi and incrimination.
Mr Sinclair is alleged to have gagged the girls, bound their wrists and tied a ligature around their necks.
He denies inflicting blunt force injuries on Ms Eadie by repeatedly punching and kicking her on the body and biting her.
He also denies forcing Ms Scott to walk barefoot into a field, ripping the strap from her handbag, repeatedly punching and kicking her on the head and body and stamping on her head.
And he denies stealing clothing, footwear, jewellery and other personal effects from the teenagers in an attempt to pervert the course of justice.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
