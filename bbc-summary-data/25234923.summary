[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £750,000 community recycling centre for Kelso is among the proposals for a new waste strategy unveiled for the Scottish Borders.

Weekly food waste collections are also planned but the garden refuse uplift service will come to an end.
At the moment people from the Kelso area have to travel to recycling sites in Duns, Selkirk or Galashiels.
After the Kelso facility opens there will be few settlements in the region more than 10 miles from such a service.
Meanwhile, a food waste collection service will be introduced in Galashiels, Tweedbank, Hawick, Selkirk, Jedburgh and Peebles in the spring or summer of 2015.
Households will be issued with kitchen "caddies" and an outdoor caddy which can be put out at the kerbside for a weekly uplift.
The garden waste uplift in Borders towns, which currently costs £450,000 a year to operate, will cease at the end of March next year.
The council said it had no legal obligation to provide the service and could not afford to continue it.
Householders will be offered a free composting unit or they can take their garden refuse to a recycling centre.
