Wrexham manager Dean Keates says he has transfer targets in mind as he plans ahead to next season's National League campaign.

The Dragons will be away to Eastleigh in Saturday's final game of the season.
Keates says planning for 2017-18 has already started and he has held talks with prospective new signings.
"All being well we can get the people that we want and build something and give the fans something to be excited about," Keates said.
"We want people coming in who are going to be honest, play with some passion that the fans deserve and have the right desire and work rate."
Wrexham, 12th in the table after Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Dagenham & Redbridge, launched a 'Build the Budget' fund earlier this year which has been set up to assist Keates with his budget for next season.
The fund has raised over Â£40,000 and Keates said he would use the money to strengthen his squad.
The former Wrexham captain has already made changes to the club's squad since succeeding Gary Mills in October 2016 and has been pleased with the progress.
"We came in and the club weren't in a great position," Keates added.
"There's been a lot of changes off the field within the squad and with the infrastructure and the club's in a lot better place."
