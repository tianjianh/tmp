A man has been jailed for killing his girlfriend in a bungled suicide pact.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Cole admitted manslaughter following the death of Leonie Roberts in a country lane in Cornwall.
Cole was semi-conscious when he was pulled out of a car by police but Miss Roberts, 28, from Chepstow was found dead in the vehicle parked in a lane near Looe, in June 2013.
The 36-year-old barman from Havant, Hampshire was given a four-year jail sentence at Exeter Crown Court.
The pair had started an on-off relationship when they worked together in a bar in Miss Roberts' hometown of Chepstow in Monmouthshire.
The couple spent the days leading up to Miss Roberts' death fulfilling their last wishes with Â£5,000 Cole had stolen from the pub where he was working at the time.
The court heard that the pact was Miss Roberts' idea and that she had persuaded Cole to join her.
She had left notes saying she was planning to take her own life with or without Cole's help but had asked him to join her in death.
Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Cole he should have tried to dissuade her but instead stole the gas cylinders used in the pact.
