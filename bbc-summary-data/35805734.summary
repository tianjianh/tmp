The Togolese FA wrote a letter to Caf, saying it was concerned following recent terrorist attacks in Tunisia.
But Caf stated in a reply that the Group A match will take place in Monastir on 25 March as scheduled.
Togo's FA has accepted the decision but will continue to monitor the situation.
Pierre Lamadokou, secretary general at Togo's FA, told BBC Sport: "If  Caf wants us to play there , despite our request, then we will do it but it will be Caf's responsibility to make sure that the conditions are good.
"But if Togolese authorities notice in the coming days that the situation worsens in Tunisia, then they will advise."
