A 100m exclusion zone was set up around a flat in Belvoir Crescent, Newhall, near Swadlincote, on Saturday.
A series of controlled explosions were carried out and, after a search, residents returned on Sunday afternoon.
Glenn Robinson, 55, was remanded in custody after a hearing at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court.
He was charged with making and possessing explosives and possession of a class B drug.
Supt Paul Callum, from Derbyshire Police, said Army advice was followed during the operation.
"I appreciate that people were looking forward to a sunny Saturday evening, maybe having a barbeque," he said.
"But when the bomb disposal squad attended the scene, they recommended the 100m zone and we put that into effect."
