International artists such as Joe Locke, Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis and Kamasi Washington will perform at venues across the city from 22 June.
The four-day festival will also feature Scottish and UK talent such as Carol Kidd, Ryan Quigley and Hamish Stuart.
To tie-in with the anniversary theme, up-and-coming musicians within the Scottish Jazz scene will also perform as part of the "30 Under 30" programme.
Glasgow Jazz festival director Jill Rodger said the organising team was "very excited to be launching the 30th" programme.
"I can't wait to introduce the array of exciting big name artists to the Glasgow Jazz Festival stage, to welcome back old friends and showcase some fantastic new, one-off collaborations," she said.
"I am especially looking forward to celebrating the "30 Under 30" musicians - the collection of young Scottish Jazz musicians making a big impression on the international Jazz scene today.
"It is vitally important to recognise the next generation of musicians and one of the key themes of this year's festival is looking forward to the exciting next 30 years that the Glasgow Jazz scene has to offer."
