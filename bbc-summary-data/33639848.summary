The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 25.36 points to 5,146.41.
Caterpillar shares lost 3.6% after the construction and mining equipment maker reported a fall in profit.
Second quarter net income fell to $710m from $999m a year earlier, after the sluggish global economy hit sales.
Shares in American Express fell 2.5%. The firm's second quarter net income fell 5% to $1.44bn after the strong dollar cut revenue from abroad.
McDonald's also edged down, closing 0.5% lower. The fast-food chain reported earnings of $1.2bn for the three months to 30 June, down from $1.39bn a year earlier.
Same store sales at its US restaurants fell 2% in the US, but rose 1.2% in Europe.
But there were some bright spots. GM was a standout performer, with its shares surging 4% after the carmaker reported its second quarter profit had quadrupled compared to a year ago.
"Earnings overall have been better than expected, but still not very good. The valuations on the market are not cheap... so we're going to need to see earnings growth for the market to make progress," said David Lynch, portfolio manager at Kenjol Capital Management.
