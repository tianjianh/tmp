Aukhadov, second in the men's -85kg event in London, tested positive for turinabol and drostanolone, the International Olympic Committee said.
His medal will be reassigned to Iran's Kianoush Rostami, originally third.
Aukhadov was caught when the IOC retested samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics using new analysis methods.
Ukrainian pole vaulter Maksym Mazuryk, who finished 18th in London, has also been disqualified from the 2012 Games retrospectively after he tested positive for turinabol.
The IOC has reported a total of 98 positive cases from recent retests of samples from the two Games in Beijing and London.
At least six of those cases came in one weightlifting event, the men's -94kg category at London 2012.
As a result, the gold medal was passed to Iran's Saeid Mohammadpour, who was originally fifth.
