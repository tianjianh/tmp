Boreham Wood 0-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood and Solihull fought out a dull goalless draw in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was particularly drab. For the home side, Morgan Ferrier was denied by Nathan Baxter, while at the other end, George Carline had a shot blocked.
In the second period, Harry White nearly scored for Solihull at his old stomping ground, but Grant Smith blocked superbly to deny him.
The Moors took the initiative as the match wore on.
Omari Sterling-James went close when he hit the side-netting, and White struck just over late on as the home side held on for a point.
