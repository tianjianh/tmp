A man who was restrained by two members of the public who believed he had snatched a woman's bag has died in hospital, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called in the early hours of 16 October to a suspected robbery on Stafford Road, Wolverhampton.
Two witnesses to the incident detained the 29-year-old suspect while waiting for police, the West Midlands force said.
Officers arrived and arrested him but police said he then "became unwell".
They performed CPR on him before paramedics arrived to take him to hospital.
He died three days later.
Further tests are required following a post-mortem examination, police said.
Det Insp Greg Evans, from Wolverhampton CID, said: "We are piecing together what happened on Sunday and it is really important that people who were in the area at the time come forward."
He said officers were looking to trace any witnesses, including a member of the public who spoke to the man who made the 999 call and an elderly couple seen walking in the area.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has been notified, as has the coroner.
