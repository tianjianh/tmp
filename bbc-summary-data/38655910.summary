Michael Anthony Bailey, 54, from Dale Terrace in Oldbury, Black Country, attacked his dog Lucky last June, magistrates in Birmingham heard.
When police came to his home he said the dog had run off but she was found hidden behind the washing machine.
Lucky made a full recovery but was later put down after it was found she was a banned breed.

Bailey was found guilty of one count of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, and one count of failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the needs of the dog were met.
As well as his jail sentence he was also banned for life from owning animals and ordered to pay a Â£115 victim surcharge.
Steven Morrall, an investigator for the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), praised police for saving Lucky from further injuries, but criticised the decision to put down the dog.
"This was a particularly brutal attack on the poor dog that was stabbed on her face and repeatedly punched, which left the her eyes so swollen that they were almost closed," he said.
"This is a very sad ending as Lucky had made a full recovery and we were hoping to see her into a new home.
"The RSPCA do not make these decisions. We do not agree with Breed Specific Legislation and have been campaigning for changes for some time."
