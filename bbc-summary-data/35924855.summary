Burger and Lobster pulls out of Marischal Square development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A restaurant chain which had been due to open its first Scottish branch in the Marischal Square development in Aberdeen has pulled out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberdeen City Council said last September that Burger and Lobster had agreed to open an outlet in the Â£107m office and hotel complex.
The company has now said opportunities have arisen in America which are a higher priority.
Marischal Square is expected to open in the summer of next year.
The council said it was disappointed at Burger and Lobster's decision.
A spokesman for developers Muse declined to comment.
Offices and a hotel are being built on the site of the former council headquarters.
Protestors failed in their bid to get the development halted last March.
Councillors voted by 22-21 to continue with the project.
