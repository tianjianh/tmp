Abbott, 28, has played three Tests, 20 one-day internationals and 14 Twenty20 matches for the Proteas and had spells in England with Hampshire in 2014 and Middlesex in 2015.
The deal will be finalised once Abbott receives a visa and gets clearance from Cricket South Africa.
He will be available for Worcestershire from early July until late September.
Worcestershire were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship in 2015, but have signed a player with previous experience of winning promotion.
"I enjoyed my previous time in county cricket and hope I can play my part in helping Worcestershire get back into Division One," said Abbott, who took 36 wickets in nine games to help Hampshire to promotion in 2014.
"They came close to staying up last season and have a good squad of young players who are only going to get better.
"Hopefully I can play my part in terms of taking wickets and passing on any advice, and also making an impact in white-ball cricket."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes is confident Abbott, who had a six-game spell in the T20 Blast with Middlesex last season, will prove an asset at New Road.
"It's very exciting to welcome Kyle on board," Rhodes said. "He'll pass on some excellent experience to our younger bowlers and we know he is the type of person that has the right character for our dressing room.
"He's not just a Test match bowler. He's a one-day bowler and has also got good T20 skills - he'll potentially be playing in all three formats."
