[SN]TITLE[SN]
Army major 'drove at 95mph' before fatal B390 crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Army major who was involved in a crash which killed another man was "way over the speed limit" and on "the wrong side of the road", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire.
Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6.
Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving.
Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury.
The weather was "awful" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors.
He said Mr Scott's car was described as "twitching" and "may have been aquaplaning" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed.
Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told.
"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road," Mr Gabb said.
Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece.
The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered "substantial injuries" and could not recall the crash, which happened shortly after 07:00 GMT on 6 October, 2014.
He does not accept the charge and suggests it was in fact Mr Reed who had crossed the carriageway, causing the collision, Mr Gabb told the court.
The trial continues.
