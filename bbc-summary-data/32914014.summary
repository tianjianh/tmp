The man was left with injuries to his legs, abdomen and face after the incident in Eastgate Street just before 09:45 BST.
He was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, the ambulance service said.
The Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation. Eastgate Street remains closed.
An air ambulance was among the emergency services called to the scene.
Gloucestershire County Council said the man, who was carrying out work on traffic signals, had been working for Richings, a sub-contractor on behalf of Amey.
Councillor Vernon Smith, cabinet member for highways, said: "We've heard about the upsetting incident on Brunswick Road this morning and our deepest thoughts are with the member of Richings staff who was working on traffic lights at the time.
"We're very concerned for the gentleman who is currently in hospital and a full investigation has already started today."
Western Power tweeted some 650 homes and businesses in the GL1 area were with without power for a time on Thursday morning.
