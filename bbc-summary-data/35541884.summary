The company said 11 customers worldwide had been injured after the glass shades, from some of their "Lock" and "Hyby" lamps, had fallen.
In a statement it said: "In a few cases medical treatment was required and one customer reportedly needed stitches."
It has received 224 reports in total due to the retaining clips breaking.
In the UK, Ikea said there had been 12 reports of the incident, two of which involved injury.
The retailer said a full refund would be offered without a receipt.
Ikea has been selling "Lock" lamps since 2012 and the "Hyby" models since 2012.
The lamps have domed white frosted glass shades and three plastic clips that attach the shade to the electrical light fitting.
Ikea said it took product safety very seriously and apologised for the inconvenience.
In January it asked customers to return LATTJO drum sticks and LATTJO tongue drum as a precautionary measure because of fears they could be a choking hazard for young children.
