[SN]TITLE[SN]
Care home wife killer Ronald King 'also had bullet' for sister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly man accused of his wife's murder has told a court he also considered shooting his sister, describing her as "a living corpse".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rita King, 81, who had dementia, was shot dead at De La Mer House in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, in December.
Her 87-year-old husband Ronald King, who is disabled, admits killing her but denies murder.
From the witness box at Chelmsford Crown Court, Mr King said his wife had told him she had "had enough".
The trial jury heard he had also considered shooting his older sister Eileen, who is also a resident at the care home, as well as himself.
He put three rounds in the revolver, the court heard. One bullet for Mrs King, one for his sister and one for himself, he said.
When asked why he wanted to involve his 92-year-old sister, Mr King said: "She lived on a big bed, she stayed on it all day - she was a living corpse."
He also told the court he modified the bullets by cutting the fronts of them off. He said he remembered reading about a "dum-dum bullet" which "leaves a hole as big as your fist, there's no chance of getting better".
Asked whether he ever told Mrs King he was going to shoot her, her husband said: "Not really, not straight out. I decided to kill us both.
"It's easy pointing a gun straight, you try turning it round, bloody hard."
Asked whether he still loved his wife, Mr King said: "Course I did. I still miss her. I've kept her ashes. When I go we'll be mixed together."
The case continues.
