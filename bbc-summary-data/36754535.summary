Driver Lee Pickthall, 25, and his passenger, 19-year-old Courtney Cowan, were killed after their car left the road at about 23:00 on Thursday.
The crash happened near Laneside Cottage on the A710 between Dumfries and New Abbey.
Ms Cowan's family said they were "devastated by the loss of our beautiful Courtney".
In a statement, the family added: "She was a popular, lively young woman with a bright future ahead of her. Everyone loved her and our lives will never be the same again as we try to come to terms with her loss.
"We are overwhelmed by the messages of concern and condolences we have received at this sad time and we would like to thank everyone who has been in touch."
Police said on Friday that it appeared the driver had lost control of the Audi A6.
The road was closed for several hours while accident investigations were carried out.
