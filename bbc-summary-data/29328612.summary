Trinder, 25, started the first two games of the Premiership season but was forced off the field in the win over Sale on 13 September.
The Cherry and Whites did not reveal how long he will be sidelined for but said the operation was a success.
England Saxons player Trinder made 19 appearances for the club last season, scoring five tries.
Trinder was one of three uncapped centres called up to Stuart Lancaster's squad for the 2013 autumn Test series and featured in the tour of New Zealand this summer, playing 58 minutes against Crusaders.
