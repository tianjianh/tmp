SWPL Cup final: Hibernian Ladies beat Glasgow City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian Ladies netted in added time to defeat holders Glasgow City and win the SWPL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City had led in the first half through Julie Fleeting's goal.
However, Hibs were level by the break as Lucy Graham tucked home on the rebound after Lizzie Arnot's penalty had been saved.
And, with time running out, a ball into the Glasgow box was deflected into the net by Arnot to give Hibs victory at the death.
