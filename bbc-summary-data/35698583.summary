Over three days next month, there will be screenings of films shot on the Eiger mountain in Switzerland and the Fitz Roy Massif in South America.
Films made in Scotland to be shown during the event include Cape Wrath and Transition.
There will also be a talks by some of the world's leading outdoor athletes, the festival's organisers said.
Transition follows top young female climber Natalie Berry's move from indoor climbing to tackling routes in the outdoors.
The 23-year-old, who is originally from Bearsden and now lives in Edinburgh, was recently named this year's Scottish Youth Ambassador for Mountain Culture.
Lochaber-based professional climber Dave MacLeod, who helped Ms Berry to make the transition from indoor to outdoor climbing, will give AAFF's guest lecture.
Cape Wrath, another of the Scottish films to be shown, sees mountain bikers Lee Craigie and Andy Toop make a journey to one of the remotest points on the UK mainland.
Among the international features will be Shifting Ice and Changing Tides. It follows six women as they set sail for Greenland in search of far flung pistes to ski.
The festival will be held at the Spey Valley Cinema in Aviemore from 22-24 April.
