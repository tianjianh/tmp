The Toxteth-based station was set up as part of a government initiative three years ago and went into administration earlier this month.
Made Television, which runs stations in Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds and the North East, has announced it is taking over the business, subject to approval from the regulator Ofcom.
It will be renamed Made in Liverpool.
Jamie Conway, Made Television's chief executive, said Liverpool was a "vibrant, exciting city".
"We are committed to investing in this important and nascent new sector in television as are the management team of Bay TV who we are proud to work with.
"Made in Liverpool provides an exciting opportunity to share our resource and expertise still further, bringing engaging local content to a whole new set of viewers in Liverpool."
