[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flanker Dan Lydiate says Wales were "not good enough" during the first half of their Six Nations loss to England.

Wales trailed 16-0 at half-time and were 19 points behind at one stage before battling back to lose 25-21.
"We were second best and didn't really get out of the blocks in the first half which was costly in the end," Lydiate told BBC Radio Wales after the defeat at Twickenham.
"We just wished the game went on for another five minutes."
He added: "We've got to play for the eighty minutes, not for the second forty. It's not good enough at this level.
"If you're not firing from the blocks in the first twenty, then you'll be under the pump. We left ourselves too much to do.
"The boys came back into the game but it was too much for us to do and we were second in the races.
"We didn't come out firing. It's something we'd talked about all week. We needed to do (it) and it didn't happen.
"We found our feet better in the second half and started to play a bit which is encouraging but it was too little to late."

Wales finish their campaign at home against winless Italy in Cardiff on Saturday and Lydiate admits an improved performance is needed.
"We'll look at the tapes and do some soul searching on Monday," he continued.
"We've got a big game and obviously we want to finish the Six Nations on a high especially in front of a home crowd.
"Hopefully we'll be looking for an eighty-minute performance this week not a forty-minute one like we showed today."
