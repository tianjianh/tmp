Rachael Hamilton - who stood down as a list MSP to fight the seat - took Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire with a majority of more than 9,000.
She held the constituency for her party from closest rival Gail Hendry of the SNP.
Labour's Sally Prentice was third with Lib Dem Catriona Bhatia fourth.
The by-election was called after John Lamont stood down to fight the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk seat at Westminster which he also won.
"We had an all-female line-up and I was just pleased to be one of those," said Ms Hamilton.
"I am pleased to be going back to the Scottish Parliament - I am absolutely delighted.
"And I am also delighted for John in his Westminster seat as well. The number of seats that we are winning throughout Scotland for Westminster - I think that is really encouraging as well - I think the Conservatives are on the up."
She added that the push for another independence referendum had definitely helped her "on the doorsteps".
"We can stand up and oppose independence and I believe that is what voters in the Borders were really gunning for," she said.
