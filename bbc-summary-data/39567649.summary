Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter says he expects prop Tomas Francis to be at Sandy Park next season, despite interest in the Wales international.

Cardiff Blues have been keen on signing Francis, 24, on a dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).
"As far as I'm concerned, as far as he's concerned, he's an Exeter player for at least the next two years because he's under contract," Baxter said.
"I've had no contact from anybody - either Cardiff Blues or from Wales."
Francis has 22 international caps and started four of Wales' five Six Nations matches this year, but the York-born tight-head has never played his club rugby in the country.
He has made 11 appearances for Premiership side Exeter this season and it is understood any deal for the forward would involve a fee.
"We're expecting him to be here, he's an important part of our squad and we're expecting him to have a big end to the season for us," Baxter added to BBC Radio Devon.
