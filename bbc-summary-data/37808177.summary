Prince Buaben headed the capital side into a first-half lead but a classy finish from Danny Swanson brought Saints level before half-time.
Substitute Chris Kane prodded home a David Wotherspoon cross with five minutes left to put the visitors ahead.
But Callum Paterson headed home Don Cowie's corner to snatch a point.
Hearts move above Rangers - who face Ross County on Sunday - into third on goal difference, with Saints remaining fifth, level on points with the two teams immediately above them.
Both sides went into this one on the back of some ropey form; Hearts had conceded five goals in their last two, winless, games, and St Johnstone had just one victory in their last four. Recent history was interesting. Saints had three wins and two draws in their last five meetings with Robbie Neilson's side.
They were under pressure from early on, though. Hearts had more possession and more chances but it wasn't until Buaben scored midway through the half that they gained the lead. And it was odd.
A shot from Don Cowie came back off the crossbar to Buaben who sent his close-range header goal-bound until it appeared to be pawed away by a St Johnstone hand.
It was questionable that the ball had crossed the line, but then had it not, we'd be talking about a penalty and a red card. The goal was given instead and Tynecastle came alive.
Not long after his goal, Buaben tested Zander Clark in the Saints goal and in these moments Hearts were comfortable. They were hit with a sucker punch and a lot of class when Swanson got on the ball.
Steven MacLean sent Swanson through one-on-one with John Souttar and there was no contest there. Swanson turned inside the centre-half, then placed a gorgeous shot past Jack Hamilton for his 10th goal of the season and his third of the campaign against Hearts.
Swanson is already two thirds of the way towards matching Saints' leading scorer from last season, MacLean.
In the early minutes of the second half there were big moments at both ends. David Wotherspoon forced a save from Hamilton, then Wotherspoon rattled the inside of Hamilton's post with a beautiful free-kick. The breaking ball fell to Joe Shaughnessy, who tapped it home, but he was offside.
Hearts had a big opportunity of their own minutes later when Bjorn Johnsen's shot from close in was brilliantly blocked by Steven Anderson. The defender's awareness of the danger around him saved Saints.
The game had become a tight battle between two sides who looked for a while like they didn't have sufficient creativity to score again. They did. Both of them.
Saints surely thought they had won it when Wotherspoon, who got better as the day went on, found Kane, who passed his shot beyond Hamilton. Hearts complained bitterly about the goal, claiming an offside, but they wasted their breath.
Five minutes remained, but the home team dug in and Paterson got them the point they undoubtedly deserved when heading home from a corner with two minutes left.
It was the Scotland full-back's fifth goal of the season. For him, next stop Wembley.
Hearts boss Robbie Neilson: "It was a really tough game. We knew St Johnstone would make it difficult and it would be a very combative game and it turned out that way.
"We managed to get ourselves in front then gave away a poor goal and then there was an offside goal for St Johnstone and they take the lead. But we managed to fight back and show our quality and equalise.

"We are disappointed not to take the three points but the manner in which we fought back was really pleasing."
Saints boss Tommy Wright: "It maybe lacked quality at times but I think it was end to end and entertaining and I think we picked up a very good point.
"I've seen the first Hearts goal back and one thing I'll say is the referee's assistant has got a clear view of it, as in a really good position. Brian Easton doesn't think it's over, but the angle I've got on the video doesn't clear it up for me.
"For the disallowed goal the referee's assistant seems to think Joe Shaughnessy was a couple of yards offside, but I have seen that back and he looks level to me. So I think we maybe got the wrong end of the stick."
