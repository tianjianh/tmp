A Church of England vicar has apologised for posting a link to an article which claimed Israel was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

The Reverend Stephen Sizer, vicar of Christ Church, in Virginia Water, Surrey, posted a link on Facebook to an article which said the official narrative of the atrocity was "absurd".
And along with the post he reportedly wrote: "It raises so many questions."
He later removed the link and has apologised for the "distress caused".
In a statement on the Diocese of Guildford's website, Mr Sizer said he had "never believed Israel or any other country was complicit in the terrorist atrocity of 9/11".
"My sharing of this material was ill-considered and misguided," he wrote.
"I very much regret and apologise for the distress caused by the sharing on Facebook of a link to an article about 9/11 from Wikispooks.
"It was particularly insensitive in that last week coincided with Holocaust Memorial Day. I removed the link as soon as I received adverse feedback, and realised that offence had been caused. "
Mr Sizer said he would not use social media or blogs "until further notice".
The diocese welcomed his apology but refused to comment further.
BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt said Mr Sizer had a history of disputes with Jewish community leaders over blog postings on Israel and Zionism.
Almost 3,000 people died in the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001.
