The six, all from Birmingham, appeared at West London Magistrates' Court.
Irfan Nasser, 30, of Sparkhill, Irfan Khalid, 26, and Ashik Ali, 26 both of Balsall Heath, and Rahin Ahmed, 25, of Moseley, have been remanded in custody until 21 October.
Bahader Ali, 28, of Sparkbrook, and Mohammed Rizwan, 32, of Ward End, have been remanded until 24 October.
Mr Nasser, Mr Khalid, Mr Ashik Ali and Mr Ahmed are due to appear at the Old Bailey, while Mr Rizwan and Mr Bahader Ali - who is the brother of Ashik Ali - are to appear before Westminster magistrates.
Mr Nasser and Mr Khalid are accused of preparing for an act of terrorism, including travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, making a martyrdom video and planning a bombing campaign.
They are accused of "being concerned in constructing" a home-made explosive device for terrorist acts and stating an intention to be a suicide bomber.
Ashik Ali is accused of preparing for an act of terrorism, which involved planning a bombing campaign, providing premises for the planning of terrorist attack and stating an intention to be a suicide bomber.
Mr Ahmed is accused of helping fund terrorist acts, collecting money for terrorism and helping others travel to Pakistan for training in terrorism.
Mr Rizwan and Bahader Ali are both charged with failing to disclose information about potential acts of terrorism.
It is alleged that between 29 July and 19 September both men had information which they knew may help prevent the commission of an act of terrorism.
Mr Ali is also charged with "arranging the availability of property for terrorist purposes".
Mr Rizwan made no application for bail, while Mr Ali was refused bail.
The offences are alleged to have taken place between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September this year.
The men were arrested after a police operation in Birmingham last week.
A seventh man from the city, aged 20, who was arrested on Thursday, continues to be questioned. Officers have until 29 September to charge, release or apply for further time.
The men were arrested as part of an operation carried out by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. Police said the arrests were unarmed, pre-planned and intelligence-led.
