[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Profits fell by 70% to $574m (Â£404m) from the same quarter in 2014. It's the third quarter in a row of falling profits for the bank.
Its latest results were hit by a $1.95bn in legal fees stemming from the financial crisis.
The Wall Street bank reported fourth quarter net revenue of $7.2bn (Â£5bn) down 5% from the same period in 2014.
The bank announced in January it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice to pay a total of $5.1bn in civil penalties and consumer relief stemming from the sale of mortgage backed securities.
Part of that bill was charged to the latest quarterly results.
Goldman Sachs was the last of the big US banks to report earnings for 2015.
Its shares fell slightly in early trading. Analysts had predicted the Goldman Sachs would report earnings of $3.53 per share but the bank disappointed with earnings per share only reaching $1.27.
