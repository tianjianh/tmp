The RNLI lifeboat charity said more than two-thirds of those had not set out to enter the water. Across the UK, 163 people died.
It was also revealed crews and lifeguards saved 84 lives last year.
The charity is launching its national drowning prevention campaign, Respect the Water, warning people that water can be "dangerously unpredictable".
Figures also showed men accounted for nearly three-quarters of the water-related deaths.
The campaign to raise awareness in Wales is being launched by Jerome Kirby, from Cardiff, who got into trouble in the water while body boarding at Rest Bay in Porthcawl, Bridgend county.
The 27-year-old drifted out of his depth and was struggling to swim against the current for about 20 minutes when RNLI volunteer Chris Page spotted him and swam out to keep him afloat until he could be rescued.
Mr Kirby said: "It just happened so easily in what seemed to be a safe place.
"I can't stress how easy it is to get into trouble. One minute I was absolutely fine and could see people around me, the next I was out of my depth, drifting into danger and not able to get back."
Mr Page said Mr Kirby appeared to be in "a lot of difficulty".
"Always go into the sea with someone or ensure someone can see you at all times," he said.
"What happened to Jerome shows the unpredictable nature of the water. Thankfully, my story had a happy ending."
