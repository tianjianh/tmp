Chinese authorities have revised down the number of survivors of the Yangtze River cruise ship disaster from 14 to 12 people.

The miscount was blamed on duplication and confusion between government agencies, said Xinhua news agency.
Authorities said 442 people, mainly tourists in their 60s, died after the Eastern Star capsized during a storm on 1 June. All the bodies of those who died have been found, officials say.
The accident's cause is still unclear.
"Different government bodies made repeated calculations of the number of survivors, thus leading to a miscalculation," Tang Guanjun, head of the Yangtze River Navigation Affairs Administration, told reporters late on Saturday according to Xinhua.
The ship sank in Jianli, in China's central Hubei province, in what reports said was a matter of seconds. Weather officials said a freak tornado hit the area.
Police have detained the captain and chief engineer for questioning as part of an investigation into the incident.
An initial probe into the sinking found the ship was not overloaded and had enough life vests on board.
The operator of the ship has apologised for the disaster and said it would "fully" co-operate with the investigation.
