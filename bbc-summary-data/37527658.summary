[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 1-1 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln lost ground on National League leaders Forest Green following a draw at Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Anderson's second goal in as many games fired Lincoln ahead a minute after half-time, but Blair Turgott equalised on 65 minutes.
Anderson scored the second goal in Lincoln's 2-1 win at Wrexham in midweek, which left them two points adrift of the leaders, and he was on the scoresheet again when he cut in from the left and drilled home.
Bromley's equaliser arrived when substitute Tom Champion gave away possession and Lee Minshull set up Turgott to score.
