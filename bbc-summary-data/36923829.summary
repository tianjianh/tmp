[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Rodriguez, also known as Grymey D, 28, contacted several girls, aged 14 and 15, online and persuaded them to go to his house in Hackney.
Videos found by police showed him having sex with girls in the house he shared with his parents and sister.
He admitted 15 offences and was sentenced to 16 years by a judge at Wood Green Crown Court.
The charges related to seven different victims and included sexual activity with a child, making indecent photographs and sexual assault.
Scotland Yard found videos of the rapper having sex with four children.
In one, Rodriguez had filmed himself having sex with a 14-year-old girl who had arrived at his house wearing her school uniform.
He was caught when police discovered messages on a 14-year-old's phone which suggested she was in a sexual relationship with him.
The girl told officers he had first contacted her when she was 13 and she had visited his house several times once she turned 14.
On one occasion the girl took a friend, who was also 14, and Rodriguez engaged in sexual activity with both of them, she told detectives.
Charges:
Rodriguez groomed his victims using Facebook, Instagram and Blackberry Messenger by complimenting them about how they looked and telling them he loved them.
Edward Lucas, prosecuting, said on Thursday: "This defendant is predatory. He preyed on young, vulnerable girls around the ages of 13 to 15.
He used his experience, charm and his guile and ultimately his force - his force of personality - to indulge in his own perverted activities."
His relatives were unaware of what he was doing.
The defence had suggested Rodriguez "did not appreciate the gravity of what he was doing" and was "absolutely stunned" when he learnt of the seriousness of the offences.
But Judge Joanna Greenberg QC said "he must be blind and living as a hermit" to have missed news of similar cases involving high-profile celebrities.
She said the rapper had deliberately targeted young girls in order to carry out "deviant sexual fantasies".
"Your desire for them was because they were young girls," the judge said.
