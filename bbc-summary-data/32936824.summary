T20 Blast: Hampshire bowler Chris Wood skittles Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire inflicted a second successive T20 Blast defeat on Glamorgan as they claimed a 21-run win in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Ervine top-scored with 49 as Hampshire posted 148-8, with four wickets for Graham Wagg and two for Glamorgan debutant Wayne Parnell.
Glamorgan slumped to 13-3 in reply before a 69-run stand between captain Jacques Rudolph and Mark Wallace.
But four wickets from Chris Wood helped Hampshire regain control and seal a second win from three T20 matches.
Having beaten Surrey and lost to Essex in their first two games of the campaign, Glamorgan had made an encouraging start to this encounter at the Swalec Stadium.
South Africa fast bowler Parnell had missed both those fixtures through injury, but marked his first appearance for Glamorgan with a wicket in each of his first two overs.
Hampshire captain James Vince and Jimmy Adams were his victims, caught at slip and third man respectively.
Wickets continued to tumble as Parnell was replaced by Wagg, who claimed the prized wicket of England international Michael Carberry - caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Wallace - before he had another former England star, Owais Shah, caught superbly by Colin Ingram at mid-wicket.
Zimbabwean Ervine led Hampshire's revival as his abrasive 35-ball innings off 49 balls helped the visitors recover from 39-4 to 115-5, before he was trapped lbw by Wagg.
Will Smith's swift 30 gave Hampshire late momentum as they ended on 148-8, and he was also prominent with the ball as he bowled Ben Wright with the second delivery of Glamorgan's innings.
It was a disastrous start to the hosts' reply, with Chris Cooke and Ingram both chopping the ball on to their own stumps off the bowling of Wood to leave the Welsh county reeling on 13-3 in the fourth over.
That brought Rudolph and Wallace together at the crease and their patient partnership of 69 guided Glamorgan to 82-4.
But when Rudolph and Craig Meschede were dismissed either side of a rain delay the wind was taken out of Glamorgan's sails.
Wood took two wickets in successive deliveries - leaving himself on a hat-trick when he next plays - as Glamorgan limped to 127-8 at the end of their 20 overs.
Glamorgan squad: Jacques Rudolph (capt), Will Bragg, Chris Cooke, Dean Cosker, Michael Hogan, Colin Ingram, Craig Meschede, Wayne Parnell, Andrew Salter, Ruaidhri Smith, Graham Wagg, Mark Wallace, Ben Wright.
Hampshire squad: Will Smith, Owais Shah, Jimmy Adams, Sean Ervine, Liam Dawson, Gareth Berg, James Vince (capt), Michael Carberry, Danny Briggs, Chris Wood, Adam Wheater, Fidel Edwards, Yasir Arafat.
