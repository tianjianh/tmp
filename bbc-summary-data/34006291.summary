Guilt trip: Is holidaying more hassle than it's worth?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For some people holidaying is not a problem. They can compartmentalise their lives and go off without a care in the world. But for the rest of us, it's not that simple. We experience a lot of seepage between the walls of work and life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holiday worry is just one of those leakages. And you're not going to get much sympathy worrying about your holidays, because you don't occupy the high moral ground. The high moral ground is where the people who are not currently on their holidays go when you are on yours.
The first question is when to go.
For years, when to go was dictated by the most important document on any company's computer system - the holiday spreadsheet.
In a lot of offices, the spreadsheet has been superseded by a super-duper "Absence Management Software", which is just "one module in a holistic and fully integrated-across-all-verticals system". But there are still holiday spreadsheets "currently locked by another user" lurking in offices around the world.
Holiday worriers are at a disadvantage here as their reticence means they haven't got in early before their colleagues take the prize slots. The holiday spreadsheet is the flight before the flight. If you're not on it, you're going nowhere.
In the political office, in the northern hemisphere, August is the month where most politicians take their holidays, except one or two. Those are the ones you see being forced to defend the government across a wide range of topics and very much out of their comfort zone.
They are living proof of the dangers of procrastination in getting the cells next to your name highlighted in green on the holidays spreadsheet. Here in Ireland, one government minister has been dubbed the "Minister for August" so ever-present has he been on air.
Ideally you should have done a comprehensive skills handover that should have the effect of broadening the skills base of your company - thereby improving resilience in the long term. But you haven't.
The rule of holidays is that the likelihood of some storm developing increases as you near your departure date. By the time you've dealt with that there's barely enough time to scribble down your password and write your out-of-the-office reply.
At the very least spell-check this, and don't write it with any device with an aggressive autocorrect function - the last thing want to do is tell people you are "out of the orifice".
And change your passwords to something that isn't obscene or a slight against a colleague. You don't know when you might have to dictate it loudly down the phone to your handover.
Who do you hand over to? The most important character trait in the person who's dealing with your mess? Loyalty. Someone who'll refrain from complete character assassination until you get back and then greet you with "you owe me bigtime."
No wonder so many people head off with a nagging feeling that here are some loose ends. Recent books on happiness have recognised this and suggest doing a little bit of work in the morning even while on holidays. It mightn't be every morning, you could check a few emails early on for looming crises.
You won't be able to fix it but you can obfuscate any group email chains that have the potential to turn into "Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Problem" by emailing individual people on the side or editing the subject from Problem to Opportunity. Or just some token heroism might be enough.
Token heroism is where you let it be known that you can be contacted if there's an emergency, yes even on your holidays! But then you render it almost unusable by dipping it in passive aggression. Take one phone call, arrange to have your spouse whisper audibly in the background to children - imaginary or otherwise: "In a minute darlings, this is clearly more important than family."
Or you could just go somewhere with no connectivity apart from a coin-operated computer in the lobby. It's amazing how efficient you get when you have exactly three minutes, 15 seconds to put out a fire.
Of course, a flipside to this worry is that your workplace can get on too well without you. In which case you may need to worry whether they need you at all. You might as well forget about that and enjoy your last paid holiday.
Having resolved your departure-related worries it's time to move onto the other anxieties that holidays bring - fear of coming back. To ease the transition, don't provoke your colleagues with photos of your holidays while you are still on holiday.
The standard photo is one of the holiday-maker's feet - the "toe-tograph" - with a colourful drink to one side and azure waters in the distance.
Speaking of filters, these toe-tos are often overlaid with a filter to make the photo look like it was taken in the saturate colour of our childhood. Which is ironic because in our childhood we weren't kite-surfing in Koh Samui, we were sitting on a gravelly beach eating bread and cheese sandwiches, protecting them from the attacks of an angry gull.
Once you're back you need to get in early. If nothing else then to take the hundreds-of-unread-emails look off your face, but also to prepare your reply to repeated questions about how your holiday was.
Here's a tip - don't make yourself sad by dwelling on that which has past. No one really wants to know how your holiday was, they just want to remind you of its end. Go with it, your reply should acknowledge this.
"It was great - back now though. (Hollow laugh)"
All of this worry is going to exhaust you. But don't worry, your boss is off next week - and then you can truly relax.
