Cat lovers from as far as the United States and Australia have donated nearly £5,000 towards a memorial for a popular "bus stop" cat in Hampshire.

Much-loved Missy was a regular sight for almost 10 years at the number 39 stop in Dunsbury Way, Havant.
She had died of "horrific injuries" after being run over or attacked.
One donor from the US wrote: "Remember the joy and happiness you brought to those waiting for the bus over the years."
The death of the 13-year-old ginger cat last week prompted hundreds of people to donate towards a commemorative plaque.
She was found badly injured and had to be put down after suffering a fractured skull and a broken jaw, and had its teeth knocked out.
Police are appealing for more information.
Flowers, photos, children's drawings and messages have been left at the bus stop bench where Missy would often be found asleep, or sitting on someone's lap.
The appeal, set up by bus driver Craig Cockram, has so far raised more than £4,500.
He said: "It's just crazy, we thought we'd raise a couple of hundred quid but this is just mad."
Left over money would be donated to an animal charity chosen by the owner, he added.
Samantha Hadaway wrote: "Bless you dear Missy for making people smile every day and only asking in return for some kindness. Such a senseless awful waste of a precious little fur angel's life".
Kristi, from the USA, posted: "God has a special place for Missy. She touched so many lives. I wish I'd known her."
