[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 0-0 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby's first game in English football's fifth tier ended in a goalless draw with Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Close to 600 people turned out in East Yorkshire to see Steve Housham's men make their National League bow and watched on as the frame of the goal was struck three times.
Danny Clarke had a first-half shot blocked for the Villagers and then Curtis Bateson looked to have given them the lead, only to see his effort bounce out off the bar.
The same two players were involved again just before the break, Clarke denied by Jamie Butler in the Braintree goal after being teed up by Bateson.
Town sub Jake Goodman became the next player to hit the bar, nodding against the woodwork as the game entered its last 20 minutes, which passed without incident other than Ferriby hacking off the line amid a scramble which also saw the ball hit the post.
