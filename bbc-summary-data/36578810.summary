'Detrimental' behaviour in Wrexham town prompts new powers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have approved plans for action to combat anti-social behaviour in Wrexham town centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The order will give police and the council powers to disperse those involved in drug and alcohol consumption, rough sleeping and other anti-social behaviour.
Officials said the issues are having a "detrimental effect" on life.
A report said there had been over 300 incidents in the last 12 months such as drink and drugs, fights and harassment.
It said vulnerable people would be given welfare help and warnings before any action was taken.
But North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones raised concerns during a public consultation that the order may move problems elsewhere and not solve them.
Failure to move away from specific parts of town would result in Â£100 fixed penalty fines or prosecution in court.
A public consultation on the plan is due to close next week.
