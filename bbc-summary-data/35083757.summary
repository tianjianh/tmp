A Met Office Yellow weather warning of rain for County Fermanagh is in force for Sunday.

The weather warning is valid from 11:00 GMT to 19:00 GMT.
Rivers Agency chief executive David Porter has said it is continuing to monitor water levels closely following more rainfall, including Lough Erne.
A number of roads are closed across Northern Ireland.
Mr Porter said the agency brought in extra pumps and Derrychara Link in Enniskillen was cleared at 02:30 GMT, but he said "keeping it open depends on rain today".
He said Upper Lough Erne "was still about 150mm below 2009 levels".
A Met Office Yellow warning of ice was in place until 10:00 GMT on Sunday.
On Friday, the minister for agriculture, Michelle O'Neill, said there was no engineering solution to flooding in County Fermanagh.
Ms O'Neill said the problem is one that the local community "will have to deal with time and time again".
