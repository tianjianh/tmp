[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flintshire crematorium plan put to public inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public inquiry into plans for Flintshire's first crematorium has begun in Mold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The application by Memoria Ltd for the development near Northop was rejected by the county council in February 2015.
The company appealed the decision, claiming the council had "no technical evidence" to back up its refusal.
Currently, Flintshire residents use crematoria facilities in Chester, Wrexham, Colwyn Bay and a new site in St Asaph.
The council does not dispute the need for a crematorium in the county but it rejected Oxfordshire-based Memoria's plans because of concerns over road safety and the visual impact of the proposed buildings on their open countryside setting off Oakenholt Lane and Kelsterton Lane.
Evidence will be heard from the company, Flintshire council, and members of the public.
Objections will also be made by J Davies and Sons, a firm of undertakers whose application to build a crematorium at another site in Northop was rejected in 2014.
The hearing will last six days but a decision is not likely to be made before next year.
