York boss Jackie McNamara is undecided about his future after a late goal denied them victory against Braintree.

McNamara, 42, said he would resign if his side failed to achieve a "positive" result against Braintree following their 6-1 humiliation away at Guiseley.
"I'll have a chat with the chairman on the bus and make my decision based on that," the Scot told BBC Radio York.
"I have some thinking to do. I'd speak to the chairman first as obviously he's the most important person."
McNamara's side have won just three of their 15 National League games this season and are 19th after Lee Barnard's 88th-minute penalty rescued a 1-1 draw for Braintree.
The former Celtic and Wolves defender was appointed manager by the Minstermen in November 2015 but was unable to save the club from relegation from the Football League.
"This has been about 90% of my life since last November," McNamara continued.
"People who know me know how hard I work here to try and change things and the club. That's why I've been here so long and the chairman has stood by me.
"The results on the pitch haven't been good enough but I've been humbled by the support from the chairman and the players."
