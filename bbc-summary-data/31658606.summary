[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three branches of the Isle of Man bank in Ballasalla, Onchan and Prospect Terrace in Douglas will close later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new mobile service will be launched on Monday to coincide with the closures which are blamed on a "fall in demand."
The growth of telephone and internet banking has been blamed for a 30% fall in bank customers over four years.
According to the bank, the mobile service is equipped with satellite technology and will offer the same services as conventional branches.
They are the latest to shut after the closure of the Laxey sub-branch in October 2013 and the Kirk Michael branch in August 2012.
