Otto, 31, had been banned from driving in December, but was caught behind the wheel twice in 24 hours in August.
He was suspended by Championship side Jersey after his arrest in August.
"Fautua Otto's conduct has fallen well short of the standards that we expect from our players," said Jersey's Bill Dempsey in a statement.
"An internal disciplinary process has resulted in a finding of gross misconduct, and this has led to a decision that Fautua's contract will be terminated," added the club's director of professional rugby.
Otto, who won the last of his 12 caps for Samoa in June 2014, joined Jersey in February 2015 having previously played for Bristol.
