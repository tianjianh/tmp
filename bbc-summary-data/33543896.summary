A hairdresser from Llanelli is trying to raise money to send her mother to die at Switzerland's Dignitas clinic.

Tara O'Reilly says her mother, who has motor neurone disease, wants to die with dignity.
She said she wants to help her mother Jackie Baker choose the time and method of her death.
Assisting a suicide or suicide attempt is a criminal offence and Dyfed-Powys Police said it was aware of the case and is looking into the fundraising.
Ms O'Reilly said they needed Â£8,000 to fund the trip and had no alternative but to ask for help.
A person encouraging or assisting a suicide or suicide attempt could face up to 14 years in prison, if a decision was taken to prosecute.
But Ms O'Reilly told BBC Wales that the family had thought long and hard about their mother's wishes.
Ms O'Reilly said: "My mother spoke to me and my sister about it and she said if it gets worse, which it has, she wanted to go to Switzerland.
"We were distraught, because it's unthinkable.
"But as the months have gone, and we've seen how much she has deteriorated, unable to feed herself, dress herself.
"It's cruel. You wouldn't let your cat or dog suffer, you'd take them to the vets. It's kind.
"This is not kind. Having to wipe your mother's mouth, feed her and give her drinks through a straw."
