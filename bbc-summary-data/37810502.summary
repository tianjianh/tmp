Wales international Rhys Patchell admits it was strange to take centre stage against his former region.

The Scarlets outside half returned to Cardiff Arms Park as his new side enjoyed a 26-15 win at Cardiff Blues.
Patchell's sensational break allowed Hadleigh Parkes' to score which sealed a bonus point.
"I'd been here five years, of course it was going to be a little bit different going into the away changing room," Patchell told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"But once you get over that and get on the pitch, the pitch is the same size as it always is, you get on with the 80 minutes."
Patchell went head-to-head with former Scarlet Steve Shingler, who was involved in a controversial sin-bin incident with his brother Aaron.

Patchell was thrilled to keep up his winning record in the fixture. The Blues did the double over the Scarlets last term and Patchell was determined to ensure he remained on the right side of the scoreline once more.
"It's pleasing, but it's not so much about me coming out on the right side of the result, it's a lot more about us coming out on the right side of the result. It was a big night for us, we needed to win," said Patchell.
"It's pleasing, at the end of the day the boys put in an incredible 80 minute shift."
The bonus point win means Scarlets leapfrog Blues in the Pro12 standings, but Patchell is not getting carried away.
"We'll see at the end of the year how important this game is, certainly for the here and now climbing up the table was a big priority tonight and to come away with maximum points is pleasing," he said.
"Don't get me wrong, it was a good win, but next week now becomes the biggest game of the season, and the weekend after that becomes the biggest game of the season.
"We're happy that we've won, but there's a long way to go this year."
Scarlets' coach Wayne Pivac felt his side were slow start to the season. Losing their opening three matches meant the derby with Blues was already a key contest.
"It was a must win game clearly with us five points off the Blues, what we didn't want to do was sink further back from that top six," Pivac told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It was an important game and last year they were the only side to beat us twice and really they embarrassed us at home. That played on our minds and we talked about that in the week."
