Crews are also delivering sandbags to Penrhiwfer Road, Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, after homes flooded.
Many rivers have burst their banks, and the worst affected include the Severn at Dolwen; rivers Vyrnwy, Mawddach and Wnion. The A458 from Llanfair Caereinion to Llanerfyl, in Powys, was closed because the River Banwy has burst its banks.
