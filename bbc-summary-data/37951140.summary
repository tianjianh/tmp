[SN]TITLE[SN]
Public Health Bill consultation is launched by AMs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being urged to have their say on plans including a ban on smoking in playgrounds, schools and hospital grounds, by a committee of AMs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The consultation is part of the Health, Social Care and Sport committee's scrutiny of the Public Health Bill.
This second attempt to bring in the bill no longer includes a ban on e-cigarettes in some enclosed places.
Committee chair Dr Dai Lloyd said he would like to hear views on proposals "affecting many aspects of life".
The Welsh Government plans, first outlined in 2014, still include tattooing and piercing regulation.
The first attempt at passing the legislation was defeated in March and First Minister Carwyn Jones has said there is "no point trying to bang our heads against a brick wall when it comes to e-cigs".
Dr Lloyd said: "It is a broad-range bill affecting many aspects of life from smoking, to pharmacy services, public conveniences, acupuncture, piercings and tattoos.
"We would like people to consider this bill anew and tell us whether they think it is necessary and whether it will do what it says it will."
The committee is asking for responses to the consultation by 16 December.
