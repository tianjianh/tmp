'Right to die' campaigner Gordon Ross dies, aged 67

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A severely disabled man from  Glasgow who tried to force Scotland's top law officer to issue guidance on assisted suicide has died in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Ross, 67, had degenerative Parkinson's disease and was concerned that anyone who helped him end his life would face prosecution.
The Court of Session in Edinburgh is still to rule on his case to force the Lord Advocate to issue guidance.
Mr Ross died on Wednesday from pneumonia and other medical issues.
The retired TV producer was a member of Friends At The End (Fate), an organisation campaigning for a change in the law on assisted dying in Scotland.
Mr Ross's friend, and Fate convener, Sheila Duffy said: "Gordon was a doughty fighter who passionately believed the law should be changed.
"Despite his numerous health problems which would have floored a lesser individual, he worked tirelessly to support the assisted dying cause, and never lost his sense of humour.
"Our thoughts are with his family, who supported his stance, at this sad time."
Mr Ross brought his case for a judicial review to the Court of Session in Edinburgh in May last year.
He wanted Scotland's most senior prosecutor, the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC, to set out guidance on what circumstances he would take into account before deciding whether to prosecute somebody who had helped another person end their life.
Similar guidance has been issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions for England.
His QC, Aidan O'Neill, had argued that under the European Convention on Human Right there was a substantive right to "a dignified suicide".
Gerry Moynihan QC, counsel for the Lord Advocate, however, said there was no proper foundation in law for the outcome that was being sought.
In a written judgement issued in September, Lord Doherty ruled that the current Crown policy was legal and did not breach the European Convention on Human Rights.
Mr Ross launched an appeal against this decision in December before the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lady Dorrian and Lord Drummond Young.
The judges are due to give their decision at a later date.
