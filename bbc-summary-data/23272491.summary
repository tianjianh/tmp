The Prince of Wales is the Queen’s eldest son and first in line to the throne. On 29 July 1981 he married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales. The couple had two sons, William and Harry. They later separated and their marriage was dissolved in 1996. On 31 August 1997 the Princess was killed in a car crash in Paris. Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles on 9 April 2005.
Prince William is the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales. The Duke was 15 years old when his mother was killed in a Paris car crash. He went on to study at St Andrews University, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011. On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State – standing in for the Queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013.
Prince George of Cambridge, was born at 16:24BST on Monday 22 July, 2013, at St Mary's hospital in west London. Prince William was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz.

The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to their second child, a baby girl, at 08:34 BST (07:34 GMT) on 2 May 2015 at St Mary's Hospital in London. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth of the 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg) baby. The duke and duchess named her Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. She is fourth in line to the throne and is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.
Prince Harry trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and went on to become a Lieutenant in the British Army, serving as a helicopter pilot. He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday, standing in for The Queen on official duties.
Prince Andrew was the third child of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh – but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York. They had two daughters - Beatrice was born in 1988 and Eugenie in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced that the duke and duchess were to separate and they divorced in 1996.
Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. She has no official surname, but uses the name York. If she marries, she will retain her royal title, but will have the option of taking her husband’s surname.
Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie of York. Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses the name York. If she marries, she will retain her royal title, but will have the option of taking her husband’s surname.
Prince Edward was given the title Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn on his marriage to Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. The couple have two children, Lady Louise, born in 2003 and James, Viscount Severn, born in 2007.
Viscount Severn is the younger child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an Earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.
Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an Earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.
The Princess Royal is the Queen’s second child and only daughter. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second husband is Vice-Admiral Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Captain Phillips.
Peter Phillips is the eldest of the Queen’s grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010 and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married Princess Anne so their children do not have any courtesy titles.
Savannah, born in 2010, is the eldest daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips and the Queen's first great-grandchild.
Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips.
Zara Tindall has followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career – including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line. Their father, Mark Phillips turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have any courtesy titles.
The Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall gave birth in January 2014 to a baby girl weighing 7lbs 12oz.
