[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 1-0 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maxime Biamou's first-half goal gave FA Cup giant-killers Sutton a deserved 1-0 victory against Boreham Wood at Gander Green Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts made a bright start with Craig Eastmond and Biamou both testing Grant Smith in the Wood goal.
Sutton finally broke the deadlock in the 31st minute when a long ball from Jamie Collins was headed on by Adam Coombes for Biamou to rifle home right-footed from 15 yards for his second goal in as many games.
Eastmond wasted a chance to double the lead four minutes later when he cleared the bar in a great position on the edge of the area.
Will Puddy, signed on a month's loan from Bristol Rovers following an injury to Ross Warner which meant striker Simon Downer had to go in goal on Saturday, rescued the hosts just before the break by making a great save - rushing out to deny Bruno Andrade.
Smith was much the busier of the two goalkeepers after the break and he did well to push efforts from Coombes and Roarie Deacon round the post.
