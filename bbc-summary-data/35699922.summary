James Kinsella was captured on CCTV speeding through the Strand shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, on 7 January.
Merseyside Police said it was "sheer luck" that no shoppers were injured, including several mothers with prams.
The 20-year-old, from Bootle, admitted dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance at Liverpool Crown Court.
He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and banned from driving for three years.
