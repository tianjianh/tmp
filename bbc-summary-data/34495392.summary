[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nassem Galleze murder: Third man charged with violent disorder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A third man has been charged with violent disorder following the death of Nassem Galleze.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shiloh Moore, 21, of Elmbridge Road, Deptford, appeared before Wimbledon magistrates and was held in custody.
Two others are in custody after being charged with the same offence.
Nassem, 17, was killed on 26 September when he crashed his car after a concrete block was hurled at it on the Turnham estate in Brockley, south-east London.
Tershan Thompson-Williams, 21, of Seager Place, Deptford; and Remi Moore, 22, of Lea Bridge Road, Leyton; were charged with violent disorder earlier this month.
Mr Thompson-Williams is due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court later this month, and Mr Moore in November.
Officers were called to reports of a fight on the estate which flared up before the car was attacked.
The suspects ran off afterwards, leaving passers-by to rush to the aid of Nassem and two friends who were in the car with him. A post-mortem examination revealed Nassem died as a result of multiple injuries.
