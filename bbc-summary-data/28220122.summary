The right-back, who has penned a two year deal, started his career at Hearts and moved to Old Trafford in 2005 for a fee in the region of Â£50,000.
He then had spells with Preston North End and Stevenage Borough.
"This is a great opportunity to play for a big club and to be part of something memorable," the 26-year-old told the Hibs website.
"I'm honoured to be Alan's first signing - he comes across really well - and now I can't wait to get started.
"Our first competitive game of the season is against Rangers in the [Petrofac Training] cup and then two games later we've got an Edinburgh Derby, so there is plenty to look forward to"
Boss Stubbs says Gray, a former Scotland under-21 international, will be joined by more new faces as Hibs gear up for the Scottish Championship campaign.
"David is a quality player with plenty of experience and a first-class attitude," he said.
"Hopefully his arrival will be the first of many new signings at the club over the next few weeks."
