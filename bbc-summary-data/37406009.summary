A postal worker has been threatened and then followed by a man while making his deliveries in Annan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened in the garden of a house on Newington Road at about 10:30 on Saturday.
The worker was confronted by a man and then followed for a short while. The Royal Mail employee was unhurt but said to be left in a "state of shock".
PC Emma Neylon said it was a "strange incident" to happen in broad daylight on a Saturday morning.
The man police want to trace is described as being white, in his early 40s, about 5ft 6in to 5ft 8in tall with short brown hair described as ruffled.
He was wearing a navy blue hooded top, beige shorts and spoke a foreign language.
The man was acting in what was described as an "erratic manner".
