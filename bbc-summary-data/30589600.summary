[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"My name is Holly Rabey. I'm 19 and I have been suffering with self-harm since I was 12.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"My teacher allowed me to borrow a pen that was broken on one end leaving it with a sharp edge of plastic.
"Absent-minded, I used it to scratch at my forearm underneath the desk and that's where it all began.
"There were a lot of reasons why I was so drawn towards self-harming - I was severely bullied at school, and from eight to 12 I was also bullied at home.

"I was constantly running away because I felt like I had nowhere safe to go.
"Self-harm felt like an exit - it replaced the emotional pain with physical pain that I felt I could cope better with.
"It also allowed me to punish myself for being the bad person I thought I was.
"Self-harm forced me to experience a very strange concoction of emotions that often left me feeling very confused later on.
"Sometimes I would smile while hurting myself because I was receiving such a huge relief from my emotional problems.
"Other times I would cry from the pain or because I felt like I was being forced to do it from either a voice in my head or purely because it felt like 'routine' - it was my 'go to'.
"My friends and family did not find out until I was 16.
"It was four very long years of silence before I finally told one of my friends, who was going through the same thing.
"From then everything started to unravel.
"I told another friend, and then another friend found out and then that friend told another friend.
"Meanwhile I was falling deeper and deeper into a black hole and I was cutting myself more and more.
"On my worse days it would be up to seven times per day.
"Eventually it got back to my mum and her first reaction was only what anyone would expect from a mother who just found out what her daughter had been severely hurting herself.
"She was angry and she was upset and she wanted to know why I was doing it.
"She was very confused and understandably ignorant on the subject.
"I didn't know what to say to her and I didn't know for a long time.
"At the time it was such a difficult thing to explain to people as I barely understood it myself.
"My mum told a few other members in my family but no-one really knew how to react or what to do so they tried their best to ignore it and act normal.
"I started to hit my lowest points, and on two occasions I overdosed and was admitted to hospital.
"Both times the doctors referred to me as 'lucky' as I didn't produce any huge damage to myself.
"Each time I explained to them that I still felt like the unluckiest person in the world.
"My arms and thighs became severely scarred from the damage I was inflicting every day.
"It has now been a year since I was at my lowest point and today I am in such a better place, but it certainly was not easy.
"With the help of concerned friends and staff at the college I was studying my A-Levels at, I found my way to therapy with the local CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) team and I was prescribed medication after being diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
"Slowly I began to gain back some of the will power that was snatched away when I began self-harming.
"My mum began to realise that shouting and crying at me wouldn't help and she became very supportive - she is now a huge activist for mental health and self-harm.
"I also met my girlfriend who became a huge part of my support net.
"My friends from college also continued to be an ongoing support.
"It took months, I relapsed, I had breakdowns but slowly the light at the end of the tunnel began to get bigger.
"I am now 19 and I am studying my BA English and Creative Writing degree at Plymouth University.
"Me and my girlfriend have been together for almost a year and are also happily engaged.
"My family are all still hugely supportive and extremely proud of me and I am extremely proud of myself.
"I have not self-harmed for about 10 months, although I have still had urges, I have recovered enough to know how not to give in to anything telling me to self-harm.
"It's certainly still a work in progress and I would definitely not call myself 'recovered' and I doubt I ever will be.
"Self-harm is going to be a life-long struggle, but a struggle that will get easier and easier as time passes."
