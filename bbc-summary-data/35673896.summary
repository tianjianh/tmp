The 32-year-old, who made his debut for the county in 2002, has scored 9,590 runs in 157 first-class games at an average of 38.20.
"Chris is an integral part of the squad and has a significant role to play," said head coach Mark Davis.
"His influence and leadership is vital to our future success."
Nash's highest first-class score of 184 came against Leicestershire in 2010 and the Cuckfield-born right-hander is closing in on 3,000 runs in List A cricket for Sussex and 2,500 runs for the Sharks in the T20 format.
He has also taken 151 wickets across all formats with his off-spin.
"It is nice to know that I'm going to be here at least until I'm 35," Nash said.
"It's an exciting time with Luke Wright taking over as captain. I'm looking forward to playing under him and hopefully over the next three years I can really hit my best form."
