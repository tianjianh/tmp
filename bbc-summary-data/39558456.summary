A north Wales railway line has reopened six weeks after being blocked by fallen trees and rocks caused by Storm Doris.

The Conwy Valley line was closed in February after a large tree fell on to the track between Llanrwst and Blaenau Ffestiniog.
Network Rail removed 300 about tonnes of rock from the face along the Blaenau Ffestiniog to Llandudno branch line so it was safe enough to reopen.
The track closed on 23 February when 94mph (151km/h) winds hit north Wales.
"The damage done to the line was significant, whilst more than a dozen of our trains suffered damage," said Lynne Milligan, customer service director for Arriva Trains Wales.
Network Rail said the project posed "unique challenges" with difficult access, dense vegetation, steep rock faces, no road access and a single track railway that meant "engineers were unable to use machinery typically used for similar repairs".
