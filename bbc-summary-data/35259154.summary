Former Wales and Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips hopes to remain at Paris club Racing 92 after his contract ends later his season.

Phillips has been partnering New Zealand legend Dan Carter at half-back for the French Top 14 club.
But the 33-year-old Welshman has yet to receive a fresh offer from Racing.
He told BBC Radio Wales: "I do really enjoy it at Racing and hopefully something can be organised there, but that's pretty much it, really."
Phillips also indicated he would be unlikely to seek a return to Wales, where he played for Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys.
"I enjoyed those times in Wales and they're very special to me," said the 2009 and 2013 Lions tourist. "I like to keep on moving forward, really, not that it [going back to Wales] is a backward step or anything.
"Hopefully [I will] try and stay in Paris and if that doesn't happen, then see what happens."
Phillips retired from international rugby in December as Wales' most-capped scrum-half after being an unused member of Warren Gatland's 2015 World Cup squad.
Racing host Glasgow in the European Champions Cup on Saturday, with Phillips' former club Scarlets travelling to Paris on Sunday, 17 January.
