James Gilbey, 25, from Bramley, died after he was hit by a Volkswagen Golf while crossing Stanningley Bypass on Monday night.
Five suspects aged between 22 and 29 are being questioned by police on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
A further man, 23, has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.
Mr Gilbey was hit by the Golf as it travelled towards Pudsey.
The vehicle was discovered just after midnight in Fagley Crescent, Bradford, following a call from the public.
Officers have also recovered a second car in Bingley, a white Audi A5, which they believe was travelling in convoy with the Golf at the time of the collision.
Det Ch Insp Elizabeth Belton, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "James' family are completely devastated about his death and we are doing everything we can to provide the answers they need about exactly what happened."
