[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers are investigating the "suspicious" death of Ethel Joyce Baldwin, at Abbey House Care Home, in Netley Abbey, Hampshire.
The 36-year-old arrested woman has been bailed until 2 December.
Hampshire police said they were working to ensure vulnerable residents and families were being supported.
A post-mortem examination was held earlier this week.
A spokesman for the care home said staff notified police and the safeguarding authority when they became aware Ms Baldwin "may have been assaulted" on 29 August.
The home said she died in hospital on 13 September.
Staff described Ms Baldwin, who was known by her middle name of Joyce, and admitted to the home about two years ago for palliative care, as "much loved" and "a pleasure to look after".
