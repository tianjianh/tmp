On Monday, Avon and Somerset Police made a fresh appeal for information over the murder of Helen Fleet in 1987.
The 66-year-old was stabbed and strangled while walking her dogs in Worlebury Woods near the town.
DS Zoe Niccolls, said: "We've had several calls from members of the public, some providing us with names."
"We'll look into each piece of information to see if it can help us progress this inquiry and we'll be keeping Helen's family updated with any significant developments," she added.
Despite a major investigation at the time of Mrs Fleet's death, no murder weapon was discovered.
Police also said the motive for the murder was unclear, as it was not a robbery and there was no sexual assault.
It is hoped evidence found at the scene will yield more clues due to forensic advances.
