[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Any corruption in the bidding process for the 2017 World Athletics Championships will be identified and dealt with, says IAAF boss Lord Coe.

London won the right to host the event but UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner says he was told that competitors Qatar were offering bribes to IAAF officials.
"If anything comes out of that nature, then clearly all those bids will be called in," Coe told BBC Radio 5 live.
"In a bidding process, every sport has rumour piled upon rumour."
London won the 2017 vote 10-6 in November 2011. Qatari capital Doha was subsequently named as host for the 2019 event in November 2014. Qatar has denied any wrongdoing in either bid.
A World Anti-Doping Agency independent report published on Thursday found that "corruption was embedded" within the International Association of Athletics Federations, the sport's world governing body.
Coe became IAAF president in August after eight years as vice-president.
A French criminal investigation into Coe's predecessor, Lamine Diack, and other leading IAAF officials is looking at whether there was any financial wrongdoing in bids for seven World Athletics Championships from 2009 onwards.
Co-author of the Wada report Richard McLaren said he suspected bribes might have been paid, adding "we don't know that for sure - that's why we want a further investigation and the police are pursuing that".

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek, Warner said that the night before the 2017 vote a senior IAAF official told him that Qataris were offering bribes in brown envelopes in return for support.
Warner, who has said London's bid was "completely by the book", felt the allegation was "quite shocking" but he "dismissed it".
However, he claims that, on the morning of the bid, "certain members of the IAAF and senior people at the IAAF were telling us that we were behind because the Qataris had promised to pay the $7.2m (Â£5m) prize money, which otherwise the IAAF would have had to pay".
Warner said the London bid decided to match that offer and "we were told that was the decisive swing factor".
He added: "I welcome any investigation into all the bidding processes because I would love to believe it was a level playing field. If it wasn't, there needs to be some recompense."
Coe said he did not know the identity of the senior IAAF official who spoke to Warner on the night before the 2017 vote.
Warner said he would tell Coe who it was after Sunday's Sportsweek broadcast finished.
Coe added: "The French police are looking at this and I have already implemented a review of our financial, marketing and sponsorship arrangements within the IAAF."
In a wide-ranging interview, Coe also said public trust in athletics might not return until "way beyond" his four-year term as IAAF president.
