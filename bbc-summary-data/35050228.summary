Uniwheel is a 'rideable' electric transporter which, as the name suggests, has only one wheel.
The makers say it can navigate urban environments more comfortably than popular two-wheeled rivals, sometimes nicknamed 'hoverboards'.
The company says its British-made interpretation of similar devices boasts improved safety features.
BBC technology reporter Chris Foxx met the firm behind it at a launch event in East London.
He asked Uniwheel's chief Steve Milton how laws in England, Wales and Scotland prohibiting the use of electric rideables in public places would affect the business.
