Glasgow City Council has approved £500,000 to refurbish Provanhall House and build a visitor centre at the site, which dates back to the 15th Century.
It will be one of the attractions in the proposed Seven Lochs Wetland Park, which aims to link nature venues between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.
The cash comes from £6m the council aims to spend in the Easterhouse area.
Council leader Frank McAveety said: "This is a great day for Easterhouse town centre and the wider area.
"Today's decision by the council allows the redevelopment of one of the city's oldest buildings and the creation of a fantastic visitor centre which will play a key role in the continuing regeneration of Easterhouse."
The £6m came from the owners of Glasgow Fort Shopping Centre, which is located off the M8 at Easterhouse.
The release of the cash to the council was a condition of approval being given for the expansion of the shopping centre.
The council said the remainder of the £6m funding would be allocated to other projects at a later date.
