Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital: 'Superbug' for three patients

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three patients have been diagnosed with a "very resistant strain of bacteria" prompting a ward closure at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital.

The trio were all on the orthopaedic surgery ward and were screened after another patient there had the bacteria, called carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).
The first patient did not require treatment for it and was discharged.
The ward has been closed to admissions "as a precaution", the hospital said.

Enterobacteriaceae are sometimes harmless and live in the gut.
CPE is another type of the same group of bacteria that have become resistant to strong antibiotics called carbapenems which are used to treat the most serious infections, the NHS choices website said - a so-called superbug.
The hospital said none of the three patients found to have the organism from their latest screening were unwell with it and "no specific treatment was required or being given".
A hospital spokesman said "this type of very resistant bacteria was becoming more common across the UK and around the world.... because of the overuse of antibiotics."
He said washing hands regularly was the "best defence".
