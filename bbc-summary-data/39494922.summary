The Dow Jones rose 0.19% to 20,689, and the S&P 500 gained 0.06% to 2,360.1. The Nasdaq fell 0.07% to 5,898.6.
Ralph Lauren shares fell 4.5%, with the retailer's struggles seen as a worrying sign for a sector losing ground to online rivals.
Retailers Nordstrom closed down 5.5% and L Brands fell 4.4%.
Airlines were weak, with American Airlines dropping 3.7% after rival Delta Airlines cut the forecast for a key revenue metric for the second time in less than a month. Delta shares fell 2.6%.
Stocks saw some support earlier in the session when Trump said US infrastructure spending could top $1 trillion and said his administration was working on a major "haircut" for Dodd-Frank banking regulations.
The S&P industrial sector ended up 0.2%, while the materials sector closed up 0.4%.
Financial investors appeared sceptical, however, as the S&P bank subsector ended down 0.3%.
