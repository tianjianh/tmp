Baudry, 28, scored 10 goals in 157 appearances for the O's after joining them in 2012.
He appeared for Orient in the League One play-offs in 2014, losing the final to Rotherham on penalties at Wembley.
"He understands what I'm about and how I want to play and I'm really looking forward to working with him," manager Darren Ferguson told the club website.
"He's a very good centre-half who can play in a back two or three. He's aggressive in the way he plays as well as being very good on the ball."
Baudry is Doncaster's fourth signing of the summer as they prepare for next season in League Two following relegation earlier this month.
