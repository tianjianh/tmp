[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Millwall fan Tommy Blackmore, 20, of Bermondsey, south-east London, died after an incident in Queen Elizabeth Street on 13 June.
Huge crowds gathered at Honour Oak Crematorium earlier to pay their respects to the man who raised more than Â£32,000 for Cancer Research UK.
Lloyd Smythe, 28, of Staple Street, Bermondsey, is accused of his murder.
More than 150 people walked to Tower Bridge to pay tribute to him on the day he died and large crowds turned out again for his funeral service earlier.
Simon Hughes, Bermondsey's long-serving Liberal Democrat MP who lost his seat in May, said there was a huge turn-out at the funeral with many Millwall fans present.
