[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby Cathedral to close midweek for refurbishment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby Cathedral is to close midweek for more than four months as it undergoes its first refurbishment for 40 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cathedral was given a grant of £500,000 to spend on heating and electrics and has raised another £170,000 for decorating.
Work will start in April with midweek services held in St Mary's Roman Catholic Church and the Chapel of St Mary on the Bridge until August.
The cathedral still needs to find almost £20,000 for the work.
The Dean of Derby, the Very Reverend Dr John Davies, said the decision to close the cathedral on Monday to Friday was a difficult one - but necessary.
"We really need to give the place over to the people who do the work otherwise it will go on for months and months and months," he said.
The paint that will be used in the decoration is specially-designed by Farrow and Ball and is described as "white with a hint of cream", called Derby stone.
The funding for the boiler came from the government's First World War Centenary Fund.
