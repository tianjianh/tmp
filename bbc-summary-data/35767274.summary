Scotland winger Sean Lamont acknowledges that Sunday's Six Nations match against France could be his last international at Murrayfield.

However, the 35-year-old, capped 103 times, is adamant that he will never retire himself from Scotland duty.
He told BBC Scotland: "I was having this conversation with the missus yesterday, that this could be the last time I run out at Murrayfield.
"I said, 'No, it's not! No, it's not!' I want to keep going."
The Glasgow Warriors winger's caps haul is bettered only by Chris Paterson, who played for Scotland on 109 occasions.
"It is a bit of a cliche but you should play every game like it's your last," he said.
"But I'll keep going. I will become surplus to requirements rather than retire."
Lamont scored a brace of tries when Scotland last beat France, 20-16 in 2006, and he believes it is time to break that run and build on the recent win over Italy.
"Ten years is too long, way too long. One year is too long for us," he said.
"We're looking to make a statement this weekend. We should be beating Italy every year - no disrespect to them - and then looking to pick off others. We've got a good win but we now need to back that up."
Those thoughts are echoed by team captain Greig Laidlaw, who accepts there is pressure on the players to build on the success against the Azzurri at the Stadio Olimpico.
"There's pressure on us and it's that internal pressure we put on each other as a group and as the boys out on the field that have to drive this team forward," Laidlaw asserted.
"It's up to nobody else to get the win this weekend.
"After the win in Rome, which was brilliant, we now have to park that and take another step forward.
"We can't relax by thinking we've beaten Italy and won a game. That's not good enough. We have to go and win another one."
