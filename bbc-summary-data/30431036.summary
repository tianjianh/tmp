[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronnie Jessiman, 33, died when a suicide bomber attacked a British embassy vehicle in Kabul.
He lived in Canterbury with his wife and had previously served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, before joining security company G4S in 2013.
Mr Jessiman was the son of a Scottish serviceman who lives in Glasgow.
Speaking ahead of his funeral, G4S chief executive officer Ashley Almanza, said: "Ronnie Jessiman was a well-liked colleague who inspired those who worked alongside him with his character and professionalism.
"He will be missed by all his friends at G4S and the company extends our deepest sympathy to his family at this most difficult time."
The suicide bomb attack on 27 November, which the Taliban said they carried out, also killed three Afghans and wounded more than 30 others.
G4S colleagues involved in close protection in Kabul described Mr Jessiman as "a true gentleman" and "very professional".
They said he was "a no-nonsense type of bloke" who was "the glue that held the team together" and he would "be sadly missed".
Mr Jessiman was born in London and joined the British Army in 1998, aged 17.
After serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, in 2007 he transferred to 5 Scots, Support Company, Fire Support Group and had two deployments to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick.
Mr Jessiman left the army in November 2012 and joined G4S in January 2013 as a close protection officer to the British Embassy in Kabul.
He married his wife Natalie in August this year.
