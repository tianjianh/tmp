It was expected that the buildings, on York Street would be open in September 2018.
However, following a report in the Irish News, a UU spokesperson said students would not begin to use the buildings until September 2019.
Construction has begun on the site of the former Interpoint and Orpheus buildings.
Work is not expected to finish until autumn 2018.
It will affect mainly those in computing, engineering, business studies and social sciences, transferring from the Jordanstown campus.
"It is not unusual for major construction projects to experience some delays and we remain in close contact with the contractor as the project progresses," the spokesperson said.
The contractor Lagan Construction Group - which is in a joint venture with Somague Group on the project - did not respond to a BBC inquiry about the reason for the delay.
The old 'art college' part of the Belfast campus has been rebuilt and is already in use.
The new Â£250m campus will eventually accommodate around 15,000 students and staff.
UU plans to sell over half of the 172-acre Jordanstown site for up to 600 new homes, along with some shops and office use.
They have appealed a decision by Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council to refuse planning permission for the development.
