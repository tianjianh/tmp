The 23-year-old forward has signed a undisclosed-length contract with the League One club.
Nichols joined Posh from Exeter City on a four-and-a-half year deal in February 2016, scoring 13 goals last season.
"I'm delighted to be signing a player, who in my opinion is a top-class striker," said Rovers manager Darrell Clarke.
Nichols will link up with his Rovers' team-mates on their pre-season tour of Portugal on Monday.
