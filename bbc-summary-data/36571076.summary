Keys' semi-final win over Carla Suarez Navarro on Saturday saw her move into the world's top 10 for the first time.
And she followed it up with a routine 6-3 6-4 victory over Czech Strycova, who finished runner-up for the second time in three years.
It was 21-year-old Keys' first title of the year and comes a week before the start of Wimbledon.
