Jose Leonardo, 56, was accused of stabbing Maria Mbombo, 52, at their Belsize Park home on 18 May.
The Old Bailey heard he had admitted killing Ms Mbombo but claimed it was manslaughter by "loss of control".
Leonardo was found guilty of one count of murder but cleared of one charge of perverting the course of justice.
The jury heard that on the afternoon of the murder, Leonardo had searched Google for "can I survive stab in the eye" and "most painful place to stab someone" on his mobile phone.
Later that evening, the couple's 23-year-old son called emergency services to the house where he was found trying to resuscitate his mother on a bedroom floor.
Prosecutor John Price said Ms Mbombo was found covered in blood and had been dead "for some while".
"For all his statements of grief to the police officers at the hospital, the defendant, who will have been with her in their home whilst she slowly died, did nothing to summon help," Mr Price told the court.
The 56-year-old will be sentenced on Tuesday.
