A chlorine leak at a swimming pool that led 40 people to be taken to hospital was caused by a piece of grit, an investigation has found.

Seven people were kept in hospital overnight after the leak on Sunday at the Wild Duck Holiday Park at Belton, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.
The park's owner Haven said grit jammed open a control switch.
This led to a "higher than acceptable amount of chemicals" entering the swimming pool, it said.
Hospitals in Gorleston, Norwich and Ipswich treated 40 people for the effects of breathing in gas and disinfectant fumes.
The pool was declared safe after the incident but remains shut.
People have been continuing their holidays at the park, but new arrivals on Monday were offered places at three other parks.
A spokesman for the park said: "Experienced technicians and mechanics have been on site overnight and have now completed their initial inspection.
"They have identified a problem with a flow switch in part of the pool's chemical and circulation system. This controls the amount of chlorine and disinfectant that is pumped into the pool on a regular cycle.
"Unfortunately a small piece of grit found its way into the switch and blocked it in the open position. This resulted in a higher than acceptable amount of chemicals entering the pool."
The Health and Safety Executive, Great Yarmouth Borough Council environment services and Norfolk Fire Service chemical leak unit are also involved in an investigation.
