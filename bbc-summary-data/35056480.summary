Crash for cash accused: Insurance claims 'were genuine'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two people accused of falsely claiming nearly £10,000 in a so-called crash for cash scheme have denied lying about accidents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people deny conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth £144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011.
Stephen Pegram, 49, of Blackwood, Caerphilly county, was paid £4,200 when his car was written off.
Nicola Cook, 41, of Hengoed, received £5,500 in a separate injury claim.
Mr Pegram said he "was shocked" to discover claims had been made for other accidents on High Street, Pengam, where he crashed in July 2009.
After prosecutor Christopher Clee suggested the crash he was involved in did not happen, he said: "It was a genuine accident.
"I don't know if he drove into me or if it was an accident. But it happened."
Ms Cook received her money after claiming for neck and back injuries when she was a back seat passenger in a crash in Oakdale in August 2009.
She told the court she needed physiotherapy afterwards, saying "it was a genuine collision".
"I heard a thump on the vehicle... I was shocked."
Mr Clee said all seven defendants were involved in insurance fraud following collisions "that did not happen".
The case continues.
