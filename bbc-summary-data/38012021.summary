There was outrage on social media when pictures surfaced of him with a "mystery woman".
The two-time Olympic champion confirmed the rumours and apologised. His wife, fellow badminton star Xie Xingfang, had their first child on 5 November.
Social media users quickly identified the woman he was seen with in the photos as actress and model Zhao Yaqi.
Cheng Hao Chen wrote: "Brother, do you know that you were the pride of 1.3 billion Chinese people? How about now?"
After the pictures emerged, another user, Duo Duo Wa Bai Cai, said: "A shameless mistake has sent you to hell from heaven.
"No matter how outstanding your achievements are, you will fall short of being a father and a husband! Sorry, super Dan, this is unforgivable - you have neglected your responsibility as a man!"
Lin, nicknamed Super Dan, used to be world number one but is now ranked third, the Straits Times reports.
"As a man, I will not defend myself," he wrote. "But my behaviour has hurt my family. I apologise to my family here. Sorry."
