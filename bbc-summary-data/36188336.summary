Cameron James Forster, 21, from Sussex, and Ajvir Singh Sandhu, 25, from Essex, died when the plane came down in a North Yorkshire field.
They were the only people on board the aircraft, which crashed off Mains Lane, in Ryedale, on Saturday at about 10.40 BST, officers said.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has launched an inquiry.
RAF Linton-on-Ouse station commander Group Captain Ian Laing said the base had been "saddened" to learn of the men's deaths.
"They were both exceptionally talented young men in the prime of their lives," he said.
"The thoughts of everyone at RAF Linton-on-Ouse are with their family and friends at this difficult time".
