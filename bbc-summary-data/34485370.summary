Stephen Nisbet, 40, who the judge said was the principal figure behind the operation, was jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Glasgow.
His brother James, his main accomplice on the outside, received 10 years.
Five men convicted for their role as couriers in the gang were sentenced to between four and eight years.
Stephen Nisbet ran the operation by mobile phone from his Edinburgh prison cell while serving a life sentence for murder.
James Nisbet, 46, had used a recycling plant near Shotts, North Lanarkshire, as a front for their £1m drugs business.
However, the duo, along with a team of couriers, were caught in January 2014 when detectives moved in following a huge police probe.
Passing sentences totalling 48 years and 10 months on Friday, judge Lord Armstrong said the men had been involved in an operation which was "organised and planned."
He added: "The courts must take full and proper account of the widespread harm that is caused by the supply and abuse of controlled drugs."
Stephen Nisbet is already serving an 18-year sentence after being convicted of murder in 2003.
Co-accused Ronald Harrison and Allan Holland, 38, were also found guilty of being concerned in the supply of heroin although had lesser roles.
John McMahon, 27, David Milne, 34, and Robert Borland, 35, all earlier admitted to related drug charges.
Drug deals were carried out across Scotland - including in Dundee, Fife and Lanarkshire.
The Nisbets were each convicted of three charges including supplying heroin and "directing others to commit a serious offence".
Stephen Nisbet was jailed for a minimum 18 years in 2003 for his part in the murder of 37 year-old David James.
Mr James was thrown from a first floor window of a flat in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, before being beaten to death.
