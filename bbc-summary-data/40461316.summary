The sportswear giant confirmed on Thursday that it would begin a "small pilot" selling goods directly through the online retail giant.
Nike's shares rose 10.96% by the close of trade in New York to $59 as the company also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
Profits soared 19% in the quarter to $1bn and revenues rose 13% to $4.2bn.
Nike was the biggest riser on the Dow Jones, which was up 62.60 points, or 0.3%, at 21,349.63.
The tech-focused Nasdaq index dipped 3.93 points to 6,140.42 while the S&P 500 climbed 3.72 points to 2,423.42.
The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy prices - rose at an annual rate of 1.4% in May.
That was down from April's rate of 1.5% and below the Fed's target of about 2%.
Other economic data released on Friday showed that consumer spending, a key driver of the US economy, edged up 0.1% last month, according to the Commerce Department.
