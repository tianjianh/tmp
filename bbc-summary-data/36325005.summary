[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire service apprentice mechanic died in the collision on the A5 in Capel Curig in Snowdonia on Tuesday.
North Wales chief fire officer Simon Smith said: "Today our thoughts are with everyone affected by this incident, but particularly with the family of the colleague we have lost."
Support has been offered to staff.
Mr Roberts was based at the fire service's fleet department at Llandudno Junction, Conwy county.
Mr Smith said: "Our service attends road traffic collisions often and they are always difficult for our staff to deal with, but even more so when they involve a close colleague."
The crash, near the Siabod Cafe, involved Mr Roberts' red Seat Leon and a silver Mercedes car.
North Wales Police has appealed for witnesses.
