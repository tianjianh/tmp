Dundee-based artists Matthew Dalziel and Louise Scullion have created the art called Nomadic Boulders.
They were commissioned as part of a project involving Highlands and Islands Enterprise to revamp John O'Groats.
HIE said the art had to be designed to withstand the forces of 100mph winds that sometimes blow through the area.
Stones believed to be 25cm to up to 100cm in diameter are moved by fierce tides in the Pentland Firth.
Nomadic Boulders uses boulders which appeared on a neighbouring beach after a storm.
