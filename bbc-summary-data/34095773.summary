Bottles of shampoo were used to conceal the drugs but they were found at the Daresbury site near Warrington, according to Cheshire Police.
The search was carried out by officers at the festival's VIP entrance on Friday, the force said.
Two men were arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply.
Supt Beverley Raistrick said: "Police have found tablets hidden in various containers including Coke cans, drinks bottles and deodorant cans.
"It is not uncommon for us to find drugs hidden in various containers in this way."
Thousands of people are attending the dance music festival which began on Friday and continues until Bank Holiday Monday.
