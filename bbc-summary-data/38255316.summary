Former Sinn Féin MLA Daithí McKay faces damages claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Sinn Féin MLA Daithí McKay is facing a claim for damages from a leading Belfast property developer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paddy Kearney has lodged a writ at Belfast High Court alleging Mr McKay "unlawfully conspired" with Loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson to damage his reputation.
Mr McKay resigned as an MLA in August after claims he and another Sinn Féin member coached Mr Bryson ahead of an appearance at a Stormont committee hearing.
The committee was investigating the £1.2bn sale of property loans by the National Assets Management Agency (NAMA).
The writ claims Mr McKay, with others, conspired to damage Mr Kearney "by the manipulation of the committee in order that Jamie Bryson's evidence be received in open session."
The papers also accuse Mr McKay of misfeasance in public office.
Mr McKay did not comment on the development.
Mr Kearney's solicitor, Paul Tweed, said in a statement: "We have been instructed to vigorously pursue this litigation and are actively considering further proceedings against other parties."
