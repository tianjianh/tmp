Wheelchair user Myrtle McCreath was caught with the haul in her luggage at Glasgow Airport after returning from Brazil on 26 February 2014.
The High Court in Glasgow heard how the 53-year-old, from Ayr, was lured into making the trip through an online romance with a man she had never met.
McCreath denied wrongdoing but was convicted of supplying cocaine.
Jailing her, judge Lord Bonomy told McCreath that it appeared there were "shadowy figures" behind the trafficking operation she had become involved in.
Bu he said a jury had rejected her claims that she did not know she was transporting drugs.
The judge went on: "I have to make sure that the people behind these crimes do not manipulate naive individuals like yourself, who provide great cover going through an airport in a wheelchair.
"I have to deter the big boys as well as the smaller individuals, who might be tempted by the money on offer."
The court heard that McCreath had struck up an internet romance with a man called John Edwards, who was said to be from Ghana, after splitting from her husband.
Edwards claimed to have ran a gold-mining business in Africa and later introduced McCreath online to another man, Philip Okoko.
Edwards claimed Okoko had been left $50m by his "ancestors" but the banknotes were stained and he needed someone to go abroad and transfer a special solution to clean them.
McCreath agreed and believed that she would get a share of the cash and be able to live with her online boyfriend, Edwards.
In December 2013, she travelled to Melbourne, Australia, where she handed over a case to two men called Ben and Matthew.
McCreath had hoped to meet Edwards for the first time there but he never turned up.
She then agreed to carry out a second trip in February 2014 to Sao Paolo in Brazil.
On her return, McCreath - who had a liver transplant years earlier - was wheeled off the plane into arrivals at Glasgow Airport.
When UK Border officers searched her luggage they found dozens of cosmetic containers with cocaine hidden inside.
After being convicted of drug trafficking, judge Lord Bonomy told McCreath that her ill health meant the jail term could be restricted from a double-figure sentence.
