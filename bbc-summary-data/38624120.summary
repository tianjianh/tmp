Forfar were fortunate to secure a point in a 1-1 draw at home to Stirling Albion.
Elgin City maintained pressure on the top two, but had to survive a late Annan Athletic comeback, eventually prevailing 3-2 at Borough Briggs.
Clyde v Montrose and Cowdenbeath v Edinburgh City were postponed due to frozen pitches.
Ryan McCord's second-half double helped second-placed Arbroath come from behind to claim an impressive win over Berwick.
The Red Lichties were behind early on after Michael McKenna's 13th-minute opener, but midfielder McCord struck twice after the break before Martin Scott added a third.
Gavin Malin wrapped up the triumph in stoppage time.
Darren Smith tapped in following a Willie Robertson free-kick to open the scoring for Stirling at the league leaders, before Angus Beith missed the opportunity to make it two from the spot, his weak penalty saved.
David Cox's powerful finish in the 37th minute secured a share of the points for a frustrated Forfar side.
In Elgin, the hosts took a three-goal lead in the first half through goals from Brian Cameron, Shane Sutherland and Chris McLeish.
However, Annan offered a scare, Peter Weatherston scoring with 20 minutes to go before setting up Smart Osadolor to give Elgin a nervy final few minutes.
