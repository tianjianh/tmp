A British student was murdered in Germany by having her drink spiked, a Labour MP has claimed.

Jane Khalaf, 19, from Huddersfield, reportedly died on 20 November, eight days after being put on life-support at St Marien Hospital in Cologne.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield, criticised German police for not investigating her death.
Ms Khalaf was on an exchange trip from Northumbria University.
It is thought she was put on a life-support machine after collapsing at the hospital during the annual carnival festivities in the west German city.
Mr Sheerman said there had been no help for Ms Khalaf's family from the German authorities.
He called for help from the Foreign Office during Foreign Office Questions in the House of Commons.
"A young girl in my constituency has been tragically murdered in Cologne," the MP said.
"There is no police investigation although there is every evidence that her drink was spiked - she was poisoned."
John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, said the Foreign Office was now aware of Mr Sheerman's concerns.
In a statement, Northumbria University said its representatives had met with the family to offer support.
"We can confirm that one of our students has tragically passed away while studying at a partner university in Germany.
"We are in contact with the authorities in Germany and the UK, and stand ready to assist further where we can."
Cologne police are yet to respond to a BBC request for a comment.
