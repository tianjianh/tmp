Speaking on Irish TV he says: "I think I'm done with X Factor. I've done 11 seasons.
"That's a long time on television. I think they're going to change the show. I think they're going to get new faces."
An X Factor spokesperson told Newsbeat Simon Cowell is the only judge confirmed for this years X Factor at this time.
Louis has been a judge on X Factor since it started in 2004, having been replaced briefly in 2007 by Brian Friedman
Dermot O'Leary has said he won't be returning to host the show when it returns this summer.
Louis was speaking on Ireland's The Seven O'Clock Show.
"I don't know who's back. I know Dermot's gone and I think Olly is working with them and I think Simon is definitely back because he owns the show."
The 62-year-old manager has only won the X Factor once in 2005 with Shayne Ward.
He says he hasn't been asked to return to the show but would he return if he was asked?
"I would have to think about it," he says.
"My day job is a manager and I've kind of neglected that. I want to get back to being a manager."
But this isn't the first time we've heard this from Mr Walsh.
Back in August 2013, he confirmed he was quitting in 2014.
But then had second thoughts about that confirmation come October 2014.
