Hearts' plans to redevelop the main stand at Tynecastle have been approved by Edinburgh City Council.

Work on the Â£11m project, which will increase the ground's overall capacity to more than 20,000, is scheduled to begin next month.
The redevelopment programme is due for completion in September 2017.
Hearts owner Ann Budge said last month that she expects the current 17,400 capacity to be unaffected while the work takes place.
"Inevitably there will be a bit of disruption because it is a big building programme but we absolutely keep that to a minimum and the supporters who still want to come and sit in the old stand will do so," she added.
