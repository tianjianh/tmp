Two Met Office yellow "be aware" warnings for snow are in effect throughout Wales on Thursday.
About 2cm (0.8in) of snow is possible on low levels, with 5cm-10cm (1.9in-3.9in) possible above 200m (656ft).
A Met Office meteorologist said there was a 20-30% chance of thundersnow in isolated areas, but the weather warning applied only to snow.
Thundersnow is similar to a thunderstorm, except snow falls instead of rain.
"When it's really cold, like we're experiencing over the next few days, the rain that would usually fall will fall as snow as it's that cold," the meteorologist said.
One warning covers Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Pembrokeshire, Powys and Wrexham will all be affected by the snow warning.
There is the potential for transport disruption, with icy stretches on roads and pavements possible.
Meanwhile, between 10:00 GMT and 21:00, rain moving across the south of the UK could turn into snow in places.
The Met Office said heavy rain and strong winds could also be a problem.
This warning affects Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan.
The Welsh Ambulance Service has made its 4x4 vehicles available to help top salt and grit bins when needed.
Director of operations Richard Lee said: "We are closely monitoring the weather forecast for Wales and have contingency plans in place to deal with the adverse conditions currently predicted across the region.
"We are well prepared to deliver the same high standard of care to the people of Wales, but inevitably when it is snowy or icy our responses may take longer."
People have been asked to use 999 "wisely" and call NHS Direct Wales if they feel unwell or go to their GP or closest minor injuries unit.
The service reminded people that ambulances were for serious and life-threatening emergencies only.
