Liverpool earned the accolade due to music's "place in the heart of the city's life", following a bid by Liverpool City Council.
Unesco noted especially a commitment to a "clearly defined" music, education and skills strategy for young people.
It is the second city in the UK to be given the Unesco honour, which Glasgow received in 2008.
A further 10 global destinations have also been given the title, including Kingston in Jamaica, the home of reggae.
The City of Music award is part of Unesco's Creative Cities Network, which was created in 2004 to promote "cooperation with and among cities that have identified creativity as a strategic factor for sustainable urban development."
Judges said the city is a "haven for music" with festivals such as its International Music Festival, Sound City and Psych Fest events.
Unesco also noted the importance of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and dance music institution Creamfields.
Mayor Joe Anderson said: "Liverpool is renowned for its musical influence and this status is the ultimate, and appropriate, accolade for a city which lives and breathes music."
Vasily Petrenko, chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra said the award recognises "one of the world's great music cities."
A council spokesman said the award would "open up opportunities to further market the city's musical heritage and, ultimately, bring more tourists to the city."
