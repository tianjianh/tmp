[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 1-1 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York and Boreham Wood remain unbeaten in the National League this season after playing out a dramatic 1-1 draw, with both goals coming in the final two minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Heslop thought he had won it for York in the 88th minute, but Ricky Shakes went to the other end and levelled things up.
Heslop drove through a crowded box to put City ahead, but before the home side could celebrate, Shakes did similarly to bring his side back square.
In a tight affair, Daniel Nti's 77th-minute effort for York was about as close as either side went before the goals, his strike blocked as it headed for the bottom corner.
Clovis Kamdjo also tried for York, denied by keeper Grant Smith, while Wood's Angelo Balanta drew a save from Scott Flinders.
