Biyi Alo: Worcester sign Saracens prop as 'injury dispensation cover'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors boss Dean Ryan has signed prop Biyi Alo from Saracens as 'injury dispensation cover'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old will come in outside the Premiership salary cap to replace fellow young prop Gareth Milasinovich, who is still to recover from the Achilles injury he suffered in April.
Alo, who has come through the ranks at Saracens, made his Premiership debut against Harlequins at Wembley in 2015.
"Biyi has learnt his trade with the European champions," said Ryan.
"He is a player who possesses the potential to be a successful Premiership player. He has amassed experience in their LV= Cup winning side."
South African Milasinovich, 23, was told that he would be out of action for "a significant time" after rupturing his Achilles tendon in the 50-12 Premiership defeat by Exeter in April.
Rules state that when a player is injured for 12 weeks or more, his club may apply to the Premiership's salary cap manager to recruit a replacement, who is then permitted to remain with the club for the rest of the season.
He becomes Worcester's sixth new signing, to follow three fellow forwards, South Africa-born Northampton hooker Matt Williams, Bath lock Will Spencer and Bristol flanker Marco Mama, as well as rugby league convert Ben Te'o and fellow centre Jackson Willison.
