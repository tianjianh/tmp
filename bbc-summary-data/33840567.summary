Phil Armes, from Norfolk, was topping 120mph (193km/h) when he lost control and was thrown off his bike in 1995.
The 55-year-old was paralysed from the chest down and hoped to use an adapted bike to "get one over on the circuit" ahead of the main event on Saturday.
Organisers said it would be rescheduled.
During the 1980s, Armes, 55, from Hellesdon in Norwich, won titles including the 250cc newcomers prize at the 1984 Manx Grand Prix, and the 350 class at the 1986 Macau Grand Prix in modern day China.
Two years ago he got back on his bike again, being one of 65 former Manx Grand Prix champions to ride a celebratory lap at the Isle of Man to mark the TT's 90th anniversary.
Saturday's event was marred by the death of rider Andy Lawson.
The 24-year-old from Arbroath, Scotland, was killed while taking part in the second Supersport race on the Dundrod circuit.
