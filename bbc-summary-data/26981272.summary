[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman slipped and drowned in a stream after checking the water supply to her home in heavy rain, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Susan Hewitt, 49, died accidentally two days before Christmas, a coroner ruled.
Dewi Pritchard-Jones said he believed the former vice president of Deutsche Bank, had slipped because it was wet underfoot at Nant Ffrancon in Bethesda.
The inquest at Llangefni in Anglesey heard homes received their water supply from the nearby stream and the pipe could be dislodged in rough weather.
The hearing was told Mrs Hewitt would sometimes check the water supply up to three times a day.
