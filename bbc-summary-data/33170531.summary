[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Central Texas is bracing for heavy rain as the remains of Tropical Storm Bill make their way inland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flood warnings have been declared as the storm heads northward, with forecasters expecting it to dump up to five inches (12.7 cm) of rain.
Much of the area in its immediate path is still recovering from devastating flooding one month ago that left 14 people dead and two still missing.
Oklahoma and Arkansas have also been issued with flood warnings.
The rising waters in Texas have put many properties at risk.
