Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, urged people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours to ensure they were all right during the extreme weather.
As well as setting flood warnings, which mean "flooding is expected, immediate action required", in the South West, the Environment Agency also has around 90 flood alerts, meaning "flooding is possible, be prepared", across England.
Environment Agency spokesman Ben Johnstone said: "We strongly urge people to sign up to flood warnings on the Environment Agency website, keep a close eye on local weather forecasts and be prepared for possible flooding."
People should not try to wade or drive through any deep water, he added.
