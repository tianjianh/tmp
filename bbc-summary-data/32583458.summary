The 7.8-magnitude quake struck more than a week ago and has claimed more than 5,000 lives.
Shaun Moody is one of six South Wales Fire and Rescue Service officers who are out there working in a UK team of 67 rescuers.
He told BBC Radio Wales some areas have suffered "total devastation".
The rescuers have been working on securing the roof of an 800-bed hospital in the capital, Kathmandu.
He added: "It is a lot worse out of the city, where 100% of properties have been destroyed in some areas.
"But the people are very resourceful and when the rescuers are getting to them, the first thing they are doing is offering them food. It is very humbling."
