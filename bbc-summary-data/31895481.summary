Police said they received reports shortly after 22:00 GMT that youths were blocking roads with burning debris in Glencaw Park and Leafair Gardens.
When officers went to the scene they were attacked with stones, bricks and bottles.
Two of those arrested, boys aged 14 and 16, have been released pending reports to the Public Prosecution Service.
Another 16-year-old boy is still being questioned.
SDLP councillor Brian Tierney appealed to those involved in such incidents to "allow residents to live in peace".
"I am a resident here in Glencaw Park and I know that most of the young people here last night causing the trouble were not from this area," he said.
"People are coming here to cause trouble and get the place a bad name for residents. That is unacceptable.
"Stones, bricks, bottles and other objects were thrown at police and residents' cars with no care or thought for anyone's property.
"The residents here just want to live in peace. We have put a lot of work into this area to try and reduce the levels of anti-social behaviour and we made great progress. The actions of a few last night won't hold us back."
