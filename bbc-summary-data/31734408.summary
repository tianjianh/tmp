Police have issued CCTV images of a woman they are looking for in connection with an assault on a toddler in Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were alerted by diners at Pizza Hut in the town's Central Retail Park after the girl, who was about two years old, was shaken and dragged along the ground by the woman on Friday 6 February.
Police said they were "extremely concerned" for the child's welfare.
Officers have appealed for witnesses.
The incident occurred at about 15:00 when the girl, who was attached to reins and pushing a toy pram, was at the restaurant with the woman and a man.
The girl appeared to be upset and was dragged towards the exit by the reins by the woman. The woman then picked up the girl and shook her, before setting her down and dragging her again by the reins out of the restaurant.
The group left in the direction of Grahams Road, and were last seen at a bus stop opposite Forth Valley Royal Hospital.
The woman is described as being white, in her thirties, of heavy build with red hair.
At the time of the incident, she was wearing a dark jacket and blue jeans.
Insp Billy Drummond of Forth Valley Division said: "I'd like to thank the numerous witnesses that have already come forward and urge anyone who recognises the woman in the CCTV images to contact police."
