Both missed last weekend's bruising 16-16 draw against Wales because of hamstring injuries.
Simon Zebo, who played full-back in that game, and winger Keith Earls are ruled out with injuries.
Earls received a blow to the head against Wales and his place goes to Dave Kearney.
Zebo had been receiving treatment for a knee injury.
O'Brien's return means Tommy O'Donnell loses his starting position and is on the replacements' bench at the Stade de France.

Fly-half Johnny Sexton and winger Andrew Trimble have been passed fit, having  got over knocks.
Sexton suffered a heavy blow to the chest on Sunday while Trimble had a shoulder problem.
France have made six changes from their narrow opening win over Italy.
Props Jefferson Poirot and Uini Atonio, lock Alexandre Flanquart, flanker Yacouba Camara, centre Maxime Mermoz and winger Teddy Thomas come into the team.
Thomas, 22, makes his return after a year-long absence with an injury he picked up against Ireland in last year's Six Nations.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt had been forced to delay his team announcement because of fitness doubts over a number of players.
"We were just trying to clarify the fitness of Simon Zebo and Keith Earls, both of whom we have left out of the squad," Schmidt said.
"They got through training and at the same time we just felt they weren't 100%  fit. We just felt it was a risk."
Fergus McFadden, who was overlooked for Ireland's initial Six Nations squad, has been summoned as a replacement for Saturday.
The 29-year-old was brought into Ireland's training ranks in midweek to cover Earls' absence with suspected concussion.
Scrum-half Eoin Reddan and hooker Richardt Strauss are also on the bench, taking the places of Kieran Marmion and Sean Cronin.
