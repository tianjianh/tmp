Simon Buckley's "Not Quite Light" festival aims to start a debate about regeneration and heritage.
The event, being held this weekend, includes exhibitions, walking tours and a fundraising event for the city's homeless.
The photographs are "leaving clues" for social historians, Mr Buckley said.
He added: "The phrase 'change is inevitable but progress isn't' kept coming back to me.
"Heritage is more than just bricks and mortar - it is a state of mind. I wanted to ask the question: what are we as Manchester? If you're knocking something down, what are you going to put in its place?"
"Manchester is going through a huge transition. You've got to be careful you don't demolish the soul of a city whilst you're running rampant, hoping to make it better."
The Not Quite Light weekend also includes a low-light photography course, a social history talk from Manchester tour guide Emma Fox and a fundraiser for homeless charity Lifeshare with live music and food.
Mr Buckley said: "In 20 or 30 years, someone else will have an opinion on the city. I'd like to think I'm creating social history through my photographs, leaving clues for historians to see exactly how I feel the city is developing."
