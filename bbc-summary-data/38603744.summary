The former Birmingham City duo, who joined Notts in 2016, are part of Mark Sampson's latest England Women's squad.
Notts manager Rick Passmoor told the club website: "Jade and Jo are both exceptional players. We're delighted.
"I'm confident we will see even more from both players."
Passmoor's side finished sixth in the English top flight last season.
