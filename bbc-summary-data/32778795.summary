Paul Cummins has designed the 8m (26ft) high sculpture covered with 2,300 hand-painted ceramic tulips.
The piece, called Candy, was unveiled in the Great Pavilion on Monday.
Mr Cummins said the work was inspired by the 17th Century "tulipomania" in Holland, during which single bulbs were exchanged for the price of houses.
The Derbyshire-based artist gained international recognition with his poppies installation at the Tower of London last year to mark the centenary of the start of World War One.
"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red" saw 888,246 poppies - one for each British and colonial military fatality in the conflict - fill the moat.
Mr Cummins said: "I make flowers. It's literally what I have done for the last 10 years.
"I like the idea that no one flower is the same unless it has been altered to look like that."
He said the sculpture commented on the marketplace and how we buy and sell commodities.
"Desirability and collecting are a large theme of my new works, and tulips will play a large role over the next year, so I thought that this would be the perfect place to showcase my art," he said.
As with the ceramic poppies, the tulips will be available to buy for £35 after they have been on display, with £10 going to a charity that has not yet been made public.
