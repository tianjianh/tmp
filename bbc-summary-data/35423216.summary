Williams, who was playing for the first time since injuring a foot at the 2015 World Cup, came through unscathed.
He is currently the only regular full-back in Wales' squad.
Fly-half Rhys Priestland played throughout Bath's 19-13 loss at Saracens on Saturday while lock Dominic Day came off in the second half.
Williams, Priestland and Day were among those playing eight days before Wales' tournament begins against Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, 8 February.
Elsewhere, lock Luke Charteris was brought on from the replacements bench for the final 20 minutes of Racing 92's convincing 26-3 win over Oyonnax in the French Top 14
Kicking coach Neil Jenkins has said Wales have had concerns about fly-half Priestland's lack of game time going into the Championship.
Prop Tomas Francis will play for Exeter against Worcester Warriors on Sunday.
And Utility back Matthew Morgan is on Bristol's bench for their Championship clash against Jersey on Sunday.
However, centres Jamie Roberts (Harlequins) and Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne) as well as wing George North (Northampton) are not in action this weekend.
Lock Bradley Davies was absent from Wasps' team to play Northampton on Friday night, while Gloucester did not select back-rower Ross Moriarty against Leicester.
Wales earlier announced captain Sam Warburton would not appear in Cardiff Blues' back-row in Saturday's Pro12 game against Edinburgh.
Warburton, 27, played in Blues' win over Calvisano, his first game since injuring an ankle in November.
Blues team-mate Gareth Anscombe also remained with Wales.
Hallam Amos, 21, played the full game as Newport Gwent Dragons beat Leinster in the Pro12 on Friday after recovering from a shoulder injury.
Wales head coach Warren Gatland says players' game-time needs have been assessed on an individual basis.
"It depends on the individual, how they feel physically," said Gatland.
"Some players like to get a few games under the belt, others are a bit more flexible and can go straight into it."

Amos injured his shoulder as Wales beat England in the World Cup, but returned to action in Dragons' win over Castres on 15 January.
Blues back Anscombe, 24, suffered an ankle injury during Wales' World Cup quarter-final loss to South Africa.
But Anscombe, who has three caps, has played twice for the region in recent weeks.
Forwards: Tomas Francis (Exeter Chiefs), Luke Charteris (Racing 92), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Dominic Day (Bath Rugby), Ross Moriarty (Gloucester Rugby).
Backs: Rhys Priestland (Bath Rugby), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Jamie Roberts (Harlequins), George North (Northampton Saints), Matthew Morgan (Bristol Rugby).
