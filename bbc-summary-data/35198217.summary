The message will be beamed on to screens at the world famous event just before midnight.
Edinburgh's Hogmanay is working with the Edinburgh International Science Festival, the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency,
Revellers from more than 80 countries will be at the street party.
Pete Irvine, director of Edinburgh's Hogmanay, said: "Edinburgh's Hogmanay is a truly global event with revellers joining us from over 80 countries around the world.
"This year we've gone one better and will be visited from space."
He added: "In a special message to Edinburgh's Hogmanay, Tim Peake, who is travelling high above us on the International Space Station, is expected to help us welcome in 2016.
"Revellers throughout the city centre should keep an eye on the event and stage screens just before the midnight moment."
Dr Simon Gage, director of the Edinburgh International Science Festival, said: "In the few hours that revellers enjoy the Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party the International Space Station, travelling at five miles per second, will orbit the Earth three times.
"If we are lucky we may even spot it going over. With UK astronaut Tim Peake aboard, 2016 will be a remarkable year for UK space science with much for us all to follow and be inspired by.
"We're delighted to have been able to extend the invitation to Tim and with the UK Space Agency and ESA to bring a little bit of science to this great party."
Edinburgh's Hogmanay is produced by Unique Events on behalf of Edinburgh City Council.
