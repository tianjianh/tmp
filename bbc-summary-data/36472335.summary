[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire set more batting records in their 36-run One-Day Cup win over Warwickshire at Trent Bridge.

Fresh from a 342-run first-wicket stand against Northants on Monday, openers Michael Lumb (133) and Riki Wessels (76) put on 178 against the Bears.
Dan Christian's rapid 94 off 47 balls pushed Notts to 415-5, as they became the first non-international team to pass 400 in successive one-day innings.
Warwickshire made 379 all out, Jonathan Trott scoring 100 and Ian Bell 60.
Sam Hain, a centurion in Tuesday's win over Leicestershire, made 69 and put on 106 for the second wicket with Trott.
A partnership of 95 between ex-England team-mates Bell and Trott set the platform for an unlikely run chase, but the visitors' challenge faded once skipper Bell had departed in the 34th over with 186 runs still required for victory.
Notts have won both of their games so far in the North Group, while Warwickshire have won only one of their first three matches.
South Africa are the only other side to have passed 400 in two consecutive one-day outings, doing so against West Indies and Ireland at the 2015 World Cup.
Lumb scored 184, Notts' highest individual limited-overs score, in a record-breaking victory over Northants and he followed that up with an 88-ball ton against Warwickshire.
Left-hander Lumb and Brendan Taylor fell in the same over, but Greg Smith (73) and captain Christian rebuilt with a fourth-wicket stand of 141 in 14 overs to help set a target beyond Warwickshire's reach.
Beginning the final over of the innings on 82, Australia limited-overs international Christian hit Oliver Hannon-Dalby for two consecutive sixes before falling six runs short of a century.
However, Samit Patel struck 17 not out in a five-ball cameo which took Notts to the 18th highest one-day score in history - and also the highest total conceded by Warwickshire in a limited-overs game.
