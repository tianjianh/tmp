Adrian Goldsmith: PC's wife 'died from head injuries'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman, whose police constable husband has been accused of her murder, died from head injuries, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jill Goldsmith, 49, was found on 26 March at the home she shared with PC Adrian Goldsmith, next to Northamptonshire police headquarters.
At Kettering Magistrates' Court, coroner Anne Pember said Mrs Goldsmith's body was identified by her former partner Dean Bailey.
The inquest was adjourned to 30 July.
Mrs Pember said a post-mortem examination carried out by Home Office pathologist Prof Guy Rutty in Leicester showed the cause of death was head injuries.
She did not release Mrs Goldsmith's body, as further tests are to be carried out.
PC Goldsmith, also 49 and known as Otis, is next due to appear in court in July.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been notified of the death.
