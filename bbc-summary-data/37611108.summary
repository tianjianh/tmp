The 30-year-old was replaced in the 80th minute after he fell awkwardly.
The club have confirmed that the Spanish captain sustained a grade two tear of his medial collateral ligament.
Ramos is reported to be out for a month, which could see him miss four La Liga matches, including a clash against local rivals Atletico Madrid.
He would also miss both Champions League group stage matches against Legia Warsaw and be a doubt for Spain's World Cup qualifier against Macedonia on Saturday 12 November.
