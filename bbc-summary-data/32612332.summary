Voting has begun in the UK general election, with 59 Scottish seats up for grabs.

Polling stations opened at 07:00 and will remain open until 22:00 on Thursday. Counting will begin when polls close.
More than four million people are registered to vote in Scotland, almost 94% of the adult population.
The first results from the 59 Scottish constituencies will be declared during the early hours of Friday morning.
Strict rules mean the BBC - in common with other broadcasters - is not allowed to report details of campaigning until after the polls close.
There are more than 5,000 polling places in Scotland with schools, village halls and community centres transformed for the day to allow people to cast their votes.
Figures from the National Records of Scotland showed that by 2 March a total of 4.04 million people in Scotland had registered to vote.
Fine weather is forecast across the country, although voting experts say there is no evidence to suggest this will boost turnout.
The Electoral Commission in Scotland has urged people not to panic if they cannot find their polling cards, as they will still be able to vote if they are registered.
A spokeswoman said anyone who does not know the location of their polling station should contact their local electoral registration office.
BBC Scotland will be delivering extensive coverage of the election results across online, TV and radio.
It will report live from Scotland's 32 counting centres after polls close.
There will then be analysis, background, reaction and debate as we find out the results from each of Scotland's constituencies.
Headlines from a UK-wide exit poll will be projected onto the exterior of BBC Scotland's studios at Pacific Quay.
And the results of the ballot will also appear on the side of the building, which sits on the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow.
