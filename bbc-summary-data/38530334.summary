[SN]TITLE[SN]
Investec to end its sponsorship of England and Wales Cricket Board

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Investment bank Investec will end its sponsorship of England's home Tests six years into a 10-year deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This summer's Test series against South Africa and West Indies will be its last as title sponsors.
The deal, which was worth about Â£40m and saw Investec's brand attached to all home Tests, began in 2011.
Investec has opted to exercise a break clause in its contract as it wishes to explore other marketing options.
The ECB will now seek a new sponsor for Test cricket, with high-profile home series against India and Australia scheduled for 2018 and 2019.
