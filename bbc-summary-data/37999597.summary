Anglesey Sea Zoo have confirmed the visitor is an Olive Ridley turtle - a species usually found in the much warmer waters around Mexico.
They think she is female, and have named her Menai.
It's the first time this type of turtle has ever been found swimming around the UK, and staff are surprised that she survived in the cold Welsh sea.
Now, they're looking after her by warming her up and rehydrating her and they say she's doing well.
Welcome to the UK, Menai!
