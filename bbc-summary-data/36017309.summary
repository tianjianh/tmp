Scottish Premiership: Celtic could seal title in Aberdeen game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic could seal the Scottish Premiership title against main rivals Aberdeen after the post-split fixtures were announced by the SPFL.

The champions are eight points clear with five matches left as they target a fifth straight title.
If both clubs win their next two games, Ronny Deila's side will have the opportunity to clinch it by beating the Dons at Celtic Park on Sunday, 8 May.
The earliest they could win it would be against Hearts on 30 April.
But that would require Aberdeen to slip up again when they visit St Johnstone in their first game after the split on Friday, 22 April.
Following Friday's defeat at Hearts, Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes conceded he thought "the title has gone for us".
"Celtic can only absolutely throw it away and I wouldn't expect them to now," he added.
Hearts' attempt to usurp the Dons in second place could be determined when the Edinburgh outfit travel to Pittodrie on the penultimate match-day, with that game taking place on Thursday, 12 May.
Relegation-threatened Dundee United, eight points adrift at the foot of the table, travel to Kilmarnock - who currently occupy the relegation play-off spot in 11th - on the final day of bottom-six fixtures on Saturday, 14 May.
Killie's main play-off rivals Hamilton face a tricky trip to Partick Thistle on the last day.
The final Dundee derby of the season will go ahead at Dens Park on Monday, 2 May.
If Dundee United lose to Hamilton and Kilmarnock beat Caley Thistle in the next round of fixtures, Dundee will have the opportunity to relegate their city rivals the following week.
Each Premiership team met three times before the 12-team top tier splits in half for the run-in.
The team finishing bottom is relegated, with the side in 11th place going into a two-legged play-off final against the Championship outfit left standing after a quarter-final and semi-final.
Dundee United manager Mixu Paatelainen admitted it will be "very hard" to avoid the drop after falling eight points behind Killie with defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle on Saturday.
