Ian Toothill, 47, believes he would be the first cancer patient to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain if successful.
Originally from Sheffield but now living in London, he has launched a campaign to raise £250,000 for his trip and to help Macmillan Cancer Support.
Mr Toothill said: "I'm determined to prove anything is possible."
He told BBC Radio Sheffield he was first diagnosed with bowel cancer in June 2015.
However, after being told in early 2016 he had beaten the disease he was recently informed it had returned.
Mr Toothill, a personal trainer from Willesden Green, said he had previously climbed in the Himalayas and dreamed of scaling Everest in "super-peak fitness" and with time to acclimatise to the conditions.
He said: "I'm working on new ways of trying to do stuff and train and work at altitude.
"I'm just going to give it my best shot and try to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support."
The Sheffield Wednesday fan has agreed to plant the flag of fierce rivals Sheffield United at the summit of the world's highest mountain after a friend donated £1,000.
His fundraising bid has so far raised more than £17,000.
