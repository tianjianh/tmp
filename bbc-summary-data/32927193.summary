Lewis Cook and Marie-Ann Wykes, both 16 and from Marston, were involved in the collision on the old A421 Bedford Road, near Brogborough, just after midnight.
Genevieve Reason, 32, from Woburn Sands, who was also in the car, was pronounced dead at the scene along with the teenagers.
Two other men were taken to hospital and have been discharged.
The road remains closed between Brogborough and Marston Moretaine and is unlikely to reopen for a few hours, Bedfordshire Police said.
The force appealed for anyone who saw the collision to get in touch.
