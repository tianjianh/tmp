Kelis reveals she doesn't actually drink milkshake

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For years she's claimed her milkshake is better than yours.

So good in fact, that if she gave you the recipe, she would have to charge.
But in a shock revelation Kelis has revealed she doesn't actually like the drink.
When asked about her favourite flavour after a recent performance in Berlin, she said: "Funnily, enough I don't actually drink milkshakes."
So that's got us thinking in the Newsbeat office, what word would you use to replace "milkshake" on her 2003 hit record?
The single reached number two in the UK chart first time round, but perhaps with a little reworking, it can go one better.
