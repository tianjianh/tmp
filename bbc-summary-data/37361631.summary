There are four foursome matches and four fourball matches on each of the first two days.
In foursomes, only one ball is used with players taking alternate shots. In fourballs, as the word suggests, there are four balls in play at any time - one for each player.
The player with the lowest score among the four competitors wins the hole for his team.
The first of 12 singles matches gets under way at 17:04 BST on Sunday, with the others starting at intervals of 11 minutes.
If a player is injured and cannot compete in the singles, the captain of the opposing team nominates a corresponding player from his own line-up to stand down and not take part.
All matches are played under the matchplay format. It means each hole is decided in isolation, rather than strokeplay, which is the cumulative scoring method used in most tournaments, including all four majors.
The winner of each match scores a point for his team, with half a point each for any match that is tied after the 18 holes.
As holders Europe need 14 out of a maximum of 28 points to retain the Ryder Cup, while the United States need 14.5 points to win the trophy back.
