Rui Li murder case: Killed nurse 'gave daughter will'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who was allegedly murdered for her life insurance policy gave her daughter a will in case she was killed, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bigamist Pierre Legris is accused of killing Rui Li, 44, who was found dead in Bournemouth, Dorset, on 30 May.
Her daughter Lu Yao, 19, told police her mother was concerned she might be pushed off a mountain during one of the couple's regular climbing trips.
French national Mr Legris, 61, denies murdering his wife.
The prosecution alleges Rui Li, a Chinese national who moved to the UK in 2003, was bludgeoned to death by Legris as part of a conspiracy that also involved his other wife Irene Smith and son Jonathan Legris.
Winchester Crown Court heard interviews between Lu Yao and police in which she said her mother and Pierre Legris, also known as Alain Baron, often went climbing and hiking, including on trips abroad.
Lu Yao, a daughter from a previous marriage, told police her mother had given her a will, which said: "If Pierre kills me you get all the money and you get all the property."
She told her it was a worse case scenario, Lu Yao said.
The prosecution alleges Mr Legris killed Ms Li because his finances had become "desperate" and he wanted to cash in on his wife's Â£300,000 life insurance policy.
The court heard Lu Yao told officers she had tried to phone and text her mother in the days after she had reported her missing.
But instead she was sent a text from Rui Li's phone by Legris, who said he had found it at a property she owned in Wolverton Road, Bournemouth.
He had explained her disappearance by saying she was working, the jury heard.
Rui Li's body was found in the boot of a car in Verwood Crescent, a week after she went missing.
Irene Smith and Jonathan Legris deny conspiracy to murder.
Jonathan Legris also denies assisting an offender and Ms Smith denies perverting the course of justice.
Before the start of the trial, Pierre Legris pleaded guilty to an offence of bigamy by marrying Ms Li in 2007 when he had been married to Ms Smith since 1987.
The court has previously heard Ms Li ran a massage service, which "on occasion" provided "sexual services".
The defence's case is that a disgruntled customer may have followed Rui Li home and murdered her.
