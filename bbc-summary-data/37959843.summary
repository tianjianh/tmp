Stoke City 0-1 Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth earned their first Premier League away win of the season as Nathan Ake's header ended Stoke's six-game unbeaten run in an ill-tempered game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Centre-back Ake, on loan from Chelsea, met Junior Stanislas' cross to give the Cherries the lead midway through the first half at the Bet365 Stadium.
The hosts had the chance to equalise when Simon Francis was deemed to have fouled Bojan Krkic just inside the area, but Bojan smashed the resulting penalty against the bar.
That miss - and wasted chances late on from Xherdan Shaqiri, Jon Walters and Bruno Martins Indi - proved costly as Stoke were unable to make the breakthrough despite heavy pressure.
The result condemned the Potters to a first league defeat in more than two months and ensured Bournemouth - who were also denied what looked a clear penalty in the first half when Ryan Shawcross brought down Callum Wilson - moved into the top half of the table.
Mark Hughes' side looked surprised, and a little rattled, by Bournemouth's intensity from the opening moments and they often they let it show in a game that saw six bookings - three to each side.
"They are a counter-attacking team and we should have done better to recognise that. They sat deep and that frustrated us for the majority of the game," he said.
"We didn't deserve to get beaten but didn't do enough to win."
The Stoke manager also accused Bournemouth of excessive time wasting, saying that the six minutes added time "could have been 16".
"It was cynical and blatant. We all do it every now and again but never to the extent Bournemouth did today.
"It's hard for the refereeing team but I feel they could have been on top of it a lot better."
Bournemouth were denied what appeared to be a clear penalty in the first half as Shawcross slid in on Wilson inside the area and seemed to bring him down without making any contact with the ball.
Referee Roger East confidently indicated play on - to the amazement of Cherries players and boss Eddie Howe alike, and the visiting manager had his say after the game.
"I'm a big fan of Roger East. I think he's one of the best referees around but he got two big calls wrong today," said Howe.
"It was definitely a penalty. You are effectively accusing Callum of diving if you don't award it. Shawcross was lucky to still be on the field."
The other call in question was the penalty awarded for Francis' touch on Bojan at the edge of the area - the missed spot-kick feeling like an injustice avoided for the visitors.
"Those two calls from the ref were game changers," added Howe. "It could have been the difference of two goals for us."
Both teams are heading to London for their next Premier League matches.
Stoke are in action at Watford on Sunday, 27 November, and will be without suspended midfielder Joe Allen. Arsenal loanee Jack Wilshere will not be eligible to face his parent club as Bournemouth visit Emirates Stadium on the same day.
