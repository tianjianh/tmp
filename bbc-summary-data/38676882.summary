[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales face Ireland in the last four on Sunday when a win would guarantee either nation a place in the next round of the World League in June.
Joanne Westwood had put Wales ahead in the first half before Symbat Sabazova equalised for Kazakhstan from a penalty corner.
Ireland beat Singapore 10-0 to reach the semi-finals.
Wales have never reached this stage of the Hockey World League before.
Advancing to the next stage in June would give them an opportunity to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.
