A mother of two accused of murdering her boyfriend wailed "what have I done, what have I done" after stabbing him in the neck, a jury has heard.

Neighbours told her trial they found Stephen Rayner, 25, collapsed in a pool of blood outside the flat the couple shared in Acton, west London, in September last year.
They described hearing "hysterical screams" moments earlier.
Jewellery designer Elizabeth "Lizzie" Hart-Browne, 27, denies murder.
David Winkworth told the Old Bailey he went outside to investigate after hearing the screams.
He told the jury he saw Mr Rayner's legs sticking out on the ground, then noticed Ms Hart-Browne sitting alone on her doorstep repeating "what have I done, what have I done".
Another neighbour, Katie Harrington, described trying to save Mr Rayner's life before paramedics arrived.
She said: "I heard some noise coming from the car park area. I couldn't hear exactly what was said, what was happening.
"A couple of moments later, I heard a female voice that was very distressed saying 'he's been stabbed, he's dead'.
"I put my shoes on and went outside. There was a man on the floor with a large pool of blood and there was a young lady who was leaning over looking and holding his neck.
"I ran inside and got some towels then I went back out there and tried to feel for a pulse."
Ms Harrington said she asked the "hysterical" woman to move away so she could roll him on his side as the ambulance operator gave instructions over the phone.
The court has heard that Ms Hart-Browne says she killed her boyfriend in self-defence during a violent attack by him.
The trial continues.
