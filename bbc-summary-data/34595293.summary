'Lazy workers' blamed for Griffin Place Communications job losses

Lazy workers were blamed for the collapse of a Torfaen call centre by its boss who set up a new firm nearby.

Cwmbran's Griffin Place Communications went into liquidation in August, with the loss of 120 jobs, despite receiving Â£600,000 of public money.
Director Stephen Wigg blamed staff for having too many "duvet days", but then set up in nearby Blaenau Gwent.
The Welsh government told BBC's The Wales Report it considered the business' viability before investing.
However, questions have been asked over why Mr Wigg received the cash after his previous Essex-based company AAC Media was also wound up in 2014.
Mr Wigg blamed the failure of the Cwmbran business on staff having "too many duvet days" and "getting drunk".
But former employees have now questioned the Welsh government's decision to back him.
Katherine Kennard said the work ethic was good with Cwmbran staff putting in extra hours, saying the decision to close and open up a new business nearby "just doesn't add up".
Another former employee, from Cwmbran, said she was furious at being labelled "lazy".
"I'm extremely angry," the 30-year-old said.
"I'm going to get branded as lazy, when I was turning up for work on time even though I hadn't been paid for five days.
"I've never had a sick day - or a duvet day."
A creditors meeting earlier this year showed Griffin Place Communications owed nearly Â£2m, while the new business - Griffin Place Media Limited - which he set up in Ebbw Vale in August, has since closed.
Finance expert Gerry Holtham questioned if giving grants, rather than loans, is a good idea in terms of trying to create jobs.
Leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said there is "a real case to answer" over the process undertaken before the money was awarded.
"Of course there is an element of risk with anything you make available, but when you have directors, such as in this company who have a track record... you really do have to ask the question, what due diligence was done?" he said.
A Welsh government spokesman said it received a funding application from Griffin Place Communications in July 2014, with plans for 300 jobs, of which 121 needed Welsh government financial backing.
The spokesman said it considered the management's previous experience and the viability of the business before investing in it.
He added: "The Welsh government has registered its interest with the liquidator in order to recover as much of the outstanding debt as possible."
