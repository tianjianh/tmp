Yorkshire v Somerset: Craig Overton's five-wicket haul puts Somerset on top

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Craig Overton completed his second five-wicket haul of the season as Somerset finished a rain-interrupted second day on top against Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The seamer, who had overnight figures of 2-17, returned to the pavilion with figures of 5-78 as the hosts closed on 159-7 - 109 runs behind Somerset.
Only 44 overs were possible with no play taking place after 15:00 BST at Scarborough's North Marine Ground.
Adil Rashid carries Yorkshire's hopes into day three with an unbeaten 30.
The only batsmen to score more than the England spinner were debutant Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Harry Brook, who each made 31.
The pair were at the crease at the start of the day and took their fourth wicket stand to exactly 50 before Brook was caught at second slip by Marcus Trescothick off Overton.
Tim Gronewald bowled Kohler-Cadmore off his thigh shortly afterwards to leave Yorkshire on 88-5.
Acting captain Tim Bresnan fell cheaply to Overton, who also removed Hodd after a seventh-wicket stand of 48 with Rashid.
