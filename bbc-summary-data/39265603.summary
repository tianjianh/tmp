A Liverpool-based developer has bought the Crumlin Road courthouse in north Belfast and has said he will spend Â£25m converting it into a hotel.

Last month, Lawrence Kenwright, from the Signature Living Group, announced plans to develop five hotels in Belfast.
The purchase of the courthouse is his first deal in the city though he owns four hotels in Liverpool.
The courthouse closed in 1998, after nearly 150 years of continuous use.
Mr Kenwright said his key focus would be on preserving the architectural heritage of the Charles Lanyon-designed courthouse, which was built in 1850.
"The courthouse is currently in a state of disrepair and our focus will be on sympathetically restoring the building to its former glory in a way that is both true to its architectural heritage, and aligns with the exciting style for which Signature Living is reputed," he said.
"We see ourselves simply as custodians of these important buildings and the courthouse will very much still belong to the people of Belfast."
Various development plans failed to get off the ground and the building has been damaged in a number of fires.
It has been derelict for 15 years and is in a state of serious disrepair.
The courthouse is one of Northern Ireland's best-known listed buildings.
