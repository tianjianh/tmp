Gay Pride: Abercrombie and Fitch accused of blunder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US clothing brand Abercrombie and Fitch has attracted an online backlash with a tweet seen by many as implying Gay Pride is not just for gay people.

The tweet, which has since been deleted, read: "The Pride community is everybody, not just LGBTQ people. - Kayla, merchandiser."
June is being celebrated as Pride Month around the world, with parades in Los Angeles, Athens, and Rome among others.
The aim is to celebrate the gay community and fight for LGBTQ rights.
The tweet was meant to promote Abercrombie's limited edition tie-up with The Trevor Project, a free suicide prevention hotline for young LGBTQ people.
But despite the praiseworthy connection, many of the brand's Twitter followers found it inappropriate.
Blogger Camille Beredjick's rebuke was "liked" over a thousand times.
