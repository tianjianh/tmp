Ridding Salford of its organised crime gangs could take a decade, Greater Manchester's outgoing Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy has told the BBC.

Sir Peter, speaking on his final day in the top job, said local people needed to work with the police to banish gun and gang violence.
There have been 21 shootings in the Salford area over 18 months.
Police revealed hundreds of "Osman" threat-to-life warnings had been issued to people in the city.
In the latest high-profile attack, Christian Hickey, seven, and his mother Jayne were shot in the legs after answering the door in Eccles on 12 October.
Detectives believe the escalating violence has been caused by a personal "falling out" between members of a gang called the A Team.
Sir Peter said: "We will arrest, undoubtedly, people as a result of this particular series of shootings, I'm confident of that.
"The trouble is will it address the underlying issue of organised crime in Salford?
"There are too many families who generation after generation have been engaged in this.
"How do we make sure we mobilise the vast majority of good people to say they've had enough and want it to change, in the way people in Moss Side said they wanted it to change?"
He said too many people were "turning a blind eye" to day-to-day crime such as the drugs trade.
"Certain families have been ruling the roost for many many years. That's the sort of thing that needs to be tackled and it's going to take probably 10 years to do that," he said.
Sir Peter, a police officer since 1981, has been Greater Manchester's chief constable since 2008.
He will now become chief executive of the African street children's charity Retrak.
