Friday marks 12 year since 52 people died and hundreds were injured when four suicide bombers attacked the city's transport system in 2005.
Sadiq Khan said Londoners "always pull together" in light of recent attacks in London Bridge, Westminster and Finsbury Park.
A wreath-laying ceremony took place earlier in honour of the victims.
"As well as grieving those we have lost, we also pay tribute to the heroic efforts of our emergency services and transport colleagues on that darkest of days", Mr Khan said
"Our firefighters, paramedics, police and public transport staff fought to save lives in the most horrific and harrowing of circumstances.
"The way our city stood together in the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks inspired the world.
"When Londoners face adversity, we always pull together."
Suicide bombers Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19, brought horror to London on July 7 2005.
Travelling from Luton, they took a train to King's Cross in London, hugged and separated to carry out the atrocities.
Within three minutes of 08:50 BST, Tanweer detonated his bomb at Aldgate, Khan set his device off at Edgware Road and Lindsay blew himself up between King's Cross and Russell Square.
Hussain detonated his device on a bus at Tavistock Square at 09:47 BST.
