[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jama Ahmed, 26, is on trial alongside Asif Yousaf, 33, charged with the murder of Jordan Thomas, 22, in 2014.
Mr Thomas was shot twice in the chest as he sat in a car on Derek Dooley Way.
Mr Ahmed, from Sheffield, denies murdering Mr Thomas, saying there had "never been a problem" between them. Mr Yousaf, from Sheffield, denies murder.
Prosecutors say Mr Thomas was shot by a lone gunman at about 22:15 GMT on 21 December in an attack linked to the fatal stabbing of Mubarak Ali in 2011 by Mr Thomas's cousin James Knowles.
It is alleged the man got out of a burgundy Mitsubishi Shogun and fired two shots at Mr Thomas and a third at driver Neshaun Ferguson.
Mr Ahmed, however, told Sheffield Crown Court that on the day of the killing he had been watching DVDs at an address in Broomhall before going home.
Asked if he knew who had killed Mr Thomas he said: "I would love to know. I'm completely innocent."
Mr Ahmed and Mr Thomas were allegedly involved in an altercation between two groups outside a Sheffield nightclub two days before the attack.
Mr Ahmed told the court he had been at the nightclub to sell drugs but was not involved in the incident.
He said he and Mr Thomas had played for the same football team and there had "never been a problem", but was aware that some people he knew "did not like anyone related to James Knowles".
Co-defendant Mr Yousaf told the court on Tuesday he had bought the car used in the shooting in exchange for crack cocaine but said he was not in the vehicle when the shooting happened.
He said he had given the vehicle to Mr Ahmed in Philadelphia Gardens, Upperthorpe, however, Mr Ahmed told the court that he had not been to that address, saying Mr Yousaf was lying.
Mr Ahmed, of Broomhall Place, and Mr Yousaf, of Violet Bank Road, also deny the attempted murder of Mr Ferguson.
Yousaf's father, Mohammed Yousaf, 61, also of Violet Bank Road, denies attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The trial continues.
