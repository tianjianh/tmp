Andy Payne, 53, suffered serious head injuries when he was hit at speed by a Fiat 500 in Brighton on 14 January.
CCTV footage of the crash, released by police in a bid to find witnesses, was viewed almost three million times.
Speaking from her home in Hove, Mr Payne's wife, Lisa, said: "He's getting better slowly. He's not too bad."
In the video, Mr Payne is thrown several feet into the air by the impact in Kemptown. He then lies motionless in Montague Place as passers-by come to his aid.
Crimestoppers confirmed that a Â£1,000 reward had been offered to help track down the driver of the Fiat 500.
Sussex Police said two people had been arrested in connection with the crash which happened on 14 January.
A 31-year-old man from Brighton was held on suspicion of dangerous driving causing serious injury, attempting to pervert the course of justice and aggravated vehicle taking.
He was detained after trying to hide on a roof in Donald Hall Road, Brighton.
A 56-year-old woman, also from Brighton, was arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Both have been bailed until 3 April.
Police said hundreds of people came forward after watching the CCTV and the man and woman were arrested as a direct result.
"We have passed on all the well wishes from people on social media to the victim who is grateful for the support," said Sgt Dan Pitcher.
"He is continuing to recover well at home."
