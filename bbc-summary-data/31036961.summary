The drive by VisitBritain will be targeted at key overseas markets.
It aims to increase the number of international tourists to Loch Ness and other nearby places such as Inverness by 50,000 over the next four years.
Inverness, Loch Ness and the surrounding areas already draw about 200,000 tourists a year.
The campaign has been welcomed by local MP and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.
He said: "I'm delighted to provide £2m for a four-year campaign to promote one of the most beautiful parts of the UK.
"The loch is a jewel in the crown of the Highlands tourism industry, which creates and sustains many jobs in Scotland.
"Around the world, Loch Ness is one of the best-known places in the UK, so it's right we place it at the heart of our international tourism campaign."
Patricia Yates, director of strategy and communications at VisitBritain, said: "Inbound tourism is one of Scotland's most successful export industries, generating jobs and growth across the country.
"Inverness already has strong appeal for inbound visitors and this extra funding, along with international profile generated around recent major tournaments across the country, can deliver growth for years to come."
Colin Marr, chairman of the Uniqueness Tourism Business Improvement District, said his organisation was looking forward to working with VisitBritain.
