Latvia profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The media reflect the linguistic and cultural split between Latvian and Russian speakers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
TV is the leading medium and the sector is dominated by top commercial station TV3, two public networks and the Baltic variants of Russian networks.
TV3's owner, Sweden's MTG, is a major player in the broadcasting sector.
Russian-language media is dominated by pro-Kremlin, Russia-made content.
In response, Latvia has given closer official scrutiny to media policy and in 2016 temporarily banned a Russian TV network for "inciting hatred".
Public Latvian Radio (LR) dominates the radio market, thanks partly to the popularity of music station Radio 2. Public radio and TV are financed by state subsidies and advertising.
The BBC World Service in English is relayed in Riga on 100.5 FM.
Newspapers - all of them privately-owned - reflect a variety of political views. Many titles have suffered declining circulations.
By late 2015, more than 1.6 million Latvians were online (Internetworldstats). Latvian social network Draugiem.lv rivals Facebook in popularity.
Inbox.lv portal, offering email, dating and photo services, is one of the most-visited sites.
