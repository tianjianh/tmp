Reading 0-0 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ali Al-Habsi's penalty save helped Reading hold promotion-chasing Burnley to a goalless draw in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andre Gray saw his penalty saved after he had been tripped by Al-Habsi, and Reading held out to secure a point.
Gray should have put Burnley in front early on when he scuffed Geroge Boyd's cross over from six yards out.
Tom Heaton saved from Yann Kermorgant's header at the other end, while Gray put Matt Lowton's cross wide from point-blank range after the break.
Former Brentford striker Gray, the Championship's top scorer with 18 goals this season, faced a long wait to take his penalty, with Reading winger Hal Robson-Kanu receiving a booking for scuffing up the penalty spot.
The Royals could have won it when Robson-Kanu fired well over, but they created few chances throughout and have now scored only eight goals in their last 14 matches.
Burnley remain third in the table after extending their unbeaten run in the league to eight games, while Reading stay 15th.

"I've looked back at the penalty decision three or four times and it doesn't look like Ali's touched him.
"Then Ali made a great save from the penalty and we're delighted with that.
"Our players were incensed for a reason, but Ali's made a fabulous save and that was the right outcome."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"From where I was looking, I did see their player [Robson-Kanu] dig the spot up.
"I've never seen that in my career and I hope my players never conduct themselves in that manner.
"I would not expect my players to move the ball off the spot when someone is ready to take a penalty and then kick the floor up. I think that's really poor."
