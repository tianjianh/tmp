Queen of the South fans renew club director bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fresh attempt is being made to get fan representation on the agenda for the annual general meeting of a Scottish Championship football club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Supporters hope to secure a seat on the board at Queen of the South.
Dumfries and Galloway Council has already agreed in principle to back the bid by the Queens Trust.
It is now being asked to use its shareholding in the Dumfries club to allow the issue to be discussed at the AGM next year.
The Queens Trust has just over 900 shares in the club, with 7,500 needed to allow it to add an item to the agenda.
It needs the support of the council - which holds more than 6,600 shares - to help secure its goal of discussing a director's role.
The club has said that its door is "always open" for an "open and honest dialogue" with supporters.
A report for the Dumfries common good sub committee early next year outlines progress on the idea since it was first suggested last year.
A meeting took place in August to discuss the possibility with the club.
The Dumfries side has since appointed a supporter liaison officer to improve the relationship between fans and directors.
Fans are still keen to take on a director's role or a place as a non-voting representative on the board.
The council will consider whether or not to provide the votes necessary to get the issue discussed at the AGM when it meets on 9 January.
