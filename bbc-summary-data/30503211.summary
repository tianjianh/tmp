Mathew Davies, of Blackwood, Caerphilly county, has been held at the high-security Cipinang Penitentiary Institution in Jakarta since August.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance.
"We can confirm that a British national has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Indonesia," a spokesman added.
