[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caerphilly Labour MP Wayne David, who left the Labour front bench in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, is to return - as a shadow defence minister.

Mr David said he has agreed to go back if he can continue to support multilateral disarmament and the renewal of the Trident nuclear system.
It was important to provide an effective opposition and "take the fight to the Tories", he added.
In July, he warned Labour was not an effective opposition under Mr Corbyn.
Explaining his decision to resign at the time he said: "Jeremy's position is completely untenable and I really think that what he should do is look at the likely scenarios over the next few months and years and recognise that, though a decent man he is, his position as leader of the Labour Party has effectively come to an end."
In his new role Mr David will work under Llanelli MP Nia Griffith, who was named as shadow defence secretary last week.
Meanwhile recently elected MP Chris Elmore has joined the Labour whip's office.
Mr Elmore, who became an MP following a by-election in May, said on Twitter that he was "following in footsteps of several of my predecessors who served as MP for Ogmore".
Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens has also re-joined Mr Corbyn's team as shadow Welsh secretary , whilst Torfaen MP Nick Thomas-Symonds was appointed shadow solicitor-general and Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan shadow arts minister.
