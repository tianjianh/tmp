However, the company said it will not sell its popular smartphones and will instead offer lesser-known products such as headphones.
Xiaomi cited logistical issues like hardware certification as a reason why it wasn't yet ready to bring handsets to the US.
It said it hoped to instead build brand awareness with the Mi.com store.
Xiaomi has enjoyed a meteoric rise in China, where it has been hailed as the country's Apple for its popular smartphones which it sells at a fraction of the cost of an iPhone.
It's the world's most valuable privately held company, and its third biggest smartphone maker, selling 61 million handsets last year.
