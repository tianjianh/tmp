Tribute to Paul Wilmott killed in Haxby house explosion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a man who was killed in a massive house explosion in North Yorkshire has paid tribute to the "fun and inspiring father".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Wilmott, 63, was alone in his detached property on Springwood in Haxby, near York, when it was destroyed by the blast on Friday morning.
An inquest is expected to open and adjourn on Thursday while an inquiry into the cause of the blast continues.
His family said the father-of-one was "extremely kind and enjoyed life".
Mr Wilmott's partner Olivia said: "He was the kindest, gentlest person I have ever known."
His son, Ian, described his father as "a happy person, who was fun and inspiring".
The cause is thought to be a gas blast and is being treated as an accident after initial inquiries.
A sound engineer from York, the 63-year-old worked at Leeds Beckett University for more than 30 years and more recently at the institute's video production unit.
He had also volunteered at York Hospital Radio for many years.
His family said: "He did many outside broadcasts including from the York Barbican and York Minister, as well as the city's Joseph Rowntree Theatre and the Theatre Royal."
Vice-chancellor Peter Slee said he was "very saddened to hear of his death and our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time".
