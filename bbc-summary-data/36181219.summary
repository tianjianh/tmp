Rescuers evacuate injured man from Maentwrog gorge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rescuers had to use ropes to evacuate a man who was injured in a gorge at a waterfall in Snowdonia before he could be airlifted to hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four mountain rescue teams were called in on Saturday afternoon after a rescue helicopter was unable to get to the man at Maentwrog gorge.
He was taken from the gorge using a rope and stretcher system after suffering an ankle injury.
The man was flown to hospital four hours after the rescue operation began.
The gorge is used for canyoning where people climb and jump into the water.
Aberglaslyn Mountain Rescue Team and South Snowdonia Search and Rescue Team worked on the rescue together with volunteers from Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team and Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation who were also called out.
