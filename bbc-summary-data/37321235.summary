Vuelta a Espana: Chris Froome wins stage 19 to slash Nairo Quintana's lead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome slashed Nairo Quintana's lead in the Vuelta a Espana by more than two minutes with a dominant victory on stage 19.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Team Sky's Froome, 31, won the 37km time trial by 44 seconds from Jonathan Castroviejo, and finished two minutes 16 seconds in front of Quintana.
That leaves the Colombian, 26, one minute 21 seconds ahead of Froome.
Saturday's stage has a mountain-top finish before a largely processional final stage into Madrid on Sunday.
Froome, who won Olympic time trial bronze in Rio, is trying to become the first man for 38 years to win the Tour de France and Vuelta in the same season.
He said: "It's going to be tough. He still has a one-minute advantage but I'll keep fighting all the way."
Froome added the Vuelta would be his last race of the season.
