[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emma Coates' reign as Doncaster Rovers Belles manager began with a defeat by Notts County Ladies, whose goalkeeper Carly Telford was stretchered off.

Coates, who replaced Glen Harris in charge of Women's Super League One's bottom side, saw her side go behind to Rachel Williams' swivel and shot.
The Belles levelled with a goal from former Lady Pie Jess Sigsworth.
England player Telford left the field after landing awkwardly, before Ellen White lobbed home the hosts' winner.
Telford had her knee in a brace, as her side's victory leaves them sixth in WSL 1, seven points above Doncaster.
Coates' side are yet to earn a point in their opening four matches since promotion to the top flight, but have three games in hand over the side above them, Sunderland.
Notts County Ladies defender Laura Bassett:
"It's a relief but we deserved it.
"The moves we put together and the chances we created mean everybody's really pleased, and so they should be.
"Belles have some fabulous players and with the new manager we knew we were going to get a tough game, so we had to start with intensity, especially in the second half of the game to get the win."
Doncaster Rovers Belles boss Emma Coates:
"I was really happy with the first-half performance but we struggled to get the ball out wide in the second half.
"We were tiring but I'm not sure if it's physical or psychological. We have to get ourselves out of a bit of a lull at times and manage the game better when we're on top.
"I told the girls it's tough to take because that's the best we've played all season.
"Time isn't on our side but we've got more to build on from what we saw when we get teams back to Doncaster."
