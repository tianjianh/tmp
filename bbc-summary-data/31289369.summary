The song sold more than 172,000 copies, about 87,000 more than Ronson's Uptown Funk, featuring Bruno Mars.
It is Goulding's second number one, after Burn in 2013.
Love Me Like You Do is the fastest-selling single of the year so far.
Ronson's Uptown Funk has spent nine weeks in the chart in total, seven of them in the number one slot.
Rounding off the top five singles, was Hozier's Take Me To Church; Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney's FourFive Seconds, and Meghan Trainor's Lips Are Movin.
