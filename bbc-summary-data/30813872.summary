Failed tourist site Archaeolink to be sold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeenshire Council has agreed to sell the site of the failed tourist attraction Archaeolink.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The prehistory park at Oyne, near Insch, was shut down in 2011.
Attempts to find a new backer have ended in failure.
It opened in 1997 but cost more than Â£100,000 a year in annual subsidies.
Aberdeenshire Council has agreed to put the former museum and a large amount of open space on the open market.
Councillor Fergus Hood, chairman of the Garioch area committee, said: "Archaeolink has served its use as a tourist facility and, having considered a range of options since its closure, it is felt offering the site for sale is the most sensible way forward.
"As well as the museum structure itself, the site boasts a substantial amount of open space and we hope it will attract significant interest."
