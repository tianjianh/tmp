An uninsured teenager driver damaged cars and houses during a police pursuit in Whitehaven, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Patrick Hughes, 19, struck three parked vehicles, knocked down a lamp post and damaged drain pipes outside five different High Road addresses.
The chase on 9 May ended when he crashed his Audi A3 into a garden wall.
Hughes, of Fell View Drive, Egremont, admitted 17 offences and was sentenced to nine months in jail suspended for two years at Carlisle Crown Court.
He must also complete 150 hours of unpaid work and was banned from driving for a year.
The police chase came five days after Hughes sped away from officers and damaged a taxi in the same town.
Judge Peter Davies said it was "two moments of madness".
