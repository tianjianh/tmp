Martyn Waghorn: Rangers striker facing two weeks on sidelines

Rangers striker Martyn Waghorn is facing a brief lay-off, allaying fears of a long-term injury.

The 26-year-old was distraught after pulling up with an apparent hamstring problem late in Saturday's Premiership draw at home to Hamilton.
But Waghorn's mood is more upbeat following a scan.
"Good result, not as bad as it could have been. Roughly 2 weeks out, hard work has begun to come back stronger," he wrote on Twitter.
Waghorn scored his fifth goal in four matches on Saturday and the news will come as a major relief both to him and manager Mark Warburton, who is still trying to sign another striker.
The striker missed 10 weeks late last season after suffering a knee injury in a Scottish Cup win over Kilmarnock.
While Waghorn will definitely miss Saturday's trip to Dundee, defenders Danny Wilson and Lee Wallace should be available after missing the midweek League Cup win over Peterhead with a sickness bug.
Former Accrington pair Josh Windass (hamstring) and Matt Crooks (ankle) have both resumed light training.
