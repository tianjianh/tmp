[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premiership: Wasps 9-8 Newcastle Falcons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jimmy Gopperth's late penalty gave Wasps their third straight Premiership victory as they edged out Newcastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a first half of few try-scoring chances, Gopperth and Newcastle's Andy Goode exchanged penalties in tough conditions to make it 3-3.
Nili Latu crossed from close range to put Falcons ahead after the break, while Wasps had tries from Christian Wade and James Cannon disallowed.
But two Gopperth penalties against his old side sealed the win for the hosts.
Relive Saturday's Premiership action.
Falcons were left to rue rue missed opportunities, with Goode, making his first start for Dean Richards' side against one of his former clubs, missing two penalties and a conversion attempt in the windy conditions at the Ricoh Arena.
Right at the death, Newcastle had also Goode in the pocket waiting for a drop-kick attempt, but Giovanbattista Venditti - who was sin-binned midway through the second half - knocked on as the ball came loose and Wasps saw the ball dead to earn victory.
The hosts had Wade returning to the back line after a three-month injury lay off, and midway through the second half he had the ball down in the corner, but was ruled offside from the kick forward by the TV match official.
Cannon - an early replacement for James Gaskell - also thought he had scored for Dai Young's side, but the referee adjudged that there was a forward pass in the build-up.
The defeat leaves Newcastle second from bottom in the table, four points above London Irish, with Wasps moving above Gloucester into fifth.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"It was a typical Wasps effort as we seem to have to win games three times over and then try and find four ways of throwing it away.
"We squandered a couple of opportunities and the conditions made it a very tight game but those conditions don't suit us as we want to play with tempo.
"We have to be smarter than that, especially in the last few minutes, and we were lucky to come out on the right side."
Newcastle assistant coach Dave Walder:
"We are hugely disappointed as we were controlling the nothingness and Wasps were getting frustrated in that second-half.
"We need to be more clinical but will learn from it.
"Getting a point out of the game was a positive as Wasps are one of the form teams of the Premiership."
