Tracey Baker duped £100,000 out of Welsh assembly

A London Underground worker has admitted receiving £100,000 from the Welsh assembly after officials were duped in to believing they were paying for cleaning services.

Six payments were made to Tracey Baker, 44, between October 2013 and June 2014.
Baker, from London, pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to acquiring criminal property.
But she denied writing the false letter claiming the assembly's contractor's business bank details had changed.
The charge of fraud by false representation will lie on file, judge Jeremy Gold said.
The court heard officials were tricked in to transferring the money to her account after receiving what turned out to be a false letter claiming that Total Support Services' bank details had changed.
But the new account belonged to Baker who pocketed a total of just under £104,000.
Judge Gold said: "You've pleaded guilty to a very serious criminal offence and there's certainly no guarantee that you won't be going straight to custody."
Baker will be sentenced in September.
An assembly spokesman said the incident was an isolated one and the Assembly Commission had strengthened its controls to ensure similar crimes would be prevented.
