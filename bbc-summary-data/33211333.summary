The trouble began in Bryson Street at about 22:00 BST.
The child was arrested after a seven-year-old boy was struck on his arm by a stone.
Police said they kept rival factions apart until just before 01:00 BST on Saturday. The 13-year-old has been released on bail.
Temporary Supt Bobby Singleton appealed for parents to be aware of where their children are.
"CCTV footage of this incident will be reviewed to determine if any further offences have been committed and I would ask that anyone who has any information to assist police with their enquiries to contact officers in Strandtown on 101," he said.
"We're concerned not only about the safety of young people in the area, but also the potential for them to get caught up in incidents which could have a serious impact on their futures."
