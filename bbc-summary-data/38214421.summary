[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire service were called to the house at Albert Street shortly before 22:00 GMT on Sunday.
Three fire appliances attended the scene and firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found the man's body.
The fire service set up an exclusion zone around the house for an hour afterwards.
People living nearby were advised to stay indoors as the building was ventilated and made safe.
A neighbour of the man, who had earlier left him round Sunday lunch, said he had complained of having problems with his fire and that he thought he needed his chimney cleaned.
She said his smoke alarm had gone off earlier in the day.
"I said 'well don't be going asleep in there'," the woman said.
"God love him, he was a lovely, lovely man - he was lovely and we'll miss him."
Police said they were investigating the circumstances surrounding the man's death.
