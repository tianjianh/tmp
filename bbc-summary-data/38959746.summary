Firefighters have blamed a rise in callouts involving sex games on kinky blockbuster Fifty Shades of Grey.

The London Fire Brigade said the number of people who had to be released from handcuffs almost doubled in two years, from 15 in 2014-15 to 27 in 2015-16.
There were nine callouts involving "men with rings stuck on their penises" since April, it said.
The brigade urged adventurous couples to be careful in order to to avoid an "embarrassing" visit.
In the last five years the capital's fire crews have been called out to:
Each incident costs taxpayers at least Â£326 - a total of Â£830,000 over the past three years.
London Fire Brigade director of operations Dave Brown said: "We're pleased that fewer people are getting themselves stuck in difficult situations and reducing callouts; however, it seems the Fifty Shades of Grey effect is still leading to some call embarrassing callouts."
The warning was issued upon the cinematic release of the second Fifty Shades of Grey film.
Based on EL James's trio of hit erotic novels, it follows an affair between student Anastasia Steele and billionaire Christian Grey.
According to BBC Entertainment, the film adaptation has received a "critical spanking" from reviewers.
