Two men wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing of a British holidaymaker in Cyprus have been arrested in the north of the island.

Estate agent George Low, 22, from Dartford, was stabbed in the neck near a nightclub in Ayia Napa on the Greek side of the border on Sunday.
Police were told it happened after a row about urinating in the street.
Arrest warrants were issued for Mehmet Akpinar, 22, and Sali Ahmet, 42, who were detained late on Friday.
The men, thought to be Turkish Cypriots, were detained on the Turkish side of the island for an offence unconnected to the stabbing, said deputy police chief of the Famagusta region George Economou,
"They appeared in court this morning [on the Turkish side] over this unconnected offence and have been remanded in custody for three days," he said.
"I am now waiting to hear what will happen at the end of those three days."
The investigation into Mr Low's murder has been carried out by Greek Cypriot police but they have no jurisdiction in the Turkish-controlled north of the island.
Mr Low's mother Helen, 47, welcomed the development.
"We have not heard anything official from CID, but we are aware of the reports and are overjoyed," she said.
"We just want justice for George and Ben, who has been left traumatised by all this."
Mrs Low said her son's body had not yet been flown back to the UK to allow preparations for his funeral to go ahead.
Police have also issued a warrant for a third man suspected to have helped the suspects escape to the Turkish side.
Mr Low, a former club manager in Ayia Napa, and his friend Ben Barker are believed to have been stabbed after a row broke out.
Mr Barker, 22, received knife wounds to his back in the attack in Grigori Axfentiou Street, but survived.
Mr Economou said earlier this week his officers were told the two British men were urinating in the street and two Turkish Cypriot men told them not to, which led to the argument.
He said the assailants allegedly returned with a knife about 10 minutes later.
The group did not know each other beforehand.
A 48-year-old woman taken into custody pending further inquiries - but not charged - is said to be the girlfriend of Mr Akpinar and is accused of taking him a fresh pair of clothes and retrieving his mobile phone.
A district court in Larnaca remanded her in custody for eight days.
