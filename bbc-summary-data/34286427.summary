[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mo Farah clear to continue with Alberto Salazar - UK Athletics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UK Athletics has found "no reason to be concerned" about Mo Farah's coach Alberto Salazar and his training regime at the US-based Nike Oregon Project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a full review into allegations of doping against Salazar, UKA restated its view there is "no evidence of any impropriety" from Britain's double Olympic champion or any reason to "lack confidence" in his training programme.
A BBC Panorama programme accused Salazar of practising doping techniques with other athletes, which he denies.
There is no suggestion Farah, 32, has been involved in doping.
Salazar has worked as a consultant for British Athletics since 2013.
UK Athletics said it will not sever links with the Oregon Project, with its "focus" being on the coaching and support for Farah.
However, UKA said its oversight group had made "organisational and procedural recommendations" which would be put in place in the coming months.
In July, UKA said none of the "extensive information" supplied to the review panel contained any evidence of impropriety by Farah or gave them reason to "question the appropriateness of the input" into his preparation by Salazar's team.
The governing body will not release further details until formal investigations by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) and UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) are complete.
Farah became the first man to complete the long-distance double at two World Championships with his 5,000m and 10,000m victories in Beijing last month.
"The UKA's Performance Oversight Group appears to have given Alberto Salazar a clean bill of health and a green light to continue working with Mo Farah - though the statement doesn't mention him by name.
"This follows interviews with some of the 20 athletes or staff who have gone to Usada to register their concern about alleged doping and unethical practises at the Nike Oregon Project.
"Salazar was accused of doping his athlete Galen Rupp with testosterone aged 16, which Salazar denies, and testing the banned anabolic steroid on his adult sons to see how much would trigger a positive drugs test, which he admits.
"UKA, whose main sponsor is Nike, said it didn't have the jurisdiction to investigate doping allegations, and said it had been asked not to reveal its full findings whilst USADA is investigating the allegations made in the Panorama programme.
"That being the case, and with UKA refusing to confirm whether Salazar will keep his official role as "consultant" to GB's overall endurance programme, questions may be raised as to what the point of this review actually was."
