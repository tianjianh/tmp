Euro 2016: Croatia fail to overturn docked point for swastika

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Croatia will have a point deducted from their Euro 2016 qualifying tally after failing in an appeal against the punishment given for fans marking a swastika onto their pitch.

The symbol was visible during June's 1-1 draw against Group H rivals Italy, which was behind closed doors.
The Croatian Football Federation said the incident was an act of "sabotage", but their appeal was rejected by Uefa.
Croatia are third in the group, four behind Italy and two below Norway.
The top two teams from each group automatically qualify for next summer's finals in France, with third place likely to mean a play-off.
Croatia host Bulgaria and then travel to Malta in their final two qualifiers in October.
They have to play two home games, including the Bulgaria match, in an empty stadium as part of their punishment.
