Williams, 40, sped over from 20 metres with his first touch back at the Principality Stadium.
He also gave scoring passes to Gavin Lewis, his brother-in-law, and Shaun Cadell.
But Williams was bumped off by powerhouse Caerphilly wing Gareth Dare for one of the Cheesemen's tries.
Scrum-half Joel Foster kicked 23 points, including six second-half penalties, to see United home.
Williams, Wales' record try-scorer, returned to the red shirt of his first club to boost their chances of glory in the third-tier club competition, playing his sixth game of the season.
He was involved in plenty of the first-half action, but his side trailed 21-20 at the break with Chris Thomas and Matthew Hurley crossing for Caerphilly before Dare's 50-metre charge.
With the lead changing hands seven times, a try from former Cardiff Blues and Pontypridd three-quarter Matthew Nuthall and 11 points from Hurley's boot saw Caerphilly lead going into the last 10 minutes.
Williams also had a hand in the final corner try for Chris Rees, but Foster's boot had already done the damage.
