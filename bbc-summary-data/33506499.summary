Animal rights activists in India are outraged after a video emerged showing a man abusing a stray dog.

The video shows the man swinging the dog by its hind legs and then throwing it at a parked car. In the 23-second clip, which has since been removed, the dog is heard howling in pain.
The man posted the video two days ago on his Facebook page, showing "how he spends his free time".
After his page was flooded with angry comments, he deleted his profile.
But outraged activists want the police to arrest the man and charge him with cruelty.
"We want the police to find this youth and take action against him for cruelty against the animal," activist Shehzad Poonawalla told The Times of India.
Other activists have urged people to discourage such behaviour.
"It's shameful that his sole intent was to torture the dog and entertain himself at the expense of its trauma. We encourage people to discourage such behaviour against animals and report them to the local police or any official nearby, if not stop it themselves," NG Jayasimha, managing director of Humane Society International India, told the paper.
