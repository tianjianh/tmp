[SN]TITLE[SN]
Deepdale Gangsters injunction backed by appeal judges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A curfew and ban on carrying multiple mobile phones, placed on a man police claim was part of a violent gang, were "amply justified", judges have ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An anti-gang injunction was made against Joshua James Murray in 2014 over his alleged links with the Deepdale Gangsters in Preston.
Challenging the order at London's Civil Appeal Court, Mr Murray's counsel claimed he was not in the group.
Dismissing the claim, judges said gang members were "all in it together".
The injunction, made under the Policing and Crime Act 2009, was one of seven served against alleged members of the gang.
One of the others was 18-year-old Jonjo Highton, who was murdered in what police described as a "mass attack" in Preston in August 2014.
Lancashire Police said Mr Murray had been involved in three violent attacks between June 2013 and May 2014.
The order imposed a night-time curfew, barred him from parts of Preston, and banned him from both travelling in a car with more than two others and carrying multiple mobile phones.
Any breach would leave him liable to arrest, the court was told.
His challenge, which claimed the order was too widely drawn, represented one of the first times the Court of Appeal has considered such injunctions.
Dismissing Mr Murray's claims that he had never heard of the Deepdale Gangsters, Lord Justice McCombe said: "It seems to me that the violence attributed to the gangs in this case could scarcely have been more serious."
He said gang members were "all in it together" and it appeared to be "a matter of serendipity" which of them took part in each attack.
As a result, he and Lord Justice Elias ruled the order against Mr Murray was "amply justified".
