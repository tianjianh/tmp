UK's tallest living Christmas tree gets decorated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What's thought to be the UK's tallest living Christmas tree has had a festive make-over.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Around 1,800 fairy lights were wrapped around the giant redwood tree at Wakehurst Place, in Sussex.
It was planted in 1890 and is now 33 metres high, that's three times taller than the highest Olympic diving board.
The team had to use two cranes to reach the branches at the top.
