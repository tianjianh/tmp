Nathan Ake hopes a first goal for loan club Bournemouth will be the catalyst to kick-start his time with the club.

The Chelsea loanee, 21, scored the winner against Stoke on Saturday to secure a first Premier League away win of the season for Eddie Howe's side.
Chances have been limited for the Netherlands Under-21 international, who made his first league start at Stoke.
"It's been frustrating, but a lot of people have helped me get through it," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Ake, who moved to the south coast on a season-long loan in June, made 20 league starts for Watford last season while on loan at Vicarage Road.
He had hoped to establish himself as a defensive midfielder but now admits he is happy to take any available opportunity to play.
"I can't complain playing at centre back," Ake added. "If you play, you play."
"I'm delighted to be able to come in and score straight away. I just need to stay focused and be ready for the next game against Arsenal.
"Hopefully, I can keep improving in training and do the things the manager wants me to do."
