Dave and Angela Dawes from Wisbech were the only winners of the jackpot in Friday's draw, banking £101,203,600.70.
Mr Dawes, 47, is a shift supervisor, and his partner, 43, is a volunteer for the British Heart Foundation.
Chelsea fan Mr Dawes, said he now plans to buy a house near the ground - and ask Frank Lampard round for tea.
He said: "We were watching TV and the Euromillions draw show came on so we kept watching, not thinking we would win anything.
"We got our tickets out and watched in shock as, one by one, the numbers came up on the line I'd chosen.
"We couldn't believe it. It was too late to call Camelot so I kept the ticket on me all night until the morning but we didn't sleep a wink."
The ticket was bought at WH Smith on the Market Place in Wisbech.
Mr Dawes, who works at Premier Foods, said he wanted to buy a season ticket to watch Chelsea FC.
He said: "I'm not worried about getting a box - I want to stand with the real fans and watch my team play.
"I'd also love to live near the ground and have Frank Lampard come over for a cup of tea."
The couple, who have been together for four years, said they would continue with their plan to get married in Portugal next year.
Ms Dawes, who has already changed her surname to her partner's, said: "It's an excessive amount of money but we intend to make our friends and family millionaires."
She added that they had already broken the news to some of the people that they would be helping.
"They are absolutely gobsmacked, amazed," she said.
"Obviously it's exciting for us and exciting for them."
In July, Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire won a record European lottery prize of £161m.
UK ticketholders have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 15 times in the past two years.
Last year two anonymous UK winners scooped £113m and £84m.
The couple's success means they are £1m better off than David Bowie, the 703rd richest person in the country, according to The Sunday Times Rich List 2011.
They move ahead of celebrity couples such as Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne (£95m) and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin (£48m).
The winning numbers were 18, 26, 34, 38 and 42. The Lucky Star numbers were five and eight.
Nine countries participate in Euromillions - the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Austria.
Ticket sales in all those countries contribute to the Euromillions jackpot.
