[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, is offering a Mass for the people of France in St Andrew's Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The theme of the service, which began at 17:15, is hope and solidarity.
Among those attending are Scotland's justice secretary Michael Matheson and French government representative Dr John Campbell.
Archbishop Tartaglia will say last week's terror attacks in Paris were acts of "pitiless cruelty".
The near simultaneous attacks left more than 400 people wounded, with 221 still in hospital, 57 of them in intensive care.
The archbishop will add: "We are in solidarity with the people of France who are deeply shocked and sorely grieved, and yet refuse to be bowed by terrorism.
"And with them we hope for the victory of humanity over inhumanity, of peaceful coexistence over civil strife, of democracy over tyranny, of civilisation over chaos, and of hope over despair.
"In this Mass, we pray for the dead, the injured, the bereaved, and for all those whose lives have been shattered by these acts of pitiless cruelty.
"And we pray for the citizens of Paris whose beautiful city has once again been turned into a brutal killing field.
"We pray that the men of violence and terror who seek to impose tyranny, to sow distrust and to engender strife will be defeated and ultimately banished by France's love for liberty, her instinct for equality, and her passion for fraternity."
