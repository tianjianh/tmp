India captain Virat Kohli says his friendships with Australia players are over after their heated Test series.

India won the final match of the four-Test series to secure a 2-1 victory.
Prior to the first Test in Pune, Kohli spoke warmly of the tourists' players, saying he was "really good friends with all these guys off the field".
But asked after Tuesday's eight-wicket win in Dharamsala if that was still the case, he said: "No, it has changed. You won't hear me say that ever again."
During the series, Kohli - who missed the final Test with injury - said Australia captain Steve Smith "crossed the line" by trying to get help from his dressing room with the decision review system.
India were thrashed by 333 runs in the opening Test, but levelled with victory in the second.
During that game, Smith was caught looking for assistance as he considered reviewing an lbw decision, which is banned. Smith described his actions as "a bit of brain-fade".
Kohli injured his shoulder as he dived to save a boundary during the drawn third Test, and Australian Glenn Maxwell was accused of mocking him later in the match.
Without Kohli, India went on to win the fourth Test, during which the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) put a video on its website of a spat between all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and Australia wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.
"I have sort of been very intense in my own little bubble, and at times I have let my emotions and actions just falter a little bit throughout this series and I apologise for that," said Smith.
"That's a big stride for me moving forward and something I can really learn from and continue to grow as an individual and as a leader."
Smith said he was "a bit disappointed" the BCCI had posted the video of Jadeja and Wade.
He added: "It happened between both sides throughout the series. I think usually what's said on the field stays on the field."
