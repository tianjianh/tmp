Wood panel manufacturer Norbord plans to make a major investment at its plant in Morayhill, near Inverness.

The Toronto-based company has informed Highland Council of proposals to upgrade the 25-year-old factory.
Norbord said the move would help to secure the long-term future of the 130 staff at Morayhill, and 300 indirect jobs in the plant's supply chain.
The investment plans have still to be reviewed and approved by Norbord's board of directors.
Karl Morris, managing director of Norbord Europe, said there was potential for the plant to take a "major step forward" in its manufacturing work.
He said: "The Morayhill site has been part of the Inverness landscape for more than a quarter of a century and has enjoyed very positive relations with both the local community and regulatory authorities.
"Building on that foundation is important, and Norbord looks forward to the support of the community, the regulators and Highlands and Islands Enterprise in ultimately achieving final approval for the project."
