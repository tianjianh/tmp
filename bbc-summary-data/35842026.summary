[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Takeaways in Wales will have to promote food hygiene ratings on their leaflets from November, the Welsh Government has announced.

Businesses will have to display the "scores on the doors" scheme on their flyers and menus.
They will also be asked to voluntarily promote their own rating - providing it is up to date.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it would "fill a gap" for those ordering takeaways by phone.
The requirement will come into force on the third anniversary of the food hygiene ratings being rolled out.
Latest figures show more than 60% of food businesses in Wales have been awarded the highest [very good] rating - a five.
That is up from just a third which got the top rating four years ago.
Mr Gething said the system had played a significant role in encouraging businesses to improve food hygiene standards.
Faruk Kadir, of Corfu Kebab House in Rhyl, Denbighshire, which has a five rating and is among the Welsh nominees for British Kebab House of the Year next week, said it was important customers knew as much as possible.
"Food hygiene is the first rule - and it's very important when you buy food that you trust the kitchen. It has to be right; that's not just from food from a business but any food you prepare," he said.
