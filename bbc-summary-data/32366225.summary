UK police are reviewing security plans for Anzac Day events after Australian authorities said they foiled a terror plot to attack an event in Melbourne.

Five teenagers were arrested over plans to target police at the memorial event next week, Australian police said.
The Metropolitan Police said there was no "specific threat" to the UK but security for Anzac Day events was being reviewed as a "sensible precaution".
Anzac Day honours Australian and New Zealand soldiers who have died in war.
Australians and New Zealanders in the UK traditionally observe the occasion, which takes place on 25 April each year, by holding services in Westminster and Hyde Park in central London.
Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: "Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK.
"We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers.
"While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant."
The current UK threat level for international terrorism, set by the government, is "severe" - meaning an attack is "highly likely".
Anzac Day was established to mark the anniversary of the start of the Gallipoli campaign in World War One, and this year marks 100 years since that day.
