The former AC Milan forward, 26, arrived in England on Wednesday amid reports he is about to join the Premier League strugglers until May.
Chelsea have not commented on a move for Pato, who spent the last two Brazilian seasons on loan at Sao Paulo.
"I really want to play for Chelsea. I need to play. I'm so happy," the Brazil international said.
Pato joined Milan as a 17-year-old in 2007 and was a success, but scored only once in his final 21 Serie A games before moving back to Brazil in 2013.
The forward has scored 10 goals in 25 caps for Brazil, but last appeared for his country in 2013.
He also won a silver medal at the London Olympics in 2012.
After landing at London's Heathrow Airport, Pato said: "Thanks Chelsea for the support and thanks for my fans.
"I want to know my new friends, the new players, and the team."
Pato was speaking as Chelsea midfielder Ramires joined Chinese side Jiangsu Suning in a deal believed to be worth about Â£25m.
