Unequal Scotland? - How a life of poverty begins in the classroom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The life chances of Scots are set early. By the time a pupil starts school, those in the most deprived fifth of communities are well behind those from the 10% of areas with the highest income.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On average, the more deprived pupils are 13 months behind in their vocabulary. They are 10 months behind in problem-solving.
Schools can do a lot to help close that gap, and alter the life chances of their students. But do they? The statistics aren't clear, as there is very little comparable testing of pupils as they make their way through school. What is clear is that the gap is much wider by the time pupils leave school.
The national survey of literacy and numeracy suggests that it widens quickly during primary and continues to spread during secondary.
On numeracy in 2013, the proportion of pupils from the least deprived areas who were performing well or very well was at 84%, but for the most deprived, 72%. At second year of secondary, that gap had opened to 90% and 68%.
On reading in 2014, the primary four gap on "performing well or very well" was at 75% in the least deprived areas, and 61% in the most deprived. Five years up the school, and the gap was a wider 52% to only 25% of pupils from deprived areas performing well or very well.
Findings from PISA, the Programme for International Student Assessment, have caused some concern, as they showed a decline since the previous survey. Whereas Scotland used to be an educational world-beater, it is now looking mediocre. And as others improve, its relative position has been falling.
That is taken as a sign that the relative strengths of Scotland's education system are possibly being eroded. But on inequality, the international perspective can still be a flattering one.
Is that widening gap a sign of failure? Not necessarily. The data doesn't tell us, but the gap may have widened because pupils from the most prosperous neighbourhoods tend to progress faster.
All pupils can be expected to progress as they grow up, but those who start with an advantage progress at a faster rate than others.
Audit Scotland noted in 2014 that 19 out of 32 Scottish councils saw improvement at fourth year of secondary was faster for higher-performing schools than lower-performing ones.
And that raises a challenging dilemma for tackling educational inequality: if resources are directed to helping raise up the so-called "tail" of those who achieve little through their schooling, might that be at the expense of pursuing excellence for the most gifted pupils at the top end of the spectrum of achievement?
Sue Ellis, professor of education at Strathclyde University, says: "Some of those who are the most gifted are children in poverty, who are gifted but not getting support. We're not identifying the children who are most gifted.
"What we may be doing is giving a lot of advantage to quite mediocre children who have the most pushy parents."
Why is it that deprivation is closely linked to low achievement? A lot has to do with the home environment, parenting, expectations placed on pupils and the peer group. One role of a school is to complement the home environment, to the extent that schools should counteract the disadvantage it sometimes brings. That can be with homework clubs and targeted support for pupils who are falling behind.
The comprehensive schooling model works well in Scotland, says Professor Innes - at least relative to other countries including England, because school catchments are quite mixed.
The expectations of higher-achieving pupils can be harnessed by teachers, not to hold back those higher achievers, but to bring along other pupils in what Professor Innes calls "a riptide, that helps children in poverty move forward".
But the inequality gap is not just about individuals and deprivation. Last year, at the invitation of the Scottish government, the OECD carried out a survey of Scottish education effectiveness, It was quite complimentary, but it highlighted a problem which has also been puzzling the spending watchdog, Audit Scotland.
Schools with similar catchment areas, in terms of deprivation, can produce widely varying outcomes for their pupils. The same can be said of entire council areas.
That helps give some context to the controversial moves by Education Secretary John Swinney to tackle the council education fiefdoms, with the aim of bringing under-performing schools and councils up the standards of the best.
Professor Ellis said: "If I was in charge, I would put a lot of emphasis on developing teachers' knowledge about literacy, numeracy, health and well-being, interesting, innovative ways to teach science and collaborative group work, with a lot of emphasis on teachers' knowledge of the subject areas they teach.
"I'd make sure there are good systems like homework clubs to help children in poverty, and small items that make a difference, like looking at who gets presented for exams and why. I would look at the head teacher's knowledge and leadership.
"I'd put quite a lot of emphasis on broadening children's lives, making the curriculum less pressured, and put a lot of emphasis on (hearing) the children's voice.
"Middle class kids spend a lot of time whingeing and whining about stuff they don't like and don't want to do. What they're learning is that they can ask for help, that parents are there to help them, and that they can organise their world according to their wishes.
"Kids in poverty don't whinge and whine. They don't ask for stuff. And they don't have that sense of entitlement that adults are there to help them.
"That is a really big and important issue that schools need to address.  If you look at pupil councils, which are an important part of giving children voice, they are dominated by middle class kids.
