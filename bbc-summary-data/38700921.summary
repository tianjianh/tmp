[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 1-2 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford stayed firmly in contention for a League One play-off spot as they edged to victory at struggling Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two set-piece goals were enough to give the Bantams victory, with central defenders Romain Vincelot and Rory McCardle both finding the net either side of Brian Wilson's equaliser.
Oldham were punished for a defensive error after 14 minutes as they needlessly conceded a corner and, when Josh Cullen returned the ball from the right, Vincelot headed in from six yards.
Bradford could have doubled their lead, but home goalkeeper Connor Ripley made smart saves from Tony McMahon and Mark Marshall.
Oldham were level a minute before the break as full-back Wilson cut in from the right and hit an 18-yard shot which bobbled through the dive of goalkeeper Colin Doyle for his first league goal since November 2010.
Bradford had golden chances to score just after the break, only for Cullen and Jordy Hiwula to be thwarted by Ripley.
The visitors went close again when McCardle's far-post header was cleared off the line by Ollie Banks.
Ryan McLaughlin fired wide at the other end, but Bradford struck on 76 minutes as Oldham failed to clear a Billy Clarke free-kick and McCardle bundled in from close range.
Doyle made sure Bradford held on for maximum points with a late save from Latics substitute Billy McKay.
