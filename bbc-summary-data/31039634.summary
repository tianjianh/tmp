Officers were called to the Corkscrew Saloon on the Furnace Creek Ranch in Death Valley National Park shortly after midnight on Tuesday.
Inyo County Sheriff's Office said Terence Michael Butler, 65, was arrested for misdemeanour assault, public intoxication and vandalism.
He was released after "detox and citation", police said.
The Californian police department said an argument escalated into "a physical confrontation", resulting in an individual being struck and a window being broken.
Police gave Birmingham-born Butler's address as Beverly Hills, California.
The bassist later tweeted his thanks to fans after the "unfortunate altercation".
Three original members of Black Sabbath, including Ozzy Osbourne, reformed in 2012 to headline the Download Festival.
At the 2013 Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards they won best UK band and best album for 13, which became their first chart-topping album for 43 years.
