[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old has agreed a two-year deal with the Sky Blues, who will be playing in League Two next season.
"Goalscoring was clearly an area requiring improvement from last season," Coventry boss Mark Robins told the club's official website.
"I'm delighted to have been given the support to improve this area with a player of Marc's undoubted quality."
McNulty has been allowed to leave Bramall Lane after failing to secure a regular place in the Sheffield United team over the last two seasons.
He had two loan spells at Portsmouth in the 2015-16 campaign, scoring 10 times in League Two, and last season scored once in 16 appearances for League One side Bradford
McNulty started his career with Livingston, where he netted 41 goals in 91 league games.
Coventry scored 37 goals in 46 games as they were relegated into the fourth tier for the first time in 58 years last term.
