Ah'Kiell Walker was found soaking wet and gasping for breath by paramedics at a house in Gloucester on 30 July 2016.
He was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where he died the next day.
Hannah Henry, 21, and Alistair Walker, 27, deny manslaughter, causing or allowing the death or a child and cruelty to a person aged under 16.
Bristol Crown Court heard Ah'Kiell had suffered four broken ribs and a fractured shoulder in the weeks before his death.
Jurors were told he had been force-fed up to four bottles of water a day by his parents as a remedy for constipation.
Prosecutor Rosaleen Collins said paramedics attended the family home, in Archdeacon Street, after Ms Henry called 999 reporting Ah'Kiell was bleeding from his nose and mouth.
"He was naked, he was freezing cold, his hair and body were soaking wet and he had water in his ears, mouth, stomach and lungs," she added.
"He [the paramedic] lifted the baby, held him face down and tipped the water out."
The court heard Ah'Kiell's death had been caused by "extensive" brain injuries resulting being shaken "vigorously".
Ms Collins told the jury the trauma "was severe" and "included drowning or immersion in water".
"It included shaking and it may have included some form of suffocation and obstruction of his airways," she added.
"Only these two defendants could have caused these injuries."
In police interviews, the couple claimed Ah'Kiell had suddenly started coughing up blood and said Ms Henry splashed water on his face to revive him.
Ms Henry, of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, and Mr Walker, of Lansdowne Green, London, deny all the charges against them.
The trial is expected to last for three weeks.
