Mohammed Abdurezek, who had links to Swansea and Newcastle, was found with several stab wounds by a dog-walker in Siston, South Gloucestershire.
Searches at a house six miles (10km) away, in Church Drive, Bristol, are expected to take several days.
Police previously said the 31-year-old was killed at a different location to where his body was discovered.
Det Ch Insp James Riccio said: "We're now conducting searches where we believe Mohammed had been living recently.
"We're working with residents living in the premises and nearby to ensure any concerns they may have are addressed.
"While the investigation is progressing, we still need more information from the public."
Witnesses who have seen any kind of assault or suspicious activity between 6 and 11 December in the Church Drive area are urged to contact the force.
