Appearing on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show to promote his new film, the ex-public schoolboy from Canterbury said he was "a pikey from Kent".
The National Gypsy-Traveller-Roma Council said his use of the "racially abusive term is worrying".
Presenter Nick Grimshaw later apologised on air to listeners.
After the interview Hollywood star Bloom said: "I've come from Kent and I grew up with a lot of, like, freewheeling, cool, interesting characters like that.
"I certainly wasn't taking a slant at that at all. I'm very respectful."
