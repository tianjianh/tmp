A shed, including eco-garden equipment, was destroyed in the blaze at St Paul's Primary School on Saturday night.
A nearby sports club in the Bloomfield Park area was also attacked.
Principal of St Paul's, Catriona McFeely, said: "The shed and equipment has been totally destroyed.
"Play resources and garden equipment has been destroyed and an extension was built to it recently.
"It's hard to believe that someone would do this.
"P1 and P2 pupils come up here rain, hail or snow because they love the gardening club.
"The local community also helped us out so it's a real shame that this has happened."
SDLP MLA Colum Eastwood has condemned those behind the attack on the school and the sports club.
"Those behind it have attacked vital community facilities and have left local people to pick up the pieces," said Mr Eastwood.
"I visited St Paul's recently and was hugely impressed by the fantastic community work which the school, its staff and pupils have undertaken.
"That includes the eco-garden project which had given children a real sense of community pride.
"The equipment for that project has now been destroyed and it's local children who have lost out.
"Those responsible for these attacks have only harmed their own communities."
The police and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said they were aware of the incidents.
