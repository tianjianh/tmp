Proposal for 3,000 houses in £1bn Perth development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been submitted for 3,000 new houses in a £1bn development in Perth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Springfield Properties has applied to Perth and Kinross Council for permission to build a new 333-hectare community at Bertha Park.
The development would include two new primary schools and a secondary school, shops, restaurants, medical, leisure and community facilities.
If approved, more than 2,000 jobs would be created over 30 years while construction takes place.
The first phase of the development would begin in 2017, with more than 1,000 new houses - including two, three and four-bedroom detached and semi-detached houses, across private, affordable and retirement accommodation.
Springfield Properties chairman Sandy Adam said inspiration had been taken from surrounding towns and villages to ensure the design retains a traditional look and feel for the area.
He said: "Bertha Park is an exceptional opportunity for Springfield Properties.
"It is one of the biggest ever developments in Perth and is an entirely new concept for us. Rather than extending a community in an existing location, we are creating a new community."
Plans are already in place for a new 1,100 place secondary school which will be completed in time for the 2018 academic year.
A new road, the Cross Tay Link Road, would be integrated through the site, providing access to Bertha Park and the new school.
