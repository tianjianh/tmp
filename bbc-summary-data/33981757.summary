Make or break at Edinburgh's festivals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh's 12 festivals generate hundreds of millions of pounds for the Scottish economy.

Their audiences total around four million - and these are the very people who can make or break the fortunes of performers and businesses.
It's Mary Hillard's third Fringe - but it's the first year she's seen queues snaking down the street from the door of her ice cream shop.
It's mostly thanks to a Buzzfeed article which described Mary's Milk Bar as "definitive proof that Edinburgh is a food paradise".
With the superlatives came the crowds.
Mary said: "It started about a week ago. It's taken us all by surprise a little bit. I'm just making ice cream, round the clock, all the time. I dream ice cream.
"I had extra staff in for the Fringe anyway, we expected it to be busy, and then a queue formed around the block before we opened… It's ridiculous."
For independent businesses like Mary's - especially ones selling seasonal produce like ice cream - the surge in business during the summer festivals can help them through the quieter months.
"This should see us through, hopefully," she said. "Fingers crossed. Survive for another year."
The festivals are the third most paid-for ticketed event in the world, after the Olympics and the Fifa World Cup.
They peak during August, when the city hosts hundreds of thousands of visitors - and around 25,000 performers and entertainers.
However, despite ticket sales, many of the artists struggle to break even.
They can spend around £8,000 of their own money hiring a venue, paying for accommodation and marketing their show - a sacrifice they make in hope of critical acclaim and bookings throughout the year.
Liam Williams is an Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee.
It is also his third Fringe - and it is the second time he has chosen to take his show to the Free Fringe, rather than a traditional paid venue.
For him, the financial result is about the same. He is well-known enough to pay for a venue and sell enough tickets to break even.
On the free Fringe, he can also avoid operating at a loss - he spends money on promotion and production, but gets contributions from the audience at the end of his performance.
The free model works particularly well for stand-up, as "all you need is a microphone, some lights, some chairs, and you've got a show", Liam said.
He believes it is more democratic - and fairer on the performer and the audience - to ask for donations at the end rather than charging upfront for tickets.
For new names in particular, the free aspect makes performing at the Fringe much more accessible.
"[They're] taking a risk merely by being here," he said.
At free venues, they avoid the upfront hire charge and get money in their buckets at the end of the show.
The benefits are not just financial. Liam said the first time he performed at the Free Fringe, his show got a lot more attention.
"I think a factor in that was that audiences thought 'we'll take a risk on this, because we don't have to pay anything'," Liam added.

For artists, the festivals may be a financial risk - but their contribution to the Scottish economy is undeniable.
They generate over £260m and create the equivalent of 5,242 jobs every year. Businesses like Mary's Milk Bar may not survive without them.
However, does this mean Edinburgh has become over-reliant on the events?
John Donnelly, chief executive of Marketing Edinburgh, disagrees.
He said: "We do have other festivals, the winter festival and the world famous Hogmanay.
"I think the way to view it is that Edinburgh is the attack brand for the country, we're the visitor economy.
"The majority of international visitors come to Edinburgh and then move on to other parts… and therefore all of the country benefits."
However, a city which relies on annual events will inevitably see some calmer months.
Mr Donnelly, said: "It's very busy between June and September and it's busy in the Christmas period.
"There are these little shoulder months when it gets quieter, so it's about filling those and giving people a reason to come to the city."
For Mary - who is struggling to keep up with demand, as she makes all her ice-cream by herself - a quiet period has its advantages.
She said: "I just can't believe that people would queue for half an hour to get an ice cream from the Milk Bar.
"I still won't believe it in a month's time when I'm having a sleep."
