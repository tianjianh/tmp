Laird, 29, spent last season with the Prenton Park side, making 34 league appearances as they suffered relegation from League Two.
Tozer, 25, made 165 appearances for the club after joining in 2011 following two earlier loan spells.
Meanwhile, midfielder Kevin Dawson has signed a new two-year deal, having made 21 appearances in 2014-15.
"I cannot wait for the season to start. It has been a horrendous time with injuries for me but hopefully they are all behind me now," said Dawson, who has been at Huish Park since January 2013.
Glovers boss Paul Sturrock, who worked with Tozer at Swindon, told the club website of the former Newcastle man: "I feel Ben's career over the past few seasons has stagnated in a way that he has become a utility player and played in about five different positions.
"I would like to settle him down now into playing in just two positions. He has all attributes to be a great signing for the club and I am looking forward to working with him."
