Halifax parking charges reintroduced after admin blunder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parking charges have been reintroduced in Halifax town centre after it emerged in October that no on-street ticket issued over the previous five years was legally enforceable.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parkers were able to claim a refund after a traffic regulation order issued by Calderdale Council was found to be invalid.
Forms were filled in incorrectly in 2008 following a change in legislation.
The council estimated the blunder could cost it between £200,000 and £500,000.
To date, 3,800 claims have been made - with the council refunding more than £25,000 in the past four months.
On street parking charges were lifted in Halifax town centre on 8 October 2014. Parking charges are back in place from Monday at the previous rates.
