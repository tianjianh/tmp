The statue of Pocahontas is a copy of a sculpture in Jamestown, Virginia, that was donated to the UK in 1958 by the state's then governor.
It was first listed in 1975.
Debbie Mays, head of listing at Historic England, said: "Pocahontas is remembered for her forging of ties between two very different cultures.
"These monuments are physical reminders of her story, those of the English setting sail to the New World, and our shared colonial past and we are pleased to mark their importance on the National Heritage List for England."
