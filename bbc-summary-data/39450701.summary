The double European champion, 27, was riding from her home in Cardiff to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant where she works as a physiotherapist.
She was taken to hospital after the incident in Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, at about 08:00 BST on Wednesday.
"No broken bones or head injury thank God," she tweeted.
"Thank you for all the get well soon messages."
Horne, who is now recovering from her accident at home, suffered bruising and required stitches to a cut lip.
She was part of Team GB at the 2016 Rio Olympics as a member of cycling's Team Pursuit squad.
But she was not picked in the final four-woman team as Laura Trott led Great Britain to Olympic gold in a world record time.
Horne, who competed for Wales in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, works full-time alongside training for the 2018 Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast.
