Ollie Devoto and Thomas Waldrom tries put the Chiefs 14-8 ahead at the break, with Scott Lawson's try and Mike Delany's penalty in reply.
Gareth Steenson then added three Chiefs penalties, while James Short and Will Chudley scored to seal the extra point.
Alex Tait's try and Delany's two more penalties were not enough for Falcons to cling on to their own losing bonus.
Newcastle's 'Big Night Oot' promotion was well received on the terraces despite a chilly north-east evening, although Exeter looked to spoil the party early on when the pacy Devoto outstripped the home cover to cross.
Lawson's bludgeoning effort and a Delany kick nudged the hosts in front before Waldrom rumbled across to re-establish the visitors control.
Steenson and Delany traded penalties as the game remained close, while Tait's try had the Falcons dreaming of leapfrogging their opponents in the table.
However the Chiefs rallied, and Short and Chudley tries settled the contest, and in turn propelled them into the top four.
Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards told BBC Newcastle:
"If you give them a seven-point head-start and concede too many dull penalties you get what you deserve.
"We have to look at ourselves rather than them, if we had discipline and patience at times then it might have been different but we gave them too much.
"We had to take control of the situation and we didn't do that."
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:
"It's a long old trip, to be fair they're a resilient team, particularly at home where no one has had five points against them at home this season and that was pleasing.
"We started to get back to the intensity that we need to have, you can see where we need to improve, defensively we were a bit hit and miss at times but we're fighting, our maul looks strong and we were prepared to work hard.
"That helped us late on in the game when space opened up on the outside and we made some inroads, that comes from the early work and sticking to our guns."
