Ronaldo's 33rd-minute goal was followed by strikes from Manchester City-bound Bernardo Silva, Andre Silva and Nani.
Mexico also progressed to the semi-finals as they knocked hosts Russia out of the tournament with a 2-1 victory.
Portugal ensured top spot in Group A as New Zealand finished bottom after a third straight defeat.
