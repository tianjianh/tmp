Two-year-olds Rhys and Shaun Scott died on Saturday after they fell into a large fish tank in the garden of their home in Dalgety Bay.
Police Scotland posted a message calling for "respect" when commenting.
Sandra Rodgers, aunt of the twins' mother, called for the family to be left to grieve in peace.
She posted on the Police Scotland Facebook page: "Our niece has just tragically lost her two gorgeous boys, and the family are devastated and heartbroken.
"Let the authorities do their investigations and leave the family to grieve for Shaun and Rhys in peace please."
Police Scotland posted: "We want to ensure that the public are kept updated on our enquiries into the tragic death of Rhys and Shaun Scott, and request that all of our followers are respectful of their family and one another when commenting."
A police report into the circumstances surrounding the twins' deaths has been sent to the procurator fiscal.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Our Facebook accounts continue to be a highly successful tool in communicating directly with the communities we serve.
"Although in the vast majority of cases the public contribute to our posts in a responsible and respectful manner there are occasions when a comment is deemed as being offensive.
"In such cases we will take appropriate steps to remove the post and identify those responsible."
