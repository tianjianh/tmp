Louloudis, 23, missed the event in 2012 as he competed for Great Britain at the London Olympics, winning a bronze medal in the men's eight competition.
Cambridge will again have the heavier crew, at 5.25 kilograms per man more.
And for the first time in its 90-year history, the women crews compete on the same day and course as the men.
Racing along the River Thames from Putney to Mortlake, Cambridge will have the heavier team in the women's Boat Race, 0.9 kg per rower more than Oxford.
Oxford are the reigning men's champions after powering to their fifth triumph in seven years in 2014.
