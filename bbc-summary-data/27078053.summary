Signaller Tyler Pearson of York-based 2nd Signal Regiment, entered the River Ouse near The Lowther pub in the early hours of 3 April.
North Yorkshire Police believe he was trying to swim to the far bank at Queen's Staith during a night out with friends.
The 18-year-old is the third young person to have died in the city's rivers this year.
Signaller Pearson's body was found on Thursday near Skeldergate Bridge, about 1,500ft (480m) downstream from where he was last seen.
His death follows that of Ben Clarkson, 22, who was found in the River Foss on 21 March, three weeks after he was last seen outside a York nightclub.
Mr Clarkson disappeared on the same day the body of 20-year-old Megan Roberts was found in the River Ouse.
Miss Roberts, a York St John University student from Wetherby, went missing in January after a night out drinking with friends in the city.
North Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner Julia Mulligan said: "My heart goes out to Tyler's family.
"The recent spate of fatalities highlights the importance of staying safe near York's rivers, particularly when alcohol has been consumed.
"Work is currently under way with groups across York and families of recent river victims to make some short films to highlight the dangers of the river.
"In the longer term we will devise a sustained and powerful campaign to help prevent more lives being needlessly cut short."
