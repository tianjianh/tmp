[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A complaint against a former council leader has been disregarded by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Barrow quit as leader of the Conservative-run Shropshire Council and as a councillor when an allegation was made in November.
He later admitted to failing to comply with the council's code of conduct by not declaring a conflict of interest.
However, West Mercia Police said a "thorough and detailed investigation" found no case to answer.

Det Insp Mark Glazzard said: "Following receipt of a complaint in November 2015, a thorough and detailed investigation was conducted...into an alleged offence under the Localism Act 2011.
"This investigation has concluded, and no further action will be taken into this matter."
Previously, West Mercia Police said it had received a complaint regarding "misconduct in public office involving a man from Shropshire". The BBC understands the complaint relates to Mr Barrow.
The former council leader stood down after failing to declare a relationship with the director of an accountancy firm appointed to work with the authority's private company, IP&E.
He apologised and also resigned as director of IP&E, following the findings of an internal investigation.
Shropshire Council did not wish to comment.
