Maurice McCloughan and his friend, Killian Doherty, were killed when two cars collided on the A5 Doogary Road just after 08:00 GMT on Saturday.
There was a guard of honour from his sports club when the cortege arrived at St Lawrence's Church in Fintona.
Mr McCloughan's family said he was their "golden boy" and "never without an infectious smile".
They also said that Mr Doherty was "another fantastic young man that didn't deserve to go so soon and leave behind another shattered family".
"We have laughed together, cried together, danced together and now, without our centrepiece, our baby, we have to mourn together," said the family's statement.
