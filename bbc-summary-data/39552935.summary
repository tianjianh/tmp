Two-time world triathlon champion Helen Jenkins has ruled herself out of next year's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.

Jenkins, who has competed at three Olympic Games, is expecting her first child in July.
The 33-year-old intends to return to the sport but says competing for Wales in Australia in April 2018 might be too soon.
"The risk is you push too hard to try and get ready for an event," she said.
"I don't want to put too much pressure on myself and I'll definitely support the Welsh athletes that are going."
Jenkins, world champion in 2008 and 2011, pulled out of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow because of a foot injury.
Jenkins say there is no point risking a quick return to the sport.
"I could push myself and get back for April but there are a few risks in doing that," she said.
"April is early to be racing at such a high level so I'll want a few easier races before dropping myself into a major games.
"We've got such a good talent with Non Stanford going and she has such a good chance of a medal and even winning so I'll just be supporting Non for the next one."
Jenkins is already looking ahead to the prospect of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
"2016 was the best year I've had for a long time and I think training went really well with a great team around me and I was really happy and balanced," she said.
"There's a massive desire to get back into it after the pregnancy because I loved last year and the Gold Coast was the best race I've ever had.
"You never know, I'd love to go to another one because I love doing the sport. It's not my main aim at the moment but if I got to 2020 and I was fit then I'd definitely go.
"I don't think I've had my best race at the Olympics yet because I was a bit sick in Beijing and in Rio and was injured in 2012.
"I would love to get there fit but it's not a massive aim at the moment because I just want to come out of pregnancy hopefully with a healthy baby and a healthy body."
