DUP to have new leader in two weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The DUP will have a new leader in just over two weeks time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The replacement for Peter Robinson will be chosen by the party's 46 most senior elected representatives.
Last month, Mr Robinson confirmed that his seven-year term as DUP leader and first minister was coming to an end.
Now the party has said his successor will be chosen on 17 December, at a hotel in Mr Robinson's east Belfast constituency.
The decision is in the hands of the party's MLAs, MPs and single MEP.
Nominations open immediately and will close on 9 December.
However, it will be a surprise if more than one name is put forward, that of the current DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds.
Mr Robinson is expected to remain as first minister until the new year when his replacement will be announced. It is expected to be the current finance minister Arlene Foster.
