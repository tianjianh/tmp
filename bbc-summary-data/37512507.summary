[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There has been an increase of almost 20% in the number of Northern Ireland students beginning university in England since 2013-14.

That is according to statistics released by the UCAS.
In 2016-17, 4,060 students from Northern Ireland were accepted into English universities - a rise from 3,430 in 2014-14.
Overall, 5,380 Northern Ireland students were accepted by universities elsewhere in the UK this year.
That is a rise of 17% since 2013-14.
According to additional figures released by the Department for the Economy (DfE), fewer than a third of those who graduate elsewhere in the UK return to Northern Ireland to work.
In 2014/15, according to DfE figures, only 31.5% of Northern Ireland students returned home to work after graduation.
According to UCAS, there has been a 1% increase across the UK in the number of young people accepted to university this year, compared to 2015-16.
While Queen's University and Ulster University have a cap in the number of students they can admit, the student numbers cap for English universities was lifted in 2015.
As a result, there has been increased competition to attract students in England.
However, tuition fees are higher at English universities at Â£9,000 per year, compared to Â£3,925 in Northern Ireland.
