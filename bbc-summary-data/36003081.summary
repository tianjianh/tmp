Leon Clarke could have given the visitors the lead from close range before the break but Robins keeper Jake Kean pushed the ball over the bar.
The Shakers went ahead when Craig Jones crossed in to the onrushing Mayor, who nodded the ball past Kean.
Jonathan Obika nearly sealed a point for the hosts late on, but his 20-yard curling shot hit the crossbar.
The result means Bury remain in 15th place in the League One table, but are 12 points ahead of Blackpool in 21st, who have just three games left to play.
Swindon stay in 16th place and are six points ahead of Blackpool with four games still to play.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"A well deserved three points, you'd expect for them to rally, with 7,000 fans behind their effort once they had gone a goal down.
"For 70 minutes my team looked like they wanted to win, looked like they wanted to score, but in the first half we just let ourselves down.
"Once we scored they had an energy with our performance and they caused us a few problems but I'm delighted with the win that we were so desperately seeking."
