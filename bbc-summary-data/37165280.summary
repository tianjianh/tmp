Hafal said it would join up with Crossroads Mid and West Wales (CMWW) to form one organisation from April 2017.
The move will involve the transfer of CMWW assets, services and staff to Hafal.
Hafal's chief executive Alun Thomas said it would secure the charity's future in the coming years.
By creating a larger organisation, staff levels were expected to increase along with its budget, he added.
CMWW currently operates in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Powys while Hafal operates across Wales.
Roger Gant, chief executive of CMWW, said: "We will of course look to our members and clients, and to our staff group, to help us develop the unified organisation and to continue to deliver excellent services."
