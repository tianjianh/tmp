Newport were reduced to 10 men in the first half when Sean Rigg was shown a red card for a challenge on Jake Jervis.
Connor Smith should have scored for Plymouth but he was denied by Joe Day.
Plymouth found it hard to break down Newport and Day saved from Jervis late in the game.
Newport County manager Graham Westley said: "It's not an easy place to come to. They've been going well and they've been winning games.
"We knew it was going to be a tough ask tom come here and win the game and win the tie and to go down to 10 men in the first half didn't make it easy.
"We had to box clever, develop our game plan and change the way that we were playing and I though the second half showing was outstanding."
