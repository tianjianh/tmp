[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 3-1 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Hartlepool dealt a blow to Exeter's automatic promotion hopes as they came from behind for victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Alessandra, who scored twice in the midweek win against Crewe, struck either side of Padraig Amond's thunderbolt as Pools - sitting third from bottom entering the clash - answered Ollie Watkins' opener to take a crucial three points.
Exeter looked threatening from the off and went ahead when goalkeeper Joe Fryer failed to keep out Watkins' 20-yard effort.
They continued to edge proceedings, Watkins heading narrowly wide from Craig Woodman's corner early in the second half.
Yet Paul Tisdale's men were hit with a sucker punch in the 66th minute when Alessandra coolly converted after Nathan Thomas' effort was blocked.
It went from bad to worse for the visitors three minutes later as, moments after Watkins was denied a penalty, Amond powered a left-footed strike into the top corner having been found by Rhys Oates.
And Hartlepool saved the best for last, Alessandra cutting in from the right wing and hammering home a brilliant low strike in injury time.
