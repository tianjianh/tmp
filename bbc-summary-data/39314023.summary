The Irishman, 28, was at Madison Square Garden to support compatriot and former Olympian Michael Conlan, who won on his professional debut.
In an animated ringside interview, McGregor said the Mayweather fight was "close" to being finalised.
"I'm going to stop Floyd and you're all going to eat your words," he said.
"No-one in this boxing game knows what's coming. I'm the boxing guy. Watch me take over boxing.
"Trust me on that. I'm 28 years of age, and I'm long, rangy and dangerous with every hand."
Multi-weight UFC world champion McGregor has long talked up a fight against undefeated 40-year-old Mayweather (49-0), who announced last week that he is "out of retirement" to make the fight happen.
UFC president Dana White also suggested confirmation of the match-up would be soon, saying this week he "doesn't see how it doesn't happen".
The fight is widely expected to be held in Las Vegas in June.
