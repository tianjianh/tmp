The spokesperson told the BBC that she was likely to lose more weight in the coming months.
The surgery was performed by a team of doctors led by bariatric surgeon, Dr Muffazal Lakdawala.

Ms Abd El Aty's family says she weighed 5kg (11lb) at birth and was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which body parts swell due to a parasitic infection.
By the time she was 11, her weight had risen sharply and she suffered a stroke which left her bedridden.
She is cared for by her mother and sister.
