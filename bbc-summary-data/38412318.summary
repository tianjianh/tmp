Port Vale 1-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Brown's first game in caretaker charge of Port Vale ended in victory against Chesterfield in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A second half goal from Jerome Thomas put an end to a dismal run of form for the Valiants, who had not won in the league since 12 November.
The first real chance of the Vale Park contest occurred on 37 minutes when Vale striker Rigino Cicilia played a one-two with Thomas before producing a save from goalkeeper Ryan Fulton at his near post.
Chesterfield started the second half on the front foot with a half-hearted penalty appeal from Ched Evans being ignored by referee Michael Salisbury.
Vale made the decisive breakthrough just past the hour mark when captain Ben Purkiss passed to Thomas on the right and his cross-shot looped over Fulton.
The Spireites tried to hit back in the 78th minute when a free-kick was hit long into the Vale penalty area and a header out was met by substitute Rai Simons - but he blazed his shot over.
