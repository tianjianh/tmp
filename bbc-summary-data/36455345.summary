Leah Washington, 18, was joined by Joe Pugh, 19, for the annual Barnsley Hospital Charity Rainbow Dash.
Ms Washington's left leg was amputated following the Smiler crash at the Staffordshire park last June.
Mr Pugh shattered both his kneecaps when the ride crashed into an empty carriage.
Several other people were also seriously injured.
Ms Washington said since the accident she had set herself a number of challenges, and had already been skiing and trampolining.
She said: "We wanted to help the Barnsley Hospital Charity as they are very local to us and I have received care at the hospital in the past."
Mr Pugh added: "It'll show what we can do and it'll make us even more determined to do more."
Beth Kaminski, Barnsley Hospital fundraising co-ordinator, said: "We are absolutely delighted that Leah and Joe are taking part.
"They are an inspiration to us all, it's amazing that they are doing this challenge after everything they have been through.
"We are so grateful for their support to the charity."
In April, Alton Towers admitted safety breaches on the Smiler rollercoaster ride and was told it faced a large fine.
