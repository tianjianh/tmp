The project is backed by the Guardians of Scotland Trust, which seeks to promote recognition of William Wallace and his co-commander Andrew de Moray.
De Moray died later in the year of the battle of injuries he had sustained.
The 1297 Battle of Stirling Bridge is one of the most significant in Scottish history but has had no prominent marker on the site until now.
Setting up a monumental artwork to honour Wallace and de Moray was a central purpose of the Guardians of Scotland Trust.
It was established in 2011 and is backed by the Andrew de Moray Project and the Society of William Wallace.
The artists shortlisted for the project are David Annand, Doug Cocker, Alan Herriot, Kenny Hunter, Malcolm Robertson and Kate Robinson.
Their designs have gone on show at the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum.
Opening the exhibition, local SNP MSP Bruce Crawford said: "I do not think I can overstate the potential significance of this project to the both historic heritage and potential tourism offer that it can bring. I am hugely excited by it.
"The trust has acted as a catalyst to bring together stakeholders and building partnerships with Historic Environment Scotland, Stirling Council, Glasgow School of Art and the Stirling Smith Gallery.
"They are helping to continue telling Stirling's story."
The Battle of Stirling Bridge was part of the first war of Scottish independence.
Wallace and de Moray had been fighting a guerrilla war against English forces. Wallace largely in the south and de Moray mainly in the north of Scotland.
They came together on the north bank of the River Forth on 11 September 1297, to protect a crossing point on the river.
Lined up against them was an English force led by the Earl of Surrey and Hugh de Cressingham.
The Scots allowed part of the English force to cross the river by the bridge, then attacked while their opponents were divided by the river.
The battle was considered a decisive victory for the Scottish forces. Wallace and de Moray were appointed Guardians of Scotland in the absence of a legitimate king.
