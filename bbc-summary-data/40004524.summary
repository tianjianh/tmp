[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old Colombian has spent the last two seasons at Juve, winning the Serie A title on both occasions.
His move on transfer deadline day last August was originally described as a three-year loan but has now been made permanent.
Chelsea paid £23.3m to sign Cuadrado from Fiorentina in 2015 but he made just four Premier League starts.
Juve said: "The fee of 20m euros will be paid in three annual instalments."
