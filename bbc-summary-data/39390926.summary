Jon Parkin fired home a superb free-kick from 25 yards to give the hosts a great start as they looked to move within three points of their opponents in the table.
Parkin headed against the bar as York looked to press home their first-half superiority, before Asa Hall doubled their lead in stoppage-time by nodding in Amari Morgan-Smith's cross.
