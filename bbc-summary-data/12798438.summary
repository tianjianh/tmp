She has been named as 64-year-old Janet Gilson, a Salvation Army worker from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.
A 29-year-old man was arrested at the city's main ferry harbour and is being questioned by detectives.
Ms Gilson - found at her niece's property on Lamma Island - reportedly suffered head injuries but police could not confirm if she had died from them.
She had arrived in Hong Kong on 6 March and was last seen on Tuesday in the village of Tai Yuen Village.
Her body was found in the flat, three days after she was reported missing by her niece.
The South China Morning Post reported that a witness to the arrest said she saw a handcuffed man with his head covered by a hood escorted by police off the ferry.
She said there had been a strong police presence around the island during the day and that the ferry piers on Lamma Island had also been under heavy guard.
The man, described by the paper as an expatriate, was held overnight for questioning.
A post-mortem examination will be conducted to establish the cause of Ms Gilson's death but police have confirmed that they are treating it as a "suspected murder case".
It emerged that she had retired only recently.
In a statement Major Carol Bailey, who is a regional manager for the Salvation Army, spoke of their sadness and shock at the news.
"She was a deeply spiritual woman and was highly respected and loved by all those with whom she came into contact."
"She was an inspirational person and she will be sadly missed."
A Foreign Office spokesman said it was ready to provide consular assistance to the family if required.
