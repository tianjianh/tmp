The programme will come back to BBC One later this year with all the original cast returning to their roles.
Still Game follows the antics of pensioners Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade and ran for six series between 2002 and 2007.
The show is written by Greg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan, who play the two central characters.
Filming on the new series is taking place on a purpose-built set at BBC Scotland's Dumbarton Studios with the first scenes starring Kiernan as Jack, Hemphill as Victor and Jane McCarry as Isa.
Kiernan said: "The BBC Dumbarton Studios are incredible and we're super chuffed to be back in the costumes and wigs again."
Hemphill added: "We were nervous at the beginning but after 10 minutes we felt as though we'd never been away."
The series will also film on location around Glasgow during the six-week shoot.
The new series will also see the return of Sanjeev Kohli as Navid, Gavin Mitchell as Bobby, Paul Riley as Winston and Mark Cox as Tam.
Reruns of the show have proved popular with audiences and it has also attracted new fans on TV streaming service Netflix.
Steven Canny, executive producer for comedy at BBC Studios, said: "We're delighted to welcome Still Game back.
"Quality scripts, a terrific cast and a wonderful creative team are all working together to create something really special. It's very exciting."
