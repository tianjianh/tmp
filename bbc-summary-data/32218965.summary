Election 2015: Non-dom #ballsup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Social media swiftly responded to what Twitter users termed #ballsup, with the hashtag being used more 1,500 times between 10:00 BST - after Labour trailed a pledge to scrap the non-domiciled tax status - and the formal announcement at midday.

Twitter was awash with comments on the discrepancy between this and an interview Ed Balls gave to BBC Leeds in January, during which he said: "If you abolish the whole status it will end up costing Britain money..."
The Tories were swift to respond with a poster that quickly went viral.
And the video of the original interview, posted on BBC Radio Leeds's Facebook page at the time, began doing the rounds again, with much comment.
After much debate about the whole affair across social media, Ed Balls himself then weighed in on Twitter offering this explanation for the apparent inconsistency...
He later issued a statement on his blog in which he accused the Tories of attempting to "deliberately mislead people".
