At least seven people died and three were wounded when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Kurram in north-west Pakistan on Tuesday, officials say.

Police took the wounded to hospital. The blast took place close to Parachinar near the Afghan border.
Kurram is a tribal area with a history of sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims, but it is so far unclear who is behind this latest attack.
Several Taliban-affiliated groups are known to be active in the region.
