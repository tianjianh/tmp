English rugby a laughing stock - Sir Clive Woodward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England coach Sir Clive Woodward says English rugby union is a "laughing stock" after Sam Burgess returned to rugby league.

Burgess was part of the England squad which went out of their home World Cup in the group stages.
He will now leave Bath and rejoin South Sydney Rabbitohs in Australia.
Woodward, who led England to 2003 World Cup success, said he did not blame Burgess "for this mess" but the English game was at one of its "all-time lows".
Burgess, from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, played 21 games for Bath after joining them just over a year ago, scoring four tries.
Having made his England debut in August, he was selected for the World Cup ahead of Northampton centre Luther Burrell, who had looked to have established himself in the team after playing in all five of their Six Nations matches earlier in the year.
Burgess, who had been playing at blind-side flanker for his club, was picked at centre for the hosts against Wales in the World Cup and his selection sparked much debate.
"The RFU has spent the last four years congratulating itself on the direction in which we're heading, but the truth is we have marched confidently into a total mess," said Woodward in his column for the Daily Mail.
"We are the laughing stock of not only world rugby but also sport and business. The rest of the world says those involved in English rugby are arrogant. I hate this reputation, but that is exactly what the RFU has been.
"The saddest part is the players and fans have been let down. To get it right on the field of play you have to get it right off the field."
Burgess says family reasons were behind his decision to return to rugby league after one season in rugby union.
"We hoped that Sam would stay at Bath," said Bath head coach Mike Ford. "He was doing really well in making the switch over from league and, given time, he could've been a great rugby union player.
"Unfortunately, for personal reasons, he is returning to Australia."
