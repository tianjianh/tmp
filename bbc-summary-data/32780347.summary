[SN]TITLE[SN]
Toy soldiers at war

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At first glance, these images look like model soldiers in a manufactured landscape, lined up and ready for battle. Yet, look again, these are the real thing. Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe's pictures from Western Sahara explore a conflict that has been forgotten, yet has lasted for 40 years, with no sign of a resolution.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although under the de facto administrative control of Morocco, the status and sovereignty of Western Sahara remains unresolved, with the Polisario Front fighting for independence. Here Brann Thorpe talks about the work, produced in collaboration with a military commander.
Toy Soldiers by Simon Brann Thorpe is published by Dewi Lewis.
Produced and recorded by Phil Coomes.
