The "Neolithic" round barrow, which is 11.3m (37ft) in diameter and 5.5m (18ft) tall, is being built on farmland at Hail Western near St Neots.
It was inspired by a 2014 long barrow in Wiltshire, which was claimed to be the first built in 5,500 years.
Sacred Stones managing director Toby Angel said he hoped it would offer an alternative to "ugly" crematoriums.
