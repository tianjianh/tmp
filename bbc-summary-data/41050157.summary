The 19-year-old full-back, who made his one first-team appearance for Millwall in last season's EFL Trophy, is captain of the Lions' under-23s.
Brown could make his debut for the Cumbrians at Lincoln City in League Two on Saturday.
"James is someone we've known about for a while," Carlisle United boss Keith Curle told the club website.
"He is very highly thought of and he's at a point where he needs to develop a profile within the game."
