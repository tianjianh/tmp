The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service was called to Holy Child Primary School at 21:20 GMT.
A spokesperson said that when crews arrived, the roof of the building in Central Drive, Creggan, was alight.
School principal Orla McDonnell said: "We very nearly didn't have a school by the end of last night, but thankfully the fire service were here quickly."
"It was an horrific experience last night getting that phone call, driving up to the school, and wondering what you were going to be met with," said Ms O'Donnell.
"There had actually been a governors meeting on in the school last night.
"We were having a very lengthy conversation about how we would celebrate the school's 60th anniversary."
Miss O'Donnell said the overwhelming feeling on Tuesday morning was one of relief.
"It would be fair to say that there is an ongoing problem with youths coming onto school grounds," she said.
"I would just urge every parent to sit their children down and have a talk about their personal safety, there could have been loss of life last night."
In a statement online, Holy Child said damage was limited and it plans to open to pupils on Tuesday morning.
Four appliances from Crescent Link and Northland Fire Station attended the scene.
Fire Service district commander Kevin Lynch said fire crews were called to the scene shortly after 21:00 BST.
"When we arrived, building materials on the roof had been set alight," he said.
"The quick action of the fire service meant we were able to extinguish the fire before it got a chance to get into the structure of the building. "
The fire was brought under control shortly before midnight.
