South Yorkshire Police said Jasmyn Chan and a 12-year-old were hit by a car travelling on Normanton Hill towards the A57 on Friday evening.
Jasmyn died at the scene while the younger girl was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The force said it was "urgently" trying to trace the driver of the car, thought to be a small Volkswagen or Honda.
Ch Insp Stuart Walne said the car was likely to have been damaged in the crash, which happened near to Richmond Park in the Intake area of Sheffield at 21:20 BST.
He said: "Jasmyn was a very active girl, very friendly, a very giving person, and unfortunately her life's been taken away in this collision.
"This is a tragic situation that has taken a young life and seriously affected another.
"If you were the driver of this car, please contact police immediately.
"There may have been reasons that you didn't stop last night, but now a girl has died and we need to speak to you."
Ch Insp Walne said the 12-year-old girl's injuries were not life-threatening and she was being treated in hospital.
Flowers have been left at the scene of the crash, with one card reading: "Dear Jazz R.I.P. Love you, you were a great friend, you'll be missed".
