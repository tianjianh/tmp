A number of areas in East Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire have been worst affected by the flooding.
A yellow weather warning is in place for London and south-east England, where downpours have caused localised flooding and some disruption to travel.
The worst of the weather is expected to clear towards the south east, with drier conditions forecast for Thursday.
The Met Office said heavy rain would "sink slowly southwards across the east and south east of England" during Wednesday, slowly dying out by Thursday morning.
Some travel routes in the south east of England have been affected, with flooding in Kidbrooke and Greenwich, both in south-east London, disrupting trains between London and Dartford.
Essex County Fire and Rescue Service reported a number of calls from residents about flooding in the area.
The worst-affected parts of England overnight were Immingham, in Lincolnshire, and Grimsby, with some homes flooded and many roads waterlogged.
In some places there were reports of standing water up to 3ft (1m) deep.
In Immingham, Lisa said her 68-year-old mother had phoned her at 04:00 BST to say water was coming in.
"When I got here it had flooded the whole bottom of the house right through to the back garden," she said.
"We can't get rid of the water in the house until the water outside has cleared.
"Its just devastating."
Allen Cunningham, from Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, said the flooding had been very localised.
"That doesn't negate on the impact it has on those people who have been affected by flooding.
"We have had pumps working throughout the night."
He said he expected water levels to drop quickly throughout the day as the weather improves.
The MP for Great Grimsby, Melanie Onn, posted on Twitter some roads in her constituency were "like a river" and that the water was "over my ankles".
