Carrickfergus man Seaton, 26, and McGovern, 28, from Bangor, were 14th at London 2012 and were fourth at the halfway stage in Rio.
"We have now decided to go our separate ways towards new adventures and life challenges," said the duo.
"It has been a complete honour to sail together."
The Northern Irish sailors began competing together in 2009 and they described their partnership as "an amazing journey".
"We spent our time travelling over the world, training with the best teams and not only having fun but working hard all the way.
"Our team-mates and other competitors became our rivals and some of our best mates for life.
"What a great pleasure it has been to sail with each other but we could not have achieved our dreams if it wasn't for all the family, friends, coaches, sponsors and supporters.
"It has been the most amazing life experience."
The duo's successes included victory at this year's Princess Sofia Regatta in the Bay of Palma.
