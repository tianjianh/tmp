New York City FC head coach Patrick Vieira believes the Welsh Football Association are leading the way when it comes to training prospective managers.

Vieira, his compatriots Thierry Henry and David Ginola plus Everton boss Roberto Martinez have all opted to earn their coaching qualifications in Wales.
"I chose the Welsh FA because I like the vision of what they see in coaches, because being a coach is not like reading a book," Vieira told BBC Sport.
"They are more holding our hand."
Vieira, who won 107-caps for France and three Premier League titles with Arsenal, feels the Welsh set-up at Dragon Park in Newport provided an ideal learning environment.
"I love the way that, at the Welsh FA, their mind is really open and what Thierry Henry will do as a coach is really different to what I will do and different again to what Roberto Martinez will do," he said.
"They are not trying to mould you.
"So there is a different way of being a coach. So they are helping me, Thierry and Roberto to find our way.
"They are more working together than just telling you 'no, you have to go on the right, you have to go on the left'.
"I believe this is why I felt really comfortable working with Osian Roberts and the Welsh FA."
