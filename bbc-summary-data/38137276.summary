The 2012 Olympic lightweight champion stopped Poland's Karina Kopinska in three rounds on her professional debut in London on Saturday.
Taylor's second pro bout will be on the undercard of Briton Anthony Joshua's IBF heavyweight title defence against American Eric Molina in Manchester.
"I can't wait to fight in Manchester on 10 December," said the Irishwoman, 30.
Swiss-based Obenauf, 30, beat Kopinska in her last contest in October and will be expected to provide Taylor with a stiffer challenge.
The Brazilian's only defeat in her 10 professional contests came against recently crowned world featherweight champion Vissia Trovato last November.
Ireland's Taylor, a five-time world and 2012 Olympic champion, was simply in a different class to her Polish opponent in Saturday's contest.
