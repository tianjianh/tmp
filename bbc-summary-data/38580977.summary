Phil Steele, general manager of Eldon Square, said: "High winds overnight resulted in some structural damage.
"Thankfully, no-one was hurt, but as a precautionary measure Northumbria Police have temporarily closed Newgate Street until debris can be removed from our roof and the building can be made safe.
"Our structural engineers will be carrying out a full assessment as soon as the wind drops and it's safe to do so.
"Eldon Square is open as usual today, and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused."
Rod Gardner, Northern Powergrid's head of network operations, said: "The strong winds are continuing to affect parts of our region, but we'd like to reassure our customers that our engineers are working hard, in these challenging weather conditions, to get their power back on for our customers as soon as possible."
Police are also warning drivers to beware of toppled trees, which have blocked some minor roads in County Durham and Tyneside.
A spokesman for Northern Powergrid said it hoped to have power restored to all those affected by the afternoon.
The bulk of those hit by power cuts were in the North East, while about 900 homes were without power in the Wigton area of Cumbria.
Tyne and Wear Fire Service said it dealt with a number of weather-related incidents overnight, including a dangerous chimney in the Bensham area of Gateshead.
High winds whipped up waves which smothered a passenger train on the Cumbrian coast near Whitehaven. Northern Rail said services were delayed in parts but still operating.
In Pelton, County Durham, fire crews have been trying to make safe a house where a gable end has collapsed. Police also urged drivers to avoid the Barlow Lane area of Winlaton after a shed was blown on to the road.
Virgin East Coast said speed restrictions were in place between Newcastle and Darlington.
Many bridges have also been closed to high-sided vehicles.
So far there have been no reported injuries.
