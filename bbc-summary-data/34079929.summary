Parts of Blackpool, Chorley and Preston got the all clear from 18:00 BST, United Utilities said.
The microbial parasite cryptosporidium was found on 6 August.
Water was treated with ultraviolet light to kill the bug.
United Utilities said it had assessed hundreds of test results after discussions with Public Health England.
Gary Dixon, customer services director for United Utilities, said: "We hope to get the warning lifted for the rest of our customers by the end of the coming week."
If people have been using their water regularly there was no need to flush their system, he added.
A statement on the company website said: "We are now able to lift the boil water advice in a number of postcode areas.
"For those still subject to the boil water advice, please continue to boil your water until advised otherwise.
"We will be keeping you informed and this page will be updated on a regular basis."
It advised people to check for their postcode on the website or ring the company helpline on 0800 9127241.
