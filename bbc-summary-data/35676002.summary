Jack Parkinson's strike against former club Woking was enough to earn Dover victory at the Kingfield Stadium.

The 26-year-old's glancing effort, having met Ricky Modeste's free-kick from the left, put the visitors in front 10 minutes before half-time.
Cardinals midfielder Kieran Murtagh shot just wide of the post as the hosts could not find an equaliser.
Dover are now five points off the play-off places but have three games in hand over fifth-placed Tranmere.
Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"I don't think we've done bad at all today. I don't hide the fact that they were by far the better side in the first half. Jake Cole made some good saves. Second half I think we improved, but not quite not enough quality.
"The team's low on confidence after seven games without a win. You've got some young players, and you can either get carried away and expect too much out of them, or you understand that sometimes you get those spells when you've got young players.
"The performances have been poor, very poor with no excuses but today there was 90 minutes of effort".
