The pair are up against Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan for Le Week-end, about a married couple's trip to Paris.
The most nominated film is prison drama Starred Up, with eight nominations - including best film.
The winners will be announced at an awards ceremony, hosted by actor James Nesbitt, in London on 8 December.
The contenders for best film are:
Le Week-end, written by Hanif Kureishi and directed by Roger Michell, sees Broadbent and Duncan as a couple in a tired marriage who revisit their honeymoon destination of Paris on their 30th anniversary.
The Selfish Giant, Clio Barnard's story of two young boys growing up in an underprivileged town in Yorkshire, picked up seven nominations.
Filth, Metro Manila and Le Week-end all picked up five nominations each.
In Philomena, Dame Judi plays an Irish woman who tries to find a son she was forced to give up for adoption. The true story is based on the book by former BBC foreign correspondent Martin Sixsmith, played by Coogan.
Coogan and co-writer Jeff Pope also get a best screenplay nomination.
Starred Up tells the story of young offender Eric, played by Skins and This is England star Jack O'Connell, who is thrown into an adult prison for being too violent.
The screenplay is by first-time scriptwriter Jonathan Asser, who has a background in the prison system working as a therapist. The title comes from the process of prematurely upgrading a teenager from a young offenders institution to prison.
