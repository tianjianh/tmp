UK Open champion Wright holds a one-point lead over world number one Michael van Gerwen.
Home favourite Van Gerwen came from 3-0 down to beat Phil Taylor and maintain his unbeaten start.
Meanwhile, fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld fired in five maximums in a 7-2 thumping of Scotland's Gary Anderson.
The evening's other matches in front of a 10,000 capacity crowd in Holland saw bottom two Jelle Klaasen and Kim Huybrechts beaten by James Wade and Adrian Lewis respectively.
Reigning Premier League champion Van Gerwen will play twice next week in Manchester because of the round he missed due to a back injury earlier this month.
