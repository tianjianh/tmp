Glan Clwyd Hospital: Patient deaths review at 'zoo' unit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review has been carried out into death rates at a Denbighshire mental health unit, where it is claimed patients were treated like "animals".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a damning report into practices at the Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan.
In the independent report, one family said it was like going into a zoo and seeing "captured animals".
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has looked for a link between alleged mistreatment and premature deaths.
It said the findings will be made public once health officials have met with the families of patients affected.
The health board has apologised for the "inexcusable and unacceptable" treatment outlined in the report.
The ward was closed after concerns were raised in December 2013.
Eight members of nursing staff have been suspended on full pay and a "significant" number have also been transferred to other roles. Others, including managers, have been "stood down".
Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, North Wales Police has decided not to bring any charges in the case.
The report's author, health specialist Donna Ockenden, found the concerns raised proven and said they amounted to "institutional abuse".
She told BBC Radio Wales: "Clearly there was a culture that had been allowed to fester over a long period of time. The staff thought they were invincible - they were never challenged.
"I think there was a lack of control, there was a lack of oversight by the very senior members of the team and the health board acknowledged that.
"Relatives regularly and over a long period of time raised their concerns verbally, via email, in writing, formal letters and everything went ignored for a very long period of time."
The independent report was commissioned by the health board, who decided not to publish it until police completed their investigation.
In the report, families described seeing patients "constantly crawling on dirty floors" and being "like a zombie...drugged up".
A family told the report's author they found a relative in bed "in a pool of stale urine and it's so stale it was brown".
When they raised this issue, they were told: "Psychiatric nurses aren't very good at looking after physically ill people."
The health board's chief executive, Prof Trevor Purt, called the ward "the worst case" he has seen in his role while Angela Hopkins, director of nursing and midwifery, said it was "shameful".
Shadow health minister Darren Millar AM said: "Anyone who's responsible for such poor levels of care shouldn't ever be allowed to look after patients again, and the senior leaders, the managers in this organisation that allowed this to happen... should face the sack."
