[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Birmingham-based West Midlands Police constables Wahid Husman, 48, and Tahsib Majid, 36, used their roles to conspire to steal quantities of Class A and B drugs, the force said.
Husman admitted drugs and misconduct offences on 7 August.
Majid was convicted on Tuesday after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.
Five other men also admitted a number of offences on 7 August following the police investigation, the West Midlands force added.
Husman accessed police computer systems to feed information to a number of criminal associates, while Majid committed a Data Protection offence on behalf of an associate, the force said.
A surveillance operation, led by the force's counter corruption unit, captured the officers talking about drug dealing on duty and conspiring with criminal associates to steal a consignment of illegal drugs destined for Birmingham.
The group planned to split the drugs between them to supply for their own gain.

Police said an investigation revealed Husman had begun accessing police computer systems as far back as 2011, when he started to feed intelligence and information to some of his co-accused.
After his arrest, officers searched Husman's address and found Â£7,000 cash and heroin.
The officers, based at Perry Barr, were suspended following their arrest in February 2017 and now face dismissal from West Midlands Police.
All the defendants are due to be sentenced in October.
