The results showed 58% of adults were still classified as overweight or obese, and 22% were obese.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford warned lifestyle choices were too often damaging people's health and placing a huge burden on the NHS.
The survey showed a continued decline in the proportion of people in Wales who smoke to 20%.
Helen Birtwhistle, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said the figures showed a "significant number of us are either overweight or obese and are not taking part in enough physical activity".
Other findings in the 2014 survey of 14,000 adults and 3,000 children, include:
Mr Drakeford said the Welsh government had a responsibility to create the right conditions in which people could live full and healthy lives, but everyone also had a duty to look after ourselves.
"The NHS is there to help us in our time of need but with that comes a responsibility to use its resources wisely," he said.
Dr Ruth Hussey, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, said: "While I take encouragement in the gradual improvement seen in our nation's health, the reality is that too many of us are still drinking too much, eating too much and not being active enough."
