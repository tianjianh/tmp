Coinciding with the Year of Food and Drink, a Scottish government-led celebration, dairy products will be the focus of events in August.
The trail is designed to allow visitors and locals to travel around Scotland's best ice cream sellers.
Leaflets have been produced to highlight more than 100 businesses. The trail has been launched at The Milk Barn in Falkirk.
The government estimates that Scotland generates over Â£2.5m every day through food and drink tourism.
Scotland's Food Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "I'm delighted to hear that Scotland's Ice Cream Trail has been launched - our dairy produce is among the best in the world and it extends to so much more than milk.
"It's great that this has been launched during the Year of Food and Drink and couldn't have been timed better for the start of Delicious Dairy Month in August."
Suzannah Reid, from The Milk Barn, added: "We're delighted to be part of Scotland's Ice Cream Trail and look forward to welcoming lots of new visitors as a result.
"Our ice cream is made using milk from our very own herd of cows, which are milked just yards away every morning, to make a wonderful and diverse range of flavours which delight our many customers."
