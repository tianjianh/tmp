Recruitment is under way and 43 of the roles are already in place.
Enterprise, Trade and Investment minister Jonathan Bell has welcomed the development.
He said the jobs would generate Â£1.4m annually in additional salaries and "offer employment opportunities across a range of roles".
This will include customer service and manufacturing.
"Over the last 35 years, Decora has grown into a dynamic, innovative business and this expansion, supported by Invest NI, underlines its drive and ambition to succeed in markets outside Northern Ireland," Mr Bell added.
"Decora is ranked as one of the largest window blind producers in the UK and its clients include some of the largest independent blind companies in the country."
The family-owned blind manufacturing firm is benefiting from an Invest NI employment grant of Â£240,000 towards the jobs.
Stuart Dickson, managing director of Decora Blind Systems, said its business growth over the past five years had been consistent.
"Our continued goal is to ensure employee, customer and supplier relationships are harnessed to their full potential," he said.
