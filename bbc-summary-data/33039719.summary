[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two unexploded World War II mines discovered near the port of Calais have led to the cancellation of a number of cross-Channel ferries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bombs, which are more than 70 years old, are of British origin and were found on the beach near the port.
One, thought to be booby-trapped, cannot be moved. The operation to defuse the bombs will be carried out by divers from the French Navy.
Roads into Calais have been closed and drivers are being diverted to Dunkirk.
MyFerryLink said the Port of Calais was closed until 13:30 BST and one of its ferry crossings each way between Dover and Calais was cancelled. Another was subject to possible delay or cancellation.
P&O Ferries advised day-trippers not to travel and said passengers booked on affected services would be able to rebook free of charge.
It said its services from Dover to Calais were still operating, with alighting traffic being diverted away from closed areas of the town.
Calais to Dover services have been suspended until the port closure is over.
