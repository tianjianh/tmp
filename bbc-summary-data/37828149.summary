[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jockey Freddy Tylicki is in intensive care after a fall at Kempton but champion jockey Jim Crowley, who was also injured during the same incident, has been discharged from hospital.

The pair were hurt in the 15:20 GMT race on Monday and taken to the major trauma unit at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London.
The meeting was later abandoned.
German-born Tylicki, 30, was flown by air ambulance to St George's with suspected spinal injuries.
The Injured Jockeys' Fund issued an update at 22:30 GMT to say Crowley, who was crowned British flat racing's champion jockey for the first time on 15 October, had been discharged "to return home with his family".
It added: "Freddy Tylicki is in intensive care in a stable condition. He is conscious and there will be a further update tomorrow once more is known."
Jockeys Steve Drowne and Ted Durcan were also unseated in the incident. They were thrown from their mounts on the turn into the home straight but walked back to the weighing room and were checked out by medical staff.
The horses involved were not reported to be seriously injured.
The incident happened in the third race, the maiden fillies' stakes, as the field rounded the home turn and Tylicki suffered a heavy fall on Nellie Dean after appearing to clip heels with leader and eventual winner Madame Butterfly.
Crowley and Electrify were racing immediately behind and were brought down, as was Drowne's mount Skara Mae. Durcan was also caught up in the melee and was unseated from Sovrano Dolce.
Following a delay of more than an hour, the decision was taken to abandon the rest of the meeting after consultation with jockeys at the track.

Falls like this in Flat races are rare but tend to be more serious. There are no obstacles to be cleared, so one reason is the sheer surprise of something unexpected happening, probably quite suddenly.
Then there is the fact the runners are often bunched together. So when the jockeys go down, there are a lot of flaying hooves with which to contend.
And, of course, there's the speed at which the incident happens. At halfway in a mile-long flat race, the horses must be going at about 30mph.
