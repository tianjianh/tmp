Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is Radio 1Xtra DJ Charlie Sloth.
Sloth is a Liverpool fan, and told BBC Sport: "I am a massive Red, and there is only one Red that matters.

"When I was growing up, my sporting hero was Stevie G - Steven Gerrard. I still idolise him to this day.
"I have met him a few times and I always get a little bit funny. I get to meet some of the biggest rappers in the world, some of the biggest superstars but, when I see Stevie, he has that effect on me."
You can make your own predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the last round of fixtures before the international break, Lawro got three correct results, with no perfect scores, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 30 points.
He suffered his first defeat of the season at the hands of actor Dave Bautista, who got four correct results, with one perfect score, for a total of 70 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sloth's prediction: If the Liverpool team who beat Leicester turn up at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea are in trouble. They don't have much pace at the back and look a bit shaky - if they let us counter-attack them, they are in trouble. 1-3

Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Sloth's prediction: This is going to be a good game. On paper I'd go for Arsenal to win 2-1 but something is telling me there is going to be a turn up for the books here so what I'm going to do is go for a 2-2.
