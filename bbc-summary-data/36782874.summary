The unprecedented raids were carried out in 14 of Germany's 16 states.
One key target was a secret Facebook group in southern state of Bavaria whose members glorified Nazism.
"Violent language is unacceptable and lays the groundwork for real violence," said Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere.
The government warned that anyone who posted hate speech on the internet faced severe penalties.
Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the internet should not be seen as a legal vacuum and praised the operation, which he said "should serve as a warning to anyone before he hits the keyboard on Facebook".
