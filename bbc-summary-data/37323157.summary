The last missing body has been discovered in the rubble of Didcot Power Station, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boiler house at the Didcot A plant partly collapsed in February, killing four men.
The body is believed to be that of John Shaw, 61, from Rotherham. His family have been informed, Thames Valley Police said.
The removal of debris from the site has been halted as the recovery takes place.
Specialists from the police, Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service's urban search and rescue and the South Central Ambulance Service hazardous area response team are taking over the operation.
A police spokesman said: "The safe recovery of the body will take place and the disaster victim identification process will commence.
"The person has not yet been formally identified and this will be a matter for the coroner, although it is believed to be John Shaw.
"He is the last of the four men to be located following the collapse of the boiler house at the power station in February this year.
"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of all four men and we would ask that their privacy is respected during this incredibly difficult time."
It follows the discovery of the bodies of Ken Cresswell, 57, on Wednesday, and Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, last week.
The three men have been missing ever since the partial collapse of the structure in February when it was due for demolition.
A fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, died from multiple injuries. His death was confirmed shortly after a major incident was declared at the site.
The remaining section was brought down using explosives in July.
