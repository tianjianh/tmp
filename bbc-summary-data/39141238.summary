[SN]TITLE[SN]
Holyhead's Newry Beach 'village green' bid rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attempt to register land at a beach in Holyhead as a village green has been refused by Anglesey council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campaigners hoped to stop plans for a marina at Newry Beach by securing the status.
A public inquiry last year recommended the application should be refused and Anglesey council's planning committee rubber stamped those findings.
A report said the land's use for recreational activity was not enough to grant village green status.
To succeed, the applicant needed to prove residents had the right to use the land - but the lease's conditions stated that right could be withdrawn.
Developers said the plans would see "enhancement of Newry Beach", including improved public access and facilities.
The marina is part of a Â£100m Anglesey waterfront development which was granted planning permission in 2012.
