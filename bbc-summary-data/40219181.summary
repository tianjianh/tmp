Murtagh has joined Wood after making 113 appearances for Woking, having joined the Surrey side on a permanent deal from Mansfield in 2014.
He has also previously played for Cambridge, Wycombe and Macclesfield.
Wells, 32, made 97 appearances for Stevenage after joining from Braintree, before being released this summer.
"It all fitted in nicely and I will be doing a bit of coaching in the academy as well which helped," said Wells, who also has the option to extend his contract by a further year.
"I will also be able to start the college course that I wanted to with the days off that I will get, so I will be doing something that I love, while still playing football."
