Lib Dem Kirsty Williams opposes 'vested interests'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh voters should reject a Labour government that only listens to "vested interests", Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams says.

She told activists in Swansea the party was gaining strength after the "struggle" of coalition with the Conservatives at Westminster.
Ms Williams claimed the five-strong Lib Dem group in the assembly has punched above its weight.
The conference began with a minute's silence following the attacks in Paris.
She told delegates that people were "open to giving us another look" before May's election.
"I want everyone to know that it's our party that puts people first," Ms Williams said.
"That we're on the side of pupils, parents and patients.
"We've had years of the same Labour government listening to vested interests, but ignoring the people they're meant to stand up for. It's time for change."
Having been in coalition with the Conservatives since 2010, the Lib Dems suffered heavy losses in the general election in May, leaving them with just eight MPs, only one of them in Wales.
"Campaigning during the coalition was tough, but now people are again willing to listen, people are open to giving us another look," Ms Williams said.
"We are growing. We are united. And the Welsh Liberal Democrats are needed now more than ever."
Polls suggest the party could struggle in next May's assembly elections, but Ms Williams argued polls had been proved wrong in the past, "and they will be wrong again."
