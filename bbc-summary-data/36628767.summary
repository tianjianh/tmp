Earlier Prime Minister David Cameron attended the main celebration at Cleethorpes in North East Lincolnshire.
It featured an aerobatic display by the Red Arrows, a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and parachute display by the Royal Navy, Army and RAF.
On Monday, a flag-raising ceremony was held at City Hall, in London, to mark this year's events.

Alex Baxter, armed forces champion for North East Lincolnshire, said: "Hosting Armed Forces Day will give our residents and others in the region an unparalleled opportunity to show their support and appreciation for serving and former armed forces personnel."
The main celebration also included a display of military vehicles, including the Sandown-class mine countermeasures vessel HMS Blyth, the AS90 artillery tank and the Warrior and Terrier armoured vehicles.
North East Lincolnshire Council leader Ray Oxby said: "Our local Armed Forces Day has previously attracted more than 60,000 people into the area for the weekend to recognise our past and serving military personnel, and I've no doubt that figure will be dwarfed by hosting the national day."
