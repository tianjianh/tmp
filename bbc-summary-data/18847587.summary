Members of the public have teed off at US tycoon Donald Trump's multi-million pound golf resort for the first time.

Mr Trump officially unveiled his Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire last week.
The course opened to the public on Sunday morning, with rounds available on a "pay-per-play" basis.
Discounts of 20% have been offered to residents of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
Mr Trump was piped onto the 18-hole course, which is three miles long, before cutting a ribbon and striking the first ball with former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie to declare the resort officially open on Tuesday.
He has clashed with local residents, environmentalists, wind farm manufacturers and the Scottish First Minister since buying the land on the Menie Estate seven years ago.
Plans for a hotel and houses on the estate have been put on hold until a decision is made on a proposed wind farm off the coast of the Links.
Mr Trump has already dubbed it the "greatest golf course anywhere in the world".
At the opening on Tuesday, he said: "It's the whole structure that makes it special - the dunes, being on the North Sea - the architect has done an amazing job.
"It's a special place, Scotland is a special place. I think this is great for golf, and what's great for golf is good for Scotland because Scotland is the home front for the game."
Mr Trump also said he remains confident that the offshore wind farm proposal in the North Sea will be rejected and plans to expand the resort will continue.
