[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was "financially ruined" by his lengthy legal battles, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Travis was convicted in September of indecently assaulting a woman and given a three month sentence suspended for two years.
A hearing at Southwark Crown Court heard that he had racked up a taxi fare bill of £4,456 during his trials.
He was awarded travel costs, limited to the value of a day return train ticket and £50 for a taxi, and hotel costs.
Stephen Vullo QC, representing Travis, made the defendant's costs application and said his client had been "financially devastated" by trials in February and September last year.
"He has no money left whatsoever," he said.
"He is now below zero."
Mr Vullo also claimed £630 in hotel accommodation, and £246 for travel to legal conferences, and asked for a total of £5,332 towards Travis's costs.
Judge Leonard ruled that Travis could claim the costs of a daily return train ticket from Aylesbury to Marylebone, which the judge said cost £61.40, as well as £50 a day for reasonable taxi costs from the station.
He allowed the hotel costs.
Referring to Travis's back problems, Judge Leonard said: "His infirmity was such that the benefit from the train, to get up from his seat rather than remain in it, is something that could only have been achieved on a train, not a car."
The defence estimated that Travis travelled from his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to court on 37 days, which means he could be entitled to £4,121.80.
The number of days will be confirmed with the court at a later stage.
Prosecutor Joshua Munro argued the costs were not "reasonable" expenses for the taxpayer to fund.
Travis was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault after a trial in February 2014.
The jury was unable to decide on verdicts on an additional count of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault and a retrial was ordered.
The Crown Prosecution Service added one more count of indecent assault, the offence of which he was eventually convicted, on the indictment for the September 2014 trial.
Travis was cleared of the indecent assault on which he was retried, and after a second jury was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charge, Judge Anthony Leonard QC, directed a not guilty verdict.
