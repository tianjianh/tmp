The TV cameras visited the mere in Ellesmere earlier in the month to watch the young herons leave their nest.
Ellesmere-based Rob McBride, an expert in ancient trees, also joined presenter Julia Bradbury as Countryfile explored Offa's Dyke.
The 177-mile-long footpath marks its 40th anniversary this year, after being designated a National Trail in 1971.
The dyke itself, built by King Offa of Mercia, dates back some 1,200 years.
The ancient earthworks run from Sedbury, near Chepstow to Prestatyn in North Wales, roughly following the modern-day border between England and Wales.
