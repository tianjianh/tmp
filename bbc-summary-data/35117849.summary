The UNESCO World Heritage Site was the overall winner of the England's Great Places awards.
The competition was run by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), to show off the most "attractive and inspiring" work of town planners.
Thame High Street in Thame, Oxfordshire, and Saltaire near Bradford came second and third respectively.
The city of Bath and the Peak District were also named among the top 10 finalists.
Liverpool waterfront, which features the landmark buildings known as Three Graces, topped the list after more than 11,000 people voted.
Janet Askew, president of the RTPI, said:  "I think Liverpool is a great place and I think there is loads coming on in Liverpool now.
"There has been so much happening recently linking Liverpool One with the waterfront itself and to the spectacular buildings of the Cunard and the Liver and the designation of the World Heritage site."
She added: "All these things come from good planning I think perhaps the public has just suddenly woken up to it."
Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said the waterfront was "recognised around the world" as a "unique" area, combining business and tourism.
Liverpool waterfront
The area stretches along the waterfront from Albert Dock, through The Pier Head and up to Stanley Dock, and up through the historic commercial districts and the RopeWalks area to St George's Quarter
It was granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004, reflecting the city's significance as a commercial port
The Pier Head encompasses a trio of landmarks known as the Three Graces - the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building
The Albert Dock, designed by Jesse Hartley, opened in 1846 and remained a fully working dock until closing in 1972. It later underwent a restoration programme and was reopened as a visitor attraction in 1988.
