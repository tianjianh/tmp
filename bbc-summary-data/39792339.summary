Daly, 24, is one of three players from title hopefuls Wasps on the list, along with Christian Wade and Jimmy Gopperth.
Saracens playmaker Farrell, 25, has helped his club to a third consecutive European Champions Cup final.
French back-rower Louis Picamoles, 31, has been selected after an impressive first season at Northampton Saints.
Wasps have had a magnificent season in the Premiership, winning 16 of their 21 games so far to head the table and secure their top-four spot.
Winger Wade is the league's top try-scorer with 16, with four from Daly, while versatile centre Gopperth is the overall leading points scorer with 256.
Farrell has made a major impact for club and country, helping England win the Six Nations and making Sarries, who are third in the Premiership, a major force in both domestic and European rugby.
Picamoles has been a key performer for Saints, and tops the offloads list with 40 passes in the tackle in the Premiership this season.
