Barriers to be installed along The Kingsway after death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Safety barriers are to be installed along The Kingsway in Swansea following the death of a police officer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, was off duty when she was hit by a bus on the road on 31 March.
She was airlifted to hospital but later died. Her daughter Olivia, eight, was also injured in the incident.
The 1.2m-high barriers will be erected on Sunday morning, with the work expected to take up to six hours to complete.
The move follows a call for "urgent action" from a coroner investigating the death of Daniel Foss, 37, who died after he too was hit by a bus on the road in 2013.
Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips said the road had a "serious design issue", which "must be addressed" by Swansea council.
