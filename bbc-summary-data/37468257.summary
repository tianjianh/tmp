[SN]TITLE[SN]
1. FC Koln 1-1 RB Leipzig

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oliver Burke became the first Scot to score in the Bundesliga for almost 17 years as RB Leipzig drew at Cologne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Burke, 19, scored five minutes into his full debut after joining for £13m from Nottingham Forest last month.
Scotland's most expensive footballer fired low past keeper Timo Horn from 15 yards to give his side the lead.
RB Leipzig had to settle for a point as Yuya Osako equalised in a game which kicked off 15 minutes late after a protest by Cologne fans.
About 100 supporters sat down in the road to block the RB Leipzig coach in a protest against the team bankrolled by energy drinks manufacturer Red Bull.
RB Leipzig, who are unbeaten, are seventh in the table with nine points, six behind leaders Bayern Munich and two adrift of Cologne.
Prior to Burke's goal, former Celtic and Aberdeen midfielder Brian O'Neil was the last Scot to score in the Bundesliga - netting for Wolfsburg in November 1999.
