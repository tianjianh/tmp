The index had reached its 12th consecutive record close on Friday, but finished Monday 11 points lower, or 0.15%, at 7,327 points.
Financial firms were hit after reports suggested that the Prime Minister would reveal her preference for a "hard Brexit" in a speech tomorrow.
RBS, Standard Life, insurer Prudential, and Lloyds were among the top fallers.
They shed 2.8%, 2.2%, 2.11 and 2% respectively.
Oil companies were hit by fresh doubts over whether Opec countries would stick to an agreed output cut announced last year.
BP was down by 1% while Shell lost 0.3%.
Against the dollar, the pound fell 1.21% or 1.5 cents, to $1.204.
Meanwhile, sterling was down 0.9% against the euro at â‚¬1.136.
In general, the FTSE 100 has benefitted from the weaker pound, as it makes overseas profits for multinational companies, which are listed in London, worth more when they are converted back into sterling.
