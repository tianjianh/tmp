Taxi driver Muhammad Khan, who saw part of the pursuit, said two police vehicles were chasing the car near a railway crossing on nearby Fen Road.
"The car was coming really fast and police threw a stinger," he said.
"The tyres were flattened, but I didn't see it crash as it was going in the opposite direction to me."
Stingers can be deployed by police officers, who have been given senior authorisation, after drivers fail to stop when required to do so - resulting in a pursuit, according to the Association of Chief Police Officers.
