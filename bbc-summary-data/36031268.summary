Durham and Somerset had to settle for a draw in their Championship Division One game after no play was possible on the final two days at the Riverside.

The home side had played themselves into a good position, with a lead of 300, at 223-4 in their second innings.
But with rain falling, umpires Rob Bailey and Nigel Cowley took an early decision to abandon the game.
Durham's Keaton Jennings was left unbeaten on 105, having made 116 in their first innings on the opening day.
Durham head coach Jon Lewis: "To have a week off between games is the norm in the rest of the world, so hopefully things will dry up and we can get in some decent preparation.
"We have a second team game here against Scotland next week, but we won't be loading the side.
"There's nothing worse than getting left out of the first team at the start of the season then not getting a chance to prove yourself. The seconds have had no luck with the weather so far."
Somerset captain Chris Rogers: "We didn't quite get it right here, but the bowlers will improve.
"We also found it hard with the bat. We kept losing wickets in groups and didn't build partnerships, but what I like about this group is that they can all contribute.
"I have loved being back here. To be up against Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth up here at the start of the season is as challenging as it's going to get."
