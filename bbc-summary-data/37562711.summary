Four Nations 2016: Australia select Wales-capped Tyson Frizell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales international Tyson Frizell has been included in Australia's squad for the Four Nations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The St George Illawarra second row has made five appearances for Wales and featured in the 2011 Four Nations and 2013 World Cup.
Born in Wollongong, Australia, the 24-year-old qualifies to play for Wales through his Swansea-born father.
Frizell can continue to represent Wales as they are a tier two nation and Australia are tier one.
Players for tier two nations - teams ranked fourth to 10th in the world - can also compete, where eligible, for one of the big three nations, Australia, England and New Zealand.
Frizell was left out of the Wales squad for the 2017 World Cup qualifiers with Serbia and Italy in October, after telling coaching staff he was unavailable for selection.
He is one of seven new names in the Kangaroos squad, who face Scotland in their opening game at Hull KR's Lightstream Stadium on 28 October.
Australia squad: Cameron Smith (captain), Darius Boyd, Shannon Boyd, Boyd Cordner, Cooper Cronk, Josh Dugan, Blake Ferguson, Jake Friend, Tyson Frizell, Matt Gillett, Valentine Holmes, Greg Inglis, David Klemmer, James Maloney, Josh Mansour, Trent Merrin, Michael Morgan, Matt Moylan, Justin O'Neill, Josh Papalii, Matt Scott, Sam Thaiday, Johnathan Thurston, Aaron Woods
