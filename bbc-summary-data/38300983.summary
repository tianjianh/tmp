Dean Rutter: Wrexham paedophile who faked suicide jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "monstrous" paedophile who faked his suicide when police arrested him has been jailed for 18 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Peter Rutter, 41, of Abenbury, near Wrexham, admitted 20 sex offences against four boys, some aged under 10.
Mold Crown Court heard it lasted several years and the boys were threatened with physical violence.
Rutter said he did it because he was attracted to young boys and would continue to abuse boys if he was able.
After his arrest, Rutter left a suicide note at his home but was found living in a Tenby hotel 10 days later after officers traced his mobile phone signal.
The note said he had taken an overdose and gone to hang himself.
Previously, he admitted wasting police time and was given a three-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.
He admitted 20 charges of sexual assault, rape, attempted rape and causing a child to engage in sexual activity.
Henry Hills, defending, said: "It beholds me to acknowledge the extremely grave nature of the offences and the harm that has been caused."
Mr Hills said the only real mitigation was the fact Rutter had taken full responsibility and pleaded guilty to all charges.
Judge Niclas Parry said he would only be freed if the parole board considered it safe.
He said his offending could "only be described as monstrous examples of sexual abuse".
The judge also imposed a 12-month licence period upon his release.
Rutter was ordered to register as a sex offender for life and a lifetime sexual harm prevention order was made, preventing him from having unsupervised contact with boys under 16.
Det Insp Sarah-Jayne Williams, of North Wales Police, paid tribute to the "courage and strength" of the victims in coming forward and welcomed the "significant sentence" which she said would ensure Rutter could not pose a risk to other young people.
An NSPCC Wales spokesman said Rutter's crimes would have caused "unimaginable damage" to the young victims.
