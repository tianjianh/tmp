Balandin had been the slowest qualifier, but won in a time of two minutes 7.46 seconds, with American Josh Prenot second in 2:07:53.
Willis came fourth in 2:07:78, 0.08 seconds behind third-placed Anton Chupkov of Russia.
Germany's world champion Marco Koch could only finish seventh in the final.
"I feel like when I do finish swimming, four will be my lucky number. But I gave it everything and I wouldn't change anything," said Willis, who has now finished fourth at the Olympics, twice at the World Championships and once at the European Championships.
"I touched and I knew I was up there. When you touch and you look around it seems to take forever. I'm just a bit gutted."

In the women's 200m breaststroke, Great Britain's Molly Renshaw, 20, and Chloe Tutton, 20, advanced to the final.
Renshaw set a British record of 2:22:33 and finished second in her semi-final to qualify as the third fastest swimmer, while Tutton's time of 2:22:71 put her through as the seventh fastest.
Controversial Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova, who was only allowed to compete at Rio after successfully appealing against a doping suspension, also reached the final, coming second in her race to be sixth fastest overall.
Efimova, 24, was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.
