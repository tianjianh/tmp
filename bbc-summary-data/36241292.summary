The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said the officers were attacked while on duty on Sunday morning.
About 50 members of staff walked out for a day on Friday, citing health and safety concerns after recent attacks.
A Prison Service spokesperson said the attacker is kept "in segregation" and will face a police inquiry.
Met Police said they were called to the prison at 11:16 BST.
Mike Rolfe, national chairman elect of the Prison Officers' Association, said: "The POA can confirm two prison officers have been seriously injured whilst performing their duties at Wormwood Scrubs.
"Both members of staff were badly assaulted and have been taken to hospital."
A spokesman for the Prison Service confirmed two members of staff were taken to hospital for treatment.
"We do not tolerate violence against our hardworking officers," he said.
"The perpetrator has been placed in segregation and will face a police investigation which could lead to criminal charges."
The union said it is still seriously concerned about staff safety at the prison and said individuals may stage further walkouts.
Wormwood Scrubs, located in Hammersmith and Fulham, was built between 1875 and 1891.
It is a Category B prison and holds around 1,200 men.
Previously, the POA had said the jail was "flooded with drugs, mobile phones and weapons".
