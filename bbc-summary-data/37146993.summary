West Bromwich Albion 0-0 Middlesbrough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough maintained their unbeaten Premier League start in a dull goalless draw at West Brom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Home left-back Brendan Galloway had the best chance of the first half, surging forward but striking tamely at Boro goalkeeper Brad Guzan.
Albion's Craig Dawson headed just wide from a corner after the break, and Boro's Cristhian Stuani shot straight at Ben Foster from a tight angle.
Daniel Ayala's poked effort from close range was kept out by Foster later on.

This was a match lacking in quality and creativity, producing a result with which the visitors will be happier. The draw means that Boro have collected five points from three matches since returning to the top flight.
Aitor Karanka's organised side had more possession without really threatening the West Brom goal, with home goalkeeper Foster worked just twice to make routine saves.
Striker Alvaro Negredo had been involved in all three of his side's goals this term but he was isolated up front - and his total of 26 touches of the ball was the lowest of any player who started the match.
Central defenders Ayala and Ben Gibson looked assured, with the Spaniard contributing a match-high 13 clearances to maintain the side's first clean sheet of the campaign.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis has added just one permanent signing during this transfer window, in Matt Phillips from QPR, as well the loan acquisition of defender Galloway from Everton.
Pulis reiterated the club need to sign "at least five players" to make a difference and on this showing, there will have to be frantic activity before Wednesday's transfer deadline to add reinforcements. The smattering of discontent from the home fans at full-time may just force the Baggies into it.
Teenager Sam Field was given his league debut against Boro and showed glimpses of his potential with tidy passing, but without any real incisiveness.
Although the hosts had 13 shots during the game, six were off target while five were blocked, so a partner for striker Salomon Rondon will be a priority.
The future of Saido Berahino remains unclear and he failed to make in impact during the 20 minutes he was on the pitch. Should he leave without a replacement coming in, West Brom could well be in trouble at the wrong end of the table.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "I have said before we need five players to come in because there are players here we need to move on who aren't going to play.

"There are 14 or 15 players who were here two years ago, when we were struggling near the bottom, who are fantastic and work so hard but we need to freshen up."
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: "It was a difficult game for both of us but a point is massive because in the Premier League every game is tough.

"To have five points on the table is good and we'd have taken that. Maybe today wasn't the best performance but the spirit was there."
West Brom travel to Bournemouth on Saturday, 10 September (kick-off 15:00 BST), while Middlesbrough hosts Crystal Palace at the same time.
