Queens Park Rangers revealed they have begun legal proceedings against the Football League, a day after being relegated from the Premier League.

The club say they are challenging "the legality of the Championship Financial Fair Play rules", which could leave them facing a fine of up to £58m.
Rangers said any charge for breaching the rules would not begin until the outcome of their challenge was known.
Their relegation was confirmed by Sunday's 6-0 loss at Manchester City.
In March, the club announced losses of £9.8m, but £60m worth of loans were written off by owner Tony Fernandes and other shareholders.
A failure to pay any fine imposed could see the London side being refused entry into the Championship.
