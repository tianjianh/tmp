Several players, including 2010 winner Neil Robertson, have been highly critical of the pockets, describing them as "massive" and "like buckets".
Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry said on Twitter on Friday that it was "#bucketry at the Crucible".
But a World Snooker spokesman said: "The pocket templates are exactly the same as they are at every other event."
Steve Davis, six-time Crucible champion, said: "The general consensus among some of the pros is that the pockets are oversized by a fraction.
"And, if you are playing shots with pockets that are bigger, you should - if you get among the balls - make the most of it."
World Snooker had previously had to take action after criticism of the tables during the start of this year's event in Sheffield.
Qualifier Ali Carter, a two-time finalist, described the table in his defeat against Alan McManus as "the worst I have ever played on".
