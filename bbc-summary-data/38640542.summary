[SN]TITLE[SN]
AC Milan v Napoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Napoli strengthened their bid for a Serie A top-three finish as their splendid recent form continued with a win at fifth-placed AC Milan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Napoli, last season's runners-up, made a flying start when Lorenzo Insigne drilled in Dries Mertens' cross-field pass after a swift counter attack.
Belgium international Mertens also provided the second when his sliding pass was squeezed in by Jose Callejon from a tight angle.
Juraj Kucka slid under Pepe Reina to give Milan hope before the break, but they could not find a second-half equaliser as Napoli stretched their unbeaten run to a 14th game in all competitions.
Teenage Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma came closest in injury-time, running forward for a free-kick and heading straight at opposite number Reina.
Both clubs harbour ambitions of finishing in the top three at the end of the season, ensuring Champions League qualification in the process.
Milan, who have not reached Europe's premier club competition since 2014, had lost just once in 11 matches going into the San Siro clash, only to leave themselves too much to do after a slow start.
They stay fifth in the Italian top-flight, one point above neighbours Inter, while third-placed Napoli are now level with Roma and a point adrift of leaders Juventus.
Juventus, who are bidding for a record sixth straight Scudetto, host fourth-placed Lazio in Turin on Sunday (11:30 GMT).
