Doncaster petrol station spelling blunder sees 'petrel' on offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road sign marking directing motorists to a supermarket petrol station has been misspelt, leaving drivers bemused.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The word "petrel" has been painted in 3ft high letters on the approach to the pumps at the Sainsbury's Edenthorpe store in Doncaster.
A picture of the blunder was posted on social media with the comment "Seabirds straight ahead #YouHadOneJob".
In a light-hearted response, the superstore said: "We're aware of this and correcting the misteke."
The white letters, which may have left drivers thinking they were being pointed towards a species of small seabird, were painted by bungling signwriters next to the flawlessly spelt word "exit" and some perfectly drawn arrows.
It prompted a flurry of social media users mocking the blooper, with some employing their own deliberate spelling errors.
Aaron Jones tweeted: "Only in Doncaster would you go for 'Petrel' instead of 'Petrol'."
While Martin Milan posted: "@sainsburys Your Edenthorpe, Doncaster store... What if I want Deesul lol?"
Petrels are small seabirds that fly low over oceans and seas.
