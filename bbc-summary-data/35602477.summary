Dublin: Second 48-hour Luas strike under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers on the Luas Dublin's tram system are holding another 48-hour strike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the second time the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) workers have stopped work in a week in a dispute over pay.
It is causing disruption for 90,000 commuters in Ireland's capital city.
On Wednesday, the union said it plans to strike again on 8 March and on 17 March - St Patrick's Day, which is a national holiday in Ireland.
The union said its members believe they are underpaid, particularly when compared to workers doing similar jobs in Irish Rail.
Workers are seeking pay rises ranging from 8% to 53%.
However, Transdev, the private company that operates the Luas, said a workers' pay claim of up to 53% was not sustainable and would add 6m euros (Â£4.65m ) to its costs.
