Due to "unprecedented interest" promoters have teamed up with Skype, so that fans, in exchange for a minimum donation of Â£15, can watch the event.
The Music of David Bowie will be held at Radio City Music Hall in New York on Friday.
Slated performers include Mumford & Sons, Blondie and The Pixies.
With a set-list devoted to classic Bowie songs, they are among 18 currently confirmed artists who are set to pay tribute to the musical legend who died of cancer in January.
Bowie's producer, Tony Visconti, is also expected to take to the stage.
Fans can donate via the fundraising platform ammado, and all net proceeds will be given to a variety of arts, music and education charities.
A similar show is to be held at Carnegie Hall in New York the day before, on 31 March.
