The UK government remains committed to considering a major funding package for projects in Inverness, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.

Inverness, along with Aberdeen, is the subject of an application for a City Deal. It could potentially be worth millions of pounds.
Mr Cameron told MPs: "We are committed to examining the city deal with Inverness."
He said "very good progress" was being made with the deal for Aberdeen.
The prime minister added that the deals were a chance for the UK and Scottish governments to work together.
Mr Cameron was responding to a question from Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP Drew Hendry, who asked what progress was being made with Inverness' bid.
Last year, Scottish Secretary David Mundell confirmed Â£3m funding for Inverness.
The money was to enable the local authority to go ahead with plans to upgrade the grounds and access to Inverness Castle.
A second project to create a free public access wi-fi scheme for the city was also expected to be funded.
Highland Council said: "We are continuing to work positively and constructively with colleagues in the Scottish and UK governments to secure a City/Region Deal for Inverness and the Highlands."
