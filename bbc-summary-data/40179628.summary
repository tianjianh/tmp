The 30-year-old joined Wanderers for a second loan stint in January from Cardiff City and helped the club to promotion from League One.
He was out of contract at Cardiff this summer and moves on a free transfer.
"It's not going to be a shock that I've signed and it's been a long time coming," he told the club website.
"Bolton is my spiritual home at the moment and I'm really looking forward to putting in a lot of hard work and get going."
