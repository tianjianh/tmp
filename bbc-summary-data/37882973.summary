Los Angeles police have charged Playboy model Dani Mathers over a "body-shaming" image she took of an older woman in a gym locker room.

The picture of the naked 70-year-old was taken in LA Fitness in July without her consent and posted on social media.
Ms Mathers uploaded the photo to Snapchat alongside one of herself and the caption: "If I can't unsee this then you can't either".
She faces a charge of invasion of privacy.
She could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 (Â£800) fine if convicted.
Ms Mathers, 29, apologised soon after uploading the image, saying she thought her Snapchat post had been a private conversation and acknowledging that "body-shaming" is wrong.
However, her lawyer, Thomas Mesereau, is quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying his client did nothing illegal, neither invading anyone's privacy nor violating any laws.
Announcing the decision to charge the model, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer took aim at "body-shaming", calling it "humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences".
"It mocks and stigmatises its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of 'perfect'."
Ms Mathers has been permanently banned from the chain of gyms, lost her job on a radio show and has faced widespread criticism online.
