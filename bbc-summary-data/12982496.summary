[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Wills forced to withdraw 'overtly sexual' images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clothing retailer Jack Wills has been told by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) not to reprint its spring catalogue in its current form.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nineteen people complained that four of the pictures in it were unsuitable for a catalogue targeted at teenagers.
The Devon-based company responded that the brand was aimed at university students over the age of 18.
But the ASA concluded that the catalogue was sufficiently provocative to present a risk to younger teenagers.
The company said that people wishing to receive their catalogue would have had to sign up online or in stores and in either case would have had to confirm that they were over 18.
It said that its logo described it as the "University Outfitters" and added that the pictures were supposed to project "a positive, fun and sometimes flirtatious" reflection of student life.
Two years ago, the ASA cleared a semi-naked image in the Jack Wills catalogue, saying that it was not provocative enough to present a risk to teenagers or be unsuitable for the target audience.
This time though, the ASA adjudication ruled that some of the images went beyond what could be considered to be fun or flirtatious.
It was particularly concerned about an image of a topless couple kissing while being sprayed with water.
