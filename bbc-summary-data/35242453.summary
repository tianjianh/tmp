Plans have been unveiled to install a lighting system on the historic Dumbarton Bridge over the River Leven.

West Dunbartonshire Council is seeking approval for the scheme from Historic Scotland - the agency responsible for the country's historic monuments.
If the go-ahead is given, the lighting system will be installed during 2016.
Dumbarton Bridge was originally built in 1765 and was widened in 1884 before being reconstructed in 1934 when the balustrade was added.
Councillor Patrick McGlinchey, convener of the council's infrastructure and regeneration, said: "I am delighted that this historic bridge is going to be lit up in this way.
"It will look really spectacular when it is illuminated and will add more character to the area.
"We can see from the initial designs how the bridge could look and I'm now looking forward to seeing it introduced."
