Bill Barfoot, 96, was presented with the Legion d'Honneur for his role with the Royal Air Force.
French President Francois Hollande promised the medal to any servicemen involved in D-Day, during last year's 70th anniversary of the landings.
Mr Barfoot said he was proud to receive the award.
"It was very emotional," he said.
"I think it went very well, the consul said he had never been to such a good party."
More than 3,000 British servicemen applied for Legion d'Honneur, and 2,000 applications are still to be processed.
The award cannot be handed out posthumously, leading to worries from servicemen's families they may not receive recognition in time.
The average age of D-Day veterans is now 95.
"You cannot be given them posthumously, so there's no second chance," said Mr Barfoot.
"It's highly unusual for one country to recognise another country's military, and this is no ordinary medal."
Nigel Barfoot, 67, was proud to see his father finally recognised.
"When you think about what they went through it's extraordinary what they did," he said.
"Dad didn't used to speak about it much, but he did incredible things."
