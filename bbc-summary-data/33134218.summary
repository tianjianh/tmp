India village holds 'selfies with daughters' contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A village in India recently held an unique contest to raise consciousness about girl children: click a selfie with your daughter and win a prize.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The competition organised by village leaders in Bibipur, Haryana attracted nearly 800 entries from all over the country.
Winners were declared on Friday and received a trophy, a certificate and prize of 2,100 rupees ($316; Â£199).
Haryana has one of India's lowest gender ratios, with 877 women for every 1,000 men. This, say experts, is the result of illegal sex-selective abortions, female infanticide, parental neglect and discrimination against girl children.
Here we show some of the selfies as well as images taken by photographer Mansi Thapliyal, who travelled to talk to some of those who participated in the contest.
