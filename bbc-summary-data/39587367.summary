[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff man has admitted taking more than £10,000 bond money from prospective tenants but then not renting out the property.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Jackson, 35, from Penylan, pleaded guilty to eight counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday.
The Crown Prosecution Service said he had advertised his house on Gumtree.
The court heard he falsely took bonds of between £1,000 and £1,400 from eight people, between October 2016 and March 2017.
The case was adjourned for sentencing until 18 May and Jackson has been remanded in custody.
"Jackson persuaded various people to pay him money over a number of months," said senior crown prosecutor Kelly Huggins afterwards.
"He continued his pretence that he was a registered landlord and that the agreements would be honoured.
"Instead, he lied about his son's health in order to delay them and avoid making repayments.
"His victims were relying on him to put a roof over their heads, but the reality was he deliberately took their money and prevented them moving on with their lives."
