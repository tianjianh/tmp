A bid for a statue of a Victorian bare-knuckle boxing champion in his home city of Nottingham has been launched.

Local legends Robin Hood and Brian Clough are already cast in bronze but prize fighter Bendigo has just a concrete sculpture on the outskirts.
Campaigner Ryan Drain believes "the people's champion of Nottingham" deserves a more fitting tribute in a more prominent city centre location.
The city council said it would consider a "firm proposal" for a statue.
William Abednego Thompson, who was born in 1811 in Sneinton, just outside Nottingham, began fighting aged 15 to provide for his family, who were sent to the workhouse following the death of his father.
Three years later he was drawing crowds of up to 15,000 at fights all over country, and in 1839, aged 28, won the All England Title.
Mr Drain, 26, said: "I've seen the Brian Clough and the Robin Hood statues and went to Sneinton to see the Bendigo statue and it broke my heart.
"The hands are missing, it looks as if it's falling to pieces to me. It's not a fitting tribute.
"He was the people's champion of Nottingham and deserves a hell of a lot better."
World champion boxer Carl Froch, from the city, recently spoke out about the state of the Sneinton sculpture, telling the Nottingham Post: "It needs renewing in bronze, like the Brian Clough statue."
And Nottingham North MP Graham Allen tweeted he would like to see "an Angel of the North-size statue".
Mr Drain said Bendigo's story was more than one of boxing success.
"I feel that passionate about Bendigo, particularly his upbringing. He lost his father at 15 and grew up in abject poverty but he came out of that to become a champion," he said.
Mr Drain is hoping to raise funds for the statue through a series of activities, including a bar crawl of the boxer's famous Nottingham haunts, and to boost the campaign's profile by getting some famous names on board.
A Nottingham City Council spokesman said "If anyone came to us with firm proposals for a statue to commemorate Bendigo's life, we would consider them."
