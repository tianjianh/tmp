The 30-year-old Portugal forward scored his 324th Real goal in 310 games to overtake Raul's record.
The club had already considered Ronaldo the record holder as they credit him with a goal deflected off Pepe in 2010.
Ronaldo's official record-breaking strike came after an hour from just outside the box - either side of goals from Marcelo and Jese.
After scoring twice in a 2-0 win over Malmo last month, Real held a presentation to give Ronaldo a trophy for breaking the record.
The discrepancy dates back to 2010 when a Ronaldo free-kick was deflected in by Pepe.
La Liga considered it a Pepe goal but Real deemed it Ronaldo's - and hence have credited him with various scoring landmarks one strike before anyone else.
New York Cosmos striker Raul, who is retiring in November, was Real's record goalscorer, but took 741 games to score his 323 goals.
Wales forward Gareth Bale was substituted off at half-time of the Levante game for Lucas Vazquez as Real went top of the table.
Barcelona are behind them on goal difference after beating Rayo Vallecano 5-2.
Previous leaders Villarreal host third-placed Celta Vigo on Sunday (11:00 BST).
