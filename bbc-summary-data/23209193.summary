Fancy an ice cream? What about a fish lollipop? Thought not but for hot penguins it's just the ticket.

While humans might be enjoying one of the hottest days of the year penguins are London Zoo need a bit of help to cope with the heat.
Many parts of the UK will be hitting highs of 26C with the Southeast getting as hot as Majorca in Spain.
Penguins which normally live in cold climates are being given frozen fish lollipops to help cool them down.
See the penguins chilling out.
