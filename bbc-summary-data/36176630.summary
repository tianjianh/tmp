The Potters took the lead with a well-worked move which ended with Marko Arnautovic setting up Charlie Adam to angle in a shot.
Dwight Gayle equalised for the home side when he side-footed in after Yannick Bolasie's mazy run.
And the Eagles striker got the winner when he picked himself up from a foul to score with a 25-yard free-kick.

Palace can now look forward to their FA Cup final against Manchester United on 21 May without any lingering worries about relegation, while Gayle's performance will have given boss Alan Pardew a selection dilemma for the Wembley showpiece.
Gayle was playing as winger Wilfried Zaha was out with a leg injury, and he took his opportunity to impress as Palace won for only the second time in their past 20 league games.
He had two penalty claims turned down in the first half but his persistence paid off as he coolly scored his first goal after the ball broke to him following Bolasie's run.
His second came despite him appearing to slip as he took the free-kick.
"It's the most important thing, staying in the Premier League," said Gayle.
"It hasn't been the best few months but, hopefully, in the next few weeks we can turn [the season] around.
"The most important thing for me is to enjoy my football which I am at the moment and hopefully I can be in and around the team for the FA Cup final."
However, there was concern for Pardew with midfielder Yohan Cabaye and his replacement Joe Ledley both having to go off injured.
When Stoke scored the opener from a move involving Giannelli Imbula and Arnautovic before Adam applied the finishing touch, it seemed they were determined to end a run of five games without a win.
They put in the kind of effort which made a mockery of claims that, because the Potters had no chance of a European place or were in any danger of relegation, they were already on the beach.
However, they struggled to maintain their performance in the second half and were punished by Gayle.
Arnautovic sent a late shot over when well-placed to level and the defeat now means Stoke cannot match their best points tally of 54 in the Premier League.
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "The first half was not our best. It's difficult as we have got one eye on the FA Cup final.
"We needed to make sure we got a win for home fans and second half we were great and had numerous chances.
"I said to him [Dwight Gayle] at half-time that I thought he was our best player. He wanted to show me and he couldn't have done anymore. We've lacked a goalscorer this season. He is a force for us."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "Today wasn't quite what we were looking for - a low-quality game in my opinion. It's not the way we anticipated finishing off the season.
"There was no question of our effort today. Just a bit of frustration that we didn't play as well as we are capable of."
