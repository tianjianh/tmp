PMQs: May and Corbyn's memorable clashes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Theresa May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions at midday for the final time before the general election - and possibly ever. Here are some of their more memorable clashes.

Making her PMQs debut in July, Mrs May focused on unrest among Labour MPs, and likened Mr Corbyn to an "unscrupulous boss". The Labour leader was not impressed, saying Tories might find economic insecurity "funny" but millions of people did not.
The May versus Corbyn clashes are unlikely to be remembered for their contribution to comedy. PMQs watchers were left groaning in September by Mrs May's attempts to shoehorn in train jokes after Mr Corbyn's tussle with Virgin Rail. In January, Mr Corbyn's suggestion of a new nickname for the PM generated a similar reaction.
Things got personal over grammar schools in March, when Mrs May told MPs Mr Corbyn had sent his son to one, adding: "Typical Labour, take the advantage and pull up the ladder behind you." The Labour leader - who had been opposed to sending his child to a selective school - accused the prime minister of indulging in a "vanity project" over grammar schools.
One of Mr Corbyn's most regular PMQs themes has been the NHS, like in January when he accused Mrs May of being "in denial" over the state of the health service.
Donald Trump's proposed state visit to the UK was the hot topic in February, with Mr Corbyn urging the prime minister to "listen" to the 1.8 million people who had signed a petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn.
The PM hit back, adding: "He can lead a protest, I'm leading a country."
In February Mr Corbyn read out leaked text messages showing what he called a "sweetheart deal" to ensure a Tory-controlled council dropped plans to raise council tax by up to 15%.
When Mr Corbyn returned to the subject the following month it provoked a very visible laugh from the PM.
Perhaps the strangest moment of the Corbyn and May tussles was one that did not involve either leader.
Mr Corbyn's deputy, Tom Watson, appeared to "dab" (a dance craze that originated in the US) after a question from his boss.
