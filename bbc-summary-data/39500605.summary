Anthony Banting, 57, was stabbed multiple times after getting off a tram at Soho Benson Road, Winson Green, at about 16:40 BST on Friday.
The grandfather-of-two was making his way to meet one son in a pub.
His family said he was "a simple man with simple pleasures" and "loved nothing more than spending time with his boys".

In a statement released by West Midlands Police, his sons said Mr Banting, known as Tony, enjoyed "crown green bowling, national hunt racing and he regularly travelled to enjoy the sunshine".
They said: "He was loved by many and this incident will never leave us.
"We would appeal to anyone with any information to come forward immediately. We would also like to ask for privacy and understanding at this very difficult time."
The force has previously released images of a man officers want to speak to in connection with the stabbing.
