A 90-year-old former teacher has been cleared of committing a string of sex attacks on a boy at a residential approved school in the 1950s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennis Young, of Burton Stone Lane, York, denied committing the offences while teaching at Skegby Hall, near Mansfield, about 60 years ago.
He was acquitted of seven counts of indecently assaulting a child at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday.
An ex-pupil had told the court he had been "bribed" with sweets to be quiet.

In a police video interview shown in court, the alleged victim said he was threatened and told that if he said anything, he would be sent to a borstal.
He also said when he complained to the school's head, he was told "not to be a silly boy".
When asked why he had taken so long to come forward, he replied: "To get it off my chest, I'm ashamed, I feel guilty as though it's my fault."
Speaking outside court, Mr Young told the Nottingham Post: "I am getting on for 91. I'm weary of the whole business."
