Nepal earthquake: Stranded Britons rescued

Eight Britons stranded in a monastery in Nepal have been rescued - a week after the devastating earthquake.

They were airlifted from a religious retreat, in a remote mountainside area of the country, by a team of experts using a chartered helicopter.
An RAF C-17 aircraft, which had taken aid to Nepal, separately flew another seven Britons out of the country.
It comes as a UK appeal for donations to help those caught up in the Nepal earthquake has raised more than £33m.
The government added £5m and pledged a further £12.5m to the fund raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee, making it the largest international donor.
The money will be used to help an estimated eight million people in need.
The rescue was carried out by emergency staff from a Department for International Development (Dfid) emergency team.
International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the "quick thinking and swift action" of the team meant the eight British nationals had been saved from "what could have been a life or death situation".
She said the RAF C-17 aircraft and a commercial transport had also delivered more than 1,900 five-litre water purification jerrycans and more than 2,500 shelter kits.
"These latest aid flights have delivered much-needed shelter and water treatment equipment into Kathmandu. These are vital to stop disease from spreading and to prevent an even bigger health crisis from emerging," Ms Greening added.
It comes as the death toll has risen to over 6,600 and the Nepalese authorities have ruled out finding more survivors.
They said more than 14,000 people were injured in the 7.9 magnitude quake on Saturday.
Rose Caldwell, executive director of the charity Concern Worldwide - which is part of DEC - told the BBC the relief effort has been a "huge challenge" since 3m people are in need of food aid and 130,000 houses have been destroyed.
She said: "Before the earthquake happened it was estimated that a third of the population lived four hours from a main road. This has increased dramatically.
$415 million
needed for humanitarian relief
3 million people in need of food aid
130,000 houses destroyed
24,000 people living in makeshift camps
20 teams working to reunite lost children with their families
"We have to transport bulky materials, shelter, food and drinking water."
Ms Caldwell explained that the UK donations had been distributed to non-governmental organisations and DEC agencies already working in Nepal and had not been passed directly to the Nepalese government.
"Many of the agencies were already on the ground and they had stockpiles which they have started distributing. But those stockpiles are depleting," she added.
Three British Chinook military helicopters are being sent to Nepal to assist in the humanitarian effort. The Nepalese government has called for more foreign help, particularly aircraft, to access remote communities.
The Foreign Office has confirmed that British dual national Hemchandra Rai, 42, was killed in the disaster while reports of another British victim killed at Mount Everest base camp are still being investigated.
The whereabouts of 1,000 EU citizens were still not known and according to a Red Cross missing persons list posted online, 28 people from Britain and Ireland remain unaccounted for.
An EU official said most of the missing Europeans are thought to have been trekking near Mount Everest or in the remote Langtang mountains.
On Thursday 120 Britons caught up in the quake landed on a returning aid flight. Others are on their way home.
Steve Douglas, who was on Mount Everest, was evacuated to Lhasa in Tibet with the British army.
His father Gareth told the BBC that he had heard from his son before news of earthquake hit the media: "He described massive earthquakes, rocks crashing all around."
They were one of the lucky ones, he was at north base camp unlike the mess at south camp, where three avalanches hit them.
Sebastian Lovera, 22 was en-route to Mount Everest when the earthquake struck. He was unable to get on one of the helicopters so is trekking 38 miles to get to an airport to return to the UK.
