Glastonbury: Living in festival city

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are a few essential items that everyone takes to Glastonbury. Loo roll, clothes, wet wipes, glitterball, cafetiere, sheepskin rugs. Right?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some 177,000 people have made a small section of Somerset their home for the music festival. That means choosing where to stay - from the vast tent city to tipis or caravans - and what to take to survive the weekend.
Here, a few of them show us around their abodes.
With a glitterball hanging from its canvas ceiling, The Palace, as it is known, is the biggest tent in sight in this packed field, and is spacious enough for a good after-hours party.
Ten friends sleep in its four wings, which are arranged around the disco-tastic central area. In fact, one of the friends is still sleeping off a particularly good night as I am given a tour.
"We've been to quite a few festivals together," says 24-year-old Scott Stirling who, wearing dungarees, mirror shades and upturned sun visor, is on his way out with six of his tent-mates.
Apart from the glitter ball, what else is in The Palace? "We've got so many bananas," he replies. "Dungarees. Popcorn. We've got some phone chargers.
"Anybody got anything really weird they've brought with them?" he asks his friends - and they all point in his direction.
Why stay in a tent when you can stay in The Cowavan?
The Cowavan is a second-hand caravan adorned with bovine splodges, which overlooks the site from one of the caravan fields outside the perimeter fence.
It belongs to 50-year-old Andy Coombs. "The tent city is pretty intense," he says. "It's something you can't escape from if that's where you're based.
"We can go down there and have fun and then withdraw to our enclave.  It's pretty civilised."
And a caravan allows a few small luxuries, like a cafetiere. "There are some home comforts," he says.
"I'd say coffee is right up there, and a phone charger and a comfy bed."
When he does leave The Cowavan and enter the main site, Mr Coombs dons his dinner jacket, bow tie and oversized moustache. "Everyone loves it and we love it," he says.
The faint, dried-in mud stains on the inner lining prove that Chris Williams' two-man tent has seen plenty of active service. It comes to Glastonbury "every year without fail" and has been to around 20 other festivals, he says.
With its blue, yellow and red scribble design and pagan symbols, "it's distinctive", says the 22-year-old.
What is inside? "A mattress, Coca Cola - which can be mixed with rum to wake you up a bitâ€¦
"Apart from that you need a bit of cash in your pocket and some clothes and the world's your oyster here. You don't need loads of stuff - coming here's about getting away from all that. Who cares if your phone runs out?"
Maya and Megan (right) have been coming to Glastonbury all their lives - and always staying in tipis. "I was born in a tipi," Maya says.
In fact, the pair, now in their 20s, have spent much of their lives living in tipis, having grown up in the community known as Tipi Valley in Wales.
The founders of Tipi Valley were involved in the early Glastonbury festivals, Megan says. "Michael [Eavis] always says 'come back and bring your hippy ways.' People would bring their homes here."
They're to be found, not surprisingly, in the Tipi Field. "It's so chilled out," Maya says, adding that it is "a place you can come to get away" from the madness of the rest of the festival.
What are the essentials when staying in a tipi? "A nice fire and knowing how to work the smoke flaps," Megan replies. "Having loads of dry wood. And loads of nice sheepskins."
But the one flaw in the tipi idea is the hole in the top to let the smoke out. What about the rain? "It just comes in," Maya replies.
Amid a sea of plain tents, Arran Cairns (left) has gone to the trouble of decorating hers with the CND sign - in keeping with the Glastonbury tradition - as well as love hearts and multi-coloured spots.
"There's a lot of glitter, because we like glitter," the 18-year-old says. "It makes it look less boring."
What's in the tent? "There's nothing valuable in our tent. We put everything like that in bum bags. We have a lot of food, clothes, beds and that's pretty much it."
Cairns is in an encampment with college friends from Taunton, Somerset - around 100 of them, all camped around a flag bearing the face of one of the friends. "Everywhere we go, we bump into someone."
