Rhys and Shaun Scott, who were two years old, were found in the garden tank on Saturday at about 08:20.
They were taken by ambulance from the rented house in Dalgety Bay to hospital where they were pronounced dead.
The HSE can compile reports for prosecutors if it believes landlords have put tenants in danger.
It is believed that the family rented the home from a man who formerly ran a business from there, selling ornamental koi carp.
In 2012, Fife Council gave planning permission for the "installation of a fish tank and enclosure to the side" of the house, at an estimated cost of Â£25,000.
An HSE spokeswoman said: "We are liaising with the police over the twins' deaths."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "We are continuing with our inquiries into the tragic deaths of Rhys and Shaun Scott at an address in Dalgety Bay on Saturday 12 March.
"In this instance, we have consulted with the Health and Safety Executive as part of our ongoing investigation.
"We are continuing to support the family with a specialist family liaison officer and inquiries are ongoing."
The twins' parents Mervyn Scott and Sarah Aitken described them as "miracle babies".
In a statement issued through Police Scotland, they said: "Both boys were long awaited little soldiers who were full of love, happiness, fun and cheek.
"Individually and together they have touched the lives of everyone they met.
"We along with our family and friends are still in shock and devastated at such a tragic loss from such a 'freak' accident.
"They have been taken from us far too early and will be forever missed and loved."
