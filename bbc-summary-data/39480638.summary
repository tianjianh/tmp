[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pontypridd's Taff Vale centre demolished for development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The demolition of a Pontypridd shopping centre has now been completed as part of a Â£1.5m site redevelopment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Taff Vale Shopping Centre was removed as part of plans to build three office buildings.
The site, now owned by Rhondda Cynon Taf council, will house offices for Transport for Wales and Pontypridd library.
The centre was partially torn-down in 2011, but plans halted in 2012 after the developer went into receivership.
Demolition works restarted in January, after the council took ownership of the site in 2015.
Plans for the site include office buildings to house the One4All centre and fitness hub, with a walkway linking Taff Street to the river.
Construction will begin in November, with the redevelopment scheduled to finish in May 2019.
