[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seventy-one women who received colposcopies (cervical examinations) at Antrim Area Hospital are being told they may have been discharged early and will require a follow up smear test.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A colposcopy is a procedure to find out whether there are abnormal cells on or in a woman's cervix or vagina.
The women are being contacted on Tuesday.
The Northern Health and Social Care Trust said it was "very much a precautionary measure".
Dr Ken Lowry, medical director of the Northern Trust said: "Any woman who has not heard directly from us by tomorrow [Wednesday] should be reassured and need take no action.
"I understand this may cause some anxiety however I would like to emphasise that this is a precautionary measure designed to reassure women who use our services.
"We have also established an advice line which will be opened on Tuesday 9 June from 5.00pm - 11.00pm. The advice line will remain open Monday to Friday from 9.00am - 5.00pm until Tuesday 16 June. The advice line number is 028 9442 4804."
