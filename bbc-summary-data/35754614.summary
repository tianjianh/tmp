There are 11 categories - all but one of which has been divided into two groups who will play a round-robin to decide the two finalists.
The female veterans will compete in one group of six in Sheffield.
BBC Sport's Jess Creighton conducted the draws with the assistance of a former QPR, West Ham, Manchester City and Cardiff player Trevor Sinclair.
You can find the under-14, under-16, pan-disability, adult male and females, walking football and male veterans draws below.
