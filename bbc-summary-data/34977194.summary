Clandon Park: Earl's plea over 'mock-Georgian replica' fear

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 8th Earl of Onslow wants plans to rebuild his fire-ravaged ancestral home shelved, claiming it will be turned into a "mock-Georgian monolith".

The 18th Century Clandon Park House, in Surrey, was reduced to a shell by a major blaze in April.
Rupert Onslow said the Â£65m restoration cost would be best spent on at risk National Trust (NT) properties.
The NT said it was exploring "various options" for the Grade-I listed house, but it did have a future.
The Palladian mansion, near Guildford, was bequeathed to the NT in 1956.
Lord Onslow told BBC Surrey it should be allowed to go to ruin.
"The tragedy is that the house has gone. It's happened, Clandon has been lost," he said.
"My question, which I think is best answered by the members, is what would they wish to have done with the insurance money?
"Do the [NT] members want to see what would be a suburban mock-Georgian monolith sitting on a small garden?
"Or would they like to see restoration of a building of historic genuine nature that is in danger of collapsing?"
He added: "I will never forget seeing orange fire in 44 windows on four floors of that house.
"It's not because I didn't love Clandon it's just that I don't think the [NT] members would genuinely benefit from a replica.
"I think it should be shorn up and left as a tragic sad site. I look forward not backwards."
An NT spokeswoman said they had been "overwhelmed by the public's response since the fire".
"It has reinforced just what a special place it is to so many people," she said.
"We want to reassure all those people who love Clandon Park that it does have a future. We have already said that it will be rebuilt in some shape or form. We are currently looking carefully at various options for the house."
Investigators said the fire that swept through the building, which housed a collection of furniture, porcelain and textiles, was probably caused by an electrical fault.
Staff were able to get out of the house safely and no-one was injured. A salvage plan helped to save contents and fire detection systems operated as they should have done, the spokeswoman said.
