The SAG awards are often seen as key indicators for the Oscars.

Showbusiness satire Birdman has the most nominations with four. Coming-of-age drama Boyhood, The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game have three nominations each.

Cumberbatch's Imitation Game co-star Keira Knightley receives a best supporting actress nomination along with Patricia Arquette (Boyhood), Emma Stone (Birdman), Meryl Streep (Into the Woods) and Naomi Watts (St Vincent).
The best supporting actor shortlist consists of Robert Duvall (The Judge), Ethan Hawke (Boyhood), Edward Norton (Birdman), Mark Ruffalo (Foxcatcher) and JK Simmons (Whiplash).
The awards, which are voted for by more than 100,000 actors, feature five film categories and eight TV categories.
