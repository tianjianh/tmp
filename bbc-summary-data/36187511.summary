PSV Eindhoven snatched the Dutch league title from Ajax on a dramatic final day of the season.

The teams went into the last day level on points, with Ajax in control by virtue of having a six-goal advantage in goal difference.
But the Amsterdam side could only draw 1-1 with lowly De Graafschap to open the door to their rivals.
PSV took advantage, as two Luuk de Jong goals and one from Jurgen Locadia gave them a 3-1 win at PEC Zwolle.
Victory gave PSV, who like their title rivals lost just twice in the Eredivisie this season, their 23rd league title.
Frank de Boer was attempting to become the first Ajax coach to lead the club to five domestic titles, a 34th in total and a fifth in six seasons.
And things looked to be going to plan when Amin Younes gave Ajax a half-time lead.
But a superb strike from Bryan Smeets, only his second goal of the season, seemed to unnerve the visitors.
And De Graafschap, who finished second from bottom and will enter the relegation play-off, held out for the point that allowed Phillip Cocu's PSV to retain the title.
In scoring twice for the champions, captain De Jong became the first PSV player to score more than 25 league goals in a season since former Chelsea striker Mateja Kezman in 2002-03.
PSV Eindhoven coach Phillip Cocu: "My philosophy is always to remain positive, even if we weren't in the best situation.
"We only had a really slim chance, but a very slim chance is still a chance, isn't it?
"De Graafschap played a big role in our title today. We're grateful for that."
