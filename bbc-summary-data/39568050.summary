George Anderson, 27, attacked the three-year-old after her mother invited him to a party at her home in Torquay.
Anderson told the girl he was a doctor and when challenged by her mother said he had gone to check on her as she was crying, Exeter Crown Court heard.
Anderson, of no fixed address, was jailed after admitting 10 charges including rape of a child.
The child's mother said her daughter had "lost all her innocence".

The court heard Anderson returned to the girl's bedroom seven times throughout the night to abuse her, filming it on his mobile phone.
He admitted the rape of a child, two assaults of a child under 13 by penetration, six counts of taking indecent pictures of a child and one of making indecent pictures of a child.
Paul Dentith, for the defence, said Anderson was "depressed" at the time and had downloaded 300 indecent images of children.
Sentencing Anderson to a total of 19 years and four months, Mr Justice Dingemans said: "You committed a number of extremely serious assaults on a three-year-old child who was asleep in her bedroom upstairs."
He said it would have a lifelong effect on her.
Anderson worked at Torbay Hospital, but has since been dismissed, and also suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
Devon Partnership NHS Trust Chief Executive Melanie Walker said there was no evidence people in Anderson's care were at risk during the period in which he worked there.
The girl's mother said she did not think she would ever be able to trust another man.
The woman said in a victim impact statement that the rape of her daughter had affected "every aspect" of her life.
She said she could not bear to dress or undress her daughter, give her a bath, or take photos of her.
"I feel completely paranoid that anything I do, such as touching her when she is naked will be viewed as inappropriate," she said.
"It feels like all the innocence that she once had has now been lost."
