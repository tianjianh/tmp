Disability benefits: Court to rule on delay test case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The High Court is expected to rule later on whether the government took too long to process benefit claims by two disabled people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed pair waited nine months for Personal Independence Payments (PIPs), and they say this left them dependent on loan sharks and food banks.
They claim the delay was unlawful.
During the test case, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) argued that it took prompt action when delays in processing claims were identified.
Labour and several charities have criticised the government for the way it handled the switchover to PIPs, which began replacing Disability Living Allowance in 2013.
At least 4,500 people have waited more than a year to have their claims processed, and tens of thousands more have waited more than 20 weeks.
The claimants in the test case said delays meant they struggled to pay for food and fuel, and this caused their health to decline.
Their lawyers said they had a right to the benefits and should have received them within a "reasonable time".
One of the claimants, who suffers from ME and severe depression, said she was "completely isolated" during her wait for payments.
The DWP argued the delays were unacceptable but not unlawful, and said more than 800 extra staff were assigned to work on PIPs after problems emerged.
Contractors processing claims also increased their staffing and made other improvements, it added.
PIPs are benefit payments to help people aged 16-64 with "some of the extra costs caused by long-term ill-health or a disability".
They are available to employed and unemployed people, and claimants can receive Â£21.80 to Â£139.75 a week, depending on how their condition affects them.
This is determined by an assessment, and claimants are regularly reassessed - though there have been claims of people being wrongly assessed as fit to work.
From April 2013, PIPs began replacing Disability Living Allowance.
This process is ongoing and the government says everyone who needs to switch to PIPs should have been contacted by late 2017.
