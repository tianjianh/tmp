Jamie Fullarton has been sacked by League Two side Notts County after just 70 days as manager at Meadow Lane.

The 41-year-old's 12-game spell in charge was brought to an end following Saturday's 4-1 home loss to Exeter, which left Notts 19th in the table.
Notts have taken just one point from a possible 15 at home and won three games since Fullarton replaced Ricardo Moniz.
The Magpies, who are up for sale, are expected to appoint a successor as early as Sunday.
Fullarton's departure comes a day after Notts County owner Ray Trew agreed a deal to sell the club to an American company.
The former Bolton Under-21 coach's departure from his first managerial job came just hours after fans held protests calling for his sacking.
Since Fullarton took charge, Trew has stepped down as chairman and put the club on the market, while chief executive Julian Winter resigned earlier this month.
"While it is well known that my position at the club has changed in recent weeks, I still have a responsibility to do what I feel is best for Notts County and that means acting when things aren't going right on the pitch," Trew told the club website.
"I have to thank Jamie for his efforts over the past few weeks because he has had to face an incredibly difficult atmosphere, somewhat unfairly I feel.
"He has maintained an exceptional level of professionalism throughout and should be applauded for how he has conducted himself."
The Magpies, relegated from League One last season, have failed to win at Meadow Lane in seven games, dating back to their 4-3 triumph over Newport County on 12 December.
