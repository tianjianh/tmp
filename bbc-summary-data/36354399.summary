[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy will miss England's friendly against Australia on Friday - because he is getting married just two days before.

The 29-year-old postponed his wedding last year and then moved it from June so he could play at Euro 2016.
England manager Roy Hodgson said Vardy "deserves" time off to get married.
Vardy, who scored the winner as England beat Turkey 2-1 on Sunday, said: "The boss has given me Wednesday off but I'll be back training after that."
Listen to the goals from England's win over Turkey.
Hodgson added: "I don't think his place in the team or the squad at the moment is under enormous threat and we do have other players that we need to look at."
Vardy, who scored 24 Premier League goals to help Leicester win the title, started the victory over Turkey at Etihad Stadium on the left of a front three.
He later moved into the centre and scored the winner after Tottenham striker Harry Kane had given England an early lead.
England face Australia at Sunderland's Stadium of Light in the second of two warm-up games for the European Championships in France.
England also face Portugal at Wembley on 2 June but Hodgson must cut his preliminary squad of 26 by three before the 31 May deadline.
Players from Manchester United and Liverpool will join the squad on Monday.
United were in FA Cup final action on Saturday, while Liverpool had played and lost in the Europa League final on Wednesday.
Marcus Rashford, United's 18-year-old striker, impressed in the FA Cup win against Crystal Palace but suffered a knee problem.
"We believe it is not a serious injury but he obviously took a nasty knock and we'll have to wait and see how he turns up," said Hodgson.
