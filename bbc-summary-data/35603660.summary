A walker who broke his spine and shattered both legs after falling on Holy Island has thanked the Great North Air Ambulance who flew him to hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Chadwick, 47, from Marton, Middlesbrough, fell from Lime Kilns last May.
He spent several weeks in hospital and had to wear a frame around his body for more than five months.
Mr Chadwick, a father-of-two, said it was like the "cavalry had arrived" when the air ambulance came.
He was anesthetised once aboard the helicopter and taken to Newcastle's Riyal Victoria Infirmary.
He was then transferred to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough after seven days.
Mr Chadwick said: "I'm still recovering now. My injuries are life-changing but it certainly isn't the end of the world.
"It has made me realise that you need to seize the moment as you never know what is around the corner."
