More than 1,000 photos can be seen on a new website produced by the Bodleian Libraries in the University of Oxford.
It aims to bring together the complete works of the Victorian photographer Fox Talbot.
Prof Larry J Schaaf, project director, said there had been "nothing like this before in the history of photography".
The Talbot Catalogue Raisonne marks the anniversary of Fox Talbot's birthday, which was 11 February 1800.
Hailed as the British father of photography Fox Talbot took the first photographic negative from a window at his home in Lacock, Wiltshire, in 1835.
Born in Melbury Abbas, Dorset, in 1800, Fox Talbot established the three primary elements of the photographic process: developing, fixing, and printing using paper coated with silver iodide.
During his career he created more than 4,500 images - about 25,000 of his original negatives and prints are thought to still exist.
The Bodleian spent two years raising Â£2.1m needed to buy the private collection of photos, letters and diaries.
The catalogue of early Victorian photographic images is expected to grow to 25,000 images by 2018.
