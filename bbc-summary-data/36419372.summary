The family of former England, West Brom and Notts County striker Jeff Astle has campaigned for research since he died from brain trauma in 2002.
A coroner described his illness as an "industrial disease", in reference to him heading leather balls.
The FA said it was working with the Professional Footballers' Association to secure funding for the research.
It said it had been in talks with organisations, including Fifa, since 2014 but wanted to press on with the research and it had "now been agreed that solely UK-based research could give us an opportunity to work with other sports".
The possible dangers of heading footballs, especially older heavier designs, was brought to light following the death of Mr Astle aged 59 in 2002.
Earlier this year it was also revealed three members of England's 1966 World Cup squad had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Mr Astle's daughter, Dawn, who set up the Justice for Jeff campaign group in 2014, said families of other players and football supporters had been in touch about other potential cases and she was unhappy about the delay in starting the research.
"This could be the most important research the game has ever done so it's ridiculous that they can't just get on with it," she said.
"It's a shocking failure and disrespectful to the families of players who are living with dementia, stripped of their dignity."
Dr Michael Grey, from the University of Birmingham, said football authorities "should be leading the way" in commissioning more independent research.
"This important issue has a dearth of good science and a great deal of unfounded opinion," he said.
