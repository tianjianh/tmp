Portsmouth 4-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth recorded a second successive four-goal victory as they took another step in gaining promotion to League One by dismantling Grimsby at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kyle Bennett, Danny Rose and Carl Baker scored first-half goals before Kal Naismith added a fourth shortly after the interval.
Pompey find themselves just four points shy of second placed Plymouth following a third straight win.
The home side took the lead after 12 minutes when Bennett struck a shot from outside the area, which took a heavy deflection as it looped over visiting goalkeeper James McKeown.
Their lead doubled midway through the first half when Gareth Evans' pass was dummied by Bennett, leaving Rose to find the net with a deflected strike from distance.
Pompey added another goal on the stroke of half-time when Evans and Baker linked up down the right before the midfielder smashed his effort into the roof of the net.
Less than a minute into the second half the home side got their fourth after McKeown could only parry Baker's long-range shot into the path of Naismith, who made no mistakes completing the rout.
