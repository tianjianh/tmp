[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Doughty earned a draw against Millwall in Swindon's first game since Luke Williams was named manager.

Midfielder Doughty stabbed home in the 94th minute after Millwall failed to clear a free-kick.
Lee Gregory burst through the defence to score his 22nd goal of the season and poor defending allowed Steve Morison to make it 2-0 to Millwall.
But Nicky Ajose's penalty, after Raphael Rossi Branco was fouled, set up Doughty's dramatic finish.
Millwall remain fifth and have gone five games without defeat, while Swindon - whose unbeaten run now stands at six league games - drop to 14th.
Williams signed a five-year contract in midweek after a successful spell as caretaker boss.
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"Huge frustration, I'm certainly disappointed with the outcome. I thought we were so good for so long with and without the ball.
"I thought we were outstanding in the first half and I think in the second half even though Swindon had all the football. On the counterattack we were really good, we just lacked that little bit of quality and ruthlessness in the final third.
"If you don't see the game off - and it's a very dubious penalty against you, about the softest penalty I've seen for a long time - you're backs-to-the-wall a little bit."
