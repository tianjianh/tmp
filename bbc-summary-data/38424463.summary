[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 3-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town deservedly ended 2016 with a home victory after seeing off Barnet at Kenilworth Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were inches away from an early lead as Jordan Cook's effort deflected narrowly wide, while Barnet's Jack Taylor saw his volley stopped by Christian Walton.
The Hatters went ahead after 31 minutes when Alan Sheehan curled a stunning free kick into the top corner from 25 yards out.
However, Barnet levelled six minutes later when Taylor's cross-shot was nodded home by Bira Dembele with the home defence screaming for offside.
Danny Hylton went close to a second twice before the break, his fierce effort requiring a sharp stop from Jamie Stephens, and then hooking just over, while Cameron McGeehan scooped off target from a yard out.
In the second period, Jonathan Smith only just missed the bottom corner, before two goals in the space of seven minutes gave Luton complete control.
McGeehan notched his 11th of the season with a wonderful volley four minutes after the restart, before Alex Gilliead rifled home from 25 yards on 56 minutes to make it 3-1.
Barnet tried to mount a comeback as Michael Nelson headed just over and Sam Muggleton's free-kick went close, but the Hatters held on.
