The Indian firm, which uses a digital platform to provide information, opened an office in Edinburgh this year.
It now plans to invest a further $1m (Â£595,000) in Scotland.
The investment includes hiring between 25 and 30 people in the two Scottish cities over the next year.
Zomato provides an online and mobile service offering restaurant and nightlife information, including menus and photographs.
In November it extended its web and app presence to Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Zomato is also active in London, Manchester, Birmingham and 40 other cities around the world.
Tony Marsden, business lead for Zomato in Scotland, said: "Edinburgh and Glasgow were the obvious choices for expansion in the UK after London, because there is such a diverse and independent food culture here.
"The abundance of local talent has helped us ramp up the team on-ground in a relatively short time-span with the right skills, knowledge and attitude.
"We've also found the Scottish food and drink industry incredibly welcoming, from restaurants to well-informed consumers, and we look forward to building on this exciting start."
Rooma Kumar Bussi, from Scottish Development International, India, said: "I am delighted to see Zomato setting up their presence in Scotland and hope to see them grow in a country that is so passionate about food.
"The food and drink industry is worth over Â£13bn annually to the Scottish economy and holds immense potential for business.
"I am sure Zomato will benefit from Scotland's vibrant industry sectors, its talent pool and business-friendly environment."
