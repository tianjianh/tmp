More than 120 jobs could be at risk after an aviation firm announced plans to close its Flintshire branch.

Marshall Aviation Services will enter a 45-day consultation with its Broughton workforce.
Unite Wales said it would mean the "virtual eradication" of the aircraft maintenance sector in north Wales.
The company blamed the possible closure on "significant losses" in business and said it would support workers through the consultation.
It said the process did not impact on its other businesses in Cambridge, Kirkbymoorside, Brize Norton and Birmingham.
A Unite spokesman said the union would work with its members and the company in an effort to save the business.
