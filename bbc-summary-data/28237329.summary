Canadian pop star Justin Bieber has pleaded no contest to misdemeanour vandalism in connection with the egging of his neighbour's home and has been sentenced to two years' probation.

California's court also ordered him to pay $80,900 (Â£47,160) in damages, serve five days of community service and complete an anger management programme.
Bieber, 20, was not present in court for the sentencing.
The singer faces two other criminal cases in Florida and Toronto.
"Justin is glad to get this matter resolved and behind him," Bieber's representatives said in a statement after the verdict by Los Angeles Superior Court in Van Nuys.
"He will continue to move forward focusing on his career and his music."
Investigators searched Bieber's Calabasas home in California in January for evidence after the egging apparently caused serious damage.
One of the singer's friends was arrested on drug possession charges after that search.
The LA County Sheriff's Office say they were looking for surveillance video tapes when they spotted the drugs "in plain view".
Surveillance footage seized from the home appears to show Bieber high-fiving friends and celebrating after throwing eggs at his neighbour's home, police said.
The pop star could have faced a more serious felony charge if the damage to the home had been greater than $20,000.
He has since moved out of Calabasas to Beverly Hills.
Two previous investigations into Bieber's conduct by the sheriff's department did not lead to charges.
Prosecutors declined to charge him last year after a neighbour complained he drove recklessly through the area, and in November 2012 after a paparazzi photographer accused Bieber of assault.
He was arrested by police in Miami in January and charged with driving under the influence and driving without a valid licence and Toronto prosecutors have accused Bieber of assaulting a limousine driver in December.
