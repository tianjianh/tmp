The 20-year-old, who has yet to appear for the Blues' first team, spent time on loan at League One side Gillingham this term, playing 15 matches.
While with the Gills, the England Under-20 international played at Plymouth's Home Park in the League Cup.
He joins a side currently third in League Two, six points above fourth-placed Portsmouth.
Before the signing, Pilgrims manager Derek Adams said he was working hard to bolster his squad with loan players.
The Pilgrims have lost striker Ryan Brunt for the rest of the season after a cruciate knee ligament injury, while Jordon Forster is still recovering from the head injury he sustained at Barnet.
"We're working away, we're trying to get some loan players in," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"I'm sure we'll have them in before the end of the transfer window."
Football League clubs have until 24 March to add loan players to their squads - the final time they will be able to do so before rules change in the summer to prevent emergency loans.
