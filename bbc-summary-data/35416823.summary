Lucy Hill, 21, from Bury, Greater Manchester, broke her pelvis when her moped was in collision with a car in Chiang Mai on 9 January.
People queued up to donate the relatively rare A negative blood after a social media appeal went viral.
Ms Hill is expected to return home soon, said her aunt, Sue Raleigh.
The Leeds Beckett University graduate is learning to walk with crutches and should be well enough to travel home in about two weeks, Ms Raleigh said.
"She's still over there with her mum, and she's taking a couple of steps in the morning and a couple in the afternoon," she said.
"She'll be able to walk again, but it's going to take a lot of work, and a lot of physio. She's had titanium plates put in her pelvis.
"She has no memory of the accident. She's just been in shock.
"The first thing she was very distraught about was realising her hair had been shaved."
Family and friends of Ms Hill posted a plea on the Trip Advisor website after the hospital ran out of supplies of the blood.
Fewer than 1% of Thai people have negative blood types.
The appeal was shared 40,000 times within six hours, with hundreds of messages from people trying to help.
Her family later said they were "overwhelmed" by the support and thanked people for their generosity.
Ms Hill went on to have several blood transfusions and operations.
