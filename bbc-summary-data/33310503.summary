The wager on Murray - the competition's 5/2 second favourite, behind Novak Djokovic - would net a £175,000 return, including the stake.
Ladbrokes believes it to be the largest tennis bet ever placed in Scotland.
The company's Alex Donohue said: "Our Murray fan in Aberdeen has given his hero the ultimate vote of confidence with this record-breaking bet."
Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion in 2013 when he beat Djokovic in the final.
The British number one is due to get his campaign under way against Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan on Tuesday.
