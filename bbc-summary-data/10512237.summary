A planning application for the proposed "Waking the Dragon" tower has been submitted to Wrexham council.

If approved, the figure would stand approximately 210ft (64m) high on land at Chirk Park.
The Frank Wingett Cancer Appeal is behind the idea and the charity claims the dragon and visitor centre could raise Â£1m a year and create 70 jobs.
The application will go out to public consultation and it is hoped a decision will be made by autumn 2010.
Wrexham council is in the process of considering transferring land it owns to allow the dragon to be built.
Chief planning officer Lawrence Isted said: "The application will now go out to formal public consultation for one month and depending on the outcome of that consultation it will be reported to planning committee for decision in the Autumn."
The 25m (82ft) bronze dragon sculpture would top a new 40m (131ft) building in Wrexham with a visitor centre.
Council leader Aled Roberts has previously said he believes the sculpture would "strengthen and develop" tourism.
