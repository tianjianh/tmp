[SN]TITLE[SN]
RMT to name Doncaster education centre after Bob Crow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trade union education centre in South Yorkshire is to be renamed in memory of former rail union leader Bob Crow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) died in March aged 52. He led the union from 2002 until his death.
The Â£1.5m Doncaster National Education Centre, in Thorne Road, is used to train workplace representatives as well as regional and national officers.
The RMT said renaming the centre would be "a fitting and lasting tribute".
Mick Cash, who succeeded Mr Crow as RMT boss, said: "With Bob Crow as general secretary our education centre in Doncaster grew into a full residential college educating and training up hundreds of our activists and building a strong, member-led union that has proved its resilience despite the shock of Bob's tragic death earlier this year.
"The union believes that it will be a fitting and lasting tribute to rename the Doncaster National Education Centre after Bob Crow and that plan will come to fruition in 2015 with the support of Bob's family."
