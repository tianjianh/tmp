The two companies said the projects offered "an unrivalled decommissioning solution."
ANSS handles waste materials from North Sea oil and gas exploration, production and decommissioning.
Its managing director, Simon Gibb said: "We are delighted to be working with the Port of Dundee to provide onshore disposal and waste management services for decommissioning projects at this excellent facility.
"This is fully in line with our strategy of providing complete waste services for the North Sea and follows successful completion of our first decommissioning projects in 2016."
Forth Ports chief executive Charles Hammond said: "This new waste management facility, coupled with our multi-million-pound investment in a new quayside, is important for the port which is ideally placed to service the immediate needs of the North Sea oil and gas decommissioning sector."
