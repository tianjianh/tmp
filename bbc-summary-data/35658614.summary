The company said the service would operate six times a week, with limited single fares starting at Â£19.99.
The announcement marks the first non-chartered international route from Dundee Airport.
Dundee computer gaming entrepreneur Chris van der Kuyl said the new service was a "game-changer" for the city.
The service will offer outbound and return flights on weekdays and Sunday.
It is the third route Flybe has announced under the UK government's Â£7m regional air connectivity fund.
UK Aviation Minister Robert Goodwill said: "It is fantastic to see Flybe launch this new service between Dundee and Amsterdam, giving the Scottish city its first international route.
"Our smaller airports are vital engines for local economies, connecting the UK and overseas destinations and opening up opportunities."
Chris van der Kuyl, founder of 4J Studios, said: "I'm delighted to hear that Dundee's first connection to a global hub airport is to go ahead.
"A direct flight to Amsterdam will be a game-changer for the city and sends a strong message that Dundee is open for business worldwide."
Inglis Lyon, managing director of Dundee Airport operator HIAL, said: "The new route offers business and leisure travellers fast, convenient links to hundreds of destinations worldwide and, crucially, creates new opportunities for inward investment and inbound tourism at an exciting time for the city."
