An estimated 330lbs (150kg) of what is believed to be mephedrone and amphetamine were found hidden in a flat in Garston, south Liverpool, on Friday.
Officers were led to the flat in Lowbridge Court after Merseyside Police followed a car to a tyre fitting yard.
Five men have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences.
Titan, the regional organised crime unit in north-west England, said the Ford Fiesta was tailed to a unit on the Huyton Industrial Estate in Huyton.
About 24,000 ecstasy tablets, 9lbs (4kg) of amphetamine and 2lbs (1kg) of cocaine was seized - some of which were hidden within a tyre.
Further enquiries led detectives to the flat, where the huge find was discovered.
The arrested men, aged between 22 and 44, are in police custody for questioning.
