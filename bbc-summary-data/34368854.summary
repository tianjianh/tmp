[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former US president Bill Clinton has offered to help in attempts to resolve the Stormont political crisis, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kenny said Mr Clinton "expressed his continued interest in wanting to assist the process in Northern Ireland", Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ reported.
Northern Ireland's political parties have been holding round-table talks.
It follows a row sparked by a police assessment that IRA members were involved in murdering a former IRA man.
In the wake of the killing of Kevin McGuigan Sr, police said the IRA still existed, but added that it was not engaged in terrorism.
Three Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers subsequently resigned from Northern Ireland's ruling executive, and Peter Robinson, the party's leader, stepped aside as first minister.
Speaking after meeting Mr Clinton in New York, Mr Kenny said the former US president told him he was "interested in helping in any way" he could.
Mr Clinton has previously described working on the Northern Ireland peace process as one of the "great honours" of his life.
The Taoiseach said Mr Clinton had expressed concern at the "fragility and the difficulty that the talks have entered at the moment".
Mr Kenny said Mr Clinton remained available "in any event that assistance were to be required or appropriate".
Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said on Thursday that this week's talks had been "useful and intensive".
Ms Villiers said the talks would resume on Monday to "discuss the impact of continued paramilitary activity".
