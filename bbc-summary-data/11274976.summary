The soldier, from 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was shot in southern Afghanistan on 23 August.
The 22-year-old, from Bolton, died in hospital on Friday.
Kingsman Deady's family, who were with him when he died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, said he fought to make a difference.
The death brought the total number of British military personnel killed in Afghanistan since the conflict began to 335.
Kingsman Deady joined the army in 2008 and was based in Cyprus before he was sent to Afghanistan.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said he was helping to protect a "vital location" in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand when his unit came under "prolonged, intense small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire".
Kingsman Deady was fatally wounded and given first aid by comrades which kept him alive, the MoD said.
His family were present when he died.
They said in a statement: "Darren was proud to do a job that he loved and most of all believed in.
"His little brother once turned round to him and asked him, 'Why do you fight?'
"Darren simply replied, 'To make a difference'."
The statement concluded: "There is only one thing left to say now - please don't forget him."
Lt Col Robbie Boyd, his commanding officer, said: "Kingsman Darren Deady was a tiny man with the heart of a lion.
"No one in my battalion was as good or as accurate with a grenade launcher - he fired it time and again on two separate tours to protect the team he was ferociously loyal to."
Captain Bowden Williams added: "Kingsman Deady was an old fashioned Kingsman - wiry, tough, humorous, never afraid to voice his opinion.
"Above all this he was loyal to his friends not only in camp, but also on the battlefield where he ultimately gave his life for them."
Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: "I was deeply saddened to learn about the death of Kingsman Darren Deady, who was fatally wounded doing his duty while bringing security and stability to the people of Nahr-e Saraj.
"He was an able and dedicated soldier, who displayed strength, courage and leadership."
