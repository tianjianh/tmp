Brian Little: Jersey manager to discuss future in role with island's FA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brian Little will discuss his future as Jersey manager with the island Football Association in the next few weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Aston Villa and Leicester City boss hinted he may quit management after leading Jersey to victory over Guernsey in May's Muratti Vase final.
Little, 62, will not be in charge of the island side when they host Scottish League Two club Clyde in a friendly.
Barry Ferguson's side will face Jersey on 25 June at St Brelade as part of a five-day training camp on the island.
The home side will be managed by Little's assistants Martin Cassidy and Paddy O'Toole.
Little was appointed as Jersey's director of football in November 2014 and stepped in to manage the side in January after his predecessor Jimmy Reilly left because of work commitments.
However, he is currently working as an advisor to Aston Villa following their relegation to the Championship, and also has television commitments in Ireland.
