[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuttgart, the 2007 Bundesliga champions, lost 3-1 on the final day at Wolfsburg to go down.
Bremen, who could have been relegated, scored a late winner to beat fellow strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 and secure safety.
Eintracht finished 16th and face a promotion-relegation play-off with Nurnberg, third in the second tier.
Relegated in 1975, Stuttgart secured promotion back to the top flight in 1977.
