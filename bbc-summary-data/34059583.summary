Britain's Mo Farah was almost pushed over on the final bend of his 5,000m heat but qualified for Saturday's World Championships final in Beijing.

Farah, who claimed his sixth successive global title when he won 10,000m gold at the weekend, recovered to finish second in 13 minutes 19.44 seconds.
The defending champion, 32, was touched on the back by Canada's Mohammed Ahmed but just managed to stay on his feet.
Fellow Briton Tom Farrell came fourth in his heat to reach the final.
Ahmed finished third but was initially disqualified by officials, only to be reinstated after a protest.
Ethiopia's Yomif Kejelcha, who has the world leading time this year, finished ahead of Farah in 13:19.38.
"I'm lucky I stayed up. I almost went down again," Farah, who also nearly fell midway through the race, told BBC Sport.
"At that point you have to stay on your feet, concentrate and relax."
Farah added he had been suffering from a sore right foot, but said "it's nothing to worry about".
He had endured agony in the same stadium seven years ago, crashing out of the Olympics after failing to qualify from the heats of the 5,000m.
But he is now one race away from securing a third consecutive double, after taking 5,000m and 10,000m gold at London 2012 and the 2013 World Championships in Moscow.
He looked to have recovered well from Saturday's victory in humid conditions, when he also survived a near-fall, as he was forced to work hard amid a packed bunch of runners in the final 150m of a quick heat.
Carlisle's Farrell, 24, progressed to the 15-man final with a time of 13:45.29 in a much slower-paced first heat.
"I think I did what I'm capable of doing - it's another thing coming here and doing it. I'm really happy to make the final," he said.

Britain's Sophie Hitchon will be in Thursday's hammer throw final, qualifying in fifth position with a throw of 71.07m.
In the women's 800m heats, Britons Lynsey Sharp, Shelayna Oskan-Clarke and Jenny Meadows all successfully progressed to Thursday's semi-finals.
Sharp, who registered a season's best of 1:58.98, and Oskan-Clarke both qualified automatically, while Meadows required a fastest loser slot.
Lawrence Clarke completed a clean sweep of British qualifications in the morning session, as his time of 13.61 seconds in the 110m hurdles was enough to put him through to Thursday's semi-finals as one of the four quickest losers.
