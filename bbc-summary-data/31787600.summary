The boys were in a vehicle on Saturday afternoon with two other 14-year-olds who suffered life-threatening injuries.
They were being driven by a 21-year-old man who police think picked up the boys without their parents' permission.
Police said the car had overtaken another vehicle before crashing on Gelderd Road in Morley at 13:50 GMT.
West Yorkshire Police said the two injured 14-year-old boys remained in hospital in a critical condition on Sunday morning.
Supt Sam Millar, of Leeds Police, said: "This is a terrible tragedy for two young boys who had their whole lives ahead of them.
"Specially trained officers are currently investigating the exact circumstances of the incident and helping the families in what is a terrible time for them.
"The two boys were from the local area and attended Bruntcliffe School and the Morley Academy and we are also supporting those schools at this difficult time."
West Yorkshire Police have appealed for any witnesses to how the car, a blue Peugeot, was being driven before the incident.
Supt Millar added: "It is thought that a 21-year-old man picked the four boys up from their homes without the permission of their parents.
"A blue coloured Peugeot was being driven along the road in the direction of Gildersome when the car left the road and collided with a tree.
"No other vehicles are believed to have been involved in the incident although it is thought the car overtook another vehicle at speed during the incident.
"The driver also remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Officers are appealing for anyone who saw the movements of the vehicle that day to come forward, especially at the Tesco Express store in Churwell."
Any witnesses are asked to contact the Major Collision and Inquiry Team on 101.
Supt Millar said: "One of the passengers, a 13-year-old boy was killed instantly and one of the other boys in the vehicle subsequently died in hospital last night.
"Two other boys travelling in that vehicle remain critically ill in hospital.
"This is an absolute tragedy for these boys, their families and for the community and for our local community schools.
"What I would like to highlight was that several members of the public who stepped in and helped at the scene of this accident.
"As you can imagine it must have been one of the most horrendous scenes to come across and yet members of the public gave immediate support and first aid to these boys.
"Their actions yesterday are absolutely commendable."
