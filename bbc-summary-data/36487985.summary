The Commonwealth Games silver medallist suffered head injuries in a motorbike accident in Vietnam on 10 May.
She has been woken from an induced coma and has been showing small signs of recovery in a hospital in Thailand.
Her younger sister, Stacey, told the BBC that she was awaiting news that she is to be flown home.
Their parents, Robert and Alison, are at the hospital in Bangkok where Stephanie is receiving treatment. The family is from Daviot, near Inverness.
Stacey told the BBC she has held off flying to Bangkok because of an expectation Stephanie could soon return to Scotland.
She said her sister's condition had gradually been improving from an initial assessment of having a 1% chance of surviving her injuries.
Stacey said: "The signs showing in the last couple of days are of huge progress. We hope and pray that positive news keep coming, though we try not to get overly excited.
"Both her eyes are nearly now open wide."
She said Stephanie had been able to hold Robert's hand and medical staff were working on getting her limbs and body moving.
Stephanie, 27, had been in Vietnam for four months teaching English to underprivileged children when the accident happened.
It is understood that a long skirt she was wearing, and which she had tied up for the bike journey, became unravelled and caught in the wheel of the motorbike, pulling her off the machine and on to the road.
