Contractors have begun work at the site of a controversial oil well in County Antrim.

On Monday, workers began felling trees at Woodburn Forest near Carrickfergus.
The site clearance work comes ahead of a planned exploratory oil well which is due to start drilling in coming weeks.
The plan is being opposed by environmentalists because the ground is within the catchment of a reservoir that supplies water to thousands of homes.
NI Water, which has leased the site to the oil company, says it is happy the project does not pose a risk to the water supply.
Last week there was a stand off between police and protesters over access to the site.
Opponents believe chemicals used in the drilling process risk leaching into the ground water.
The oil company, Infrastrata, released a statement setting out the protection measures it would take.
These included plans to collect and dispose of all surface water and measures to protect the drill shaft during the exploratory drilling.
