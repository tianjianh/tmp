[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shops were boarded-up and roads closed in Llangefni before a march by about 40 members of the "Infidels of North Wales" group at 13:30 GMT on Saturday.
About 300 people also attended the town as part of the opposing "Celebrating Diversity" group's counter protest.
North Wales Police said officers were present to ensure "the safety of the public" and there were no arrests.
