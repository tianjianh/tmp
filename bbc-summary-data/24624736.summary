The 29-year-old is the latest player to pledge his future to Ulster after Ruan Pienaar, Nick Williams and Robbie Diack all signed contract extensions.
"I am delighted to have committed to Ulster for the long term," said Henry.
"It is a great team to be a part of, and there is no doubt when it comes to winning silverware, we have some unfinished business."
Henry, who has won eight caps for Ireland as well as playing 109 times for Ulster, is hoping to win a trophy with the province after defeats in the Heineken Cup final and Pro12 final in the past two seasons.
He is also targeting a place in Joe Schmidt's Ireland squad for the World Cup in 2015.
"In my opinion, being at Ulster gives me the best chance to fulfil that ambition," he said.
"This squad is getting better and better.
"We have experience as well as young players coming through, who are proving that they can perform at the very highest level."
Ulster's Director of Rugby David Humphreys said: "Chris has been a cornerstone of our success in recent years".
"His performance against Montpellier typified what he brings to the Ulster team, namely commitment, intensity and ferocity at the breakdown.
"It would be hard to find anyone who is more passionate about playing for Ulster than Chris Henry and I am extremely pleased he will be part of the squad until at least 2017."
