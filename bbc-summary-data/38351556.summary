Brian Croxton, 77, died in hospital after the incident outside the Brass Band Club in Royton, Oldham, on the night of 8 December.
The 23-year-old is also accused of failing to stop and failing to report a collision.
She was released on bail, police said.
Paying tribute to Mr Croxton, his family said he was president of the club for more than 10 years and "his life revolved" around it.
Sgt Lee Westhead, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "We made an arrest yesterday in the Royton area and have also seized a car for forensic examination.
"The investigation is still very much ongoing and my team is still keen to speak to people who were on Sandy Lane on the night of the collision, or anyone with any information."
