Sex game gas mask death: Kevin Adams guilty of manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man whose sexual partner died after he left him tied up with a gas mask on his face has been found guilty of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dohoon Kim, 36, was found dead on the bedroom floor after meeting friend Kevin Adams, 52, at Mr Adams' home in Swindon for sex in June 2015.
Bristol Crown Court heard the pair had taken drugs before engaging in "extreme" sexual activity.
Adams was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.
The court heard Mr Adams, of Exmouth Street, Swindon, met Mr Kim on a dating website two years earlier.
In the early hours of 12 June, Mr Adams called 999 saying Mr Kim, from Slough, Berkshire, was unresponsive and not breathing.
When paramedics arrived, they found Mr Kim had been dead for some time with a gas mask to one side of him and a pile of ropes and restraints nearby.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Kim had an "excessive" level of mephedrone - sometimes known as M-Cat - in his body.
It was concluded he died from a combination of the restriction of his airways and the effect of the drugs both he and Adams had taken.
The jury decided Adams had failed to remove the gas mask or restraints or check the condition of Mr Kim, who was left lying on the floor, before he went to sleep.
Adams will be sentenced on Monday.
