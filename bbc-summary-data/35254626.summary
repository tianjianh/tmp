St Peter's C of E Primary in Bristol wins literacy award

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A primary school in Bristol has been named the UK's Literacy School of the Year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Peter's Church of England Primary was chosen by the UK Literacy Association (UKLA) which aims to raise standards in literacy.
Head teacher Livvy Sinclair-Gieben said the "recognition meant a lot" and it "felt very prestigious".
UKLA assessors said they had been "impressed" by the staff who ensured no child "slipped through the net".
The school, rated by Ofsted as outstanding, is located in Bishopsworth, an area with high social deprivation, and has almost 400 pupils.
Ms Sinclair-Gieben said: "We've spent a lot of time and money investing in having a class library in every classroom and the children help and select the books.
"There's enough books for the children to have one in school, one at home and a different book every day of the year."
She said the school believed all children needed to be able to read "with a fair degree of fluency" by the age of six.
She added they had a support programme called Reading Recovery which started in year one and gave those who needed it 100 one-to-one lessons.
