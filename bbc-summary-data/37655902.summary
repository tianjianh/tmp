Two men who stabbed a taxi driver and forced him to hand over his takings have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Newlands, 28, was sentenced to eight years in prison and his co-accused Michael McKenzie, 26, to six years and 10 months.
Both men were also ordered to be monitored in the community for two years after their release.
They were convicted after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow of stabbing Taroon Miankhail on the head and body.
They robbed the driver of Â£60 at Startpoint Street, Glasgow, on 15 October 2015.
The pair were also found guilty of assaulting another taxi driver by presenting a knife at him hours earlier at Cruachan Road, Glasgow.
Judge Lord Ericht said: "You have been convicted of assault with a knife on a private taxi driver and later that day a second driver sustained knife wounds.
"You have an appalling record for crimes of violence and knife crime."
