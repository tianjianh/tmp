Elite League leaders Cardiff Devils went seven points clear at the top of the table after Sunday's 2-1 home win over bottom side Edinburgh Capitals.

That followed Saturday's 3-0 win at Nottingham Panthers, as the Welsh side bid for their first Elite League title.
Luke Piggott opened the scoring for Cardiff against Edinburgh, but Brandon Thompson levelled for the Capitals.
Andrew Hotham struck the Devils' winner in the middle period, as they spurned several chances to add further goals.
Devils' bid for the league crown was also boosted as second-placed Braehead Clan lost to Fife on Sunday.
Guillaume Doucet, Jake Morisette and Leigh Salters scored the Devils' goals against Nottingham, all assisted by Joey Martin, against the Panthers on Saturday, while netminder Ben Downs made 32 saves.
The league's leading scorer, Doucet, also scored four times in the midweek victory over Dundee Stars.
