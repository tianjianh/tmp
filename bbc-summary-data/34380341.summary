A production line at Deeside's Shotton steelworks is being mothballed which could affect 40 jobs, a union has said.

One of Tata's two galvanised steel lines could be closed from the end of October or November, according to Keith Jordan from the Community union.
The company said the line could be restarted in better market conditions.
Last month, Tata announced it was mothballing part of its plant in Newport for the third time in six years with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
Mr Jordan said it was hoped many of the Shotton workers will be moved to the second line, which produces 350,000 tonnes of steel per year or 7,000 tonnes per week.
The Shotton site is part of Tata Steel Colors which produces metallic and paint coated products for the construction industry and domestic appliances.
A company spokesman said: "We continue to be in discussions with employees, their representatives and the employers of contractors and agency staff about possible implications for employment levels.
"Every effort will be made to redeploy any affected employees within the business."
