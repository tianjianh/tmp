The 26-year-old Swede, who has played 25 times for the Championship promotion chasers, will undergo surgery on his left knee.
He suffered the injury in Saturday's 1-0 loss to Ipswich.
"The feeling for this type of injury is around the nine months mark to get back," said Hornets head of medical Richard Collinge.
