Shaun Barker: Former Derby County defender joins Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Burton have signed former Derby defender Shaun Barker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barker has not played competitively since dislocating his knee and rupturing ligaments in March 2012.
The 33-year-old, released by Derby in 2015, was captain at the Rams under now Burton boss Nigel Clough.
Barker told the club website: "If it doesn't happen now I will have to put my hands up and walk away. I don't like being defeated and I hope this year that I get back out there."
Meanwhile the Brewers have also signed attacking midfielder Will Miller on loan from Premier League side Tottenham.
Miller, 20, has signed a deal until the start of January.
