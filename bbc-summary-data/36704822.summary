[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The company behind plans to build a new nuclear power plant on Anglesey has started an investigation of the seabed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Horizon Nuclear Power said the work will give it a better understanding of the geological conditions offshore from the proposed Wylfa Newydd site.
Samples will be taken from the seabed and coastline throughout July and August.
The company claims the Â£8bn plant will employ 1,000 people once it begins working in the first half of the 2020s.
Site Development Director Charlie Tasker said: "Although we'll be working 24 hours a day, we'll ensure the work doesn't cause any inconvenience to local people or tourists by keeping lighting and noise to an absolute minimum.
"We'll be keeping a distance of more than 800 metres from the Cemlyn Bay nature reserve at all times."
