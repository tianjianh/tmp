In race one Turkington held fourth place in the early stages, despite running with a misfire issue which had hampered him in qualifying, behind Scottish teenager Aiden Moffatt as a queue of drivers formed behind.
Sutton managed to get past Turkington with a move at the Island Bend, before contact with Moffatt resulted in a drop of power in his BMW which resulted in the 35-year-old crossing the line in 29th place.
In race two, Turkington made stellar progress through the pack, sneaking into the points despite starting in 28th.
The race ended in messy fashions as Senna Proctor pushed Turkington into Jeff Smith, spinning Smith's Honda around at the final corner.

In the support series, Dan Harper had a difficult weekend as he bogged down from the front row at the start of the first Ginetta Junior race, resulting in the Hillsborough teenager getting launched into the air after he was pinned between two other cars with Harper having to pit with damage.
