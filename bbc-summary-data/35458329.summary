The woman was stopped near St Albans after driving "for miles" on three tyres and one wheel.
Officers said she "had no idea that she'd lost the tyre and thought her car had broken down".
"[The] discs were glowing bright red when stopped", they wrote on Twitter. She was later found to be almost three times over the legal alcohol limit.
Hertfordshire Police said a 46-year-old woman from Barnet was arrested for failing to provide a breath specimen, and was in police custody.
The woman initially failed to give a breath test at the side of the road, officers from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire road policing unit said.
