The bodies were found at 16:30 BST on Monday, following a search on the island on Lough Sheelin.
It is believed they may be the bodies of Eoin O'Connor, 32, and Anthony Keegan, 33, from Coolock, Dublin, who were last seen in Cavan on 22 April.

A car belonging to one of the men was discovered near a lake in County Westmeath, three days after they were last seen.
On Monday, two bodies were found on the island. Both appeared to have been tied up and were under tarpaulin that had been covered with vegetation.
A house by the lough's shore has also been cordoned off for a forensic examination.
While Irish police have not confirmed the identities of the bodies, the families of Mr O'Connor and Mr Keegan have been informed of developments
GardaÃ­ appealed to anyone with information, particularly those from the boating community on Lough Sheelin, or anyone who may have been on the lough between 22 April and 26 May, to contact them.
