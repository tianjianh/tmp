Andrew Timblin, 60, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, was found guilty of committing 11 offences including rape, sexual assault and actual bodily harm.
Police said he "brutally attacked" his first victim when she was 17 and the abuse continued for six years.
In 2014, he raped a girl of 14 three times "to satisfy his own sickening urges".
Timblin, who denied all the charges, was jailed at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
Judge Jeffrey Lewis branded him "depraved" as he passed sentence.
Police said Timblin, of Greenhill Street, would viciously beat and injure his first victim if she tried to put up any resistance.
Ten years after losing contact with her, he targeted the second girl.
Police said on three occasions he overpowered and brutally raped her despite her pleas with him to stop.
Det Insp Gina Brennand of Greater Manchester Police said: "Timblin is a vile character who preyed on two vulnerable people and brutally attacked them to satisfy his own sickening urges.
"His actions were nothing short of evil and it brings me and the investigation team great satisfaction to be able to say that he has now been brought to justice and given a sentence that reflects his depravity."
She praised the courage of the victims in coming forward.
"Although what he did to his victims will stay with them for the rest of their lives, I hope that the result here today will bring them some sort of comfort to know that they have helped take a violent predator off the streets," she said.
