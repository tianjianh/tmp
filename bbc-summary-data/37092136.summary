The front page of the Scottish edition of The Times features a photograph of gold-medal winning horsewoman Charlotte Dujardin, but it splashes with the death of former footballer Dalian Atkinson. The paper said he was the third person to die after being shot by a Taser this year.
The same story features prominently in the Scottish Sun, which claims police shot the ex-Premier League star with a stun gun three times.
Meanwhile, The Scotsman reports that the future of the Kinloss army barracks has been "thrown into doubt" amid claims it was among military bases being considered for closure.
Research that claims pregnant woman who take paracetamol are more likely to have children with behavioural problems features on the front page of the Scottish Daily Mail.
The Herald leads with claims that children's charity ChildLine is receiving an increased number of calls about explicit images.
The Press and Journal's Aberdeen edition reports that a toddler was taken to the city's children's hospital amid fears she had swallowed cocaine.
And the front page story in The National reports that destitute asylum seekers are being told that their children can only be accommodated if they are taken into care.
