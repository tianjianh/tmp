Sven-Goran Eriksson: Shenzhen FC appoint ex-England boss as manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed manager of Chinese second tier club Shenzhen FC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 68-year-old Swede will replace former Netherlands midfielder Clarence Seedorf, who took over in July but failed to win promotion.
Eriksson, who managed England between 2001 and 2006, left Chinese Super League team Shanghai SIPG in November after two years in charge.
He was succeeded by former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas.
Shenzhen said they appointed Eriksson for his "rich coaching experience, advanced football philosophy and intimate knowledge of Chinese football".
