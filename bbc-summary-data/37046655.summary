[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James King took seven devices from his school, St Peter's CofE Primary in Swinton, Greater Manchester, between September 2014 and March 2015.
A teacher misconduct panel ruled he had committed a "serious breach of trust".
King, 43, who received a 12-week suspended jail term in October after admitting theft and fraud, can apply to be reinstated after five years.
He admitted stealing four iPad Airs and three Asus Netbooks and pawning them for Â£1,620.
The teacher also admitted pretending to be the landlord of the flat he was renting and taking deposits from prospective tenants.
The panel said King had deprived pupils of equipment needed for their learning and the offences were "premeditated, systematic and repeated".
Confirming the panel's recommendation, Education Secretary Justine Greening said: "This is a serious case but the panel noted Mr King has made full admissions and demonstrated some remorse."
She added the onus would be on King to prove he was fit to return to teaching after five years.
The Diocese of Manchester said it would not be commenting on the case.
