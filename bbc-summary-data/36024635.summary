A stop at Dalcross close to the airport has been a long standing aspiration of the group, which promotes improvements to public transport.
Hitrans has proposed constructing the station on the Inverness to Aberdeen line at a cost of Â£2m.
It could be open in 2018, if planning permission and funding are secured.
Hitrans said it could become the second busiest station in the Highlands after Inverness.
As well as people travelling to the airport, the group believes the station would be used by residents of a new village being built at Tornagrain.
