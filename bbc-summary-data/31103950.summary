[SN]TITLE[SN]
Comical, tedious, important: Election 2015 in a word

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You'd put your mum in power over Cameron. You want a revolution. And you think we're doomed?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We invited 12 people aged 18 to 24 to the Radio 1 Live Lounge to talk about the big issues facing the country ahead of the general election in May.
Some said they intend to vote, others won't. A few are vowing to spoil their ballot papers.
All had strong opinions about the problems in the UK and what politicians should be doing to get them interested.
Owen, 18, from Gloucester
I will vote.
The big issue for me is tuition fees. I'd like to see them drop because they are so expensive. The problem is how can it be paid for? The NHS needs to be prioritised as well.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: David Beckham
Sophie, 19, from Surrey
I will vote.
The big issue for me is a strong economy, so that means there will be enough taxation to fund extra spending on education and welfare.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Day to day people, not professional politicians
Rob, 21, from Dover
I will vote.
The big issue for me is the economy. The economy was really bad, it has been improving but it needs to get better. At the same time the NHS needs to be protected.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Anyone but Russell Brand
Nick, 21, from Tamworth
I will vote.
The big issue for me is immigration. Mass immigration needs to be controlled. I'll vote for a party that deals with immigration - there are too many sponges.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: David Beckham
Michael, 23, from south London
I won't vote.
The big issue for me is the lack of representation. I don't believe politicians represent me or engage with young people. There are no concrete youth policies from the established parties
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: People should spoil their ballot papers to show that established politicians don't represent young people
Reece, 20, from Somerset
I will vote.
The big issue for me is taxation. I think people are too highly taxed and that there should be less state interference.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Lee Evans
Helen, 20, from Henley-on-Thames
I will vote.
The big issue for me is taxation. I think variable tax levels aren't an effective way to raise money. I want a flat tax rate for everyone, but where those on the minimum wage don't pay.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Myleene Klass
Robyn, 21, from Cwmbran
I won't vote.
The big issue for me is bad politicians. I don't believe the government in Westminster does anything for people my age.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Barack Obama
Elizabeth, 22, from London
I will vote.
The big issue for me is the cost of living. Politicians need to make it more affordable to buy a house. Prices are out of control. Rental prices are too high as well.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Hillary Clinton
Thomas, 26, from Newport
I won't vote.
The big issue for me is a lack of policies. Some policies appeal, but not enough for me to back on political party in Westminster.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Shane Williams
Chloe, 20, from Rugby
I plan to spoil my ballot.
The big issue for me is benefits and the NHS. I believe people on benefits need better protection and that there needs to be more money pumped into the NHS.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: my mum
Jordan, 20, from Manchester
I won't vote.
The big issue for me is the "system". I don't believe in mainstream politics. The main problems are systemic, so we need to look at the system itself. We need a revolution which we can't achieve through voting.
Someone I'd vote for who's not a politician in the UK: Jacques Fresco / Russell Brand
