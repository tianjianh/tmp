Pinder, who was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court, was in the Horseshoe Arms last September when security staff asked everyone to leave at closing time.
He threw a bottle at full force, hitting the other man as he stood up to leave, causing a deep gash on the back of his head, police said.
He was celebrating with his girlfriend after just being told he was in remission from acute myeloid leukaemia.
Pinder's image was circulated and he was identified.
