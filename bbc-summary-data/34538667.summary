[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kosovo tear gas: MPs stage protest in parliament again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opposition MPs have let off tear gas in Kosovo's parliament - a week after a previous such protest in the chamber.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Opposition lawmakers are angry at a deal with Serbia which grants more autonomy to Serb-majority areas.
MP Albin Kurti was arrested after last week's tear gas protest - his arrest triggered violent protests in the capital Pristina.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians broke away from Serbia in an armed revolt in 1999, then declared independence in 2008.
Most Western countries recognise Kosovo, but Serbia and Russia do not.
MPs opposed to the deal, and another with Montenegro over borders, have said they will disrupt parliament until they are rescinded.
