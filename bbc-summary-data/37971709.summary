The letter emphasises the bonds of friendship and economic ties between Scotland and the United States.
Ms Sturgeon also stresses shared values of "equality, tolerance, diversity and human rights for all regardless of race, faith, gender or sexual orientation".
She says she hopes to see such values flourish during Mr Trump's presidency.
On this basis, Ms Sturgeon wishes Mr Trump success in the coming years, the letter says.
Nicola Sturgeon's letter to Donald Trump
Dear President-Elect Trump
I am writing to convey my congratulations on your election as the 45th President of the United States of America.
As you know from your family ties, the USA was shaped by some of Scotland's finest thinkers, and many people of Scottish descent contributed to the transformation of your country into the global power it is today.
These bonds of family and friendship, and our close economic ties, mean that the USA is one of Scotland's most valued partners, as well as our most important international export market and source of inward investment. I hope that these ties can be strengthened in the years ahead.
As you acknowledged in your victory speech, the election campaign was a divisive one. I was therefore encouraged to hear you pledge to be a President for all of America, and to seek to work with others to unify your country.
Our nations share fundamental values of equality, tolerance, diversity and human rights for all regardless of race, faith, gender or sexual orientation, and I hope we will see these values flourish during your Presidency.
On that basis, I wish you success as you prepare to take on the responsibilities of office, and in the years ahead.
Ms Sturgeon had backed Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House but has said she will engage "positively and constructively" with Mr Trump.
The SNP leader has, however, insisted she will "not maintain a diplomatic silence" in the face of "abhorrent comments".
Last year the first minister stripped Mr Trump of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland, after he suggested Muslims should be banned from entering the United States.
But former SNP MSP Chic Brodie has criticised the first minister's approach to Mr Trump, claiming she had not handled the issue particularly well.
The former West of Scotland MSP, who has met Mr Trump several times, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that he believed Ms Sturgeon should have raised her concerns with the tycoon face-to-face when he visited his Trump Turnberry golf resort earlier this year instead of "sniping from the sidelines".
He added: "You can't complain about President Obama getting involved in the independence campaign and in turn get involved in a vastly different election campaign than we are normally used to.
"I think it would have been better to have turned up and tried to have that conversation."
