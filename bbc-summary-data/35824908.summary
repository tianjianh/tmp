Sale Sharks are in discussions to sign Wigan Warriors winger Josh Charnley in a cross-code move.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old is out of contract at Wigan at the end of the season and has been in talks with Sale for some time, BBC Radio Manchester understands.
The winger has made 144 appearances for Wigan since 2010 and has turned out nine times for England.
Meanwhile, Sale wing Tom Arscott will miss the rest of the Premiership season with a knee injury.
