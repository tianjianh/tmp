Nicola Sturgeon urges unity on austerity fight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged all parties in the Scottish Parliament to come together to fight the UK government's proposed cuts.

Her call came the day after it was announced Scotland would face a £176.8m cut in public spending this year.
Chancellor George Osborne announced a £3bn cut in UK departmental budgets for 2015/16 and the knock-on for Scotland.
In a letter to the four opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon said the parties "must speak with a united voice".
The letter was sent to Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Scottish Green Patrick Harvie.
It said: "I hope that you will agree with me that all parties in Scotland must unite in making clear to the UK government that it is unacceptable for reductions to be imposed on this year's Scottish Budget.
"Not only do such reductions have a potentially damaging impact on our programmes and public services, but the chancellor's approach shows little respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament itself in approving the annual devolved Scottish Budget."
Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to argue for an alternative to the UK government's austerity programme.
This would involve a "moderate increase" in public spending of 0.5% a year in real terms between 2016-17 and 2019-20, she said.
Mr Osborne made his cuts announcement ahead of his emergency budget, which will take place on 8 July.
The Tory chancellor said he believed it was vital to tackle UK debt "as quickly as possible".
The UK government has pledged to clear the deficit by 2018/19.
Mr Osborne must find a further £30bn of savings over the next three years, including £12bn from welfare spending and £13bn from government departments.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: "Nicola Sturgeon doesn't seem to understand that if Britain is going to prosper for the long-term, it needs to pay its way in the world and no longer pass on multi-billion pound deficits for our children and grand-children to pay off."
He added: "The truth is that the time when the SNP could resort to its age-old tactic of whipping up grievance over UK government decisions is over.
"Tax-raising powers are coming to the Scottish Parliament, so if it wants to act, it can."
Mr Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said he opposed the UK government cuts but "the Tories are unlikely to listen".
He said: "The real challenge will be to achieve unity in the Scottish Parliament to use our own devolved power to achieve fairer taxation and protection of the public services we all depend on."
