[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Londonderry mother-of-three has appeared in court on charges linked to the discovery of a cannabis factory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julie Ruth Wilson, 38, of Larch Road in Dungiven, faces seven charges, including the cultivation of 347 cannabis plants.
The plants, with an estimated street value of £250,000, were found in Dungiven on Saturday.
A judge at Londonderry magistrates' court refused Ms Wilson's application for bail.
The defendant also faces charges of possessing the cannabis, possessing it with intent to supply, and being concerned in supplying the cannabis.
The other charges against her are of dishonestly using electricity, falsely claiming housing benefits and with being concerned in offering to supply speed.
A police officer told the court that Ms Wilson has 22 previous convictions, 12 of them for drugs offences, several of which were for cultivating and supplying cannabis.
He said other people were still being sought by police in relation to the discovery.
He added that the main witness in the case was the defendant's landlord, and he believed that if the she was released on bail the defendant would attempt to interfere with prosecution witnesses.
The judge remanded Ms Wilson in custody pending a future high court bail application.
