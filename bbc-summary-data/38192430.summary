Peterborough United 5-2 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Play-off contenders Peterborough brought Chesterfield's revival to a halt with a home victory on an afternoon of spectacular goals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posh hit the front after just 25 seconds as Tom Nichols steered in a Paul Taylor cut-back, but they found themselves trailing to two deflected goals in quick succession.
Goalkeeper Luke McGee was wrong-footed as Ched Evans levelled in the 22nd minute before Liam O'Neil looped in his first Spireites goal from 25 yards.
Posh ace Gwion Edwards produced a stunning equaliser on the stroke of half-time when darting inside and launching a long-range blast past Ryan Fulton.
They restored their advantage in similarly classy style nine minutes into the second period when Taylor exchanged passes with Nichols before slamming home a first-time shot from just outside the box.
The same two men tormented Chesterfield again 10 minutes later with Taylor releasing top-scorer Nichols to bag his eighth of the season.
Michael Bostwick completed a rampant second-half showing from Posh with a typically thunderous blast from 20 yards with eight minutes to go.
Chesterfield's misery was compounded when defender Lawrence Maguire was carried off on a stretcher.
