The 21-year-old has made 25 appearances since joining on a one-year deal in June 2016 after leaving Barnsley.
Maris missed three months with an ankle injury, but has helped the U's rise to two points off the play-off places.
"He possesses good technical ability and the capability to play in a variety of attacking positions," said U's head of football operations Ben Strang.
