Bale's Real Madrid side face Atletico Madrid in the final of the Champions League on 28 May when Wales will be preparing in Portugal.
Chris Coleman's team play their opening European championship game against Slovakia on 11 June.
"From a selfish point of view it would be nice to have him there, but we're all happy for him," said Williams.
"I think for us it doesn't really matter because hopefully they win and he's come in on a high.
"He'll still be sharp and match fit. It would have been nice to have him with us, that's a good reason to miss the training camp."
Bale's deflected shot saw Real beat Manchester City 1-0 in Wednesday's second leg of their Champions Cup semi-final.
The forward scored in Real's 2014 final win against Atletico to clinch the club's 10th European Cup.
The two arch rivals will now meet again in this season's final on 28 May.
Wales have qualified for the finals of a major championship for the first time since the 1958 World Cup, with Bale scoring seven of their 11 goals in the qualifying campaign.
And with the championship so close, Williams admits he will have his heart in his mouth when he watches Bale in the final.
"To be honest I've been like that whenever I've watched him recently," he admitted.
"As soon as we qualified everyone had in the back of their mind they didn't want to miss it with injury and there was still a lot of football to be played.
"He has to go out do his best and try and win one of the biggest games in world football.
"I'm sure he'll look after himself."
