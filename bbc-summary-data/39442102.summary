Warrants were carried out at addresses in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on Tuesday before further arrests were made on Wednesday.
The men were arrested on suspicion of rape and other offences relating to three females between 2008 and 2015.
Eight of the men - seven from Banbury and one from Birmingham - appeared before Oxford magistrates earlier.
They are Leon Cole, 19; Atiq Hussain, 23; Qamran Hafiz, 24; Abdul Sarfraz, 31; Nasser Younis, 37; Tafail Mohammed, 23, and Marcelo Suarez, 20, all from Banbury, and Ahsan Raza, aged 19, from Birmingham.
They were remanded in custody and are due to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 25 April.
Two other men, Amir Arfi, aged 23, of no fixed abode and Atique Akhtar, aged 23, of no fixed abode, will appear at Oxford Magistrates' Court on 2 May.
Det Supt Paul Hayles, of Thames Valley Police, called it a "complex investigation into non-recent child sexual exploitation" in the town.
The raids are part of what the police are calling Operation Nautical.
