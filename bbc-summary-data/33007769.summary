Spain fugitive Sean Heiss sentenced for mother's murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who strangled his mother before fleeing to Spain, where he murdered another woman in a knife attack, has been given a life sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Heiss, from Surbiton, south London, killed Margaret Sheehy, 58, at her home in Kingston in June 2012.
Three months later, he nearly beheaded Clementina Liscano in Barcelona.
Heiss admitted killing Ms Sheehy, but denied murder on grounds of diminished responsibility. He must serve at least 27 years and three months in jail.
Judge Gerald Gordon sentenced Heiss at the Old Bailey after a jury convicted him by a majority of 10 to one on Wednesday.
The court had heard Ms Sheehy considered selling her flat and using some of the proceeds to help pay off her son's debts, but had then changed her plans.
But Judge Gordon ruled out greed as the motive for her murder and said: "In my view the cause of the killing that night was anger."
Heiss had quit his job and was Â£200 overdrawn in one bank account when he throttled Ms Sheehy on 11 June 2012.
He then stole her bank cards and escaped by Eurostar to Paris, travelling from there to Spain.
In October, he was arrested by Spanish police for stabbing Ms Liscano to death after she disturbed him while he slept rough by a cash machine.
Heiss, 30, who had suffered from psychotic illness in the past, did not dispute that he killed his mother but denied murdering her on grounds of diminished responsibility.
He was sentenced to 22 years in jail for the Spanish murder and extradited to the UK for murdering his mother.
Judge Gordon said Heiss' life sentence would run alongside any outstanding sentence for Ms Liscano's murder.
