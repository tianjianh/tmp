The reboot of the classic Rudyard Kipling adaptation has reaped $684.8m (£468.5m) globally since its release last month.
The Huntsman: Winter's War managed takings of only $9.4m (£6.4m) in its second week of release.
Feline action comedy Keanu took third slot with a modest $9.35m (£6.39m).
Comedy Mother's Day had a weak debut, with takings of $8.3m (£5.6m), despite featuring stars including Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson.
All eyes are on the release of Captain America: Civil War, which opens next week in the US and has already done good business elsewhere.
Civil War opened in 37 territories over the weekend, taking in an estimated $200.2m (£136.9m).
That included record openings in Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines for the film which many believe could be this year's biggest hit.
