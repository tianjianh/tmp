CCTV footage released by Manchester City Council, shows a woman bending down to read messages at the memorial in St Peter's Square.
She then walks over and kicks several wreaths, which commemorate the Battle of the Somme, and leaves with a friend.
A woman, in her 20s, has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated criminal damage, police said.
It is the second time the landmark has been targeted by vandals in weeks.
A man was fined Â£90 after he was caught on CCTV kicking one of the wreaths in July.
Another man was caught on CCTV urinating at the same memorial in February.
