Two masked men robbed the store at Largy Road, Ahoghill, on 26 November.
Police said they had released the video of the young women's "extremely frightening ordeal" in an attempt to identify the men.
A detective said that while the men's faces were covered, "their height and shape might be familiar to someone".
"Also, their gait, stance and movements may provide a further clue as to their identity," said DCI Catherine Magee.
She said anyone who had information but was reluctant to contact police should watch the footage.
"These criminals were quite prepared to use violence and highly threatening behaviour to get their hands on till money," she said.
"It is important that we keep people safe by bringing them before the courts."
