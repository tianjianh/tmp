Hurst, 41, had been linked with Notts County despite leading The Mariners back to the Football League for the first time in six years.
He is currently preparing the squad to face FC Halifax Town in the FA Trophy final on Sunday.
"I genuinely have no other offers out there to even be in consideration," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"There is nothing to tempt me. I've had a chat with the board, I've got a rough idea of what we're about and then set about building a squad that we can still be proud of.
"It's got to be a realistic target that we set and I'm sure at some point we'll nail that down."
Hurst joined Town in 2011, taking over as sole manager in 2013 after Rob Scott was sacked for gross misconduct.
Under his tenure Grimsby have reached four play-offs in the fifth tier, finally achieving promotion after beating Forest Green 3-1 on Sunday, but there has been some fan unrest over Grimsby's progress.
"I have said one or two things along the way which has been for the benefit of the players," Hurst added.
"Our best performances have always been when the crowds are behind us, which we had on Sunday."
