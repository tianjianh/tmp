'Interest' in Tullis paper-making firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Administrators appointed to a paper-making firm have said a number of parties have "expressed an interest in the business".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 325 employees lost their jobs when Tullis Russell Papermakers, based at Markinch in Fife, called in administrators last month.
A further 149 positions were said to be at risk.
More than 360 people attended a recruitment fair for Tullis workers on Wednesday.
The fair was organised by Pace, which comprises bodies including the Scottish government, Fife Council and the UK Department of Work and Pensions.
Joint administrators Blair Nimmo and Tony Friar of KPMG said that although interest had been expressed in the business, there remained a "number of challenges" to overcome.
The administrators said they had re-established contact with parties including other paper manufacturers and paper merchants across the world who had earlier declined the opportunity to buy the business.
They said they had also marketed it for sale to the wider investor community.
A deadline has now been set for bids after they received a number of "notes of interest from parties worldwide, both for the business and assets as a going concern and for individual assets or brand names".
KPMG said an information memorandum had now been issued to a small number of parties who have signed a Confidentiality Agreement.
Mr Nimmo said: "We have been contacted by a number of parties that have expressed an interest in the business, which reflects the company's long history, strong reputation for high quality products and the high regard in which it was held by its customers and within the industry.
"Nevertheless, there remain a number of challenges to overcome should a purchaser wish to acquire the business and assets and recommence paper manufacturing.
"We have set an initial closing date for indicative offers for the business and assets for 12pm on Monday 18 May, after which we will be better able to assess the level of interest. In the meantime, we would like to thank the company's staff for their ongoing assistance."
