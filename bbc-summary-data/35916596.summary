Charnley, 24, has helped Wigan win a Super League Grand Final and two Challenge Cups since joining in 2010.
"Josh is a great signing. Everyone I have spoken to rates him very highly," said director of rugby Steve Diamond.
Meanwhile, Wigan centre Dan Sarginson, 22, will join NRL side Gold Coast Titans next season.
Charnley, who has played seven times for England, scored a hat-trick in his most recent appearance for Warriors - Monday's 30-16 win over Hull KR.
He has scored 148 tries and kicked 94 goals in 152 games for last season's Super League grand finalists.
Diamond added: "He has explosive pace and can play either full-back or on the wing. The last big signing we made from Wigan, back in 2000, was Jason Robinson and what an impact he had."
Wigan tried to keep both Charnley and Sarginson by offering them new deals, Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan said.
"We offered Josh a new long-term contract that would put him up there with the biggest earners at the club," he added.
"But having won so much at Wigan, he feels that the time is right to take on a new challenge."
Wigan coach Shaun Wane said he will have "a heavy heart" seeing Charnley leave, adding he was "sad" at Sarginson's impending departure.
Australia-born Sarginson, who has also played at full-back this season, joined Wigan from London Broncos in 2014.
"Dan has been open and clear that he wanted to see out his contract at Wigan before then taking on another challenge in the NRL or in rugby union," said Lenagan.
