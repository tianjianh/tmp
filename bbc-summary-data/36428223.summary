Bradley Long accused of £117,000 extortion plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is to stand trial accused of attempting to extort £117,000 from another man and threatening to reveal private information to his family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecutors allege Bradley Long threatened the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with violence and damage to his property.
Mr Long will stand trial at Forfar Sheriff Court later this year.
The charges are alleged to have taken place between May 2011 and June 2014, and October 2014 and March 2015.
Mr Long is also accused of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards the man, being in possession of cannabis when he was detained by police and being concerned in the supply of cocaine.
A further charge alleges that he failed to appear in court at a prior hearing of the case in February.
Mr Long, 30, of Eastbourne, Sussex, was not present at the pre-trial hearing over the charges.
Sheriff Pino di Emidio continued the case to a further hearing later in June and ordered Mr Long to appear on that date.
