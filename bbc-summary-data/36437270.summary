Julie's Greenroom will be aimed at preschool children and feature a cast of puppets learning about performing arts.
Netflix said it would be available on the streaming service worldwide in early 2017.
The show will feature celebrity cameos from Alec Baldwin, Sara Bareilles, Josh Groban and Idina Menzel.
Netflix said "Ms Julie" and her assistant Gus (Giullian Yao Gioiello) will bring the performing arts to a new generation of kids known as the Greenies.
Dame Julie said: "This project represents the fulfilment of a long held dream to educate children about the wonder of the arts."
The actress is best known for her roles in films including Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.
It is the second programme to be produced for Netflix by the Jim Henson Company.
Vocabulary building show Word Party is also being made available on the platform next month.
The series, which will have 26 short episodes, will follow four baby animals as they learn new words.
Netflix also announced a new children's animated original series Beat Bugs will be available from 3 August.
The show is inspired by the music of The Beatles and will feature appearances from Pink, James Bay, Regina Spektor and James Corden.
