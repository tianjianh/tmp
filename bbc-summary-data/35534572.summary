They might look cute and cuddly, but fat dogs, cats and rabbits are often unhealthy so overweight pets have been invited to sign up to a special pet fit club.

The animal charity the PDSA is running a six month diet and exercise plan to help pets slim down and teach their owners about feeding them well and keeping them active.
A third of all dogs and a quarter of cats are now classed as overweight or obese.
Pets are getting fatter than ever because they're being fed too many treats and leftover takeaways, according to the charity.
