Papua New Guinea crumbled to 53 all out as Scotland's 16-year-old leg-spinner Abtaha Maqsood (2-9) and 18-year-old seamer Kirstie Gordon (2-10) starred.
The Wildcats reached their target in 15.4 overs for the loss of two wickets, with Kari Anderson unbeaten on 24.
Bangladesh are Scotland's opposition on Sunday in their next Group A match.
Gordon told the Cricket Scotland website: "I'm really pleased with how I bowled. A really good first wicket and from then the wickets kept falling for the team.
"It is a massive game against Bangladesh. They are a full member, so we know they are going to be tougher opposition."
In Saturday's other Group A game, Bangladesh beat hosts Thailand, while in Group B, Ireland and Zimbabwe saw off the Netherlands and China respectively.
The top two teams in the eight-strong qualifying tournament will progress to next year's Women's World T20 in India.
