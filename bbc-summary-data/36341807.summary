The 27-year-old, who signed a one-year deal in 2015 after leaving Ross County, will stay at Argyle next term, whether or not they win the League Two play-off final against AFC Wimbledon on 30 May.
"I'm here next season," the Irishman told BBC Sport.
"There are a few of us that have played enough games to trigger an extension and I'm one of them."
Former Celtic youngster Carey has scored 12 goals for Plymouth in all competitions this season.
Carey delivered the corner from which Peter Hartley headed a stoppage-time winner against Portsmouth to win the League Two play-off semi-final on Sunday.
"It's good that that's not at the forefront of my mind and I can just focus on football," Carey added about his new deal.
"My intentions were to stay here next season no matter what, so hopefully it can be in League One.
"I think the foundations that the football club have and positive steps that we've made this season is building for a brighter future."
Carey was one of Plymouth boss Derek Adams first signings when he took over at Home Park last summer.
"He's brought goals to the team," Adams told BBC Sport. "I think that he's been able to contribute with a good number of assists this season and he has an excellent work rate as well."
