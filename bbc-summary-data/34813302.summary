A jury at Birmingham Crown Court has found two men not guilty of the abduction and murder of the 18-year-old, who went missing on 14 December 1991.
John and Marilyn Payne said they felt terrible guilt they had still not found their daughter and asked the public to come forward if they had any information which could help them lay her to rest.
