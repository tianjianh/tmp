Odds-on favourite Enable recorded her fourth successive Group One victory by winning the Yorkshire Oaks.

The filly led the one-mile-and-four-furlongs race at the Ebor Festival from the start and jockey Frankie Dettori guided her to a five-lengths win.
The 1-4 favourite finished in front of Coronet (16-1), with Queen's Trust (12-1) in third.
"If you try and keep up with her she'll break your lungs," Dettori told BBC Sport.
Trainer John Gosden says she will now to Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 1 October.
Dettori, who will be seeking his fifth Arc win, said: "She's easy for me to ride; great temperament, unbelievable stamina, uncomplicated, takes everything in her stride and I'm as impressed as you guys.
"She's top drawer, keeps on delivering and she's capturing people's imaginations."
And speaking to ITV, Gosden added: "There are some good fillies but she is special."

The way in which Frankie Dettori rode Enable - not arguing with her and letting her stride on - was a new tactic that was in theory potentially risky.
She was up in front, providing a target at which the others could aim, but as Dettori put it so well "she'll break [opponents'] lungs", in your language and mine "they didn't have a prayer".
What this victory - her fourth in an Oaks after Cheshire, Epsom and Ireland - demonstrates is that she does not appear to have any chinks in her armour. Wow.
