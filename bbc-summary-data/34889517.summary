[SN]TITLE[SN]
Windsor Legoland roadworks row road reopens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road near Legoland which sparked a row between two councils when it closed for roadworks has reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bracknell Forest Borough Council closed Winkfield Road, near the attraction in Windsor, for "essential" repairs on 10 November.
However, Windsor and Maidenhead council said it caused a "nightmare" for its neighbouring residents.
The road will now see three further weeks of work and temporary traffic lights.
Bracknell Forest Council said the road, between Squirrels Roundabout and the Legoland roundabout, reopened a day ahead of schedule.
It added the scheme aimed to prevent "a possible future collapse of the culvert retaining walls, which would have posed a significant safety risk and would have caused long-term traffic disruption".
The Windsor and Maidenhead authority had offered to contribute to the cost of the work, in a bid to speed up the scheme, but Bracknell Forest said it was too late to change the schedule.
