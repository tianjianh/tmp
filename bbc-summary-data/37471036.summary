The broadcasting watchdog said it had received 20 complaints about the housemate's remarks, aired on Channel 5 on 1 August.
The actor was removed from the Big Brother house a few days later.
The show's producers said they took the decision because he had made "comments capable of causing great offence".
During a conversation about homosexuality, the openly gay star had said: "The worst type though is, I'm afraid to say, the bisexuals... what it is is people not wanting to admit they are gay."
The 67-year-old was warned three times by Big Brother for comments which could cause "widespread offence".
The final one involved a conversation where he said Aids was "a bisexual disease".
After he was removed from the house, Biggins said he was he was "very sorry and very sad".
An Ofcom spokesperson said: "We're investigating whether a contestant's comments about bisexual people were offensive and breached generally accepted standards."
