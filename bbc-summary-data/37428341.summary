The 24-year-old centre-back had surgery on cartilage damage in February, but had another operation last week.
He has not played for the Shakers since the 0-0 draw at Coventry on 16 August.
Cameron recently signed a two-year contract extension with the League One side after reaching 100 appearances for the club at the end of last season.
