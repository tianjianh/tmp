The 27-year-old utility back moved from the Irish province to Welford Road in 2011 and scored 18 tries in 75 appearances for the Tigers.
Morris missed all of last season because of a serious foot injury.
"He brings experience to our back three, an area that's very competitive, and we look forward to seeing him play," said Leinster coach Leo Cullen.
"Niall was unlucky with injuries in his last season in England but has performed at a very high level for the Tigers in both the Premiership and in the Champions Cup."
The Dubliner, who has represented Ireland U20s and Emerging Ireland, scored the opening try as Leicester defeated Northampton in the 2012-2013 Premiership final at Twickenham.
"After five enjoyable years in England, I am delighted to return to my home province Leinster," said Morris, who extended his deal with Tigers in 2012.
"I know the club well and it has fantastic players, staff and supporters. It is one of the biggest clubs in Europe and I am very much looking forward to being part of such a great set-up again."
