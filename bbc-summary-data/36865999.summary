The pictures were taken at his home in Norfolk to celebrate the little prince turning three.
Photographer Matt Porteous took the shots in July at Anmer Hall.
The photos show George playing on a swing and eating ice cream on a picnic blanket with his cute dog Lupo, an English Cocker Spaniel.
A Kensington Palace spokesman said: "The Duke and Duchess hope that people will enjoy seeing these new photographs.
"They would like to thank everyone for all the lovely messages they have received as Prince George celebrates his third birthday."
