British Transplant Games: Torquay organ donation family at opening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family that has experienced both the joy of a life-giving organ donation and the loss of a child whose death meant others could live will open the British Transplant Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lottie Bryon-Edmond, from Torquay, was the youngest person to survive a liver transplant at just five weeks old.
When her half-brother Daniel, 25, died in a road crash earlier this year his organs were donated to five people.
A torch will be lit in his honour at the opening in Newcastle later.
Lottie's father Chris Bryon-Edmond said his stepson had left a "phenomenal legacy".
"There weren't words when Lottie got her transplant to express how we felt," he said.
He said there also were no words to describe how he and his wife Julie felt on hearing of the death of their son.
Mr Bryon-Edmond was driving with his wife when she heard of her son's crash and let out "a primal scream".
He said: "There is this phenomenal legacy where there are five people walking around who would not be walking around today."
The Bryon-Edmond family have campaigned to raise awareness of organ donation since Lottie's transplant.
They will light the torch at games, which run until 4 August.
The British Transplant Games were first held in 1978 and "aim to demonstrate the benefits of transplantation" while increasing public awareness.
More than 600 organ recipients will take part in more than 20 sporting events.
