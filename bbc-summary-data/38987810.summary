Exeter Chiefs lock Damian Welch has returned to Welsh region Cardiff Blues ahead of the 2017-18 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old worked with Blues coach Danny Wilson at Cardiff RFC and had been with the capital region until joining Scarlets in 2009.
After leaving Scarlets in 2012, Welch turned out 98 times for the Chiefs but will now return to the Arms Park.
"I'm looking forward to going back to a club which pretty much started my professional career," he said.
"It's great to be heading back and Danny [Wilson] had a big bearing. He was my coach at Cardiff RFC so I'm really excited about working with him again.
"Cardiff Blues are building an exciting and ambitious squad and I'm looking forward to getting back across the bridge to play my part in that."
Welch is the second signing in as many days for the Blues, after Welsh centre Jack Roberts joined from Leicester Tigers for next season.
"We're delighted to bring Damian on board for the 2017-18 season," Wilson said.
"He is a very athletic second row and a good lineout forward who has gained valuable experienced in the Aviva premiership since leaving Wales."
