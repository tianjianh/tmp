Centre Nick Grigg insists Glasgow Warriors are capable of extending their historic European campaign, and winning the Champions Cup.

The Warriors face defending champions and Aviva Premiership-winners Saracens at Allianz Park in their maiden quarter-final on Sunday.
"We're not wanting to stop there," said New Zealand-born Grigg.
"We want to go on to the final and win that - if we play well and everything goes to plan on the day, we can do it."
The powerful 24-year-old has been a shining light amid an inconsistent Pro12 season for Glasgow, making 12 league appearances and scoring three tries.
Grigg, eligible to represent Scotland via a grandparent, progressed through Scottish Rugby's academy system after earning a move from New Zealand by catching the eye of Warriors analyst Gavin Vaughan.
"I made a cringe highlight video from when I was playing club rugby back home," he said. "(Former All Blacks prop) Craig Dowd got hold of me and said, would he like me to send my CV overseas.
"He saw I had Scottish ancestry, so he sent it over here. Gav Vaughan saw the video, introduced it to (head coach) Gregor Townsend and I came for a trial - here I am.
"Last year, I got my debut, played one game for the team, and this year I've got more opportunities.
"Over the year, I've grown as a player in terms of coming up against top teams and seeing guys from back in New Zealand that were big names, professional rugby players, and I was playing club rugby, and now I'm coming up against them. I find it a great challenge; I love playing against them."
Glasgow reached the Champions Cup last eight for the first time after home and away pool victories over French champions Racing 92, and English heavyweights Leicester Tigers respectively.
The Warriors, who will be backed by over 5,500 travelling supporters, head to London after a vital bonus-point win over Connacht last Saturday.
"The Saracens team is full of stars, so I guess if you work harder than your opposite number, you're going to come out on top," added Grigg, who is among the substitutes for the Allianz Park showdown.
"We've spoken this week about the differences between Connacht and Saracens, how Connacht don't really kick the ball and Saracens kick it a lot. We've been going through how to beat that defence and those tactics.
"The Racing and Leicester games - I think it was the 'death pool' they called it - we came through and gained a lot of confidence, knowing if we put in the performances we can beat those sorts of teams."
