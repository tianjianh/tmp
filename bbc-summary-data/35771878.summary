Soldier Aled Jones's death: Family's long fight for answers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family claim they have yet to learn all the facts about their soldier son's death in 1996 in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An inquest concluded Trooper Aled Martin Jones, 18, from Chwilog, Gwynedd, took his own life with a gun wound to the head.
His family have always contested this and hope a new inquest into another soldier's death - granted after a 20-year-campaign - will help their quest.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said investigations were held at the time.
His mother, Elaine Higgins, has been speaking on BBC Radio Cymru programme Manylu as a fresh inquest continues into the death of Pte Cheryl James, one of four soldiers who died at Deepcut Barracks, Surrey, between 1995 and 2002, and follows a long campaign by her father.
Mrs Higgins said: "I hope the Deepcut families get the truth...  Maybe it'll open doors for other families."
Regarding her own son's death, she said: "I think that somebody somewhere knows exactly what happened that night."
Trooper Jones died three weeks after being deployed on tour in the Balkans with The Queen's Dragoon Guards.
Witnesses described him as being in a "jovial mood" while having a few drinks at the bar where his regiment were billeted on the night of his death.
He was said to have signed out his SA80 rifle at approximately 00:30. Then, 25 minutes later, fellow soldiers said they heard a gunshot and found him on a bed in an unused room with his rifle lying across his chest.
His death was investigated by the Royal Military Police, and the subsequent inquest, which used a Board of Inquiry report as its main evidence, recorded a verdict of suicide.
His family claimed the report contained inconsistencies which should have been investigated further, including witness statements which put their son in two places at the same time in the minutes leading up to his death.
They also said they were unable to question senior officers during the inquest or speak with soldiers who had been giving evidence, claiming they were "rushed from court into a car".
Pwllheli solicitor Michael Strain, who represented the family during the inquest in 1997, said: "We had been given a copy of the Board of Inquiry report the morning of the inquest and the only people available as factual witnesses were serving soldiers.
"If you wanted to ask anybody anything there wasn't access to witnesses, so you felt that if there was anything untoward or witnesses that had any contradictory accounts there wasn't an avenue for the family to make enquiries that may lead to a different conclusion."
The MoD responded to the family's concerns in 2003, saying the investigation was completed according to regulations and the satisfaction of the coroner.
It also said that any significant discrepancies in witness statements would have been challenged by the Royal Military Police at the time but that in this case they were "minor discrepancies arising from the inaccuracy of individual recall".
In a statement to Manylu, the MoD said: "The death of Trooper Aled Martin Jones on 18 July 1996 was investigated by the Royal Military Police and was the subject of a Board of Inquiry conducted by the Army.
"There was also a coroner's inquest which concluded that Trooper Jones committed suicide. Any questions about the conduct of the inquest should be referred to the coroner. Our thoughts remain with Trooper Jones' family."
