Marcia Shakespeare said it was a "bittersweet" honour after a "rollercoaster of emotions" in the years since daughter Letisha Shakespeare, 17, and best friend Charlene Ellis, 18, became the innocent victims of a drive-by shooting in Birmingham in the early hours of 2 January 2003.
Following the killings she has campaigned to rid the city of guns and says her reward is the young people who have turned around their lives.
