[SN]TITLE[SN]
War memorial in Gloucester given listed status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A war memorial in Gloucester has been given listed building status.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The monument, at the junction of Green Lane and Hucclecote Road in Hucclecote, was put up in 1920 as a tribute to local men killed in World War One.
It has been added to Historic England's list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest and is now Grade II listed.
It brings the total number of designated or listed buildings across Gloucester to 663, excluding churches.
During World War Two a bomb fell on the village, killing seven people, including several members of the same family.
These names are recorded on the memorial alongside servicemen who died in the war.
A Grade II listed building or structure is one that is of special interest, "warranting every effort to preserve it".
They make up about 94% of all listings in England and can not be demolished, altered or extended without permission.
