[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Hislop, 53, admitted abusing a boy and three girls at addresses in East Renfrewshire and Renfrewshire between 1977 and 2015.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that Hislop was investigated over abuse claims in 2004 but there was not enough evidence to prosecute him.
He will be monitored for 30 months after his release from prison.
Jailing him, Sheriff Seith Ireland told Hislop he had committed "serious sexual offences".
"I'm left with the opinion that no other disposal is appropriate other than a custodial sentence due to the gravity of the offences," the sheriff said.
"You remain and present a serious risk to the public because of your behaviour of offending in a sexual manner over a period of time."
Hislop pleaded guilty to four charges, one in relation to each of his victims.
The court heard that he abused his first victim between 1978 and 1980, when the boy was aged between eight and 10 and he was 16 or 17, at an address in Renfrew.
He abused his second victim on an occasion between 1977 and 1980, when she was asleep and was aged between 12 and 14, at the same address.
His third victim, who was aged about nine, was abused between 1994 and 1995 at another address in Renfrew.
The court heard the schoolgirl told a friend what had happened and wrote it in a letter, which was found by her mother years later.
This was reported in 2004 and Hislop was interviewed by police that year, and again in 2011, but on each occasion there was insufficient evidence to proceed.
Hislop went on to abuse his fourth victim, a 19-year-old woman who has dyslexia, dyspraxia and autism, at his home in Neilston, East Renfrewshire, in March 2015.
Police were called in after she told her boyfriend about the attack and Hislop was later prosecuted for all historic abuse.
