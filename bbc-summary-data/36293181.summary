The attack took place at 02:35 on Saturday in Benthall Street in the Gorbals area of the city.
Police said the victim was with a woman friend before the "unprovoked" assault by three men and two women.
The man is being treated for several stab wounds at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Det Con Ashleigh Coghlan said: "This was a very violent attack and what appeared to be a totally unprovoked attack which has left a young man with serious injuries and his female friend traumatised by the incident.
"I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed this attack or anyone who saw the five culprits running off afterwards as they may have information that could assist us in identifying those responsible."
The suspects were all white and in their early 20s.
One man was 5ft 6in, very thin and wearing a dark grey cotton hooded top and matching jogging bottoms.
Another man was 5ft 4in, also very thin and wearing a dark grey cotton hooded top.
A third man is thought to be slightly older than the other two, 5ft 6in, of very thin build wearing a dark cotton tracksuit.
One woman was of slim build, with dark hair in a messy bun wearing a denim jacket, black leggings and white trainers.
The other woman was of heavy build, had dirty blonde shoulder length hair and was wearing a dark zipper top.
