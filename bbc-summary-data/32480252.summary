Books of condolence have been placed in BBC Derby's reception and at the ground of the local football team, on which he commentated for several years.
Thousands of messages have been posted on social media or sent to the BBC.
Friend and former Olympic swimmer Ross Davenport said: "Colin was someone you could open up to and trust wholeheartedly."
Bloomfield worked at BBC Radio Derby for more than 10 years as a news reporter, Derby County commentator and breakfast show presenter.
He was diagnosed with stage four melanoma, a type of skin cancer, in 2013.
Mr Davenport added: "We were always told not to get too close to journalists but Colin meant it was nice to talk to someone and he became a friend and came to our wedding.  It is such a shame this day has come."
Derby County chief executive Sam Rush, signing the book of condolence at the iPro stadium, said: "He was the first man who painted the pictures when I was down in London before I came to Derby.
"My earliest pictures were created by Colin Bloomfield and those goals and experiences were those which excited us before we came up here."
While there were spontaneous chants in tribute to Mr Bloomfield at Derby's match away at Millwall on Saturday, Mr Rush said there would be a minutes applause for him at next Saturday's game.
Listeners have been sending in messages, many on social media, in response to the news and various tributes.
@TaraJones_29 tweeted: "Listening with a box of tissues, loving hearing his voices again", while @Amgkirtley also tweeted: "Truly lovely person and a great broadcaster".
The Skcin charity, which raises awareness of skin cancer, has passed a £75,000 target part of the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal and said it would continue to fundraise.
Sally Pepper, a fellow BBC Radio Derby presenter who ran the London Marathon on Sunday, has raised more than £20,000 for the appeal.
