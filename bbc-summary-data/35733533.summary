Bromley 2-0 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley extended their unbeaten run in the National League to six games thanks to substitute Bradley Goldberg's brace against Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an uneventful first half, Rohdell Gordon hit a rebound wide with the goal gaping after Will Hatfield saved.
But his blushes were spared by Goldberg, who headed in Lee Minshull's cross to open the scoring.
And Goldberg sealed victory with his second, a curling strike with seven minutes left.
