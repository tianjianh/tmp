Colin Taylor, 62, from Wheatley, was found dead in the seating area at Oxford City Football Club's Marsh Lane stadium on 17 July.
The three boys had arrived at the ground for football training.
At Oxford Coroner's Court, assistant coroner Nicholas Graham recorded a verdict of suicide.
The coroner said Mr Taylor had made a "huge" difference to the development of the football club and had left a "lasting legacy" to the community.
The inquest heard Mr Taylor was worried about the club's financial status.
His GP Dr Elizabeth Cope said Mr Taylor had been diagnosed with severe depression and had said he "felt hopeless about the future" and had suicidal thoughts.
Det Sgt Anthony Maddison, who investigated Mr Taylor's death, said it was "absolutely not" suspicious.
In a statement, Susan Taylor said her husband had a "passion for football".
He worked for the club in a voluntary unpaid basis, dealing with its business interests and day-to-day running, and worked hard to "turn the club around and get things back on track".
She said he was private about his depression and saw it as "a failure in himself".
On the day before his death he went to a meeting in London to speak to potential sponsors and watched the team play at Chesham United.
She said he seemed in a good mood and later fell asleep in his chair, but in the morning he was gone and had left his phone and wallet behind.
When she drove to the ground she saw the boys who said they had seen his body.
"I was in shock and did not know what to doâ€¦ I touched him and he was very cold," she said.
