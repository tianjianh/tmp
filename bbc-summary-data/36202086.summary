[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Sangster, 19, from Auchnagatt in Aberdeenshire, died after the crash on the A950 New Pitsligo to Mintlaw road in November 2014.
The driver, Adam Youngson, of Mintlaw, admitted causing Mr Sangster's death.
Scott Neil, of Stuartfield, admitted driving another car at excessive and inappropriate speeds. Sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh was deferred.
The court heard that moments before Youngson's car hit a tree, the car being driven by Neil came close to the back of Youngson's red Ford Fiesta.
Youngson reacted by accelerating away from Neil's car.
However, Neil then broke the speed limit to keep up with Youngson.
Youngson - who ignored requests from his passengers to drive more carefully - lost control of his vehicle, causing it to leave the road.
Mr Sangster was a back seat passenger in Mr Youngson's car.
Firefighters had to cut him free, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.
Judge Lady Wolffe deferred sentenced until 1 June.
She said: "It is important for me to be fully informed about all the circumstances concerning this incident."
Youngson's defence counsel Shahid Latif told the court that he would reserve his mitigation to the sentencing hearing.
He added: "My client at this stage wishes to offer his sincere apologies to the family, friends and anybody who has been affected by the death of Mr Sangster."
Neil's defence counsel Gavin Anderson also told Lady Wolffe that he would give his mitigation at the sentencing hearing.
Mr Sangster's family previously described him as a "larger than life character" and said he would be "sorely missed."
