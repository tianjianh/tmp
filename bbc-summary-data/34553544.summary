Timlin made the breakthrough in the 55th minute with a well-struck shot from the edge of the box.
Keeper Freddy Hall got a hand to the ball but could not prevent Timlin getting his 12th goal of the season.
Seven minutes later McNamee raced past central defender Patrick Kanyuka and coolly slotted in City's second goal.
Patrick McEleney went close to making it 3-0 when he cut inside and fired a right-foot shot which struck the crossbar.
McEleney was carried off on a stretcher after being injured late in the game.
City have won three and drawn the other in a four-match league run which has lifted them well clear of the danger zone. They have taken 19 points from a possible 30.
Sixth-placed Derry will complete their league fixtures with a home match against Bohemians followed by a trip to Longford Town on the final night of the campaign.
