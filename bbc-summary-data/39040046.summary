The 33-year-old winger is expected to make his debut for the Donegal club in Friday's opening league fixture against Cork City.
McCourt left Irish League club Glenavon in December, midway through a one-year deal.
His former clubs include Celtic, Rochdale, Barnsley and Brighton.
"Paddy is an experienced player who we hope will be big asset to us for what is going to be a very tough season," said Harps manager Ollie Horgan.
"At home he has played with top Premier teams like Shamrock Rovers and Derry City before going to Celtic, which is a huge achievement, and won Scottish League and Cup titles.
"He has come in late so it will take him a little time to get to know the lads.
"He has that natural ability to make things happen and we will need him to produce that quality because we are going to be up against well-organised defences in this division."
Last year Finn Harps finished 10th in the 12-team top flight, having won promotion in 2015.
