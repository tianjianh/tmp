Wolfgang Rangger's become the first person to try it out.
He lost his leg in 2007, and says the new technology is impressive.
'It feels like I have a foot again.'
The prosthetic leg has sensors in the sole that measures contact with the ground.
The sensors are connected to nerves in the thigh.
They send messages to his brain to let him know what he is touching.
It can work out if the ground is hot, cold, wet or slippery. It can also tell him if the ground is soft or hard like a road or grass in the park.
He says it helps him avoid falling and he can run faster.
