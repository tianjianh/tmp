Teenager Henry Hicks 'was not run over' by police officers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who died after he came off his scooter while being followed by police was not run over by the officers, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry Hicks, 18, was being followed by two unmarked police cars in Islington, north London, on 19 December 2014 when his moped crashed into another vehicle.
Marks on his clothing were more likely blood spots than tyre marks, St Pancras Coroner's Court heard.
Mr Hicks' family had raised concerns about the circumstances of the crash.
Det Insp Gary Wright at Surrey Police reviewed the initial investigation into the teenagers' death, led by Paul Summerton at the Metropolitan Police Service.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission requested Mr Wright to carry out the inquiry.
Mr Wright considered how the damage to the teenager's moped and helmet were caused, how he came off his bike, what caused the fatal head injuries and whether the marks on his jacket and tracksuit bottoms indicated he had been run over.
He told the jury: "Despite there being no skid marks, it's probable that harsh braking was the reason for Henry to fall from his bike or to become unstable at least before there was a smaller impact with the taxi."
He told senior coroner for Inner London Mary Hassell he had no reason to believe the police cars collided with the teenager.
The investigator said he broadly agreed with the previous report stating Mr Hicks probably did not initially realise police were following him.
But he said it was "difficult to document" what Mr Hicks was thinking at the time.
Four police officers, who were in the unmarked cars, are expected to give evidence to the inquest on Tuesday.
