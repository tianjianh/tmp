John Radcliffe Hospital porters set to strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Porters at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford are set strike for 48 hours in a row over changes to their shift patterns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unison members voted in favour of industrial action which is due to take place from 22:00 BST on Tuesday.
Oxfordshire Unison Health Branch said some porters could lose up to Â£54 a week if their hours are altered.
It is now in talks with private firm Carillion in a bid to reach a deal before strike action.
Carillion, which runs the porter service for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.
Before the ballot Unison said: "The porters at John Radcliffe, who are nearly all Unison members, are facing pay cuts and job losses amid huge pressure from management to accept the proposals."
