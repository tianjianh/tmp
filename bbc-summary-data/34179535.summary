[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £9.5m university technical college (UTC) in Church Square welcomed its first intake of 145 students from year 10 (14-15 years old).
North Lincolnshire Council said it would provide "hands-on' learning" to reflect "real issues in the workplace".
The 600-capacity college will work with firms including Tata Steel, the Royal Air Force, BAE Systems and Able UK.
UTCs, which are government-funded, were set up so students could benefit from the expertise of local business, further education colleges, vocational education experts and universities.
