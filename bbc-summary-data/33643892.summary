[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron at the Royal Welsh Show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I'm at the Royal Welsh Show where David Cameron has made his third visit to the showground in a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was at last year's event, then he came to a pre-election rally here at a time when the polls said he was neck-and-neck with Ed Miliband.
How things change in politics. In marked contrast to those nervous days for the Tories, the walkabout today had the feel of a victory parade at times.
With all the challenges he's got ahead of him, particularly over Europe, he may not have come to Wales at a better time.
Not only was he in a constituency that was one of the Tory gains at the election, but also Labour are in a mess and he came to Wales with news of hundreds of new jobs in the valleys.
The most interesting part of my interview was when I asked him whether he was directly appealing to Aston Martin to locate production of its new 4x4 model to south Wales, and he said yes.
Claim credit
It's not surprising that David Cameron is calling on the car maker to make sure the work is carried out in the UK, and he did hint at that in his answer.
But what will raise eyebrows is the apparent promotion of St Athan during a visit to Wales.
It could be seen as a dangerous game. Politically you can see where he's coming from.
If Aston go with the Vale of Glamorgan, he can claim the credit which, I have no doubt, will deeply annoy the Welsh government which will want to claim the credit for months of hard work behind the scenes.
If Aston go elsewhere, then I have no doubt that Welsh government ministers will accuse him of scuppering the deal for a few cheap headlines.
Either way, the impression we've got here is that David Cameron is trying to trying to bounce the car firm into making a decision.
In my experience, companies hate being told what to do by politicians, never mind on a huge call like this one.
NHS spending
But if you are going to have a politician trying to bounce one of the world's most famous car makers into a particular decision, then I suppose the argument would be that it might as well be the prime minister.
Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Cameron was particularly dismissive of Carwyn Jones' claim this week that some of the Tory spending plans were nigh on impossible to achieve.
He responded by saying that this was a typical response from a party who warned that the world was going to end a few years ago.
Instead he called on the Welsh government to offer the same protection to NHS spending in Wales as in England.
Carwyn Jones has said this is something he wants to do but was unable to offer a cast-iron guarantee.
And with all the concern about the electrification of the Great Western mainline, he reaffirmed his political commitment to the work being done all the way to Swansea, although he didn't give any guarantees that it would be completed by the target date of 2018.
