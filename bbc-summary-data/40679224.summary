Scotland Women striker Jane Ross is likely to miss her side's two remaining Euro 2017 group games due to injury, according to team doctor Stephen Boyce.

The Manchester City forward injured her right shoulder in Wednesday's 6-0 defeat by England.
Ross, 27, will stay with the squad but is a doubt for Sunday's match against Portugal and the game against Spain.
"It is unlikely that she'll be able to take part in those games," team doctor Boyce said.
"However, should Scotland progress further in the tournament, we'll re-evaluate the clinical situation at that time.
"After the (England) match she was in significant pain and discomfort.
"We performed an X-ray of her right shoulder which demonstrated the presence of an Acromioclavicular joint injury."
Ross is one of Scotland's most experienced players, having scored 50 goals in 107 appearances for the national side.
Scotland went into the tournament in the Netherlands minus star playmaker Kim Little, who suffered anterior cruciate knee ligament damage in May.
Little's Arsenal team-mate Emma Mitchell also missed out through injury, along with experienced Manchester City defender Jen Beattie and Hibs striker Lizzie Arnot.
Glasgow City midfielder Hayley Lauder missed the opening defeat to England with a hamstring problem but has a chance of recovering in time to face Portugal in what is a must-win game if the Scots are to progress in the tournament.
