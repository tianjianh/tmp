Ray Matthews, from Maltby, near Rotherham, completed his challenge in September after starting in July.
He raised £29,975 for Rotherham's Newman School, which caters for children with special educational needs and disabilities.
Mr Matthews described himself as "just a guy who goes out and runs marathons".
He said: "What I've seen since I've been involved with the school is just amazing - all I ever see when I walk in here is joy on the children's faces."
The money is to be used to improve the external areas of the school and provide new equipment.
Mr Matthews started the challenge shortly after his 75th birthday and described the marathon series as a 75-day "birthday present" to himself.
The majority of the routes he tackled were organised by running clubs in South Yorkshire, but he also completed two marathons in Rotherham's twin town of St-Quentin in France.
Mr Matthews said his only disappointment was the amount raised "isn't £75,000".
Four years ago, at the age of 71, Mr Matthews also ran 150 miles in 36 hours.
