Viewers of Periscope, Twitter's live-video streaming app, alerted police to a woman who appeared intoxicated and was streaming a video of herself driving around Lakeland, Florida.
Police eventually found Whitney Beall, 23, and charged her with driving under the influence.
"I am...drunk," she said at one point in the video, swearing.
Periscope users sent her messages on Saturday night imploring her to stop driving before she hurt someone.
No-one was hurt in the incident, police said.
Ms Beall said on the video that she had a flat tyre and did not know where she was. Periscope viewers helped police pinpoint Ms Beall's location after they spotted local landmarks in the background.
When officers arrived, Ms Beall refused to take a breathalyser test and failed field sobriety tests, police said.
