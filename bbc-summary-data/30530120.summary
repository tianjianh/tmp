Brothel owner from Oldham asked to leave Jersey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from Greater Manchester has been bound over to leave Jersey for three years after admitting running a brothel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catalin Mihail Avram, 35, of Whitehouse Avenue, Oldham, was arrested on Wednesday morning.
He was charged with running a brothel at Panama Apartments on Green Street in violation of an 1895 Jersey law.
Magistrate Bridget Shaw said there was no benefit to Jersey to keep Avram in the island.
Avram appeared at Jersey Magistrates' Court in St Helier on Thursday where he pleaded guilty.
The court heard he arrived in Jersey by boat on Monday from the UK with two women, a car boot full of adult material and £300 in cash.
The prosecution lawyer said the officers spoke to one of the women who said she had sold sex for money and had had three clients in one afternoon.
Police found £697 in their possession meaning they had acquired £397 in the time they had been in the island.
The court heard there was no coercion or threats against the women and they were here willingly.
Magistrate Shaw bound him over to leave the island for three years and ordered him to sign £397 over to the court, which she said were the proceeds of prostitution.
