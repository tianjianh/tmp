Jamille Matt's strike put Argyle ahead and Reuben Reid added to the lead from the penalty spot after Matt was fouled.
Will Boyle's own goal should have put the game out of reach, but York's Russell Penn pulled one back with a drilled finish after the break.
Luke Summerfield's late penalty ensured a nervy finish, but Argyle held on to close the gap on Oxford to two points.
Plymouth also have a game in hand on second-placed Oxford, who drew with Cambridge United.
York have still not won away since 5 September and are seven points from safety with seven games to go.
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"I thought we played well, that's the frustrating thing.
"We started the game well with a few chances and a few blocks and came close.
"Three-nil at half time, obviously was a test of character and I thought in the second half we were fantastic.
"It's probably the best we've played for a while."
