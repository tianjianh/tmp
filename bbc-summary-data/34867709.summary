Vigils for missing teenager Kayleigh Haywood have provided a shocked community the chance to rally round her family.

The 15-year-old, from Leicestershire, has not been seen since Friday and two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The people of Ibstock and Measham said the close knit communities have been left "numb".
A JustGiving page has raised more than Â£1,000 in a few hours for the family.
Kayleigh, of Measham, was last seen on Friday when she was dropped off in the nearby village of Ibstock for a planned night with friends.
A body was found late on Wednesday evening, which, although not formally identified, detectives believe is that of Kayleigh.
In the hours before the grim discovery, a vigil was held at Ibstock Baptist Church attended by about 100 people, many wearing the teenager's favourite colour of purple.
Afterwards they left the church and walked down the street in silence in a show of support to the family.
Speaking after the police revealed a body had been found, the Rev Ray Monks said the family was "numb".
"The community is devastated, we are all devastated, but we are determined that we want to stand with Kayleigh and her family at this very, very difficult time.
"Sadly, today a young girl is not going home with her family and the family are absolutely beside themselves and the community equally is a grieving community.
"She was a bright, bubbly girl, a typical teenager. A very bubbly, nice young girl. I'm sure she brought sunshine into the lives of all who knew her."
Kayleigh's former stepmother Michelle Fantom said she was a brilliant sister to her half-siblings.
"She is a lovely girl, very quiet, very caring - a brilliant sister. A brilliant daughter to Martin and Stephanie... and a normal 15-year-old planning life ahead of her."
Another vigil will be held later at St Laurence Baptist Church in Measham, where mourners will be able to light candles and leave messages of support in a book for the family.
The Rev Linda Cox said Kayleigh's disappearance had touched everyone.
"Kayleigh's mum was extremely devastated and upset and all the range of emotions you go through when losing a child, anger being one of them," she said.
"All we can do is be there and support the family through that.
"We all like to think we live in a safe place and things like this won't happen and it has. People are devastated and worried for their families and themselves. We can understand that outpouring of unease and disbelief."
Eddie Green, head teacher of Ashby School where Kayleigh was a pupil, described her as a "fun-loving" girl.
"Ashby School has a long tradition of being at the heart of our community and the students have an outstanding reputation for overcoming and dealing with adversity," he said.
"We have no doubt that at this, the most difficult of times, they will show their resolve, resilience and true community spirit in supporting each other through this period."
David Phillips, principal of Ibstock Community College, Kayleigh's previous school, said: "A close community such as ours means that our lives are intertwined with others and from this we gain great strength.
"It is this strength that will support us and also Kayleigh's family in these dark times.  We have had many offers of support and this has reinforced our confidence in the good that exists in our communities."
