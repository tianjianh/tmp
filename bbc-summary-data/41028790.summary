The pair, who received a bye in the opening round, reached the last 16 with a 21-15 21-10 defeat of Austrian duo Dominik Stripsits and Roman Zirnwald.
"Once we realise what we needed to do it became quite easy and we dominated," Ellis told BBC Sport.
England's European champion Rajiv Ouseph beat Sameer Verma of India.
But Lauren Smith and Sarah Walker lost in the second round of the women's doubles.
The English pair lost 21-10 21-14 to South Korean fifth seeds Kyung Eun Jung and Seung Chan Shin.
Langridge and Ellis reached the quarter-finals at the last World Championships in 2015 before illness prevented them progressing further.
They know that winning a medal in Glasgow would boost the prospects of UK Sport overturning their decision not to invest in badminton heading towards Tokyo 2020.
"We want to be doing well here and challenging for medals," Langridge told BBC Sport.
"Personally, though, I'm not thinking about UK Sport or any of the external factors as we just need to concentrate on ourselves and hopefully then the success will come later in the week."
Langridge and Ellis' medal bid could yet be helped by a shock on the third day of competition, with top men's doubles seeds Junhui Li and Yuchen Liu losing their opening match.
The Chinese pair lost 19-21 21-18 21-18 to unseeded Polish duo Mohammad Ahsan and Rian Saputro.
Ouseph edged his first-set against Verma 22-20, before a dominant second set (21-9). But the "greatest challenge" of his career awaits in the next round, with the 30-year-old drawn to face two-time Olympic champion and five-time World championship gold medallist Lin Dan of China.
"It doesn't get any bigger," Ouseph told BBC Sport.
"It's very exciting and the pressure is off, but I believe he does have weaknesses in his game now and I can win tomorrow."
Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour, who received a bye in the opening round, opened her campaign with a straightforward 21-16 21-13 defeat of India's Rituparna Das.
She will face 20-year-old rising Chinese star He Bingjiao, who is a two-time world junior champion.
"Today was all about finding my rhythm and I felt good about the way I played," she told BBC Sport.
"It was great to sample the atmosphere tonight as I've lots of great memories from this venue and I'll try to draw on those throughout the week."
Thursday's action will see the return of English Commonwealth champions Chris and Gabby Adcock, who will take on Japan's Kenta Kazuno and Ayane Kurihara for a place in the quarter-finals.
