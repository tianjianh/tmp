The man and woman, who were visiting from east Asia, were approached by two men at about 13:30 on Saturday outside the Scottish Parliament.
One of the men claimed to be a police officer. He showed them identification and checked their belongings.
The pair later discovered a "four-figure sum" of money had been stolen.
The theft is not thought to be linked to other recent incidents in Scotland involving fake police officers.
Police said the first suspect was east Asian, with a slim to medium build and 5ft 7ins tall. He was 30-35 years old, with short black hair and unshaven.
He was wearing a brown jacket and carrying a black backpack.
The second man is described as white, of medium build, 6ft tall, about 50 years old, with a deep scar on his right cheek.
He spoke with an English accent and was wearing a black beanie hat and a full-length black coat.
Insp David Robertson appealed for witnesses to come forward and said the theft was currently being treated as an "isolated incident".
He added: "Our officers will always be in possession of photographic identification and will be able to provide you with a unique identification number.
"If you are still unsure, please call us on 101 as the call handler can check their credentials for you and officers will be happy to wait until this has been done."
