Former Olympic downhill champion Lindsey Vonn is set to return to competition just nine weeks after severely fracturing her right arm.

Vonn, 32, had surgery after injuring her arm in a training crash in Colorado in November.
She will compete at Altenmarkt-Zauchensee in Austria on 14 January.
"It's been a tough three months with over 300 hours of rehabilitation but being able to compete again makes it worth it," she told Eurosport.
"I have already missed a few races but hopefully I can overcome that and still make a run at some World Cup titles," she added.
In February 2016 she raced with a hairline fracture of her knee, before the injury subsequently forced her to stop competing.
She also suffered a serious knee injury in 2013 which caused her to miss much of the season in both that year and 2014.
