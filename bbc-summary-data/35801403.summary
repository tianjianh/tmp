Portland Port cruise ship berth upgrade given go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More cruise ships could be set to visit the Dorset coast, following the approval of plans to extend facilities at Portland Port.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The port's board has given the go-ahead for the upgrading of its berth to accommodate ships of more than 340m (1,115ft) in overall length.
General manager Ian McQuade said it meant the port could target "the ever increasing range" of cruise customers.
The new facility is due to be finished in time for the 2017 season.
The 9.6m-deep main cruise berth at Portland is due to handle about 5,000 passengers on board Holland America Lines and the TUI Group vessels later this year.
Costa and Saga cruise ships are also due to visit the port.
Portland is one of three ports on the south coast that can already accommodate vessels up to 300m (985ft) alongside.
Mr McQuade said the further extension would put it among a "unique group of ports".
