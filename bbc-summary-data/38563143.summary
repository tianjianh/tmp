[SN]TITLE[SN]
Can Obamacare be repealed?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republican lawmakers have tried repeatedly to overturn Obamacare since the health law's passage in 2010. But be careful what you wish for.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From 20 January, the party will control the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time in a decade.
Now their electoral base expects them to act.
Will Republicans finally be able to undo President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement under a Trump presidency?
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act aims to decelerate the growth of US health spending, which is the highest in the world.
The system is kept solvent by an individual mandate that requires Americans who do not receive medical insurance through their employers, or free healthcare from the government, to buy such coverage through government-run websites.
The programme offers subsidies to make health insurance more affordable and aims to reduce the cost of insurance by bringing younger, healthier people into the medical coverage system.
Obamacare also requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance.
There are about 20 million Americans who now have health insurance under the law.
But the programme has been rocked over the past year by swingeing premium hikes and a trio of national insurers abandoning the online marketplaces.
The individual mandate is also highly unpopular because many uninsured Americans who end up paying penalties to the US tax authorities are low-to-moderate income workers juggling rent, car payments or student loans.
But the law is also popular because it bans insurance companies from denying health coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions and allows young people to remain on their parents' plans until age 26.
Obamacare has also defied Republican predictions that it would bloat government expenditure - the Congressional Budget Office says repealing the bill would increase the federal budget deficit by $137bn (Â£112bn) by 2025.
Conservative lawmakers do not have the votes needed to repeal Obamacare outright.
But they are taking legislative steps to dismantle the law through a special budget strategy.
Right after convening the 115th Congress, the Senate voted 51-48 to open debate on a budget resolution to overhaul Obamacare.
The resolution, with floor votes expected as soon as this week, would lead to a budget reconciliation bill to demolish major provisions of the health law and starve it of funding.
Congress could eliminate federal subsidies, overturn a raft of Obamacare-related taxes, and gut funding to expand Medicaid, a federal healthcare programme for low-income Americans.
Still, there may be limits to what the newly empowered Republicans can achieve in the face of a unified Democratic opposition.
Conservatives' long-cherished dream of abrogating Obamacare could be doomed to falter in a legislative, intra-party and bureaucratic quagmire.
Democrats are expected to deploy a "vote-a-rama", temporarily delaying the budget resolution with dozens of amendments.
But the resolution and the ensuing budget reconciliation bill only require a simple majority to pass, instead of the 60 votes typically required.
There are 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, so if they all stick together - and that could be a big "if" - Democrats don't have the seats to stop them.
Repeal legislation could come to a vote as soon as February.
Republicans have been touting a transition period because they're wary of pulling the rug from under the feet of the 22 million people currently covered by Obamacare.
One proposal congressional leaders seemed to be coalescing around was repeal-and-delay, that is, overturning Obamacare and letting it stand for up to three years while Republicans craft an alternative.
But several of the party's senators have expressed strong reservations about getting rid of the health law without an adequate replacement.
And Mr Trump told a press conference he wanted the bill repealed and replaced "essentially simultaneously".
One major problem with that is the party would need a 60-vote majority in the Senate to pass a new law, and Democrats could filibuster that indefinitely.
If he decides to toss a monkey wrench into the cogs of Obamacare, Mr Trump doesn't even have to wait for Congress.
He would be able to do it with a stroke of a pen.
As president, he could simply drop the federal government's appeal against a lawsuit, House v Burwell, which Republican House of Representatives members won in April 2016.
That legal action argued the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that Congress had not formally appropriated by reimbursing health insurers who provide coverage to low-income policyholders.
If Mr Trump opts to drop the administration's challenge, insurers who are currently giving deep discounts to half their customers would lose their reimbursements. And that, say analysts, would send Obamacare into a death spiral.
Few details have been forthcoming on what would replace the Obamacare and although Republicans have bandied around lots of ideas, there seems little consensus on the way forward.
Most conservative proposals bear a resemblance to Obamacare, but with more costs shifted to consumers and fewer people covered.
One repeal bill passed by House Republicans last year - and vetoed by President Obama - would have eliminated the individual mandate.
Most Republican plans call for preserving - in some form - Obamacare's ban on insurers denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.
Other ideas call for partially privatising Medicare, the government healthcare scheme for the elderly, or stripping funding from Planned Parenthood, the family planning group that provides abortions.
Whatever conservative lawmakers do, they'll be mindful of political ramifications and the so-called Pottery Barn rule - If you break it, you own it.
