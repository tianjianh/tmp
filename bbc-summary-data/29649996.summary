The 19-year-old has yet to make a first-team appearance for his parent club but has previously been loaned to Cheltenham, Luton and Gillingham.
Inniss was recommended to Glovers manager Gary Johnson by former Palace counterpart Tony Pulis.
"We have kept an eye on him and it's good timing on our part," Johnson told BBC Somerset.
"He certainly looks the part so hopefully he can strengthen our squad."
Johnson met with Inniss on Wednesday and added: "I didn't really want to walk up the high street with him, as he's 6ft 6in and I'm less than that.
"We certainly looked like the odd couple, like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film Twins."
Johnson added that he would decide on Friday whether Inniss was ready to feature in Saturday's League One clash with Swindon.
