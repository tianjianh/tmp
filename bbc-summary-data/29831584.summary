Norwegian TV has set up a webcam in front of Mount Mannen, western Norway, after experts warned of a rockslide, but no-one knows when it may happen.

According to local media, geologists were left stumped after the rockslide did not occur as predicted on Tuesday.
Norway's NRK TV says the mountainous area is moving 1.5 cm a day, but experts now say it could stabilise.
Norwegian TV is known for airing hours of so-called slow TV such as knitting, wood burning and salmon fishing.
For several days, TV viewers have been eagerly awaiting the rockslide after NRK and several local media outlets set up webcams to monitor its development.
But with the exception of a tiny rockslide lasting 15 seconds on Tuesday, the spectacular collapse of the mountainside has failed to take place on the scale predicted by experts.
Norway's chief geologist, Lars Harald Blikra, acknowledged on Tuesday that they were struggling to read the mountain's movements, according to The Local website.
"I'm unsure of what's happening. It's difficult to understand the dynamics up there," he said.
Eleven local residents were reportedly evacuated from the area after it was declared a no-go zone last week.
