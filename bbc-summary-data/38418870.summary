[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed woman was held on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm by officers probing allegations of abuse at Rosecroft Residential Home in Bromley.
Five other women have been arrested in connection with the allegations.
All six, aged between late-20s and mid-50s, were bailed until February.
The residential home cares for elderly people who need nursing care, including those with dementia, physical disabilities and sensory impairment.
The Metropolitan Police said the investigation involved a number of alleged victims whose ages ranged from their mid-70s to mid-90s.
Det Con Vicki Thomson said: "Although the incidents we are investigating are alleged to have taken place this year, I am keen to hear from former employees of the care home including agency staff who were employed as far back as 2007."
