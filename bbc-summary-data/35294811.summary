Officers 'not warned' of gunman Raoul Moat death threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No warning of any kind was issued to police staff when gunman Raoul Moat threatened to kill officers in 2010, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC David Rathband was shot and blinded by Moat in the early hours of 4 July, minutes after he told the Northumbria force he was hunting for police.
The officer's family is pursuing a compensation claim after PC Rathband took his own life in February 2012.
Geoffrey Tattersall QC said a warning should have been "a no brainier".
The civil claim against the force, brought by the PC's brother Darren and sister Debbie Esseray, is focusing on the crucial minutes between Moat dialling 999 to say he was hunting for police, and him shooting the unarmed traffic officer, who was sitting in his patrol car on a Newcastle roundabout above the A1.
It states that had he been warned about the specific threat, PC Rathband would have kept mobile.
In the early hours of July 3 2010, Moat shot his ex-partner Samantha Stobbart and murdered her new lover Chris Brown in Birtley, Gateshead, and went on the run.
The next night, Moat spoke to a Northumbria Police call handler for almost five minutes, saying he would kill any officer who came near him, that he was not coming in alive and, at one point, that he was hunting for officers.
Mr Tattersall said "no warning of any kind was issued", leaving the officer ignorant to the threats that Moat had made.
He told Newcastle High Court: "This is an immensely sad case.
"A duty of care was owed and the force were negligent in failing to warn David Rathband that Raoul Moat had telephoned and made threats.
"We say that an interim warning should have been given noting the threat to officers, to probably tell them to be vigilant and probably that they should keep on the move on the basis a mobile officer is far harder to shoot."
Speaking before the hearing, Mrs Esseray said: "David felt he was left out in harm's way by the organisation in which he served, the organisation which has continued to state that they did nothing wrong, however have since changed various practices and procedures to ensure it never happens again."
She added if the claim was successful, any money would go to the officer's children, Ash and Mia.
Northumbria Police led a huge manhunt for Moat and eventually cornered him six days after the shooting in Rothbury, Northumberland, where, after a six-hour stand off, Moat killed himself.
The hearing continues.
