A statement from Jan Jedrzejewski's family described him as "an amazing, caring and sincere son, brother, brother in law, uncle and friend".
Mr Jedrzejewski, who lived in the city, was found on Keene Street, Lliswerry, at about 23:00 GMT on Thursday.
He was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital, where he later died. Police have arrested four people.
His family released a statement in Polish and English, which said: "We will never forget the smile on your face when your favourite football team Real Madrid scored a goal.
"You will forever stay in our hearts. We love and miss you, until we meet again."
Two men aged 18 and a 17-year-old boy were arrested on Friday and a 43-year-old man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of murder.
