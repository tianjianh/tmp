Plans for a controversial recycling plant near Calne in Wiltshire have been rejected by Wiltshire Council.

The Hills Waste site at Lower Compton has consent to operate until December 2016. After that it has to be restored back to greenfield.
In spite of 129 letters of objection, it was expected the application to retain and extend the site would be approved.
A spokesman for the waste firm said it was "extremely disappointed".
The company was hoping not only to retain the site but process up to 119,000 tonnes of household waste a year there.
However, residents claimed it would result in an HGV every two minutes, 12 hours a day, on the road to the site.
Despite being recommended for approval by planning officials, the proposal was rejected by the council's strategic planning committee.
A spokesman for the firm said councillors had "behaved unreasonably" in voting against the scheme.
"The issues do not reflect the planning position or the technical reports which have been scrutinised by Wiltshire Council and by external consultants," he said.
"Hills is confident that this decision will be overturned on appeal and will be looking to recover full costs of the appeal from the council."
