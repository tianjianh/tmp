The victim, who has been named locally as Noel Kirwan, was attacked in Ronanstown in west Dublin at about 17:10 local time.
A woman who was also in the car was not injured but was left badly shaken.
Police say the shooting bears the hallmarks of a gang-related attack.
Garda Supt Dermot Mann said police believed "a lone gunmen approached the car and fired a number of shots at the car."
"He then, we believe, got into a white Peugeot partner van.
"That car was subsequently found burnt out at the rear of the Neilstown shops carpark," he said.
RTÃ‰ reported that the victim was an associate of Gerard Hutch, a notorious criminal in Dublin in the late 1980s and 1990s, who was nicknamed the Monk.
Paul Reynolds, RTÃ‰'s crime correspondent, said the dead man was involved in crime as a much younger man:
"He was arrested and questioned a number of times by Gardai (Irish Police), was before the courts in 96/97 for gun offences.
"He hasn't been involved in any criminality in recent times. He's originally from north inner city in Dublin.
"He was a community activist in that area and was involved in the anti-drugs campaign in the 90s.
It is believed that the attack could be the latest in a feud between criminal gangs in the city.
