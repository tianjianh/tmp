[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pedro Godinho, 22, died in hospital after being discovered in Canonsleigh Road, Leicester, on Sunday morning.
Ezekiel Braithwaite, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder and attempted grievous bodily harm.
Taome Stabanner, 21, of Rowena Court, Mountsorrel, has been charged with assisting an offender.
Both are due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court later.
Mr Godinho's cousin, Rafael Godinho, said on behalf of the family: "Pedro was sadly taken from us. He was only 22-years-old, with a promising life ahead of him.
"At this time, the family is working closely with Leicestershire Police.
"Anybody who knows him would tell you what a good heart he had, he'd be the one to give you the shirt off his back."
