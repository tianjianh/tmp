[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 2-1 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Richard Duffy own goal helped Colchester come from behind to beat struggling Notts County and extend their unbeaten run to four matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
County took a 17th-minute lead through former Colchester loanee Elliott Hewitt, who headed in from close range after Duffy had nodded on Carl Dickinson's corner at the near post.
Colchester's Denny Johnstone came close to converting Brennan Dickenson's cross, while Owen Garvan's half-volley flew straight at Adam Collin.
But Colchester equalised in the 24th minute when Kurtis Guthrie sent a fine diving header past Collin from close range, following Johnstone's excellent cross into the six-yard box.
Collin easily saved George Elokobi's weak header just before half-time while in the opening stages of the second half Tom Eastman's header from Dickenson's cross flew just over the bar.
Colchester keeper Sam Walker denied Dickinson at his near post but Duffy put through his own net with 13 minutes to go after Eastman had headed Garvan's free-kick into the six-yard box.
