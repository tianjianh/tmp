The film, about a struggling unemployed man, was one of 25 movies to be announced on Tuesday.
Other recent festival winners on the programme include Gianfranco Rosi's migrant crisis documentary Fire at Sea, which scooped Berlin's Golden Bear.
The New York event runs for 18 days and opens on 30 September with slavery documentary The 13th.
The film, about the amendment that abolished slavery, had already been announced as part of the lineup, along with the festival's centrepiece movie 20th Century Women, starring Annette Bening.
The closing night gala will be Amazonian thriller The Lost City of Z, starring Twilight actor Robert Pattinson.
All three gala presentations are world premieres.
Pattinson's Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart has two features showing in the New York line-up - Personal Shopper and Certain Women.
French actress Isabelle Huppert also stars in two films - Things to Come and Elle.
Festival director Kent Jones said he was interested in "good film-making" and not putting "stars on the red carpet".
"I'm immensely proud that we're showing all of these films. They're all vital and important works. And none of our selections are made to satisfy a niche," he added.
Other films on the programme include Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's latest work Julieta, about a mother and her estranged daughter.
Family drama Manchester by the Sea, starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, will also be shown.
The film, telling the story of a man who takes on the care of his nephew after his younger brother's sudden death, was well-received at the Sundance Film Festival.
The New York Film Festival takes place each year at the city's Film Society of Lincoln Center and is open to the public.
