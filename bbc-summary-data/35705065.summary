Metal cladding approved for Inverness Museum and Art Gallery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have approved a plan to improve the appearance of a prefabricated concrete building in Inverness by covering it with metal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £500,000 cost of the work to Inverness Museum and Art Gallery would be met from £3m of funding provided by the UK government.
The building's front and side is to be clad in aluminium.
The light sandstone-coloured anodised, perforated aluminium would feature a map of the city.
The museum, which is operated by High Life Highland, is in the city centre next to the Inverness Town House and Inverness Castle.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell confirmed the £3m of funding for Inverness during a meeting with Highland Council last year.
The local authority plans to use the rest of the money on upgrading the grounds of Inverness Castle and on creating a free public access wi-fi scheme for the city.
