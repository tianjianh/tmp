Ferrari-linked 250 C number plate fails to beat record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number plate linked to one of the most expensive cars in the world has failed to approach a record price.

Registration "250 C" was expected to appeal to owners of Ferrari's 250 GT California Spyder and had been tipped to sell for more than £500,000.
However, the hammer fell with bidding at £21,500 during the DVLA auction in Nottingham.
The existing record was set in November, when a Ferrari dealer bought "25 O" for £518,000.
While the hammer price was for the plate was £21,500, fees and other charges brought the total to £27,944.
The link to Ferrari's car was expected to be enough to attract some wealthy buyers to the "250 C" registration.
DJ Chris Evans paid more than £5m in 2008 for his Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder, once owned by Hollywood actor James Coburn.
A replica Spyder with the registration "NRVOUS" was famously destroyed by Matthew Broderick's character in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
A total of 1,600 registrations are being sold over three days, and are expected to make between £3m and £3.5m for the Treasury.
Other sales so far have included "AH11 MAD", which made more than £17,000, and "BR15 TOW", which sold for £16,000.
The auction is also attracting special interest as it is the first time registrations featuring the letters "Z" and "I" have been included.
The letters "I" and "Z" are only used for Northern Ireland's vehicle registrations.
The move means there are registrations featuring Baz, Kaz, Daz and Dez.
