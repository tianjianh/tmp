Dyddgu Hywel's third-minute try allowed Wales to reach half-time level, with a pushover from Safi N'Diaye the only reward for French forward domination.
A brilliant try finished by Wales prop Megan York proved crucial.
Wales also confirmed their place for the 2017 World Cup as Scotland now cannot overtake them.
Wales got off to a flying start, as full-back Hywel sped past her marker on an arcing run from the 22 to score after only three minutes.
France created a golden chance for winger Caroline Boujard who dropped a cross-kick with the line open, but number eight N'Diaye levelled after 15 minutes with a pushover effort.
Robyn Wilkins pushed a 30-metre penalty shot wide for Wales before the French forwards took control, with Wales just managing to hold up them on the line twice.
The injury-time loss of lock Shona Powell-Hughes to a yellow card for not retreating from a penalty was a blow for Wales, and France took the lead after 45 minutes when Audrey Abadie was on target with a simple penalty with her fourth shot at goal.
But Wales produced the move of the match as wing Bethan Dainton's long break from defence saw Elen Evans on the other flank send York charging down the touchline for a memorable score.
Wales were pinned in their own 22 for long periods of the final quarter as France threw on their replacements in search of a breakthrough, but a magnificent defensive performance held the visitors out.
