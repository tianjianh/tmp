She was Amy Reid, 21, from Coolnafranky Park, Cookstown. A neighbour said she died during a house party in Coagh early on Friday.
Two men, aged 26 and 39, and a 32-year-old woman were arrested for questioning about drugs. They had been taken to hospital as a precaution.
They have been released on police bail pending further inquiries.
Ms Reid's neighbour, Peter Cassidy, said that the family were "absolutely shocked" at what had happened.
"She was a young girl with everything to live for, tragically taken away so young.
"I have seen her from since she was a child up to now, a bubbly girl who enjoyed life.
"She had three brothers and a sister, they're totally gobsmacked. They can't take it in. The parents are totally devastated."
Ulster Unionist councillor Trevor Wilson said it was a "terrible tragedy".
"She had her whole life ahead of her. When the news reached Cookstown and the people that lived round about where she lived, it was very sad and they are really stunned."
Sinn FÃ©in councillor John McNamee said he knows the young woman's family.
"At such a young age of 21, it is terrible for the family and for the whole community. We should reflect on what really happened, a young woman, 21 years of age, in the prime of her life has lost her life," he said.
"Her family, friends and neighbours are totally devastated."
He warned against speculation about what happened at this stage.
