Kris Meeke is without a drive for the 2016 World Rally Championship after Citroen revealed they will not take part in next year's championship.

The eight-time winners of the series will take a year away from the sport to concentrate on the development of a new car running new regulations for 2017.
The 33-year-old may still have a role in developing the car but the Northern Ireland man is weighing up his options.
Meeke's team-mate, Norway's Mads Ostberg, has left the French team.
The Dungannon driver finished second to world champion Sebastien Ogier in last week's Wales Rally GB and, with Ostberg, helped his team to second place overall in the Manufacturers' Championship.
Meeke scored Citroen's only 2016 victory in Argentina in a season dominated by Volkswagen and finished fifth in the championship standings.
The focus of Citroen in 2017 will be the defence of their World Touring Car crown.
