It will be held at Scotland's new national performance centre, Oriam, on Wednesday 28 September.
Rio 2016 has been the most successful "away Olympics" for Scottish competitors, with 12 medals won so far.
Sportscotland said the homecoming event would be streamed on social media channels.
All Scottish Olympians and Paralympians will be invited to the event, which will also include an audience with school children and members of various community, sports and youth organisations.
With two more days of competition remaining, the medal tally of Scots members of Team GB is only one short of the 13 won at London 2012 and well ahead of the seven medals won at Sydney 2000, the previous record for an overseas games.
Sportscotland Chief Executive Stewart Harris said: "This represents the most successful overseas Games for Scots on Team GB and everyone in Scotland can be very proud of their success.
"It's testament to all the hard work by the athletes, sports, coaches and the collaboration between UK Sport and the Sportscotland institute of sport that Scottish athletes are delivering record-breaking performances on the Olympic stage."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "All of Scotland's Team GB sportsmen and women have done the country proud.
"I hope their performances will help to inspire the next generation of Scottish Olympians and Paralympians."
Andy Murray was the fourth Scot to win gold at the Games after cyclists Skinner and Katie Archibald and rower Heather Stanning.
Skinner also claimed a silver medal, as did rowers Polly Swann and Karen Bennett, canoeist David Florence and rugby players Mark Bennett and Mark Robertson.
Katherine Grainger's silver rowing medal made her Britain's most decorated female Olympian, while swimmer Duncan Scott won two silver medals in relay races, the first coming with fellow Scots Stephen Milne and Dan Wallace. Sally Conway took bronze in judo.
Murray defended the tennis gold he won in 2012 with victory over Juan Martin del Potro.
A total of 50 Scottish athletes travelled to Brazil for the Games..
Four years ago, thousands of wellwishers lined the streets of Glasgow and Edinburgh to celebrate the success of Scottish athletes at London 2012..
