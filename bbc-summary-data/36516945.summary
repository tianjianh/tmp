Former Watford and Middlesbrough striker Wilkinson, 51, finished his playing career, in which he played more than 650 games, with the Cobblers.
Since then, has held a number of coaching roles, including a spell as assistant boss at Sheffield Wednesday.
"I know Paul very well and he'll prove a really good addition to the staff," said Page, who was appointed in May.
"He has plenty of experience, both as a player and a coach, and I am sure the players will enjoy working with him."
