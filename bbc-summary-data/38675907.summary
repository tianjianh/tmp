A 10-day festival of music, theatre and comedy dubbed the world's biggest Burns Night celebration is getting under way in Dumfries.

The sixth edition of the Big Burns Supper runs until 29 January.
Lulu will help kick off proceedings at the Easterbrook Hall on Friday night with Nicola Benedetti, King Creosote and many other acts to follow.
A Burns Night Carnival is also planned for Sunday which will see thousands of people take to the streets.
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, Charlie Landsborough, Seth Lakeman and Hackney Colliery Band are other acts involved this year.
Eddi Reader, Sean Hughes, the Peatbog Faeries, Emily Smith, Paul Foot and Dervish are also taking part.
The festival sees the return of the Le Haggis cabaret show which is now in its fourth edition.
Earlier this year, the festival announced a venue switch to the Crichton site with the end of the use of the Spiegeltent in Dumfries town centre.
Organisers have said the programme will hopefully offer "something for everybody".
