The man, aged in his mid-60s, was detained after the cyclist, 28, died at the scene, at the junction of Ruckholt Road and East Cross Road, Hackney.
Police and an air ambulance attended the scene after the crash, which happened at about 19:45 BST.
Scotland Yard said the suspect was being held on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
He was taken to an east London police station.
The crash, involving an Olympic media bus, happened close to the Olympic hockey centre, velodrome and Paralympic tennis arena.
The victim has not yet been identified, but an International Olympic Committee source told BBC London he was not an Olympic competitor.
"The police are investigating and our thoughts are with the cyclist's family," Olympic organisers Locog said.
"We can confirm that a cyclist tragically died as a result of a collision with a bus carrying media from the Olympic Park this evening."
Following the collision no buses were allowed to arrive or depart from the Media Transport Mall's multi-storey car park.
The Olympic Park internal shuttle remains operational.
The incident is being investigated by the Met's Traffic Investigation Unit.
