The 38-year-old father of one died in the early hours of Saturday in a care unit in Derry. His family was with him.
The civil servant was 30 when he was attacked by a mob at a barbecue in the Waterside in Derry in 2006, and never regained consciousness.
The investigation into the attack has now become a murder investigation.
Only one person has ever been convicted over the attack, although up to 15 people are believed to have been involved.
Sinn Féin's Martina Anderson spoke to the family on Sunday. She said they were "heartbroken" by Mr McCauley's death.
"They also referred to the hate messages and the sectarian bile that was posted on social media sites by those allegedly involved in the attack," she said.
"At this moment in time they just want their son home, they want to go through the process of the wake and the funeral and their hearts are absolutely torn in two.
"But they also want justice for Paul McCauley and that is what the people of this city want."
Daryl Proctor was convicted of the attack and given a 12-year jail term. He was released in February this year.
Mr McCauley suffered multiple injuries, including a brain haemorrhage and a fractured skull, when he and two friends were beaten by a gang of youths.
He also had two heart attacks on the way to Altnagelvin Hospital.
Senior Investigating Officer DCI Michael Harvey said: "On behalf of the entire police family, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the McCauley family following Paul's death.
"They have conducted themselves with great dignity over the past almost nine years since the vicious attack on Paul and his friends. The love and care they gave to Paul have been a beacon of light in a tragically dark set of circumstances."
He added: "In memory of Paul, for the McCauley family and in the interests of justice, police stand ready to explore any opportunities provided, either by a change in circumstances, or a qualm of conscience.
"The investigation remains open and detectives are committed to bringing those responsible to justice."
Foyle MP Mark Durkan said he hopes people with information about the attack will come forward.
"You have to hope at this stage that something would move people," he said.
"If people have had their hearts so hardened to date, or are still locked in their own prejudices, or other sick loyalties that mean they want to harbour people who've done this, maybe now this final tragic news about what has happened to Paul may move or stir someone and would appeal to anybody with any heart to do so."
In 2014 PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton apologised to the McCauley family for not bringing more people to justice for the attack.
