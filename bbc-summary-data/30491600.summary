Dr Andrew Goodall said a choice may have to be made between emergency care and non-urgent surgery.
In an extended interview with BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke, Dr Goodall said hospitals might make the decision not to schedule surgery in the first place to focus on "front door pressures" during the peak winter months.
Two hospitals, Morriston in Swansea and the Princess of Wales in Bridgend, have already cancelled some surgical procedures until after Christmas.
