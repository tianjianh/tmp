Manager Jim Bentley has hailed an "unbelievable" month for Morecambe, despite problems off the pitch.

The Shrimps' staff have twice been paid late this season with a court case ongoing over the club's ownership.
However, on the pitch Morecambe lost just one of their eight League Two games in February to move up to 14th, within six points of the play-offs.
"We can enjoy what we've done in this month, because it's been nothing short of unbelievable," Bentley, 40, said.
A takeover by businessman Joseph Cala was delayed on 3 February after Diego Lemos, who owns a share in the club's owners, G50 Holdings, obtained a court order preventing a sale.
But following a 1-1 draw at promotion-chasing Portsmouth on Tuesday, Bentley believes Morecambe, who have a game in hand on many of their rivals, should maintain their focus on the league.
"At the start of the year we were a little bit concerned with budget cuts, squad size and transfer embargoes. It's not been easy managing this football club," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"Whether we've been paid on time or not over the last few months, the players deserve every credit because we are the smallest squad in the division.
"They've turned in performance after performance, stuck together through thick and thin, through all the adversity, all the problems off the field and come out fighting every match.
"The month of February has been absolutely brilliant. It's still all to play for and we can look forward to the run-in."
