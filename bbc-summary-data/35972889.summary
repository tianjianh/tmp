Homophobia in sport: UK government to hold inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK government is to hold an inquiry into the issue of homophobia in sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Culture, Media and Sport Committee is planning to investigate the different experiences of men and women across a range of sports.
An inquiry into racism in football four years ago found homophobia was emerging as a bigger problem than other forms of discrimination.
"It is clear homophobia remains a serious issue," said Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Jesse Norman.
"We are particularly interested in looking at the possible differences between sports, and sports governing bodies, and between the experiences of sportsmen and sportswomen."
There are no openly gay male professional footballers in England or Scotland and the inquiry will hear opinions on why athletes may be fearful of being open about their sexuality.
The public can submit written submissions on the issue before the deadline of 29 April, 2016.
