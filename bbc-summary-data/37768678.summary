[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premiership: Wasps 31-6 Newcastle Falcons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wasps won for the sixth time in seven Premiership matches but their victory over Newcastle Falcons was marred by an injury to Marty Moore.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wasps prop Moore was taken off on a stretcher early on at the Ricoh Arena with a possible neck injury.
The hosts went into a 17-3 half-time lead thanks to a penalty try and one from Frank Halai.
Jimmy Gopperth then touched down twice late on against a side whose only points came from Mike Delany's boot.
The victory leaves Dai Young's side a point behind Premiership leaders Saracens - the only side to have beaten them in the league this campaign.
Newcastle have won once in their four league matches away from home this season, but this was a game that was defined by stop-start play and an injury to Moore that contributed to the first half lasting about an hour.
Both sides had tries disallowed by the television match official in the second period before Gopperth took advantage of some great play from Joe Launchbury for his side's first points of the half.
Danny Cipriani, on as a second-half replacement, then set up Gopperth for his second to give Wasps maximum points from a game in which they never looked at their best.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"It was a bit of a tired and flat performance and the scoreline flattered us. We didn't show much control today and were fortunate to get a bonus-point win.
"We've had a lot of big games lately and some of our players badly need next week off to recharge their batteries.
"He (Marty Moore) experienced neck pain and has gone to hospital. There are no symptoms in his arms and legs and one can't be too careful in these situations, but hopefully there is no real damage."
Newcastle head coach Dean Richards:
"It was another questionable TMO decision - I spoke to Simon at half-time and he said that he just went for the tackle, and therefore it's a little bit disappointing.
"The scoreline doesn't reflect the effort we put in as our defence was outstanding to make it a difficult game for them.
"We created as many chances as they did but we didn't take them, and a little bit more accuracy would have made a big difference."
