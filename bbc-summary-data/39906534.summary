But, bosses said there had been "no major impact" on the business.
"Like many organisations our plant was subject to a ransomware attack affecting some of our systems on Friday evening," a spokeswoman confirmed.
The government's emergency committee, COBRA, is due to meet to discuss the global cyber attack which also disabled NHS computers in England and Scotland.
The situation at the Wearside plant is "continuing to be monitored", but in line with normal weekend procedures no car production was taking place, the spokeswoman added.
Cyber-security firm Avast said it had seen 75,000 cases of the ransomware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - around the world.
The attack that also hit about 40 NHS organisations was "unprecedented" in scale, Europe's police agency says.
