A model of the proposed Titanic II has undergone a series of tests.

Power and speed assessments have been carried out on a 9.3m wooden replica in Germany ahead of the vessel's construction in China.
The ship, the brainchild of Australian billionaire, Clive Palmer will have similar dimensions to the original, with 840 rooms and nine decks.
Its maiden passenger voyage in 2016 will retrace the original Titanic's journey from Southampton to New York.
Mr Palmer said: "The model testing including resistance and open water tests, is an important part of the process in the Titanic II project.
"The Titanic II model was tested at speeds of up to 23 knots and this testing is crucial for assessing the speed and power performance of this prototype vessel design."
The model was tested by the German hydrodynamic service and researchers at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin.
The luxury liner is expected to make regular sailings on the transatlantic route between Southampton and New York and will have three passenger classes, like the original.
Changes from Titanic include welding - not riveting, a bulbous bow for greater fuel efficiency, diesel generation and bigger rudder and bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability.
Titanic sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg four days into the voyage.
The liner, owned by White Star Line, was then the largest in the world at just under 270m long, 53m high and weighing approximately 40,000 tonnes.
