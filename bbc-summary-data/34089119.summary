Councillors to discuss £23m Inverness sports hub

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors will next week consider a proposal for a £23m regional sports hub in Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A feasibility study has suggested that the city's Bught Park offered the best location for the centre.
It has also proposed that the flagship centre have a cycling velodrome and high quality facilities for gymnastics, athletics, judo and tennis.
Funding for the hub would depend on a successful bid for money from the UK government's City Deal scheme.
At a meeting next week councillors will be asked to agree that £150,000 be spent on commissioning detailed plans for the centre.
The idea for a hub is linked to Highland Council's West Link roads project, which already involves relocating rugby pitches and a golf course.
