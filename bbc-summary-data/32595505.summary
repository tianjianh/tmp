Labour leader Ed Miliband appealed to Scottish pride and patriotism in his final push to win votes.
Conservative leader David Cameron visited a farm shop near Dumfries, where he urged voters to think about the future of the country.
And Nick Clegg predicted the Lib Dems would do better than expected.
First Minister's Questions, which was held a day earlier than usual to avoid a clash with polling day, was dominated by the election campaign, with Ms Sturgeon fielding questions from her political rivals.
Earlier, the SNP leader told supporters in Edinburgh her party was on the brink of making history.
She said: "We are within touching distance of doing something the SNP has never done in our history.
"We are within touching distance of winning a Westminster election. And if we do that, then the voice of Scotland is going to be heard more loudly at Westminster than it has ever been heard before."
She added: "We can lock the Tories out of government but then we can make sure that the Tories are not simply replaced by a Labour Tory-light government, they are replaced by something better."
Meanwhile, in his final message to the people of Scotland ahead of the vote, Mr Miliband said: "I understand the patriotism and pride you feel in your nation.
"I know you want change. And I know you want a more socially just and fairer country. That's what I want too."
The Labour leader added: "If I'm prime minister I will hold Scotland's interests in my heart and my head.
"My party is based on values long held in Scotland and has been driven forward by great Scots like Keir Hardie and John Smith throughout our proud history."
Mr Clegg has been making his way from Lands End to John O'Groats in his election "battle bus".
On the way, he stopped off at a nursery in Bearsden where he claimed the Lib Dems would be the "surprise story" of election night - doing better than pollsters had predicted.
He said: "At the beginning of this campaign we were written off and yet tomorrow, when the polls close, the Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this general election campaign because we are going to win.
"We are going to win here against the SNP, we are going to win against Labour, we are going to win against the Conservatives.
"I'll tell you why we are going to win - because we work harder than any other political party. Because what we offer the British people is in tune with their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations for the future. And because our values are right."
David and Samantha Cameron paid a fleeting visit to Scotland as they dropped into Kilnford Barns Farm Shop near Dumfries where they met staff and apprentices and picked up some cheese and sausages.
Mr Cameron told reporters: "The key thing here is to think about the future of our country as you hold that pencil in your hand and choose to vote.
"The SNP's agenda is to break up the United Kingdom. Don't mistake their agenda for anything else, that's their aim.
"If you want a party that will keep going with a strong economy and a strong United Kingdom then you need to vote Conservative."
The Scottish Greens said they would help to build a fairer society as they campaigned in Edinburgh.
Co-convenor Patrick Harvie said: "It's time to move away from a fossil fuel dominated economy which is lurching from crisis to crisis and build a fairer, more equal society.
"Only a Green vote will put those values into the heart of our political system''.
Polling booths will be open from 07:00 to 22:00 on Thursday. Counting of votes will begin when the polls close.
