Scottish SPCA staff were called after staff found the 18in long reptile under seats on a flight that had arrived from Cancun, Mexico, on Tuesday.
They used a box to contain the snake, which is believed to be a juvenile Middle American smooth-scaled racer.
The snake was taken to the charity's animal rescue centre in Cardonald, Glasgow, where staff have named it Furtivo - Spanish for sneaky.
Scottish SPCA senior inspector Billy Linton said: "We have had the snake examined by a vet and, although we can't be 100% certain, we believe he is of the Dryadophis family, which are commonly referred to as American smooth-scaled racers.
"Racers aren't venomous but, like all snakes, they can bite and Furtivo is very feisty.
"Although small at the moment, he is still a juvenile and has a lot of growing to do."
Inspector Linton said staff at Glasgow Airport had "remained remarkably calm" after finding the snake.
"I can only imagine that Furtivo managed to sneak his way onto the plane while it was waiting to take off in Cancun, although it is also possible he has hitched a lift in someone's hand luggage," he said.
"We have rescued several exotic creatures from international flights including scorpions, spiders, turtles and even giant land snails, so this isn't as unusual as many people might think.
"Furtivo will remain in our care until we can find him an expert home with someone who has the necessary experience and knowledge to be able to look after such a creature."
