On Saturday Clare Currie spoke at a demonstration in Oxford that saw hundreds of people march through the city centre.
Her nephew's Witney constituency is in the county and he has also voiced opposition to the planned cuts.
Ms Currie, from Oxford, said: "I am here to protest against all of the cuts - I think they are a big mistake."
She added: "I would like the county council to change its mind about making such huge cuts.
"This is going to hurt everybody, particularly people who do not have enough in the first place."
The county council has said between 2010 and 2020 it has been forced to find Â£361m in savings.
The prime minister previously wrote to the local authority expressing "disappointment" at planned cuts to museums, libraries and day centres for the elderly.
But council leader Ian Hudspeth said the cuts were the result of reductions in funding from central government.
Last week it was revealed that David Cameron's mother Mary has signed a petition against the cuts.
Members of the Unite union employed in early intervention at the council will stage a 24-hour strike on 16 February in protest at the plans.
The budget will go to a full meeting of the county council on Tuesday for approval.
