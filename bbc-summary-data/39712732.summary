Ivanka Trump: Who is America's first daughter?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ivanka Trump, the oldest daughter of President Donald Trump, has quickly moved from a behind-the-scenes adviser to a White House power player.

The 35-year-old mother-of-three and her husband, Jared Kushner, have both played influential roles in Mr Trump's administration during his first months in office.
She joined German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and IMF chief Christine Lagarde, at the G20 women's summit and has sat in meetings with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping during state visits.
While her two brothers, Donald Jr and Eric Trump, took control of the family business, Ms Trump followed her father to Washington.
Ms Trump was born in New York City in 1981 to Mr Trump and his first wife, Czech model Ivana Trump.
Ivanka remained in the public eye throughout her childhood after her parents divorced when she was 10.
She began a short-lived modelling career in 1997, appearing in Seventeen magazine and on the runway for fashion brands Versace, Marc Bouwer and Thierry Mugler.
She later attended Georgetown University for two years before transferring to University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated in 2004.
Ms Trump converted to Judaism after marrying Mr Kushner, the son of a prominent New York property developer, in 2009.
The pair have three young children: Arabella, Joseph and Theodore.
Mr Trump gave his daughter a level of authority in the family business that none of his wives ever had.
She would rise to become an executive vice-president of development and acquisition along with her two brothers and is said to have handled some of the Trump Organization's biggest deals.

Jared Kushner: Who is the Trump whisperer?
Ms Trump helped expand the Trump Hotel brand abroad, handled interior design of the hotels and oversaw their international real estate brokerage, according to the Trump website.
She also launched her own eponymous fashion line, which was dropped by several retail chains as part of a Trump brand boycott after the election.
But the brand's president said the company saw a reported sales surge earlier this year amid the backlash.
She has released two books including The Trump Card, which was published in 2009, and Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, which is due out this year.
Ms Trump also appeared as a judge on her father's reality television show, The Apprentice.
She has since stepped down from her role at the Trump Organization, although she will continue to receive fixed payments from the real estate firm.
The former business executive also handed over control of her fashion line to the company's president and transferred its assets to a trust for oversight.
But some ethics experts say Ms Trump's unspecified role at the White House has raised questions about whether she is violating conflict-of-interest rules.
Donald Trump's list of potential conflicts
Ms Trump has increasingly appeared alongside her father at high-level meetings with political, business and world leaders.
She was given a coveted West Wing office and security clearance before she formally joined the Trump White House as an unpaid special assistant.
Before January's inauguration, she told CBS she would not join the administration and would instead focus on being a daughter.
But Ms Trump and her husband have become some of Mr Trump's most visible aides both at home and abroad.
Mr Kushner has been tasked with brokering peace in the Middle East, reforming the criminal justice system and managing the Office of American Innovation, which will tackle reforming the federal government and the opioid epidemic.
Ms Trump, who appealed to working women throughout her father's presidential campaign, has said she wants to focus on issues such as equal pay for women and paid parental leave.
She has frequently defended her father against criticism of his treatment of women, especially after a tape of him making obscene remarks was released during the presidential campaign.
And Ms Trump has faced her own criticism for not publicly speaking out against some of her father's more controversial actions.
"Where I disagree with my father, he knows it," she told CBS' This Morning, adding that she voices her opinion "quietly and directly and candidly".
