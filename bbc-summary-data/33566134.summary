The funeral, held in Gainsborough, included a tribute to Ms Lovett from her fiance Liam Moore, who was on holiday with her when she was killed.
He described her as the "love of his life" and said he felt "lost and empty" without her.
Mr Moore also spoke about their last moments together on the beach in Tunisia.
"She told me she loved me, I told her I loved her. I hope she took comfort that I was there with her," he said.
Ms Lovett's family said they were praying that the "evil" seen in Tunisia would end, to spare others the heartbreak they had experienced.
They said the couple's future together had been "cruelly taken away".
Canon Mike Cooney, who delivered the eulogy at All Saints' Parish Church, said: "She was a fantastic individual. She was bright, she was talented, she was creative, she was witty and amusing.
"She was great company and good with people - she was simply a lovely person."
One mourner at the church said: "It is just awful what has happened, and it is hard to believe something happening so far away can affect a small town like Gainsborough.
"We've got to show that things like this can't carry on."
Several people attending the funeral also said there should be a permanent memorial to Carly in the town.
Ms Lovett, a fashion blogger, also worked for an e-commerce company called Fizzco Ltd in Fillingham, based near Gainsborough.
