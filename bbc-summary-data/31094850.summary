Swift has spent a lot of time hanging out with the Haim trio, if her recent Instagram posts are anything to go by.
The Haim sisters are in the running at the Grammys next weekend, with a nomination for best new artist.
Swift's Shake It Off is up for three - and she already has seven Grammys to her name.
The foursome have been snapped in various poses on holiday over the past few weeks.
Riptide singer Vance Joy is also set to join Swift's 1989 tour - he will be on board for the entire North American leg.
Haim will also set off on their own North American tour in April, which takes in the Coachella festival and wraps up on 24 May in Vancouver.
Following performances at the Grammys and the Brits later this month, Swift's tour will begin on 5 May in Tokyo, Japan.
The star will also squeeze in a headline performance at Radio 1's Big Weekend, which takes place in Norwich on 23 and 24 May.
Swift said: "Everyone talks about the festivals in England being the best ones you can go to. I feel like I've been missing out - I'm really excited."
