The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she gave the Queen home-made chutney for Christmas when she first joined the Royals for the festive period.

Speaking to ITV for the Our Queen at Ninety documentary, Catherine admitted she was "worried" about the gift.
But she said it showed the Queen's "thoughtfulness" that the jar was on the table the next day at Sandringham.
The Duchess's sister Pippa Middleton included a recipe for "Granny's Marrow Chutney" in her recipe book.
The two-hour documentary, to mark the Queen's birthday in April, features interviews with 11 members of the Royal Family, including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Duke of York, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
Catherine's contribution - her first solo television interview - gives an insight into the pressure of buying a present for the woman who has virtually everything.
"I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I was thinking, 'Gosh, what should I give her?," she said.
"And I thought back to what would I give my own grandparents. And I thought, 'I'll make her something.' Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny's recipe of chutney.
"I was slightly worried about it, but I noticed the next day that it was on the table. I've noticed since she's done that on lots of occasions and I think it just shows her thoughtfulness, really, and her care in looking after everybody."
The Duchess did not reveal the recipe she used, but her Granny's Marrow Chutney is a likely contender.
The recipe - according to Pippa Middleton's book Celebrate - "has been passed down the family" and is a "great way of using up very big marrows" or courgettes.
Catherine also describes the Queen's relationship with her great-grandchildren: "George is only two-and-a-half and he calls her Gan-Gan.
"She always leaves a little gift or something in their room when we go and stay and that just shows her love for her family."
She said the Queen had provided "gentle guidance" and helped her get used to her role.
The Duke of Cambridge told the documentary that people were usually starstruck when meeting the Queen.
"I've seen people literally faint in front of her," he said. "There's a lot of trembling knees and people can't talk sometimes."
