Michelle John, Mo Adeniran, Into The Ark and Jamie Miller all made it through the semi-finals last week.
With Max Vickers, Craig Ward, Truly Ford and Jason Jones being sent home.
Meaning coach Gavin Rossdale is the only one without any acts left in the final.

I want Jamie to win. I love all of them!

I think Jamie or Into the ark should win. I love Jamie as he isn't afraid to show his emotions . Into the ark are also very unique.

I think that Jamie should win the voice, he's my personal favourite. All the other acts are amazing as well, they've got great voices! It's a shame that Gavin has none of his in the final. I think that Jennifer has the two best on her team!
