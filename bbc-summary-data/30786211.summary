The cover of the latest edition of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has been published in French media, and depicts the Prophet Muhammad.

The cover shows the Prophet holding a sign reading "I am Charlie", below the words "all is forgiven".
The magazine's lawyer Richard Malka told French radio earlier that it was important to show that staff would "cede nothing" to extremists.
Gunmen attacked the magazine's offices on Wednesday, killing 12 people.
Following the attack, the gunmen were heard shouting that they had "avenged the Prophet Muhammad".
The magazine was firebombed in 2011 after publishing Muhammad cartoons.
A total of 17 people were killed in three days of terror attacks in Paris last week.
The slogan "Je suis Charlie" or "I am Charlie" was widely used following Wednesday's attack on the magazine, as people sought to show their support.
Three million copies of Wednesday's edition are being printed. Normally only 60,000 are available each week.
Mr Malka told France Info radio: "We will not give in. The spirit of 'I am Charlie' means the right to blaspheme."
Survivors of the massacre have been working on the magazine from the offices of another French title, Liberation.
Five of Charlie Hebdo's top cartoonists were killed in the attack.
The new edition will be created "only by people from Charlie Hebdo", its financial director, Eric Portheault, told AFP news agency.
Contributions from other cartoonists were declined.
