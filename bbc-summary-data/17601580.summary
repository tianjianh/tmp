Moldova country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova emerged as an independent republic following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with its economy relying heavily on agriculture.
Two-thirds of Moldovans are of Romanian descent. The languages are virtually identical and the two countries share a common cultural heritage.
The industrialised territory to the east of the Dniester, generally known as Trans-Dniester or the Dniester region, was formally an autonomous area within Ukraine before 1940, when the Soviet Union combined it with Bessarabia to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.
This area is mainly inhabited by Russian and Ukrainian speakers. As people there became increasingly alarmed at the prospect of closer ties with Romania in the tumultuous twilight years of the Soviet Union, Trans-Dniester unilaterally declared independence from Moldova in 1990.
Fierce fighting followed. Trans-Dniester's independence has never been recognised and the region has existed in a state of limbo ever since.

President: Igor Dodon
Pro-Russian candidate Igor Dodon was elected president in November 2016 beating pro-European rival Maia Sandu with 55 percent of the vote.
His election marked the first time in 16 years that Moldova's head of state was chosen directly by the people and not by parliament.
During his election campaign Mr Dodon pledged to end Moldova's seven-year flirtation with the European Union and steer his country back towards Russia.
In 2015, Moldova was wracked by a banking scandal leading to deep public discontent over high-level corruption and poor living standards.
A former economics minister, Mr Dodon has led the Party of Socialists since 2011. His party is keen to scrap a 2014 blueprint for closer trade and political ties with the EU and instead sign up to the Russian-dominated Eurasian Customs Union.
Prime Minister: Pavel Filip
In January 2016 Pavel Filip became Moldova's third prime minister in the course of a year, the previous two having been brought down by an unfolding scandal over the embezzlement of $1bn (12.5% of GDP) from the banking system.
Like his predecessors, Mr Filip is part of the three-party pro-European-Union coalition that has run Moldova since 2009.
The internet is the second most important source of news after TV. More than 1.7 million Moldovans were online by 2015 - around 49% of the population.
The top social network is Russia's Odnoklassniki (more than 800,000 accounts) followed by Facebook (570,000 accounts).
