London Irish: Tom Coventry focuses on keeping morale high

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Irish head coach Tom Coventry says his side have "to get on with it" rather than dwell on their position at the foot of the Premiership.

Irish are eight points adrift at the bottom following a 25-17 defeat at Bath on Saturday - their 12th of the season.
"We're trying to keep our morale high," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
The Exiles have already arrived in New York before Saturday's first-ever overseas Premiership fixture against defending champions Saracens.

Victory for Worcester against fellow strugglers Newcastle on Friday left Coventry's side further behind in their quest to avoid relegation.
They came within a post's width of a losing bonus point against Bath when fly-half Greig Tonks' added-time attempted conversion struck an upright.
"When things aren't going so well, it's easy to forget why you play the game," Coventry said after defeat at The Rec.
"We came here (to Bath) to get points and we came away with zero. That hurts and the boys showed that emotionally with their body language.
"We'll lick their wounds, we'll give them a pat on the back and rub their heads and tell them to get on with it.
"That's all you can do as a coach, think of the positives and concentrate on what you're doing."
