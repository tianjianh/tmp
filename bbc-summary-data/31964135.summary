STV has won licences to run new local TV services in Aberdeen, Dundee and Ayr.

The three licences were awarded by broadcast regulator Ofcom.
STV already runs local TV services in Edinburgh and Glasgow and said the new services would be delivered in partnership with local colleges.
Its director of channels Bobby Hain said local TV was a "long-term commitment" for the company.
The three new digital terrestrial channels will be called Around Aberdeen, Ayrshire Today and View From the Bridges.
The new services will focus on news and current affairs, with media students from Robert Gordon University and North East Scotland College in Aberdeen, the University of the West of Scotland in Ayr, and Abertay University and Dundee and Angus College in Dundee given the opportunity to "learn and train in a live TV environment".
STV Glasgow launched in June 2014, with STV Edinburgh following in January 2015.
Mr Hain said: "STV is committed to delivering local content for viewers in Scotland and the award today of three additional TV licences will serve to complement our existing STV family of broadcast, online and mobile services.
"Local TV is a long-term commitment for STV and we look forward to working with our education partners in Aberdeen, Ayr and Dundee to deliver these new services."
Last month, STV announced a revamp of its stations in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Broadcasting hours were extended, with many of the same programmes now shown at the same time on both channels.
As part of the changes, magazine shows were cut to make way for more news bulletins.
Mr Hain said at the time that the stations were performing "in line with expectations".
