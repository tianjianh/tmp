The interior decorator told police that the bodyguard punched him and tied him up at the princess's chic apartment in Avenue Foch on 26 September.
Quoted by French media, the alleged victim said he was assaulted after taking photos inside the apartment.
The whereabouts of the princess, who has diplomatic immunity, are unknown. Police have now visited the apartment.
The princess's name has not been confirmed.
According to the 53-year-old interior decorator, the princess got angry with him for taking photos which she suspected he wanted to sell to the media. He said he needed the photos for the planned refurbishment of the apartment.
The bodyguard's lawyer, quoted by Le Point, said his client had only used a standard restraint technique on the workman. He denied the claim that he had "beaten him up".
