[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 1-1 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot took their unbeaten run to five games with a draw at Boreham Wood, who continue to struggle with just one win in eight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had the best chance of a goalless first half, which came in its last minute. Tony Straker and Jake Gallagher combined well to find Matt McClure in space, but his nod at goal was fielded by Grant Smith.
The game came alive in the second half. Morgan Ferrier got on the end of a swift Boreham Wood counter attack down the left, and converted under the body of Jake Cole.
Minutes later though, a Josh Wakefield cross-shot was neatly turned in by McClure for the equaliser.
