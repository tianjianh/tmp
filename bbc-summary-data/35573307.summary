The 47-year-old, who was most recently first-team coach at Bolton Wanderers, is reunited with his former Middlesbrough team-mate Hignett as first-team coach at Victoria Park.
"Curtis is a fantastic fella and it's great news for me that he's coming in," the Pools boss told the club website.
Hignett started his managerial career with a 2-1 win over Yeovil on Saturday.
The 46-year-old, who succeeded Ronnie Moore on Wednesday, also said Fleming could be joined in the new-look coaching set-up by an assistant manager.
