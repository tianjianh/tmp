Skipper Laura Delany hit 81 with Shauna Kavanagh notching 67 as Ireland managed a competitive total of 254-5.
Zimbabwe's run chase looked on course as Chipo Mugeri (57) and Modester Mupachikwa (57) produced a second-wicket stand of 115.
But Beggs' introduction saw her producing figures of 5-52.
As Zimbabwe lost their way, they were eventually bowled out for 235 with two balls of their 50 overs remaining.
YMCA seamer Beggs' victims included Mupachikwa which left Zimbabwe on 150-3 after Leah Paul had bowled Mugeri.
Gaby Lewis also produced tidy figures of 2-46 as the Irish ended the tournament in Potchefstroomon on a positive note after earlier hammerings by India and hosts South Africa.
Beggs was named player of the match after her five-wicket haul.
Seven uncapped players - Beggs, Rachel Delaney, Louise Little, Lara Maritz, Sophie MacMahon, Leah Paul and Rebecca Stokell - were included in Ireland's 15-woman squad for the tournament as a number of regulars were unavailable.
Ireland's women missed out on earning a place at this year's World Cup in England at the qualification tournament in Sri Lanka in February.
