Up to 15cm (6in) of snow was recorded in places above 300m after cold air swept in on Friday evening.
The Met Office  amber be prepared warnings for snow and high winds were lifted on Saturday evening.
A yellow "be aware" warning remains in force for the whole of Scotland and north west England until late Sunday morning.
The snow followed a day of disruption due to high winds brought by Storm Gertrude, with a gust of 105mph recorded in Shetland.
The weather led to schools being shut, power cuts, bridges closing and delays across Scotland's transport network.
Scottish Hydro said power had now been restored to those who lost supplies on Friday and overnight into Saturday.
A loss of telephone lines on Longhope in Orkney affected 999 calls but police said mobile coverage was unaffected and the coastguard station was being staffed in case anyone needed emergency assistance.
Police advised drivers to avoid the A9 at Drumochter Pass, Dalwhinnie, due to heavy snow.
The road was open but due to the adverse weather, there was queuing traffic and delays both northbound and southbound. Drivers were urged to use alternative routes where possible.
West coast ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne said its services in the north faced significant disruption on Saturday and advised passengers to check before travelling.
The company will operate additional or amended sailings on Sunday on a number of routes to clear backlogs, including Coll and Tiree, Lochboisdale and Barra, and Colonsay,
However, it warned that the arrival of Storm Henry on Monday could lead to more problems.
Calmac's operations general manager Ross Moran said: "Unfortunately Storm Gertrude has caused and is still causing extreme challenges across our network.
"We continue to advise customers to keep an eye on weather forecasts, and to check ahead on our website, app and Twitter for the latest schedule updates.
"Tomorrow's forecast indicates a lull in the weather and we will take advantage of this to operate extra or amended sailings to Coll and Tiree, Lochboisdale and Castlebay, and Colonsay. But this window does not look set to last and the Met Office is now forecasting Storm Henry on Monday."
