[SN]TITLE[SN]
Acid attack accused 'was under police surveillance'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the men accused of an acid attack on a journalist was under police surveillance, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Court in Glasgow was told Alexander Porter was watched by a covert team the day before the attack.
Mr Porter, 58, and William Burns, 56, deny assaulting Russell Findlay to the danger of his life at his Glasgow home on 23 December 2015.
The pair also deny attempting to murder Ross Sherlock by shooting at him in Bishopbriggs in September 2015.
The court heard how surveillance officers had seen Mr Porter driving in Paisley.
The officers also described seeing Mr Burns get out of Mr Porter's car and go into a store for a couple of minutes and then walk off towards Clavering Street East in Paisley.
Det Con Craig Munro told the court that he was part of a surveillance team that had kept watch on Mr Porter's house in Morar Drive, Foxbar, from 09:00 until noon on 23 December.
He was asked by prosecutor Richard Goddard: "You didn't see him outside Morar Drive and you didn't see his gold-coloured car, is that correct?" The officer replied: "No, I didn't."
Forensic scientist Louise Sonstebo told the court that she analysed liquid found in a jar in the hallway at Mr Findlay's home and said: "The liquid contained sulphuric acid - a strong acid."
She also examined liquid taken from a dado rail in the hall of the house and said it was also, in her opinion, sulphuric acid.
The scientist was asked by defence counsel Thomas Ross, representing Mr Burns: "The more concentrated it is the more likely it is to cause damage." Ms Sonstebo replied: "Yes."
He added: "If we were to hear there was no damage to the dado rail, would that suggest a lower concentration of acid," and she said: "Yes.'
The prosecution claims that the alleged offences were aggravated by a connection with serious organised crime.
The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues.
