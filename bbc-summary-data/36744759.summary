[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paedophile jailed for sex abuse of girls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fife paedophile who sexually abused young girls, including one who wrote a book about the abuse, has been jailed for five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William King, 52, raped a 12-year-old girl and forced another child to perform a sex act on him during years of abuse committed two decades ago.
King, from Dunfermline, was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The father-of-two had denied the offences but was convicted of three sex charges.
He was acquitted of a further charge of rape on a not proven verdict.
King was convicted of sexually abusing one of his victims, Dana Fowley, who has waived her right to anonymity, between August 1992 and June 1995 at houses in Edinburgh and Inverkeithing and having unlawful sexual intercourse with her as a 12-year-old child.
He was also found guilty of indecency towards a second girl who he preyed on from the age of seven until she was 10, from 1990 to 1994, at houses in Edinburgh and Inverkeithing, molesting her and forcing her to perform a sex act on him.
He had also been accused of raping the second victim, but was acquitted on that charge.
Lady Wolffe told him she had to mark "society's abhorrence" at such sexual abuse committed over a number of years towards girls who were vulnerable because of their age.
Ms Fowley said outside the court: "I am delighted. I have been waiting 19 years for this."
She said she had first reported the offending to police in 1997 and, during evidence in court, detailed some of the other abuse she had suffered as a child at the hands of her mother, King's late father, Billy senior (Ms Fowley's stepfather), his grandparents, and other accomplices.
She said: "There were more abuse days than normal days."
She said Billy King began abusing her at the age of five.
Ms Fowley, 36, told jurors how her mother was jailed for her part in the abuse along with others. Caroline Dunsmore was 43 when she was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2007.
John O'Flaherty was 50 when he was sentenced to 13 years and Morris "Mo" Petch was also 50 when he was given a life sentence the same year.
A book on her experiences called "How could she?" was later published.
The 32-year-old said the abuse had been "devastating" and added: "I never, ever forget. I live with this every single day."
Defence counsel Ronnie Renucci challenged a background report prepared on King over a claim that the likelihood of his re-offending remained high.
He said: "He accepts that a custodial sentence is inevitable. He accepts the verdict of the jury. He does not agree with it."
King was earlier put on the sex offenders register.
Det Sgt Graham Watson of Police Scotland said he hoped the sentence could give King's "brave" victims "some comfort".
He said: "King will now be spending a considerable amount of time in prison, having failed to accept and admit the suffering he caused and forcing the two women to recount again what happened to them over 20 years ago.
"Tackling sexual crime is a priority for Police Scotland, we want to encourage people to come forward."
