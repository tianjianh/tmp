Wildschut, 25, has agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract after requesting a transfer from Wigan on Monday.
The Dutchman helped the Latics win the League One title last season.
Dijks, 23, was in Norwich last week for talks, but his agent said in a Dutch newspaper that Dijks would not be moving to Carrow Road.
However, Dijks has joined the Canaries on a deal which includes an option for the English club to buy the player.
Dijks began his career with Ajax, but had a spell with Willem II before rejoining them in July 2015 and has made 15 appearances this season in the Dutch Eredivisie and Europa League.
