The France player, 30, signed from Arsenal for £25m in 2011 and made 129 Premier League appearances for City.
He won two league titles and a League Cup during his time at the Etihad, but spent last season on loan at Spanish club Sevilla.
Before completing the move, Nasri was pictured boarding a flight to Turkey.
He did go with City on their pre-season tour of the United States but had no future at the club under manager Pep Guardiola.
Antalyaspor are captained by former Barcelona forward Samuel Eto'o.
"Everybody at the club wishes Samir good luck in the next chapter of his career and would like to thank him for some fantastic memories," City said in a statement.
