Regarded as one of the most successful managers in the game, the 65-year-old has won 18 major titles, including Champions League successes with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.
"My job as a coach has finished," he said. "I'm proud of my career."
Hitzfeld will now work as a television pundit, and he joked: "I don't lose when I work on TV."
Switzerland were beaten in extra time by Argentina in their last-16 tie on Tuesday and Hitzfeld, who retires with the Swiss ranked sixth in the most up-to-date Fifa world rankings, said he will leave the game with many fond memories.
"I've had some marvellous teams," he said. "Every moment in football sticks in your memory. It's been a great honour and I have a heart full of emotion."
Hitzfeld retires with a glittering CV and was hugely respected by fellow managers, with Sir Alex Ferguson among his admirers.
The pair's most famous meeting was in the 1999 Champions League final when Ferguson's Manchester United team snatched the trophy from Hitzfeld's Bayern Munich with two late goals.
The German played as a striker during the 1970s and 80s for clubs including Basel and Stuttgart before moving into management. He enjoyed most of his success at Dortmund and Munich.
