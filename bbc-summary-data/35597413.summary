The Daily Mirror shows some England stars, including the Spurs duo, modelling the new suits which the side will wear when out in France in June and July.
Brad Friedel has told the The Sun that Hugo Lloris can be the reason that Spurs win the Premier League this season. The 44-year-old former Spurs number one says that his hard-working ethic and calm nature mean that "people can look to him even at the most nervous of times".
And manager Mauricio Pochettino looks set to stay in North London - according the London Evening Standard.
The Argentine has been subject to rumours of a move to Manchester United and Chelsea but says he is impressed with the youth set-up and that "there are all the conditions needed to carry on working here and to enjoy the culture that there is".
