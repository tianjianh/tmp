Timm van Gugten took 5-52 to pass 50 Championship wickets for the season as Leicestershire were bowled out for 96 in just 29.3 overs before lunch.
Teenager Kiran Carlson top-scored for Glamorgan with an unbeaten 74, but three wickets each from Neil Dexter and Clint McKay saw them all out for 199.
Leicestershire reached a relatively sedate 78-0 in their second innings.
Leicestershire batsman Ned Eckersley told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It was a bizarre day of cricket and definitely wasn't forecast at the start, the pitch was a little bit soft but fine.
"I'm at a loss to explain it. For our first innings a few of us, myself included, will be disappointed in the manner of the dismissals.
"But in all fairness and credit to us, to comeback from being bowled out for 96 and bowl them out, to have that fight and keep taking wickets like we did, was very impressive.
"We have given ourselves a chance of winning the game going into day two."
Glamorgan batsman Kiran Carlson told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was quite a tough wicket to get started on and that showed with a lot of people getting out early but, as soon as you got in, it flattened out a little bit as you saw with their openers at the end of the day.
"We need to come back again strongly, if we take a few quick wickets early we can make inroads in the afternoon.
"It's nice to follow up my hundred at Chelmsford and do well again in the last game of the season.
"Timm van der Gugten has been on fire the whole season, he's missed a couple of four-day games and still managed to take 50 wickets, so that's brilliant."
