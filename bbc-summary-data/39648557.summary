[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC half-back Albert Kelly has extended his deal until the end of next season after the Super League side activated a clause in his contract.

The 26-year-old Australian joined in November from rivals Hull KR and has scored nine tries in eight games.
Kelly was granted compassionate leave by Hull earlier in April but scored in their win at Leigh on Monday.
"I want us to be competitive and to be challenging for all three pieces of silverware on offer," he said.
He continued: "It was a no-brainer to extend my contract here. I like to think that I've been playing well recently and I'm in a happy place."
