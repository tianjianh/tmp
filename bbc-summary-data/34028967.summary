James Bradley, from Union Street, was last seen by his wife at their home at about 03:30 on Friday.
She contacted police about four hours later after discovering him missing, along with his car.
The locked car, a silver Vauxhall Astra, was found by police later that day, at the back of the Customhouse building at Customhouse Quay.
Mr Bradley is described as being 5ft 6ins tall, of medium build, clean shaven with a fair complexion.
He was last seen wearing a grey/white bomber-style jacket with a black lining, a blue striped shirt, black trousers and glasses.
Insp Jane Taylor, of Police Scotland, said there were "serious concerns" for his health.
She said: "Officers, including the force helicopter, have been searching the quay and around his home address, as well as checking CCTV and speaking to friends and family to try to find out where he is, however, so far there have been no further sightings of him.
"James has not been missing before and is always in contact with his family."
She said he had recently recovered from pneumonia but also had other medical issues.
"I would appeal to anyone who has seen his car, or has any information about where he is to contact police," she said.
