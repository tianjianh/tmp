Southern rail: Train drivers stage third strike day of week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern rail train drivers have begun a third strike day this week, bringing severe disruption to the network.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Aslef union is in dispute with Southern's parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) over guards' roles on trains.
Drivers walked out for 48 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday and more strike days are planned later this month.
Southern has accused the union of abusing its power but Aslef chief Mick Whelan said the firm had tried to force through changes rather than negotiate.
Aslef's next strike is planned for 24, 25 and 27 January.
Members are also operating an overtime ban.
The RMT, whose members are mostly conductors, has been involved in industrial action since last April and has announced a 24-hour strike for 23 January.
The RMT also represents 12 drivers who are also taking part in the Aslef action.
The rail operator, which is also in dispute with the RMT union, has said it will take Aslef to the Supreme Court over the industrial action.
The long-running dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into supervisors. In this role they would no longer be responsible for opening and closing carriage doors - this duty would become the responsibility of the driver.
Friday's strike comes after continued disruption on Thursday, when drivers were back at work for one day.
Commuters have said non-strike days are worse than strike days because disruption is harder to predict.
In a blog post, advertising executive Kimberley Butler, who commutes from Brighton to London, said the "real stress" came on non-strike days.
Commuter Lucy Luscombe, a management consultant, said it was "daily chaos" because she never knew when her trains from London Bridge were being cancelled, dropped at short notice or run as shorter services - making them too busy to board.
