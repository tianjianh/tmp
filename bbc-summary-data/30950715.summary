IPCC investigates delay in child abuse probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police watchdog will investigate how evidence was handled about paedophiles who bought child abuse images online, including a Cardiff deputy head.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Williams, 48, admitted 31 charges including nine of voyeurism and 20 of making indecent photos last May.
The Ysgol Glantaf teacher was caught in an international police operation.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will examine whether the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre acted quickly enough.
The evidence led to Project Spade, an investigation into child abuse images that were shared around the world.
This led to the conviction of Williams who was subsequently jailed for five years, later cut to four.
Police found recordings he made at the school where he taught and at other properties.
CEOP, now part of the National Crime Agency (NCA), had information on him some months before he committed many of his offences.
"The public are rightly concerned about the safety of the most vulnerable members of society and issues concerning the protection of children," said IPCC commissioner Carl Gumsley.
"IPCC investigators will be examining closely the actions taken by CEOP and NCA officers and staff over a 16-month period to determine if they acted appropriately and promptly as well as looking at any possible organisational failings."
