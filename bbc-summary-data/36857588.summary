Valerie Armstrong died on Wednesday night.
The youth who cannot be named because of his age is accused of causing death by dangerous driving and having no insurance.
Police told the court the teenager co-operated with officers in interviews.

The teenager wept during the court proceedings.
Mrs Armstrong, a mother of three young children, was walking her dog in Colin Glen Forest Park when the incident happened.
She died in hospital on Wednesday night surrounded by her family, who have decided to donate her organs.
