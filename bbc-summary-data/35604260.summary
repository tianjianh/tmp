Dundee's Oor Wullie bucket trail to raise charity cash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Artists have been invited to volunteer to illustrate 50 sculptures of one of Dundee's most famous fictional sons, Oor Wullie.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blank sculptures of Wullie sitting on his bucket will form a Bucket Trail across Dundee and Tayside for 10 weeks during the summer.
The trail is set to raise money for the new operating suite at Tayside's Children Hospital.
Artists have until Friday to submit ideas for how to paint the statues.
Artists who have already committed to the project include John Lowrie Morrison - known as Jolomo - who said he was delighted to be involved and could not wait to see how the paintings turned out.
The Oor Wullie sculpture has been inspired by the cartoon character's 80th anniversary. The organiser, ARCHIE Foundation, hopes the Tayside Appeal will make a difference to the lives of local sick children.
The art project also allows celebrities to contribute, with Lorraine Kelly commissioning an artist to paint one of the statues in Dundee United colours.
As the summer comes to a close in September, the sculptures will be auctioned off with all proceeds going towards The ARCHIE Foundation's appeal for Â£2m towards the new twin operating surgical suite at Tayside's Children Hospital.
