[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Van Gerwen, 27, lost the first leg but dominated the rest of the match to beat 15-time champion Taylor and secure the Â£100,000 prize money.
"Darts has changed and this man (Van Gerwen) is the greatest as far as I'm concerned," Taylor told Sky Sports.
Taylor, 55, has won 16 world titles and is widely considered the best ever.
Taylor, who had never lost a Matchplay final before van Gerwen's triumph, admitted that he had to start "making changes."
"My energy levels were not there and he bullied me. When he hits a good shot he lets you know," he added.
"I've got to start making changes and that starts Monday morning. He is phenomenal - he is."
Taylor last won the world title in 2013 and the World Matchplay in 2014.
