PSNI settles disability and sex discrimination case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Police Service of Northern Ireland has settled a discrimination case brought by a female officer for Â£11,250, without admitting liability.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She had complained about how she was treated after returning to work after maternity and sick leave because of a disability related to her pregnancy.
The woman brought her disability and sex discrimination case, aided by the Equality Commission.
The PSNI said it accepted the findings of the commission's report.
When the woman returned to work, she was given restricted duties and called to appear before an all-male attendance panel.
She was given an informal warning for unsustainable absence, but it was rescinded when she appealed the finding.
A new, mixed-gender panel that was convened five months later also found her attendance was unsatisfactory.
It issued an informal note of concern that was to remain live for two years and limited her options for applying for promotion.
In settling the case, the PSNI has also removed the note of concern from her personnel record, granted full mitigation for her period of absence, and adjusted her records and duties to take account of her disability.
The officer said: "This was an extremely difficult and stressful time for me and the way I was treated when I returned to work made it much worse."
She added: "I hope that this will lead to other officers who are faced with such difficulties being treated better by the organisation in future."
The Equality Commission's Eileen Lavery said: "Coping with ill health immediately after the birth of a child can be a very difficult experience and it is important that employers make all necessary arrangements to enable a returning member of staff resume her duties and career."
"In this case, the PSNI agreed to meet with the Equality Commission to review its policies, practices and procedures, and to consider recommendations the commission might make."
ACC Mark Hamilton, head of the PSNI's human resources department, said: "It is important to note that the PSNI were actively reviewing their attendance management policy at the time this case was settled.
"This review, which has now been completed, was not as a direct result of this discrimination case.
"That said, as a result of this particular case, we will apply learning from it in an effort to prevent any recurrence for other officers and staff."
