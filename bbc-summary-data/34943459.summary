She married Parviz Shapour, a famous satirist, at the age of 16. They had a son but their marriage ended after only two years.
In the conservative, religious society of Iran, Forough was a controversial character; a divorcee writing poetry, voicing her rage at the limitations on women.
She called for liberation and freedom, giving the women or Iran a glimpse into a world in which they could have both. Tragically, Farrokhzad died in a car crash at the age of 32.
