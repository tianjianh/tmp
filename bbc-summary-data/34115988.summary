Manchester United have signed Newport County's 17-year-old defender Regan Poole for an undisclosed fee.

The Wales Under-17 international joined United after passing a medical at the club's Carrington training ground.
Poole, who had been on trial at United and Liverpool, was the subject of a £60,000 bid plus add-ons from Championship side Hull.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for him to progress at such a magnificent club," Newport boss Terry Butcher said.
"In the past few days a number of clubs have shown an interest in Regan, but as soon as Manchester United came in there was only really going to be one outcome."
Butcher says Poole has also achieved something the former England star did not.
"He's still very young at 17. He's got the perfect stage to go and perform and the perfect place to learn," said Butcher..
"He'll love it, I'm sure.
"I nearly made it to Manchester United, but never quite so he's done something I've never done, which is brilliant."
The fee for Poole is believed to be £100,000 in a deal that could rise to £400,000.
Butcher says some of that cash will go into his playing budget.
And Kevin Feeley's departure by mutual consent also leaves Butcher with "a nice little pot to work with".
Brighton had also shown an interest in signing the young centre-back, who became Newport's youngest ever player in 2014 when he made his debut against Shrewsbury Town aged 16 years and 94 days.
Meanwhile, Newport rejected an improved £65,000 transfer deadline-day offer from Championship club Burnley for teenage striker Aaron Collins.
Newport have signed former Dagenham & Redbridge centre-back Matt Partridge on a deal until the end of the season.
Defender Kevin Feely has had his contract terminated by mutual consent. The 23-year-old is to return to his native Ireland after deciding not to pursue a career in football.
"The decision I made was a completely personal one, based on where I wanted to go with my life, at the moment I don't think football is where I want my future to be," he said.
