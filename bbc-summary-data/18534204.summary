Gareth Currie, 39, from Ballieston, died at Buchanan House, in Port Dundas Road, at 12:20 on Wednesday.
A 34-year-old man is also being treated for a head injury at Glasgow Royal Infirmary after the incident. He was said to be in a stable condition.
Police and the Health and Safety Executive have launched a joint investigation into the incident.
The building, which houses offices for Network Rail and Transport Scotland, was undergoing refurbishment work at the time of the accident.
It is thought that Mr Currie was thrown from a platform after the arm of the crane collapsed.
Mr Currie was employed by One Stop Safety Systems Ltd.
The directors of the firm said in a statement: "Our sympathies are extended to the family of our employee, Gary Currie, who was killed in the industrial accident on Wednesday afternoon.
"Our sympathies are also extended to the injured crane operator from Craig Services and Access Limited. Our thoughts are with him, his family and work colleagues, and we hope he makes a full recovery from his injuries.
"Everyone involved with our company has been greatly affected and saddened by the tragic events of yesterday afternoon. The directors of the company will do everything in our power to make sure both families are given every possible assistance and support in the days ahead."
The directors added: "In addition to carrying out our own internal investigation, One Stop Safety Systems will co-operate with the owners of the crane and the Health and Safety Executive in their investigations.
"We aim to provide the safest possible working environment for our workers and everyone connected with the company."
