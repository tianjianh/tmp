[SN]TITLE[SN]
Londonderry: Renewable energy firm fined £4,000 for polluting river

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A renewable energy company in County Londonderry has been fined £4,000 for polluting a tributary of the River Faughan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greenan Generation Ltd, which was set up by local farmers in Eglinton, admitted two charges at Londonderry Magistrate's Court on Thursday.
The offences occurred between May and October last year.
A defence solicitor said the company directors have since carried out remedial works worth about £4,000.
The spillages were described by the defence as "teething problems" in an industry which would have a positive impact on the environment.
The company is based on the Carmoney Road, Eglinton.
