The 5,000 capacity arena houses a 250m cycle track, 12-court sports hall, a gym, group exercise space and a cafe.
Previous suggestions have included naming the venue after cycling coach and Derbyshire resident, Sir Dave Brailsford.
Alison Martin of Derby City Council said talks were ongoing with potential sponsors.
Ms Martin, Labour cabinet member for leisure and culture, said: "David Brailsford has achieved so much in his life and he has contributed so much towards the achievement of this arena.
"However, we are in sponsorship negotiations... basically we need that extra funding for the city, so we will be using a sponsorship deal."
The council has said it is looking to add to the arena's current line-up for 2015 which includes Jimmy Carr, badminton events, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and pantomime Aladdin.
The Â£31m arena was opened on Thursday, three months later than originally planned, by Dame Sarah Storey, Britain's most decorated female paralympian, and Derby MP Margaret Beckett.
Team Sky boss Sir Dave has called it a "superb facility".
