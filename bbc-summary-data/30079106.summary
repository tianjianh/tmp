In pictures: Poultry on show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Poultry Show took place at the weekend at Telford in Shropshire, England. With nearly 7,000 entries on show and 500 sales pens, it is an essential event for anyone in the trade. Also at the weekend, the first case of bird flu in the UK since 2008 was confirmed at a duck breeding farm in East Yorkshire. The government has said the risk to human health is very low.

The National Poultry Show is run by the Poultry Club of Great Britain, a registered charity which aims to protect the interests of all pure and traditional breeds of poultry.
The show draws poultry fanciers from across the UK and beyond, with more than 135 breeds on show.
The idea of exhibiting poultry began to grow following the ban on cock-fighting - an activity brought to Britain by the Romans - and was restricted and finally banned by a series of Acts of Parliament between 1833 and 1845.
Records of poultry keeping date back hundreds of years, but it is only since Victorian times that standards have been recorded for specific breeds.
At the show, a Bantam Softfeather Light poses with its trophies.
Poultry fanciers admire a Midland Old English Game Large Fowl.
Eggs are also on show, and judged according to set criteria.
