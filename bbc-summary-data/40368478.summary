Bolton, 22, moves up two divisions to League One, having made 39 appearances in the National League last season.
The former Macclesfield and Halifax right-back becomes Shrewsbury manager Paul Hirst's 10th summer signing.
"It's always been my goal to play in the Football League, so if I get the opportunity I'm confident I can get up to pace," Bolton told the club website.
Although he can play at centre-back, Hirst confirmed Bolton will play at right-back in the absence of the injured Joe Riley.
