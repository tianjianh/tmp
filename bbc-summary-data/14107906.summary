Uganda country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Landlocked Uganda has transformed itself from a country with a troubled past to one of relative stability and prosperity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since its independence from Britain in 1962, the east African nation has endured a military coup, followed by a brutal military dictatorship which ended in 1979, disputed elections in 1980 and a five-year war that brought current President Yoweri Museveni to power in 1986.
The country has also had to contend with a brutal 20-year insurgency in the north, led by the Lord's Resistance Army.
While the country has won praise for its vigorous campaign against HIV/AIDS it has also attracted international attention for its hardening stance against the LGBT community.

President: Yoweri Museveni
Yoweri Museveni and his National Resistance Movement have ruled Uganda without interruption since seizing power in 1986.
He won the 2011 presidential elections after a 2005 constitutional amendment lifted presidential term limits, and went on to win again in 2016. The opposition and independent observers have complained about the fairness and transparency of these and earlier polls.
Mr Museveni has been credited with restoring relative stability and economic prosperity to Uganda following years of civil war and repression under former leaders Milton Obote and Idi Amin.
But he has also faced UN criticism for his role in the conflict in DR Congo. More recently, Uganda has been accused of aiding rebels there.
Uganda is a pioneer in the liberalisation of the media in Africa.
It boasts a vibrant media sector, with nearly 200 private radio stations and dozens of television stations and print outlets, although circulation numbers have declined in recent years.
Some key dates in Uganda's history:
