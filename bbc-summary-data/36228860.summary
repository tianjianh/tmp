Queen dismisses EU referendum petition from crown dependency group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queen has dismissed a petition from a group of Crown Dependency residents asking for a vote in the UK referendum on EU membership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Order approved at the Privy Council said the Committee of Council for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey had considered the petition, but that they advised the Queen to dismiss it.
Campaigners say the Crown Dependencies should get a vote in the EU referendum.
However, it is not constitutionally possible.
The Crown Dependencies' link to the European Union is set out in Protocol 3 of the UK's Treaty of Accession.
The Order said: "Her Majesty, having taken the Report into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to dismiss the Petition."
The petitioners - Eddie Power from the Isle of Man, Christina Morgan from Jersey and former States of Guernsey member Anthony Webber - believe the islands could be affected by the results of the UK EU referendum.
Mr Webber said: "Obviously we were very disappointed. We are being denied a chance to vote on our future.
"This is a great mistake by the UK government... we are now looking at the legal options."
Lord of the Rings actor and Isle of Man resident John Rhys-Davies, launched an online petition demanding the right to vote in the European Union referendum for those living in British Crown Dependencies.
The petition requires 10,000 signatures for the government to respond to it.
