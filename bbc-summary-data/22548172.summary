[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late Branislav Ivanovic header sealed the Europa League title for Chelsea, taking the Blues' haul to 11 trophies in 10 years with nine different managers.

The reigning champions of Europe were disjointed for large parts of the final in Amsterdam against a spirited Benfica. But a superb Fernando Torres effort followed by Ivanovic's dramatic winner leaves Chelsea with silverware to show for a disrupted, and lengthy, season.

Phil's view: The keeper was as reliable as ever and a calming presence for Chelsea when they came under pressure from Benfica. Made a brilliant second-half save from Oscar Cardozo to keep Chelsea level. A vital moment.
Phil's view: Suffered with his fellow defenders as Benfica ran Chelsea ragged in the opening phases but stuck to his task and added another medal to his vast collection.
Phil's view: Solid as ever and one of the real heroes of the modern Chelsea. A strong man who can be relied upon when the going gets tough - and he was here. And, of course, the match-winner with that towering header. Man of the match for the Blues.
Phil's view: Looked short of confidence in the first half but produced a brilliant last-ditch tackle in the closing seconds to deny Benfica a second equaliser.
Phil's view: Conceded a penalty and had his uncertain moments but a promising player who will be even better for these experiences next season.
Phil's view: Subdued and not able to impose his natural gifts on the game, although still showed flashes of that wonderful, natural close control.
Phil's view: It turned out to be a quiet night in midfield for the Brazilian playing against his former club, particularly for a player who has shown flashes of real brilliance at times recently.
Phil's view: Chelsea's captain for the night was quiet for periods but still such a threat. Another experienced head in some tough times against Benfica. Could have scored twice when he produced a brilliant save from Artur in the first half then hit the bar late on.
Phil's view: Always probing and trying to create, even when Chelsea's time in possession was scarce. Delivered the corner that led to Ivanovic's late, late winner.
Phil's views: Poor display from the midfield workhorse who operated on Chelsea's right flank. Lost possession and was caught offside far too often.
Phil's view: Left without support for much of the first hour but then revived memories of his magnificent pomp with a stunning individual goal.  Six goals in his last six Europa League games - not bad for a supposed flop.
Phil's view: This win was not the result of any great tactical genius but he did resist the temptation to make hasty changes when the tide was going against Chelsea. He can leave the club with his reputation enhanced and his head held high.
