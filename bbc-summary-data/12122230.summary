[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sue Bruce, 55, previously worked in the same job for Aberdeen City Council, turning round the fortunes of the ailing local authority.
She replaces Tom Aitchison who retired at the end of December.
Mrs Bruce said: "It's exciting to be in this role at last. A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes to help ensure a smooth transition."
She added: "The council has many skilled, experienced and committed staff, and I look forward to working with them and our elected members in serving our great capital city."
Jenny Dawe, Edinburgh City Council leader, said: "I'm very pleased Sue is now in position and able to start bringing her outstanding knowledge, experience and leadership to the role.
"She will no doubt have a difficult, but rewarding, time ahead as we deal with budgetary and other challenges in coming months and years.
"I am looking forward to working with her in the interests of the city and the people of Edinburgh."
In June 2010 Mrs Bruce was the first public sector leader to receive the Prince's Ambassador in Scotland Award.
Four months later she received the Scottish Business Insider Public Sector Leader of the Year Award.
