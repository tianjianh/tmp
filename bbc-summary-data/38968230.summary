Winks, 21, has made 13 Premier League appearances and scored against West Ham on his full debut in November.
The England Under 21 international is the latest player to sign a long-term contract at the club.
Striker Harry Kane, midfielder and England team-mate Dele Alli and France keeper Hugo Lloris have also committed their future to Spurs.
Winks is a graduate of the Tottenham academy and made his debut as a substitute against Liverpool in August.
Spurs have also given 19-year-old right-back Kyle Walker-Peters, who is yet to feature for the first team, a new deal until 2019.
