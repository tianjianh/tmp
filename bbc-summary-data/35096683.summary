The statistics have been highlighted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) as part of its Christmas campaign against domestic violence.
The campaign was launched by Det Ch Supt George Clarke.
"The sad reality is that at this time of year, the number of domestic incidents increase," he said.
"On Christmas Day alone last year, there were 79 recorded incidents and on Boxing Day, there were 111," Mr Clarke said.
The officer, who is head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, described the figures as "shocking".
"It is also important to remember that all year round, police officers respond to an incident of domestic abuse every 19 minutes," Mr Clarke said.
The PSNI campaign will run throughout December and urges victims of domestic abuse to contact police on the non-emergency 101, or in an emergency, 999.
A 24-hour domestic and sexual violence helpline is also available on 0808 802 1414.
