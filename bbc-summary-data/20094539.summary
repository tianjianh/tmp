[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rosslyn rapist Robert Greens has appeared on petition in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old was allegedly in Edinburgh Road, Penicuik, a part of the town he was banned from entering under the order, on Thursday.
Greens made a brief appearance in private before Sheriff Richard McFarlane. He was remanded in custody.
No plea or declaration was made on his behalf and the case was continued.
Earlier in the day, Greens was scheduled to appear with his solicitor at a procedural hearing in connection with the temporary order which allows police to monitor him.
His solicitor, Tony Kelly, claims the order is unfair and breaches his client's human rights.
A full hearing on the order is due to take place next month.
When the case was called in court, however, solicitor, Andy McGlone, representing the Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police, told Sheriff Alistair Noble: "There has been a development in relation to this case."
Greens, he said, had been arrested on Thursday in relation to allegations of a breach of the order.
He told the sheriff Greens was due to appear from custody in the court later.
Mr McGlone said there was a joint motion to adjourn the procedural hearing for a week in order to hear of any decision of the Crown about a possible recall of Greens.
He also asked for the Interim Order to be continued until the full hearing in November, if Greens was released on bail.
Sheriff Noble agreed to both motions.
