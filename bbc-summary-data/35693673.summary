[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 2-2 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley twice came from behind to secure a point against play-off chasing Tranmere in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were ahead when Guiseley defender Rob Atkinson inadvertently turned the ball into his own goal.
James Hurst volleyed the hosts level two minutes later before Jake Kirby's strike put Rovers back in the lead.
Again that was short-lived, as Hurst made it all square again to earn a point that leaves Guiseley five points above the relegation zone.
