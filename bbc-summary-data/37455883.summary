[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dublin taxi driver accused of trafficking 'advertised on website'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dublin taxi driver and tour guide suspected of being part of a human trafficking gang was advertising on a website, a court heard on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chee Seng Chan, who is originally from Malaysia but now lives in Dublin, appeared at Belfast Magistrates Court.
He is charged with arranging or facilitating the travel of another person, with a view to that person being exploited.
The 51-year-old appeared alongside an interpreter.
He acknowledged that he understood the charge.
Objecting to bail, a detective said he was concerned that Mr Chang had no connections with Northern Ireland and gang members in the Republic of Ireland could help him flee.
He said there was also a fear that Mr Chang may interfere with witnesses or other potential victims or delete potential evidence from the website.
The defence solicitor said the alleged victim, who is believed to be in Taiwan, has not made a signed statement, adding: "Without her, there is no case - this is a weak case."
Police said they have been liaising with Interpol and are unsure when there will be a signed statement from the alleged victim.
The PSNI have seized Mr Chang's passport, driving licence, taxi licence, and car.
The district judge denied bail and Mr Chang was remanded into custody until next month.
