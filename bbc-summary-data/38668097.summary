Bristol lecturer fell to his death exploring Indonesian cave, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A university lecturer whose body was found in a cave in Indonesia fell to his death looking for ancient paintings, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Miller, 55, of the University of the West of England in Bristol, died in the Mampu cave in Cabbeng village, South Sulawesi, in August last year.
Avon Coroner's Court that heard guides saw Mr Miller enter the cave and raised the alarm when he failed to emerge.
With no evidence of foul play, a narrative conclusion was recorded.
A pathologist concluded that he died from chest and pelvic injuries and had a background of hypertensive heart disease.
In a statement, Mr Miller's sister Karen Brown said her brother had recently become interested in ancient cave paintings.
"They believe Stephen had gone to climb a wall face inside the cave where there was an opening at the top," she said.
"The police believe Stephen lost his footing while climbing and tumbled down the wall."
Divorcee Mr Miller's credit cards and two million Indonesian Rupiah, were found with his body.
"Knowing this sum of money is a considerable amount to Indonesians, we did not suspect foul play," Mrs Brown said.
Dr Peter Harrowing, assistant coroner for Avon, said the occupational therapy senior lecturer had "died from injuries sustained following a fall".
"The effect of these injuries was compounded by hypertensive heart disease," he said.
