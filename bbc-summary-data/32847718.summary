Peter Hedley murder: Partner Clare Humble jailed for life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been jailed for life for the murder of her partner, whose body was found in a Newcastle park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Hedley, 49, from Bedlington, Northumberland, was found dead in undergrowth at Newburn Riverside Park in November.
Newcastle Crown Court heard Clare Humble, 50, also from Bedlington, beat and stabbed him and buried the body with the help of a former boyfriend.
She was told she must serve a minimum of 20 years.
The jury was told Humble persuaded her former partner Lee Nicholson, 39, to help dispose of Mr Hedley's body.
Nicholson, from Newcastle, admitted perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced later.
Humble told police that she and Mr Hedley had fought at the house they shared, but denied murder.
Mr Justice Laing said she had taken advantage of a "trusting man."
