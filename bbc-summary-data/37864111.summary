Memorial for baby ashes families in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service has taken place for families affected by the baby ashes scandal in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated at Hazlehead over a five-year period.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together and given back to relatives of the adult, while the parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
The non-denominational event was held at the city's Mither Kirk from 15:00.
The Aberdeen situation followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
