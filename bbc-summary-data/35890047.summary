Mr Sassou Nguesso has been in power since 1979, except for a five-year period after losing elections in 1992.
The constitution was changed after an October referendum to remove term and age limits which would have prevented the 72-year-old from standing again.
Riot police fired tear gas at opposition activists who complained about alleged irregularities after voting ended on Sunday in the capital, Brazzaville.
Guy-Brice Parfait Kolelas got 15% of the vote, while General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko came third with 14%, the minister said.
Before voting day, Congolese Interior Minister Raymond Mboulou had ordered telephone operators to cut all communications - telephone, text messages and the internet.
