Smoke bombs were let off and bricks thrown as police turned out in force to oversee hundreds of far-right demonstrators marching through town.
They clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators, leaving five people with minor injuries.
Kent Police said it seized more than 20 weapons including a knuckle duster.
Police said their operation ended at 17:00 GMT after they had arrested individuals for possession of offensive weapons, breaching the peace and public order offences.
Banners and placards carried by the right-wing marchers included those from the North West National Front, neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 and the Scottish Defence League.
Counter-demonstrators included members of Kent Anti-Racism Network, anti-fascist group Antifa and people with Socialist Worker placards. They were addressed by Diane Abbott, shadow secretary of state for international development.
Earlier, six people were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder at a service station on the M20 which was closed after several coaches believed to be on the way to the demonstrations were damaged.
Police said officers were called to a disturbance at Maidstone services at junction eight at 10:51 GMT. Two coaches had swastikas daubed on them in blood following a clash between two rival groups.
A coach which left the scene was stopped at junction 11 services at Westenhanger.
During the day police took away weapons including a knife, pieces of wood, glass, hammers and bricks.
A police spokesman said he could not comment on the motives of those involved, or what groups they may or may not have been a part of.
Police warned on Friday the demonstrations were expected to attract large numbers of protesters, with businesses and residents told to expect disruption.
