Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: "When we were 1-0 up at half-time, I wasn't 100% sure whether it would be enough to see it through and it was very important to say to our young players to keep their discipline and I was comfortable at 1-0.
"When you have one of your more senior players go to ground to even it up it certainly made it tough for us. They got the equalising goal and to be honest they looked like the team who were going to win it."
"I don't have a complaint, I am just disappointed for the changing room. I'm not knocking the effort or the battling performance, but when you're on a low, it's tough for them to dig in."
