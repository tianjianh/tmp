[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The festival, visiting Abergavenny this year and running until 6 August, opened in a ceremony at 13:35 BST.
Before that, there were brass bands and disco dancing competitions on Saturday morning.
The Eisteddfod is returning to Abergavenny for the first time since 1913 and is being held on the grounds of Castle Meadows.
The Woodland Trust is displaying a model of a war horse carrying a wounded soldier to mark 99 years since Hedd Wyn, Ellis Evans from Trawsfynydd, won the chair for his poem The Hero.
He was killed in World War One, just six weeks before being awarded the black chair.
