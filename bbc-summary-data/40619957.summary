Robertson took charge of his first competitive game in his second spell as boss of the Highland side as they swept aside Brechin City 3-0 in League Cup Group A.
Falkirk beat Stirling Albion 4-1 in the group's other match.
"It was a situation I never thought I'd find myself in," Robertson told BBC Scotland.
"I hadn't applied for the job. I wasn't 100% sure if I would go back into management, I had a good job at Hearts. I spoke to the club, it was a very positive chat. It was a complete shock.
"In the end I spoke to family members and they said 'would you regret it if you didn't take it?'
"They were spot on - in a year's time I would have regretted it."
Robertson was Inverness CT manager from 2002 to 2004, leading the club to the top flight for the first time in their history.
It is a feat he hopes to repeat after the club's relegation last season, and has been encouraged by the recruitment of eight players over the summer.
"It'll be a positive, attacking team, that's the way I try to play, and try to entertain people," said Robertson.
"I've been encouraged by the talent that's out there. I can assure everyone they're not coming here for the money, they're coming here for the chance to stay full-time and play and get their careers on track.
"We've got a good squad of players together. We want to be in a place to try and qualify from the group stage and then be ready for an absolute blockbuster of an opening league game against Dundee United."
Gary Warren scored a first-half double for Inverness before George Oakley added a third to give them a winning start to their League Cup campaign.
It is Falkirk who occupy top spot in the group, though, after Nathan Austin, Joe McKee and Alex Harris' first half goals were added to by Aaron Muirhead's penalty.
Darren Smith's goal three minutes from time gave the Binos a consolation.
