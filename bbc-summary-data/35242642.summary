Shrewsbury Town: Chairman still '100 per cent' behind manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town chairman Roland Wycherley insists he and his board are still "100 per cent behind" manager Micky Mellon, in the wake of the club's worst defeat in almost 52 years.

Town, still smarting from Saturday's 7-1 defeat at Chesterfield, are a point clear of trouble in 20th, having won only once in seven League One games.
"Micky has assured me it won't happen again," said Wycherley.
"Micky's a man with a good heart and a strong vision for the team."
In a statement on the club's website, he added: "We have given him our full backing as we enter this January transfer window. We all see last weekend as a huge wake-up call."
Wycherley has responded to the Chesterfield embarrassment by offering free coach travel for fans travelling to Cardiff for this Sunday's FA Cup third round tie, which has an 18:00 GMT kick-off time.
"I'd like to thank the fans that travelled with us to Chesterfield," he said. "It hurts me to say it was the worst result in 50 years, and in my tenure as chairman at the club.
"I agree with the sentiment of our captain Liam Lawrence who suggested that we refund the cost of the ticket to those fans that travelled.
"Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to identify every supporter who attended. But, in appreciation, we will run free coaches for fans travelling to Cardiff, leaving from the Greenhous Meadow."
Shrewsbury boss Mellon, who has let five-goal top scorer James Collins go to Northampton, is now hopeful of wrapping up the return of striker Andy Mangan from National League side Tranmere Rovers.
The deal is expected to go through, but the paperwork has not yet been completed.
"We've brought in Andy Mangan, who's a different type of striker," Mellon said. "The bottom line is we need to find a way of scoring more goals especially the front men."
Mangan, who scored goals against Leicester City and Chelsea in last season's League Cup run, joined Rovers on a one-year deal in the summer after leaving Shrewsbury, who had offered him a new contract.
Shrewsbury, who will be without the suspended Junior Brown at Cardiff, already have an addition to the squad, with loan defenderJack Grimmer returning to the club from Fulham.
