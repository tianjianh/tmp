[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harlequins back row Jack Clifford will miss England's autumn internationals as he requires surgery on an ankle injury.

The 23-year-old, who has won eight caps for Eddie Jones' side, is set to be sidelined for around 10 weeks.
Clifford featured as a replacement in all five of England's matches at the Six Nations and came off the bench in in the second and third Tests against Australia this summer.
He suffered the injury in Quins' 36-25 defeat by Exeter last weekend.
"It is very disappointing and unfortunate that Jack has sustained his injury," Quins director of rugby John Kingston said.
"He is a fierce competitor and I have no doubt he will work exceptionally hard to get himself back on the field as quickly as possible."
