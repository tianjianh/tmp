[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender James Clarke, midfielder Ryan Broom and forwards Ellis Harrison, Rory Gaffney and Alfie Kilgour may all sign new contracts at the League One club.
But eight players will not be staying.
Manager Darrell Clarke is set to let goalkeeper Will Puddy, defenders Bob Harris and Danny Greenslade, midfielders Cristian Montano, Dominic Thomas and Jake Gosling, plus strikers Jermaine Easter and Jamie Lucas leave.
Meanwhile, senior Rovers players Lee Mansell and Steve Mildenhall have been offered the roles of academy coach and goalkeeping coach respectively.
All other first-team players remain under contract with the club, who are 10th in the third tier with one match remaining this season, at home to Millwall on Sunday, after winning back-to-back promotions in the past two years.
