Government rejects call to drop tax referendum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The unelected members of the House of Lords like nothing better than discussing elections.

Perhaps it brings back happier memories for those who have previously stood for election before being ennobled.
Welsh Liberal Democrat Lady Humphreys used question time today to raise an issue on many a voter's minds: when will the new ballot papers naming the top four candidates on Welsh assembly regional lists be revealed? (A Liberal Democrat amendment to the Wales Act 2014 will mean voters discover the names of some of those seeking election, even if they can only vote for a party in that part of the election).
Government whip Viscount Younger of Leckie told her the details of how this would be achieved would be laid before parliament later this autumn.
Her question sparked a mini-debate on Welsh legislation past, present and future. Another Lib Dem, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked for the requirement to hold a referendum before the Welsh government can vary income tax rates to be dropped.
Lord Thomas said it was being used as an excuse for a delay in seeking the powers: "Will the government use the forthcoming Welsh bill to remove this block and make the Welsh government accountable for its gross failure in maintaining standards in health and education in Wales?"
Viscount Younger rejected the request: "The Wales Act and the St David's Day agreement empower the Welsh government with the tools and levers it needs to grow the Welsh economy so we believe that the referendum is right as part and parcel of giving the Welsh people more say in terms of their powers."
Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas, AM for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, asked if the government's policy was to seek the consent of a majority assembly members for any future Wales bill.
Viscount Younger said it told peers the next Wales bill - due to be published in draft version next week - "will appear here before too long...there are no dates".
