Almost 130 bank branches have closed or will close in Wales over five years, figures obtained by the BBC have shown.

By the end of April this year, HSBC will have shut 51 of 131 branches, NatWest 52, Barclays 18 and Lloyds seven.
The banks said a drop in customers' use of local branches and a rise in online and mobile banking were the main reasons for the closures.
Former Welsh Secretary John Morris said action was needed.
Lord Morris has a family home in Llandysul, Ceredigion, where three banks have closed in four years.
He told BBC Radio Cymru: "I'm worried there's a lack of a plan at the moment.
"I think some kind of board has to be set up to look at the problem and make some recommendations which can be considered by the government."
Barclays' south Wales director, Mervyn Owen, said: "Banking patterns have changed. A lot of customers are going online now and using their phones. So, there's been a major decline in the use of local branches."
