The family of a 19-year-old who was fatally stabbed in Flintshire has described him as a "wonderful young man".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mathew Cassidy, 19, from Liverpool, died in Connah's Quay on 29 May.
A man, also 19 and from Liverpool, has been remanded in custody to stand trial for murder in November.
Mr Cassidy's family said their loss was "tragic and devastating" and would be "forever etched in our hearts and on our minds".
They said in a statement: "Matthew was a funny, caring, thoughtful and loving son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin to his family.
"He will be remembered as someone who was always fiercely loyal to those that mattered to him.
"He had a big heart and loved all of his family, but none more so than his young cousin... When Matthew and his cousin played together Matthew's face would light up with a big smile. The love was obvious for all to see."
'In love with life'
Mr Cassidy, a fan of music and attending music festivals, had been starting out on a career in construction and "loved nothing more than to be busy," his family said.
"There would always be some music being played out of his bedroom and the passion and vibrancy of a young man in love with life rippled outwards for all to see and hear."
North Wales Police said two other men who were being held on suspicion of murder have been released pending further investigation.
