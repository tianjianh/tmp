[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bowes Museum Silver Swan returns from London exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 240-year-old musical automaton has returned to its County Durham home following a visit to London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Silver Swan was purchased by the founders of the Bowes Museum in 1872 and until recently had only left the building for conservation purposes.
During February and March it was one of the star attractions at the Science Museum's "Robots" exhibition.
It is now back in time for Easter and visitors can once again see it put through its paces every afternoon.
The life-sized artefact, which comes to life once a day, twists its head, preens, and catches a fish.
