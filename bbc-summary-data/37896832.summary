Paul Lambert: New Wolves head coach keen to have 'major say' at Molineux

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newly appointed Wolves head coach Paul Lambert says he hopes to have a "major say" in his role at the club.

Former Aston Villa manager Lambert, 47, who won the European Cup in his playing days with Borussia Dortmund, is already conditioned to the concept of what he calls "the German model".
He will work alongside sporting director Kevin Thelwell at Molineux.
"I've seen how it can benefit. It takes a bit of pressure off dealing with certain things," Lambert told BBC WM.
"I'm pretty sure I'll have a major say in what's going on at this club. It would be wrong if I'm not.
"I know the German model, with a sporting director, and how it works, and I'm looking forward to working closely with Kevin."
After a summer transfer window in which Wolves made 12 signings, the club's new owners Fosun International gave Walter Zenga just 14 games before deciding their wholesale changes had not worked.
It is reported that funds are there for Lambert to spend again in January but, although he expects the right of veto over signings, he does not guarantee new arrivals - especially if there is an upturn in form.
"I need to be fair to the lads I've already got here," Lambert added. "Some will go with it, some will maybe struggle."
Paul Lambert has taken over a side lying 19th in the Championship. But he only has to look at the impact Steve Bruce has had across the West Midlands at Villa - and he knows clubs have come from further back than Wolves to win promotion.
"I don't see why we can't make a run of it," said Lambert. "There are still a lot of games to play. It's an unforgiving league because of the amount of games, but anybody who puts a run on can get in there.
"There's a great expectancy level. But I need a club with an expectancy level. I've always been at clubs where expectancy levels are really high. I enjoy the pressure of it.
"But I need to try and make the players hungry for success. I know we need to do better than what we're doing to get out of this league."
Rob Edwards, who was promoted to number two under Walter Zenga, had been caretaker boss for the last two games, since the Italian's departure. The Telford-born Wales international defender, 33, played for Aston Villa, Wolves, Blackpool and Barnsley, also briefly playing for Lambert on loan at Norwich in 2011, prior to his premature retirement with a knee injury.
Former central defender Stuart Taylor, 41, spent his playing career in Scotland with St Mirren, Airdrie, Falkirk, Partick Thistle, St Johnstone, Ross County and Hamilton Academical. He managed Limerick in the League Of Ireland before working with Lambert as part of Villa's development squad.

Paul Lambert appeared relaxed, refreshed and reassured at his press conference, cutting a rather different figure to when he was last seen in this region at Villa.
He pronounced himself satisfied with the structure of the club that he would be joining, and made it clear - politely, but plainly - that he would be the controlling influence on the team and transfer dealings.
Kevin Thelwell, the club's sporting director, also spoke impressively as he handled some pointed questioning about the club's methods since the takeover in the summer.
Thelwell led the club to the important recruitment of Kenny Jackett three years ago, and has taken the lead in bringing Lambert to Molineux. Like Lambert, he laid out clear demarcation lines in public and, with those established, Wolves supporters have every reason to feel optimistic about the appointment.
