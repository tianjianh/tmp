Ashley Daniel Talbot, 15, was run over by PE teacher Chris Brooks, 34, at Maesteg Comprehensive School, Bridgend county, on 10 December 2014.
In January, police confirmed Mr Brooks would not face any criminal action.
A second 13-year-old boy suffered minor injuries in the crash.
A family tribute released after his death said: "Our son was our life and he was loved as a brother and we wouldn't change him for the world.
"He was a typical teenager, a practical joker with a wicked infectious laugh."
South Wales Police said it had questioned Mr Brooks but confirmed no action would be taken against him.
The force said Ashley's family had been informed about the latest development.
