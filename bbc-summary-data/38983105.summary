[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere remain four points behind National League leaders Lincoln as Andy Cook's early double earned them a 2-1 win over Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was just 33 seconds old when Cook controlled Liam Ridehalgh's cross and finished on the turn - and a similar finish from a 13th-minute Ben Tollitt corner doubled the lead and brought him his 17th of the season.
Cook went close to a hat-trick with a header into the ground which bounced over the crossbar, while James Norwood had a shot tipped wide on the stroke of half-time.
Tranmere were good value for their lead at the break, though goalkeeper Scott Davies had to keep out Ricky Shakes, Frank Keita and even his own team-mate Steve McNulty.
Davies tipped Matt Paine's header onto a post early in the second period, before Bruno Andrade flicked in a late consolation for the visitors from a free-kick.
