Competitors will have their trigger fingers at the ready to try to get Maserati Trofeos, a Bentley Continental and a Chevrolet Camaro to be the fastest on the track.
Each will compete in a six car 10 lap race around a 28ft (8.55m) circuit.
Similar heats have been held elsewhere in the UK and Europe.
The final rounds are taking place at the English Martyrs Church Hall in Goring-by-Sea, and at Marquee Models in the Harvey Centre, Harlow.
Last year, Australian Peter Dimmers was crowned world champion, with Ann Bird, from East Preston, in West Sussex, the runner-up.
Ms Bird also won the event in Goring, with a time of 26.93 seconds.
Mr Dimmers' time was 23.12 seconds, which was recorded in Australia.
There were also heats in Singapore and Barbados during 2014.
Anyone can turn up at Saturday's events - which are taking place between 11:00 and 16:00 GMT - and race as many times as they want.
The winner of each has their time added to the leader board, with the fastest winning race time of the day then added to the world leader board.
Prizes will be awarded for the fastest time each hour and to the overall winner and top under-16 racer of the day.
Organiser and joint founder of Worthing HO Racing Andy Player said competitors would race on exactly the same Scalextric Digital layout as the other championship events and use the same Scalextric cars and controllers.
