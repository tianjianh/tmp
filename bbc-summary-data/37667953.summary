[SN]TITLE[SN]
More than 70 WW1 names added to Brookwood memorial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The names of 77 men and women killed during World War One are being added to the 1914-1918 War Memorial at Brookwood Military Cemetery in Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The individuals had not previously been commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC).
It said they may have come home and died of injuries or illnesses from the war and it had not been informed.
The CWGC said there were "still many cases to be resolved" and the memorial had room for further names to be added.
The new memorial to the fallen of World War One was unveiled at the cemetery last year.
Most of the names have been inscribed on panels at the CWGC's workshop in France, but more than 15 have been engraved at the site.
The Brookwood 1914-1918 War Memorial commemorates the missing and casualties with no known grave.
The majority are servicemen and women from the land forces of the UK.
Brookwood Military Cemetery contains 1,601 Commonwealth burials from World War One and 3,476 from World War Two.
