The 29-year-old came on as a substitute for Northern Ireland on Saturday when Stuart Dallas' late winner ensured a 1-0 victory in World Cup qualifying.
"I heard about the fact they (Qarabag) were supposedly interested in me but I haven't heard anything more," he said.
"Who knows what could happen if Qarabag come in with an offer for me?".
"Obviously I've spent a few days there and from what I've seen the city is fantastic and I was really impressed by the stadium," added Lafferty.
Dallas' dramatic late strike strengthened his country's hold on second spot in their qualifying group.
They did so in the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, home to Qarabag, who are believed to have shown an interest in luring Lafferty following his release by Norwich City in the summer.
Six of Azerbaijan's starting XI on Saturday play for Qarabag, the club who have won the Azerbaijan title for four years in a row.
Lafferty has previously shown a willingness to ply his trade further afield after spells in Switzerland, Italy and Turkey.
His limited playing time at Norwich over the past three years has seen him slip down the pecking order at international level, though Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill is confident he will be a success wherever he ends up, provided he is shown some love.
"He needs to go somewhere where first of all he's happy that he's valued and if you make Kyle feel like that, he'll do well for you, simple as that," O'Neill said last week.
"If he goes to a club that really want him, really value him and he makes the right decision in terms of the move he makes, I've no doubts he'll be a good signing for any club."
