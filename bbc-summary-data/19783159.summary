The whale, which is about 10m (33ft) in length, was washed up at Shingle Street, near Hollesley shortly after 15:00 BST on Sunday.
The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said it was a juvenile fin whale and that a post-mortem examination would be carried out on Tuesday.
Suffolk Police warned people to stay clear of the carcass, which has been tied down.

Rob Deaville, manager of the cetacean stranding investigation programme for ZSL, said fin whales were a "fairly unusual species to be found beached in the UK".
He said that last year, out of 600 strandings in the country, only about five would have been fin whales.
"Looking at photos, it does look a little bit on the thin side, so starvation may be a factor but we have an open mind," he said.
Andrew Capell, of HM Coastguard Search and Rescue, said: "We answered the call and we originally thought it would be a porpoise, because we tend to get them quite a bit.
"But we arrived on the beach to find this rather handsome animal.
"There are a few grazes on it where it has been on the shingle, but there is no other wounds or injuries.
"There's a lot of interest today as it is not the sort of thing you see in Suffolk."
A crew from Aldeburgh Lifeboat station was also called to Shingle Street.
Coxswain Steven Saint said: "Unfortunately it had already died when the crew were there - but there were reports it had been in the water a short time before."
Another whale died after being stranded at a beach in Bridlington, east Yorkshire, on Sunday.
