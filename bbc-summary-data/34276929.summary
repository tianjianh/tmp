Derbyshire have released all-rounder Jonathan Clare.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old made his debut in 2007 and played 136 times for the club in all formats
He made 57 first-class appearances, taking 154 wickets with career-best figures of 7-74 and scoring 1,725 runs, including two centuries.
Clare said: "It's been a pleasure to represent the club but it is now time for a new challenge and I'm looking forward to continuing my career."
Elite performance director Graeme Welch said: "Jonathan has worked extremely hard over the last two years to overcome a back injury.
"He has shown a real determination, but with the number of young players coming through, it was the right time for him to look for regular first-team action elsewhere. We wish him all the best."
