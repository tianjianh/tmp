The suspect is described as white, about 5ft 7in tall, with a medium build.
At the time of the robbery, he was wearing a dark hooded jacket and dark trousers. He was also wearing a balaclava to disguise his face and he had a local accent.
Officers will be carrying out door-to-door inquiries and gathering CCTV images from the local area.
Det Con Emma McLaughlin, of Police Scotland, said: "There are other stores, such as a takeaway and a local shop nearby and it's possible someone may have seen the man before the incident, perhaps he was loitering outside, maybe you saw him acting a little suspiciously.
"If you have any information or knowledge of the incident or the suspect, then please do contact us."
