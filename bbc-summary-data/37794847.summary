Terror review suggests London police forces should merge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major review of London's ability to deal with a terror attack has suggested the three police forces serving the capital could be merged.

Lord Harris of Haringey said the Home Office should consider combining the Met Police, the City of London Police and the British Transport Police (BTP).
The review was ordered by mayor Sadiq Khan to assess London's security.
Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there was "good argument" for a merger, but others had concerns.
Saying the current set-up was "confusing" and the move would save money, Sir Bernard added: "We should get improved operational effectiveness and that's what this report is talking about: how to respond to a terrorist incident - would we respond better together? And I think we would."
But the City of London Police said the paper itself had noted that merging forces would cause "significant disruption".
In his review Lord Harris, a security adviser who chaired the Metropolitan Police Authority, concluded that any response to a terror attack would now be "substantially faster and more effective" than five years ago.
But, he said, even though the intelligence agencies and the counter-terrorist police operating in London were among the best in the world, the city should be prepared for an attack with multiple fatalities.
The review also found that, once the Met had completed its recruitment of 600 extra firearms officers, there would be no need for a further increase.
To do so "would be at the cost of transforming the look and feel of our capital city", it said.
A total of 127 recommendations were made in the paper.
Lord Harris also said live CCTV streaming should be extended across London.
Earlier this year Mr Khan intervened after Westminster Council announced it would turn off its fixed CCTV cameras to save money.
City of London Police said it welcomed the review but warned against merging it with the Met.
"As the report clearly states, policing in London needs stability and certainty, not upheaval and disruption," they said.
The BTP's Paul Crowther welcomed the report but said: "Over the past eight years, there have been a number of studies that have examined the rationale and effectiveness of a dedicated transport police force.
"Each study has unequivocally concluded that there is a need for a specialist national force, which can provide 'end to end' policing and an understanding of this complex environment."
