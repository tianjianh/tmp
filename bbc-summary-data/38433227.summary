[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 0-0 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield remain deep in relegation trouble after they were held to a goalless draw by MK Dons in a lacklustre game at the Proact Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides lacked quality and invention although the visitors came close to winning it in the final minutes with substitute Daniel Powell forcing Ryan Fulton into an outstanding save.
The first 25 minutes was devoid of quality or incident but Chesterfield almost broke through when Ched Evans' run through the centre was halted by Paul Downing's sliding challenge.
Chesterfield went closer in the 32nd minute when Ian Evatt's header from a corner was blocked on the line by a combination of goalkeeper David Martin and Ben Reeves.
MK Dons created little in the first half but Chuks Aneke's pass sent Nicky Maynard into the area in the 55th minute, only for Liam O'Neil to get his challenge right to deny the striker.
Maynard's overhead kick in the 71st minute forced Fulton into a diving save as the visitors enjoyed their best period of the match and Joe Walsh put a free header over from a corner in the 79th minute.
Fulton made an even better save in the 83rd minute when he turned a Powell shot behind after the substitute broke through on the left.
