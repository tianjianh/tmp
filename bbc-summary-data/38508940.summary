Janet Commins: IPCC inquiry into 1976 murder investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police watchdogs are investigating how North Wales Police handled the inquiry into the rape and murder of schoolgirl Janet Commins over 40 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-year-old's body was found on a school playing field in Flint in 1976.
A man was jailed for 12 years after admitting manslaughter. However in September 2016, Stephen Hough, 57, was charged with her rape and murder.
Police voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
The IPCC will look at whether officers in the initial investigation acted in accordance with the rules in place at the time relating to the detention and interviewing of suspects.
It will also investigate how the force handled new information that came to light in 2006.
IPCC Commissioner for Wales, Jan Williams, said: "This will be a complex investigation not least because of the passage of time, but it is important for all concerned that we independently investigate the case."
