[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is BBC Radio 6 Music presenter Mark Radcliffe.
Radcliffe, who also hosts The Folk Show on BBC Radio 2, is a season-ticket holder at Manchester City and is backing them to beat Chelsea on Sunday.
You can make your own predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.

Radcliffe has been a City fan since he was a boy and watched them regularly since 1976 when he moved to Manchester.
"It is difficult to pick out one moment as the highlight of my time following City," he told BBC Sport. "It is tempting to pick the glory days and I suppose when Sergio Aguero scored that goal to win us the Premier League in 2012, I was there watching it and wondering 'has that actually just happened?'
"It seemed impossible. It was so surreal and the sort of thing that never happened to City.
"I suppose that is my greatest moment although I am always drawn back to Paul Dickov scoring at Wembley, with his famous 95th-minute equaliser in the play-off final in 1999, because I do think that was the key moment in the City story of recent times.
"Lose that, and we were staring into the abyss but we won and it felt like we were on the way back. So my head would say Aguero but my heart would go back to Dickov, on his knees at Wembley."
You can hear more of Mark's tales about following City on Football Focus at 12:15 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got two correct results from 10 Premier League games, with no perfect scores.
His score of 20 points saw him draw with former England cricketer Graeme Swann who also picked two correct results.
The Premier League team top of the Predictor leaderboard after week one is Watford, with an average score of 57 points, while the 13-15 age-group has the highest average score of 55 points.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).

Mark's prediction: 2-1
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Mark's prediction: I think Stoke will do well this season but I would not call them a surprise package because I think people are expecting them to do quite well. I've just got a funny feeling that Kane won't have the season he just had and that Spurs might falter. 1-1
Match report
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Mark's prediction: West Brom looked pretty indifferent on Monday night but they were playing us and Pulis got his team wrong. 1-0

Mark's prediction: After what happened to Arsenal against West Ham, Palace will have great belief and I think they could do this. 2-1

Lawro's prediction: 1-0
Mark's prediction: We looked like we meant business against West Brom. I have got to go for a City win again although I can't see there being much in it. 2-1
