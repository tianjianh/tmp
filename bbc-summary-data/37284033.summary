At a news conference, team members played an audio recording of the person allegedly offering various incentives.
Canada must beat El Salvador in Vancouver and hope Mexico defeat Honduras in the final round of Group A games to stand a chance of progressing.
El Salvador cannot progress to the final round of qualifying.
"It's the most dramatic thing in football I've seen for some time now," investigative journalist Declan Hill told the BBC World Service.
The most they would have got for allegedly fixing the match would have been about $3,000 per player
"The entire team came in with their coaches and said they had been approached on Saturday. They played an 11-minute conversation with the attempted match-fixer.
"He was offering each player a variety of money per minute depending on the result they could get. The most they would have got for allegedly fixing the match would have been about $3,000 per player."
Hill said the offer was allegedly made by an El Salvadorian who knew some of the players, but who wanted to aid the Honduras national team.
The BBC has approached the Honduras football association for comment.
Canada, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico are members of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf).
Three Concacaf nations will qualify for the 2018 World Cup automatically, with a fourth entering a play-off against a team from the Asian Football Confederation.
