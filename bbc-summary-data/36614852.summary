EU referendum reaction
Daniel Kawczynski, Conservative MP for Shrewsbury & Atcham, said he was elated by the result.
"It is time to stand proud and tall as the fifth largest economy in the world, a permanent member of the UN security council and a member of the G7.
"This country punches above its weight and I have every confidence in our future."
But Richard Yates chairman of the Shropshire Branch of the National Farmers' Unions said he was concerned for the future of the country and his business.
"I fear it will lead to a break up of the UK. As a farmer and a businessman I am in unknown territory."
Brexit: What happens now?
Lucy Allan, Conservative MP for Telford, said she was pleased the Leave campaign won. She said: "I think it's to do with feeling under-represented, ignored, cut off from the political elites.
"Also it's a question of low wages being undercut by people coming in - those are the issues that people tell me they have concerns about."
Mark Pritchard, Conservative MP for Wrekin who had campaigned to remain in the EU, said the most important thing now was to restore stability in Britain and negotiate the best exit terms.
Gavin Denton, a commuter in Telford who voted to remain, told Radio Shropshire the result was "shocking" and rejected the agreement for a peaceful Europe after World War Two.
"I don't think anyone expected that it would happen," he said.
"I've felt European all my life."
But William Mantle, from Bridgnorth, was happy to be leaving the EU.
"Finally the glasses are off and people can really see what the European Union is all about," he said. "It's a corrupt organisation for the elite."
Thomas Holt, a winemaker who brings his produce from Spain to Shrewsbury,  said the result has had an "instant impact" on his business by making his products more expensive.
"I'm very worried about the future, and I think it's a dark day for the UK," he said.
Adam Fejfer, a Polish man working in Shropshire, also said he was worried about the future.
He said: "Probably I will have to spend a few good quid for my British citizenship, which will be expensive for me and my family. I am really scared."
