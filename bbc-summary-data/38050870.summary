Lincolnshire Police to recruit local officers only

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force which launched a worldwide search for a new chief constable is restricting applications for new officer positions to locals.

Lincolnshire Police said recruits had to have lived in the county for the past 12 months.
Last month, the job advert to replace Chief Constable Neil Rhodes was promoted overseas.
One employment lawyer described the force's policy as "potentially discriminatory".

In a statement on the force's website, Mr Rhodes said he wanted "the force to reflect the community it serves and for applicants to have an understanding of the county and issues facing the public of Lincolnshire".
Lincolnshire Police said it was planning to recruit "around 150 [officers] over the next couple of years".
A spokeswoman for the force said the recruitment of the chief constable was a matter for the county's police and crime commissioner and that other ranks in the force "are promoted internally or from time to time we accept transferees from other forces".
Mary Walker, a partner at Andrew Jackson Solicitors and an expert in employment law, said the force would have to decide if the locals-only policy was "proportionate" and "legitimate".
"Does the need for that local knowledge outweigh the potential of discrimination on other potential recruits?" she said.
Some other forces in England and Wales have a similar policy.
The Metropolitan Police said since 2014 recruits had to have lived in London for three of the past six years.
