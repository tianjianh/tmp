Lee Nutley, who featured in the second series, was pronounced dead at the property in Kingston Road, Stockton.
Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and a file was being prepared for the coroner.
Critics said the show stigmatised the poor and in 2014 residents worried it would portray the town in a bad light.
A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said officers had been called to the scene on Monday by the ambulance service.
Mr Nutley was one of the residents of the street followed by cameras for the controversial documentary show.
In his biography on the Channel 4 website before the series aired last year, it said: "Lee relies on his next-door neighbour Julie and the other residents of Kingston Road more than ever.
"With every appliance in his home broken he can't even cook himself a meal.
"Lee has been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for the past year, living on Â£45 a week after being laid off by the construction company he worked for."
The biography also said he found himself "in a constant battle with both ill health and the benefits system."
