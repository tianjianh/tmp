[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Forrester grabbed a stoppage-time winner as Peterborough completed a derby double over Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posh notched their third league in on the bounce, but they were made to work for it with Adam Smith in good form in goal for the visitors.
Forrester and Leonardo Da Silva Lopes both went close early on, while Marcus Maddison was twice denied by Smith and Tom Nichols shot just wide.
Zander Diamond's header was saved at the other end by Luke McGee, while Alex Revell and Paul Anderson were wasteful when well-positioned in front of goal.
McGee produced a double-save from Sam Hoskins and Revell in quick succession, while Smith continued to frustrate Peterborough by saving from Da Silva Lopes to ensure the sides went in level at the break.
The game opened up in the second half and Brendon Moloney fired just over the bar from the edge of the box for the hosts, as did Jak McCourt.
Both sides had good chances late on, but it was two minutes into stoppage-time when the deadlock was finally broken as Forrester headed home at the far post for his third goal of the season.
