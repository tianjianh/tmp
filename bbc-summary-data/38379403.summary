Middlesbrough must focus on their own performances and results in the quest to retain their Premier League status, says midfielder Marten De Roon.

Saturday's 3-0 win against Swansea, another side battling to stay in the top flight, put Boro four points above the bottom three after 17 games.
Fellow strugglers Burnley are the Teessiders' Boxing Day opponents.
"We just have to win our games and not look too much at the teams around us," De Roon told BBC Tees.
Boro's position was boosted at the weekend by defeats for Hull, Crystal Palace and Burnley, although Sunderland and West Ham both won.
The trip to Turf Moor is a potentially daunting one for Aitor Karanka's side, as none of the bottom 10 teams have won as many home games this season as the Clarets.
However, victory would put Boro on 21 points, and importantly stretch the gap between them and Sean Dyche's side to four points.
"We have to give ourselves a really big Christmas gift which would be three points," De Roon added.
"The teams around you, to win those games are the most important and we will be ready for next Monday."
