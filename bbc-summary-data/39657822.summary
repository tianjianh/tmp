Jim Clark Museum in Duns races towards funding goal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fundraising campaign towards a museum celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One champion Jim Clark is closing in on its target.

The drive was launched this year to raise the final £300,000 towards the project in Duns in the Borders.
A crowdfunding campaign which is coming to a close has raised more than £90,000, with more than £175,000 coming from direct donations and other groups.
The Jim Clark Trust has urged the public to keep contributions coming.
It thanked all the supporters who had already backed the proposals, which will cost £1.6m in total.
It has secured £1.3m but launched the campaign earlier this year to bridge the funding gap.
It is now within about £35,000 of that goal.
Scottish Borders Council has pledged £620,000 towards the museum with a similar sum coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Planning permission has been given, subject to the work starting in the next three years.
It is hoped the development could be completed by 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany, aged just 32.
The driver was born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in the Borders, and was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965. He won a total of 25 grand prix races.
