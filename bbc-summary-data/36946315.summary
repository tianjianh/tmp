Champions League winners Real took the lead when Marco Anensio scored with a thunderous long-range strike.
Europa League winners Sevilla levelled through Franco Vazquez and Yevhen Konoplyanka's penalty gave them the lead after Sergio Ramos fouled Vitolo.
Ramos made it 2-2 to force extra time before Carvajal won it for Real.
The former Bayer Leverkusen player scored after a powerful run into the penalty area to earn Zinedine Zidane his second trophy since being appointed Real boss in January.
Sevilla, who beat Liverpool in last season's Europa League final, have appeared in the past three Super Cups and lost all three.
Jorge Sampaoli, who took over after Unai Emery was appointed Paris St-Germain boss, looked set for a fine win before Ramos made it 2-2 with a header three minutes into stoppage time to force an additional 30 minutes.
Real were missing key players, with Cristiano Ronaldo having been injured playing for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final, while Welshman Gareth Bale and Germany's Toni Kroos had extended breaks because of their involvement at the same tournament.
"We were trailing for all of the second half, but Madrid never give up and a goal in 90 minutes allowed us to become champions," Carvajal, 24, said.
"Today we had a lot of players missing but we have a great squad of homegrown players."
Real Madrid, who have not won La Liga since 2012, start their 2016-17 campaign away to Real Sociedad on 21 August, while Sevilla are at home to Espanyol a day earlier.
