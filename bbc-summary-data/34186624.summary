Health trusts fined over Jade Norton bed fall death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two health trusts have been fined £60,000 over the death of a disabled 10-year-old who fell from her faulty bed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jade Norton suffocated when plastic sheets fell on her in at her home in Blackpool in June 2011.
Blackpool Primary Healthcare and North Lancashire Primary Care trusts admitted health and safety breaches.
Her family asked on five occasions for a fault to be repaired, Preston Crown Court heard.
The court was told of the "multiple failings" from the trusts and prosecutor Lisa Roberts, for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said the errors "went back four years."
She said: "She was sleeping in a bed with rails that were blatantly not safe.
"She was unable to move once the bed had failed."
Miss Roberts said the North Lancashire trust had no record of the bed's existence and took no action when it was reported damaged.
Advantage Healthcare Ltd, now Interserve Care Ltd, responsible for providing care to Jade, was also fined £50,000 after admitting two health and safety breaches.
Jade, who was severely disabled with Rett syndrome, suffered an epileptic seizure when she became trapped between the mattress and sheeting.
The rail was supposed to prevent her falling out of the bed when she was having a seizure.
Her parents, Amanda, 42, and Lee, 41, had reported the broken bed on five occasions in three months before her death, the court heard.
Judge Stuart Baker said the risks were all "foreseen and preventable" and the breaches "contributed materially" to Jade's death.
The court heard no remedial action was ever taken and risk assessments of the bed were not carried out, despite Jade being found in a similar position twice previously and her seizures worsening.
Jade, who also had scoliosis, was prescribed a bed with railings to stop her rolling from the bed - but the top left railing was damaged in the months before her death.
Bernard Thorogood, for NHS Litigation Services, issued an apology to Jade's family, adding they were "touched by the terrible events."
Jade's father said: "Judge Baker could have imposed a £500,000 fine but it would not have made a difference, it still wouldn't bring my Jade back."
He said he hoped the case would be a "massive wake-up call" for organisations.
