Abdi Gutale, from Leytonstone, was killed when a gunman opened fire as he drove his Vauxhall Zafira down a residential street early on Saturday.
He was with friends in his car having just finished work when the shots were fired near the Melbourne Road and Capworth Street junction in Leyton.
Mr Gutale reversed to try to escape but hit a parked car and died at the scene.
One of his friends was shot in the foot.
Det Ch Insp Andrew Packer said: "From witness reports it appears in the immediate aftermath there were people running away from the scene.
"I continue to appeal to anyone who was in the area and witnessed this incident, or who has any information that could assist this investigation to come forward and speak to police."
Two men aged 19 and 31 were arrested on suspicion of murder and released on bail until early July.
