Wales are lucky to have two top fly-halves available in Sam Davies and Dan Biggar, says Ospreys coach Steve Tandy.

Davies created the Ospreys' only try for Josh Matavesi and kicked eight points in their 13-9 Pro12 win in Edinburgh on Friday.
Biggar - currently Wales' first-choice number 10 - was not released from the national squad for the match.
"We're really pleased, and Wales should be satisfied in having two top-end 10s," said Tandy.
Davies, a replacement in Wales' 29-13 defeat by Scotland, was one of six Ospreys players released by Wales for the match.
The fact he was allowed to play is being interpreted as confirmation Biggar remains ahead of him in the fly-half pecking order for the Six Nations match against Ireland on 10 March.
But it might also reflect the fact that Davies has not played much rugby during the last month and needed a run-out.
In any event, the 23-year-old was named man of the match at wet and windy Myreside.
"It's great for me, we've got two outstanding 10s for different games," Tandy told BBC Radio Wales.
"There's a heavy workload with international rugby and regional rugby, Sam can play at 15 and we can move things around.
"Whoever plays for Wales against Ireland and France will definitely not let that shirt down."
The win in Scotland lifted Ospreys top of the Pro12 ahead of Saturday's match between Leinster and Scarlets.
The Swansea-based region had to put in a huge defensive effort to hold on for the victory in freezing rain on a muddy Myreside pitch.
"Huge plaudits have to go to our defensive effort, it was tough out there at the end," Davies told BBC Wales.
"The conditions were (rain) coming down hard, it was windy and they had the momentum but we stuck in there and ground out the win, it was a huge defensive shift."
Davies not only kicked his goals but provided the one moment of inspiration in a dour game, making the break and providing a deft pass to put Matavesi over between the posts.
"A lot of credit has to go to the boys around me, opening gaps up so there were a lot of options for me," he added.
"Luckily I picked the right one and Josh's communication was world-class so I could drop it off for him to get under the sticks."
Davies will join fellow Ospreys Nicky Smith, Rhodri Jones, Rory Thornton, James King and Olly Cracknell in returning to the Wales squad on Sunday, ahead of the Ireland game.
