A sublime pass by Joe Allen set up Aaron Ramsey for the first goal, Neil Taylor doubled the lead and Gareth Bale scored his third goal of the tournament to cap a performance he described as the "best I've ever been involved in" for Wales.
But who were Wales' best players in Toulouse?
A spectator for most of the match, but alert to deny Artem Dzyuba in the first half.
Under less pressure defensively than against England, freeing him to fly down the right flank with gusto.
Never flustered, the West Brom defender continued his fine form with some important interceptions, with one contributing to the opening goal.
Coped with the physical threat of Artem Dzyuba and marshalled Wales' defence through a relatively simple 90 minutes.
Always composed in possession, covered Neil Taylor well as the wing-back pushed forward.
Untroubled defensively, scored his first goal for club or country since 2010 to cap an energetic display.
Busy defensive work and one-touch passing helped Wales start the match at a furious pace.
Enjoying an excellent tournament and gave his best display yet, battling ferociously and providing a brilliant assist for the opening goal.
Man of the match. Arguably his greatest game for Wales, scoring a fine goal and threading intricate passes at will to pick holes in the Russian defence.
Tormented Russia's defence with a performance brimming with power, pace and purpose, yet could have scored to make the winning margin even greater.
Something of a surprise starter, the Burnley striker missed a good early chance but provided a solid outlet for Wales on the attack.

Solid enough when introduced late on to give Joe Allen a deserved rest.
First appearance of the tournament was a routine one, helping Wales see out the game.
Another making his competition bow, on too late to make much of an impression.
