Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper's Twitter suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Sandwell Council's Twitter account was temporarily suspended amid claims he had posted a private image of a community activist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Cooper posted the picture of Darryl Magher on his @sandwellleader profile.
Twitter suspended the account but it had been reinstated by 15:30 GMT.
Mr Magher said the Labour leader and Smethwick councillor had posted the image in a bid to suppress him and stop him asking difficult questions.
"He does not like being challenged and held to account," said Mr Magher, who runs a Facebook page about the Yew Tree area of Sandwell.
But Mr Cooper said the image concerned was already in the public domain.
He said he had been a victim of trolling and said the complaint was part of a campaign of harassment mounted against him.
Asked on BBC WM if he had done anything wrong, he said: "I don't think so. I try to stay within the realms of decency and modesty.
"People have a go at you, usually political opponents, and sometimes you have a go back, but I'm not aware of anything I have done that would breach Twitter rules."
Twitter said they did not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.
It referred the BBC to the website's rules.
