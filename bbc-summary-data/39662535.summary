England's Florentyna Parker and Sophie Walker, along with Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh, are a stroke off the lead.
Nordqvist, ranked 10th in the world, carded six birdies and one bogey on a windy day at Club de Golf Terramar.
"I know I grew up in Sweden, but I've been in the heat for so long now that I don't do very well with the cold weather," the Swede said.
