[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shots dominated the opening half but it took until first-half stoppage time for them to go ahead.
A superb counter-attack started by Callum Reynolds saw the ball played in to Shamir Fenelon and he fed Kundai Benyu, whose cross was parried but Fenelon was on hand to drill into the top corner.
The hosts doubled their advantage in the 70th minute when Bernard Mensah's pull-back from the left touchline found Jake Gallagher and his shot deflected off team-mate Scott Rendell and past Magnus Norman.
Southport pulled back a consolation with the last kick of the game as Andrai Jones lifted the ball over Jake Cole after meeting a cross from the left.
