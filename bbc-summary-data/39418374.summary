Nicholas Anthony Churton, 67, was found dead at an address in Crescent Close at about 08:20 BST on Monday.
North Wales Police is searching for Jordan Davidson, 25, on suspicion of murder.
Det Supt Iestyn Davies warned Mr Davidson must not be approached as he may have weapons.
A post-mortem examination showed Mr Churton died of significant head injuries between 14.45 on Thursday and midnight on Friday 24 March.
Det Supt Davies said Mr Churton, former owner of Churtons wine bar in Rossett, lived alone at the property and was a "vulnerable man". His family have been informed.
"If anyone sees Mr Davidson or knows of his whereabouts, I'd ask that they contact police immediately, but under no circumstances should anyone approach him as he may be in possession of weapons," he said.
"I also want to reassure the public that every effort is being made to locate the suspect. There are increased reassurance patrols in and around the town and people will notice an active police presence as we carry out enquiries."
Properties in Vernon Street, in Rhosddu, and Lysfaen Road, in Old Colwyn, have been searched as part of the investigation.
A man, 35, and woman, 27, both from the Old Colwyn area, and a 27-year-old man from Wrexham were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.
