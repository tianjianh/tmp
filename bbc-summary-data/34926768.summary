Criminal Justice Inspection criticises police PPS files

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inspectors have criticised the quality of police files sent to the Public Prosecution Service for it to decide whether to take a case to court.

Over 45,500 case files were submitted to the PPS by the police in 2013-14.
A report published by Criminal Justice Inspection says a sample review found that a third were either of an unsatisfactory or poor standard.
The inspectors also expressed serious concerns about the level of disclosure of information to defence legal teams.
Brendan McGuigan, the CJI chief inspector, said disclosure was dealt with satisfactorily by police in only 23% of crown court cases.
He said this was "unacceptable".
"The statutory duty placed on both the police and prosecution to disclose material which may be of assistance to the defence has become germane to achieving a fair trial," he said.
"Disclosure is an integral part of the criminal justice process and when statutory obligations are not met, it can lead to a number of potentially damaging outcomes including abuse of process arguments at trial and the acquittal of an accused person."
The inspectors recommend that the PSNI establishes a new disclosure unit, and that the PPS gives the police greater support and guidance to ensure that legal obligations are met.
On the quality of files sent to the PPS by police, the report says too many are not submitted on time, or to an acceptable standard.
It also criticises the Public Prosecution Service, saying it must do more to set out clear guidance about the quality of files it expects and needs to make a decision about whether a case should go to court.
"Poor quality files leads to increased costs, court adjournments, avoidable delay and in the worst cases, prosecutions being discontinued, all of which weakens public confidence in the justice system," Mr McGuigan said.
The inspectors say the problems with file quality are due to a combination of factors.
These include a lack of knowledge and understanding among police officers, weaknesses in supervision and quality assurance, and a failure to properly use electronic systems.
This is not the first time the quality of police files has been criticised by inspectors, but CJI says it is "heartened" by the response from the PSNI and PPS.
Chief Constable George Hamilton and the director of public prosecutions Barra McGrory QC have established a prosecution team to work collaboratively to address the issues raised.
In a joint statement, the PPS and PSNI said they accepted the report's six strategic recommendations.
"Both organisations face significant pressures to deliver their respective service with fewer resources, and we are committed to working collaboratively to overcome longstanding challenges that contribute to delays in getting cases to court," they said.
"This will see us re-design and re-balance our working relationship to facilitate maximum focus on areas of greatest importance."
