Dewi and Dwynwen, named after two of Wales' most renowned patron saints, are nestled in a romantic "cwtch".
Their arrival marks the launch of a campaign by heritage body Cadw to bring Wales' history to life.
Four-metre (13ft) wide, smoke-breathing Dewi attracted a record-breaking 120,000 visitors to eight Cadw sites across Wales in 2016.
His new companion Dwynwen, resplendent in purple, has been created at the same Cardiff-based prop company Wild Creations as Dewi.
Secretary for economy and infrastructure Ken Skates said: "The Welsh dragon first appeared on Henry Tudor's flags at the Battle of Bosworth, and more than 500 years later, it is still a celebrated emblem of Wales which Cadw is proud to have brought to life."
Dewi and Dwynwen weigh two tonnes, and were sculpted and moulded before being cast out of fibreglass,
Caernarfon Castle has free entry today to celebrate St David's Day and visitors to the town's square will be able to meet the Cadw dragons for free until 16:00 GMT.
Dwynwen is at Caernarfon Castle throughout March, while Dewi will be at Harlech Castle until the end of the month before making an appearance at Wrexham's DragonFest on 1 April.
