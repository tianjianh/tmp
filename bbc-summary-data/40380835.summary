On Wednesday, coach Warren Gatland selected his Lions XV for Saturday's first Test against New Zealand.

Over the last 36 hours, you have been having your say.
Using the BBC's selection list, fans picked the team that they thought stood the best chance of undoing the back-to-back world champion All Blacks.
And, based on the data as of 08:00 BST on Friday, there have been some differences of opinion between the coach and the popular vote.
The most marked difference was in the second row.
Gatland included Welshman Alun Wyn Jones, but admitted it was a "toss-of-a-coin" decision to go for the 31-year-old over England's Maro Itoje.
BBC users would have called it the other way by some margin.
Itoje was picked in the second row in 75% of the teams selected. By contrast, Jones was chosen to partner George Kruis - the most popular lock choice - in just 26% of teams.
BBC Sport users overwhelmingly backed Gatland's decision to bring back Owen Farrell in place of Johnny Sexton at fly-half after the England number 10 recovered from a thigh injury.
Farrell was picked at stand-off in 69% of teams, with Sexton lagging behind on 21%.
The decision to drop wing George North - a veteran of the series victory in Australia four years ago - was also replicated in your teams.
Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly - Gatland's starting wings - were picked in that position by 59% and 51% of selectors. North managed 32%.
Full-back was a trickier call.
Leigh Halfpenny was the most popular choice in that particular position,
He was full-back in 43% of teams, ahead of Gatland's pick Liam Williams, who got the nod at 15 from 36% of selectors.
However Williams suffered for his versatility and was included as a wing in more than twice as many teams as Halfpenny.
Overall, Williams was the 15th most selected player, a few hundred picks ahead of Halfpenny.
We've included Halfpenny at full-back, but, as Gatland said of his second-row options, it was a "toss-of-the-coin" call.

Who would you select in your Test XV for the Lions?
Use the numbers as they correspond to positions. So, one is loose-head prop, two is hooker, three tight-head prop, four and five are second rows, six is blind-side flanker, seven open-side flanker and eight - well that's the number eight, obviously.
For the backs, nine is scrum-half, 10 fly-half, 11 is left wing, 12 inside centre, 13 outside centre, 14 right wing and 15 is full-back.
