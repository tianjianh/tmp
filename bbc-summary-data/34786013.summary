A two-minute silence was observed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - the time in 1918 when the guns finally fell silent along the Western Front.
Services took place in Wrexham, Caernarfon, Gwynedd, and the Infantry Battle School, Brecon, Powys.
Commemorations in towns and villages throughout Wales have also taken place.
At the Cenotaph in London, singer Cerys Matthews read an extract from The Times newspaper from October 1915 about the deaths of 41 only sons in battle.
In Cardiff, an exhibition has opened at the Senedd which tells stories of soldiers and their families from World War One.
In Wrexham, a two-minute silence was held, while a wartime air raid siren will be sounded at 18:30 GMT.
At the same time, in Caernarfon, the names of almost 11,000 men who died in World War One were projected on to the walls of the castle.
