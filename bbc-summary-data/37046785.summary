Etoile defeated  Kawkab Marrakech of Morocco 3-1 in Sousse to continue the defence of their title.
Trailing Kawkab by five points after two Group B games, Etoile then won three consecutive fixtures to take an unassailable four-point lead over the Moroccans.
Iheb Msakni scored either side of a Hamza Lahmar goal to give Etoile a three-goal advantage just after half-time before Ahmed Chagou pulled one back.
FUS Rabat booked their semi-final place in Africa's second-tier club competition with a 1-1 draw against Al Ahly Tripoli of Libya in a game switched to Tunis for security reasons.
Gambian Youssoupha Njie gave the Rabat outfit a second-half lead that was cancelled by Rabie Allafi 10 minutes later to end a run of four straight Ahly losses.
FUS have 11 points, Etoile 10, Kawkab six and Ahly one with the remaining two fixtures scheduled for 23/24 August.
In Group A,  bottom side Young Africans of Tanzania secured a 1-0 win over Algeria's Mouloudia Bejaia - their first victory of the group phase.
A goal from Amis Tambwe in the third minute was enough to keep alive Young Africans' faint hopes of progressing and puts them just a point adrift of both Mouloudia Bejaia and Ghana's Medeama.
That result will boost Medeama ahead of Sunday's match against Group A leaders TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who have already qualified for the last four.
Coach Prince Owusu admits that a heavy international and domestic fixture load has affected his squad and forced him to rotate his line-up, often to the annoyance of supporters.
"We are going through hell when it comes to fixtures," the coach told the Ghanaian media. "We always seem to be travelling, either in Ghana or in Africa.
"When we return home from Confederation Cup matches, we have to play catch-up in the domestic league. It is not an easy situation.
"People say that most European clubs play twice a week so why are we unhappy, but journeys there are usually much shorter and smoother.
"I really appreciate what my boys are doing. Rotation helps, but some supporters believe we should always start with our best players."
Mazembe clinched a semi-finals place last month with two match days to go.
They are five points ahead of second-place Medeama and Mouloudia Bejaia in third.
Zambia winger and captain Rainford Kalaba scored twice to help Mazembe beat Medeama 3-1 in Congolese mining city Lubumbashi in June after Malik Akowuah had given the visitors a first-minute lead.
While Medeama are competing in Africa for only the second time, Mazembe won nine Confederation of African Football competitions between 1967 and last year.
Young Africans have a mathematical chance of snatching the second semi-finals ticket and must avenge a 1-0 away defeat by Bejaia to stay in contention.
