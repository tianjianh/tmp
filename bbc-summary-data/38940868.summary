[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following the news that Wrexham boss Dean Keates has signed a new three-and-a-half year contract, the Dragons failed to find a breakthrough.
They paid the price when Scott Rendell scored with 20 minutes remaining, before Jim Kellermann made certain.
Aldershot remain seventh and in touch with the play-offs, while Wrexham are tenth, ten points off fifth.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"It is a feeling of disappointment after that one, obviously we are the home side and the expectation is to win football matches at home.
"In the first half we were ok but we were not bang at it. In the second half you give Aldershot credit, I thought they were outstanding and dictated the tempo of the game.
"We are frustrated, we needed to take our chances in the first half.
"It is not good enough, our decent run has come to an end and we need a reaction now."
