Dr Dyfed Elis Gruffydd has disputed research, led by University College London (UCL),  which found the bluestones came from outcrops at Carn Goedog and Craig Rhos-y-felin.
Following excavations, the team of archaeologists and geologists said the stones may have been first used in a local monument near the quarries and then dismantled and taken to Wiltshire.
But Dr Gruffydd said no evidence of human quarrying had been found at the sites.
