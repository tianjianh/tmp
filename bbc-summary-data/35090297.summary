High rise in Northern Ireland private sector employment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Employment growth in Northern Ireland's private sector rose at its fastest rate for more than a year, but manufacturers are continuing to shed jobs.

That is according to the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November from Ulster Bank.
It gives an idea of how firms in the private sector are doing in terms of job creation, business activity and new orders.
Firms took on staff in November at their fastest rate for 14 months.
This growth was driven by improvements in services and construction, but shows a more worrying slowdown in manufacturing.
This comes after hundreds of job losses were announced at the Michelin tyre factory in Ballymena, County Antrim, last month.
Exports have stayed flat and the strength of sterling is making it harder to secure new business from abroad.
Chief economist at Ulster Bank Richard Ramsey said: "The pace of growth in business activity and new orders accelerated relative to the modest levels of expansion recorded in October.
"However, these rates of growth remain below the pre-recession historical average.
"The improvement in services and construction firms concealed a slowdown in retail sales and outright contraction within manufacturing."
