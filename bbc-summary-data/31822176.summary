Pound v euro: European holidays just got cheaper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An extra 16% free cash to go on holiday sounds pretty good because that's what you'll get if you're planning on heading to Europe this year.

It hasn't been so cheap to visit the 19 countries that make up the eurozone since 2007.
Europe's economy growing more slowly than the UK and fears over Greece leaving the single currency are behind the rise.
It comes at the most popular time of year for young adults to book holidays.
Daisy Parker from travel association Abta says: "For the under-30s, with the pound at a seven-year high and day-to-day prices coming down in the eurozone, it's a great time to travel to Europe."
The pound is also currently struggling at it's lowest point for a year against the dollar making trips to the America more expensive.
So let's do some maths.
Say you planned to spend Â£500 during a trip to Spain.
That could get you up to 700 euros at the moment. Compare that to last year you'd be lucky to get near 600 euros.
For people buying bigger items like a car from Germany or a holiday home in France the difference can now run into thousands of pounds.
Some currency analysts expect things to get even better by the summer holidays.
RBS economist Sebastian Burnside says things can change quickly.
"So has it reached its peak? No-one knows for sure what will happen to currencies, but there'll be many more bumps in the road before a long-term solution to the Greek bailout crisis is reached.
"Recent history shows that the pound has benefited from that uncertainty."
If you plan on heading further away from home the pound is also flying strong against both the South African Rand and the Australian Dollar.
Eighteen months ago I reported from Sydney for Newsbeat about the expense of following the British and Irish Lions.
Back then you couldn't get much more than Aus $1.50 to the pound but now it's closer to Aus $2.00 making an expensive trip a touch more affordable.
The question arises should we wait for the pound to get stronger? That's a tricky one.
With a general election around the corner that brings uncertainty to the money markets no matter what the result.
There are also the other advantages to booking now according to Daisy Parker from Abta.
"Booking this far in advance gives you time to save for your holiday as well as the advantage of widespread availability, with your choice of where to stay much less restricted than booking last minute."
Of course it's important to remember that the place you exchange your money to go on holiday often makes just as big a dent as variations in the currency.
