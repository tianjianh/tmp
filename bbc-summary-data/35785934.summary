The 29-year-old won the title by beating Darleys Perez in November, less than a year after fracturing his skull when confronting burglars.
Venezuelan Barroso beat Kevin Mitchell for the interim title in December.
"This is a tough task but there was no way I was not going to take the fight," said Manchester's Crolla.
"I enjoyed a break since winning the title, but I have been in the gym for a while already and I am in a good place.
"People said I was going to duck him. If I don't fight him I lose my belt, simple. Of course I am going to fight him.
"I've worked too hard to become world champion to give it away."
Barroso, 33, has won 19 of his 21 fights, drawing the other two.
