Allin, who played one first-class match and one List A game for the county before leaving in 2013, also represented Devon and Cardiff MCCU.
"Everyone at Edgbaston is immensely saddened by the news," Warwickshire said in a statement.
"Tom was an incredibly popular member of the professional squad during his six years with Warwickshire."
It is the second tragedy to hit cricket in a matter of days following the death of Sussex bowler Matthew Hobden at the age of 22.
