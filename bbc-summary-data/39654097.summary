Met PC Joshua Savage denies charges over Camden 'car attack'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Met officer has pleaded not guilty to four offences, including possession of a bladed article, over an alleged attack on a car in a stop-and-search.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Joshua Savage, of Wanstead, is also charged with common assault, criminal damage to a windscreen and threatening behaviour over the alleged incident in Camden on 16 September 2016.
Footage of the stop in Vicars Road was circulated on social media at the time.
PC Savage denied the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier.
The footage, filmed by the driver and shared on social media, appeared to show an officer smashing a windscreen during a stop and search and then sawing the windscreen with a blade.
PC Savage, who is currently on restricted duties with the Met Police, is next due to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 18 May.
