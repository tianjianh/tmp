[SN]TITLE[SN]
Loos with a view - no chain - on sale in Barry Island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A heritage "loo with a view" has gone on sale in Barry Island and is expected to fetch more than Â£50,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade-II listed public toilets closed 15 years ago and the new owners can expect to spend more than a penny renovating the concrete building.
Built in 1923, its symmetrical neo-classical facade has earned it its listed status.
It is expected to become a cafe or restaurant for tourists, with a view of the beach and Bristol Channel.
