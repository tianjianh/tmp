[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The attack happened in Beechmount Crescent at about 20:00 BST on Tuesday.
The man, who is in his 30s, was shot once in the right leg. He was treated in hospital for non life threatening injuries and has since been discharged.
West Belfast SDLP councillor, Colin Keenan, condemned the attack and said vigilantism and violence were never justified.
He said: "People need to put their faith in the rule of law and not take believe they have the right to judge people and administer violence.
"History has shown us paramilitary-style shootings did not solve social issues in the past and will not solve them now."
Police have appealed to anyone with information about the attack to contact them or call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously.
