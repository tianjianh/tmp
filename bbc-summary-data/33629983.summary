The workers were trapped in Friday's blast at Wood Flour Mills in Bosley, near Macclesfield.
Police said a body found on Sunday is "probably that" of Will Barks, 51, but a second body, recovered on Tuesday, is yet to be identified.
Cheshire Fire manager Steven Barnes said they could not "put a timeframe" on finding the remaining people.
"We are continuing to make our best efforts to make progress," he said.
Mr Barks, is feared dead along with fellow workers Jason Shingler, 38, Derek Moore and Dorothy Bailey, both 62.
Their families will visit the site, which is owned by Wood Treatment Ltd - part of The Boden Group of Companies.
Assistant Chief Constable Guy Hindle, from Cheshire Police, said: "For their own reasons [the families] would like to see the level of activity... to search for the missing people, and also to pay their respects and understand the nature of the scene.
"That'll be a difficult time for them all."
Temperatures reached 1,000C during the explosion and blaze, which caused the collapse of the four-storey building.
Police are conducting an investigation with the fire service and Health and Safety Executive.
ACC Guy Hindle said the site was a "potential crime scene".
He said: "We have the potential for four people to have been killed in an industrial incident.
"This is not a narrow, short investigation - it will be a long and detailed investigation."
"We are liaising closely with the company, who are assisting us."
On Tuesday, Mr Barks' father Geoff Hobson, from Leek in Staffordshire, criticised Wood Treatment Ltd.
He said he had "heard absolutely nothing" from the company, "except a feeble apology".
"It's not good enough," he added.
The company has not responded to a request for a comment.
The site was also struck by fires in 2010 and 2012.
Wood is processed at the plant into a fine powder and the resulting "wood flour", with a consistency like sand, is used to make laminate flooring.
