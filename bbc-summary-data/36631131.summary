Leave voters: Surprised', 'anxious' and 'pleased'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters who opted to leave the European Union in Thursday's landmark referendum have been reflecting on their decision, in the wake of the momentous result.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With more than two million people signing a petition calling for a second referendum - and the hashtag #wearethe48 trending on Saturday - Leave voters give their reaction and share their thoughts after voting to take the UK out of the EU.
I voted to leave the EU but the result was, frankly, a surprise to me, as it was for many people.
I am very pro-Europe and the UK is still part of Europe but the EU today bears little or no resemblance to the one I voted for many years ago.
It has not matured and its ideology is flawed. The UK has had very little influence on the decisions taken in the EU and the laws and sovereignty of this country have been eroded and threatened.
I expect the British parliament to be accountable to the voting population to carry out their promises and policies and that is our democracy.
If the government do not do this, they can be voted out and replaced. We do not need the approval of the EU to govern our country.
Our government needs to appoint the best negotiators to carry out the exit process and stabilise the current uncertainty. Bickering about the result is pointless and undemocratic in the political arena.
The UK population needs to pull together now. The democratic process is over. We need to show others in Europe that huge reforms in the EU are necessary if it is to continue.
I voted for membership of the European Economic Community 40 years. I voted for what I thought was free trade between the UK and the six founder countries.
I did not vote for what the EU was becoming, which appeared to be a federal state run by Brussels bureaucrats who I believe do not serve the interests of any of the EU member states.
For this reason, I voted Leave on Thursday. Although I have felt some anxiety, I also feel hopeful.
I have no doubt we will see some turbulent economic times initially, but we have seen economic turbulence through the recession, and prior to that, with the high interest rates and inflation of the 1970s and 80s.
As an "out" voter, I am still European. I still believe in mutually beneficial trade deals, both with Europe, and the rest of the world, and I support controlled immigration.
Britain was, is, and will continue to be a great country. I am optimistic. We should see "brexit" as an opportunity.
I voted to leave the EU because I feel that the British public are regarded as insignificant.
We need to be able to make our own decisions that affect us including our laws and our spending, not least how much money goes to the EU.
The amount of money we send to the EU is atrocious.
The government called for a vote to stay in or leave the EU and the people of Britain voted out.
The outcome of the vote should be respected. Otherwise the voters of this country will only have a voice when the result is what the politicians want to hear.
It should be remembered that this is a democracy and everyone should respect the wishes of the majority.
I voted out, even taking into account the impact this may have on my job.
It was time we took control of our own destiny and the interests of the British public.
Too long we have been the puppet of Europe, having to pay an extortionate amount of money for the privilege.
All the money we spend on being a member of the EU could have been spent on other much more important matters such as doctors' wages, instead of supporting the countries that can't control their own economies such as Greece, Spain and Portugal.
There are many reasons why this period will be difficult, especially for my employers and customers. We have already seen impacts on exchange rates.
We don't know how it will effect our general trading terms. The remain campaigners who are calling for a re-vote should be ashamed.
The turnout was the highest for many years, even more than the last general election.
The British public came out in their millions to voice the opinion which has resulted in leaving the EU.
If we were to do a re-vote that would completely undermine any future public votes in this country.
So even after hearing all that may happen, I would not change the way I voted.
I voted out and am pleased to have done so. It was the result I wanted and we can now start taking control of our own finances.
All my friends also voted out. It makes no sense to be in. As a lawyer, I see nonsense legislation from Europe that we have no say in.
I don't have an issue with immigration but it needs to be kept under control, to help our NHS and benefits system.
We can't keep bailing out poorer countries. If there was a stricter test on them coming in then maybe I would have voted in.
I'm more than happy with my choice. We knew the pound would crash but give it a couple of months and it won't affect our economy that much.
It will grow, with more markets opening up which were previously restricted by the EU. The Germans will still sell us cars and the French will sell us wine. We can still travel there.
People are just scared of change. It looks like we have taken the brave move and others may follow.
I voted out and after reading the reactions of some in Europe and here at home, I am now convinced I voted the right way.
This was meant to be a democratic election, yet those who lost are seeking a second referendum and now we're being bullied into a quick exit from those in European positions of power.
That's hardly a democratic response..
Scotland now want a second independence referendum. Were they not conscious when they had the first one that a Brexit might be coming in the future?
If Scotland do want to become independent and stay within the EU, then I wish them the very best of luck.
