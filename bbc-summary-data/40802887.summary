Swastikas and far-right images were displayed on the Queen Street screen on Tuesday night after a hacker gained control and selected what was shown.
Writing in an anonymous online post, the hacker claimed there was a security vulnerability with the screens.
BlowUP media, which controls the billboard, has been contacted for comment.
South Wales Police said they had received a number of calls relating to the incident.
A spokesman added: "We alerted the city council and will investigate any crimes which may have been committed."
Cardiff council said it had contacted the company that owns and operates the screen and it was switched off at midnight.
