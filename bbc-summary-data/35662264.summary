Brighton hospital on 'black alert' as demand rises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital has been placed on the highest level of alert to cope with A&E demand and a shortage of beds.

Brighton's Royal Sussex County Hospital said exceptionally heavy demand had triggered black alert status, following a rise in people going to A&E.
Chief Nurse Sherree Fagge urged people to use A&E appropriately and said it was a tough environment for staff.
Gary Palmer from the GMB union said members were near breaking point and "really concerned".
Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS said a black alert meant there was heavy A&E demand and insufficient beds available in the hospital.
The trust said black alert triggered a system-wide response that tried to increase the number of patients being discharged, and the flow of patients through the whole hospital.
All A&E patients were being seen by a clinician within 20 minutes and being made comfortable and monitored in a safe environment, the trust added.
Ms Fagge said: "We are confident that we are keeping patients safe, but it is a very tough environment for staff to work in at the moment.
"We ask the public to use A&E appropriately and to use the many alternative services available if they do not require emergency treatment."
But Mr Palmer said: "Our members are full out. There is no respite at the moment, and with continuing underfunding and cuts, it is only going to get worse."
He added: "Everybody keeps talking about peaks and troughs within A&E. Our members aren't finding that. Those are now being evened out and they're under stress and strain every day of the week, 52 weeks a year."
The NHS trust has not yet responded to Mr Palmer's comments.
