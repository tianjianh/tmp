The Scottish government was asked last week to look at the business case for the scheme at Tweedbank in the Borders.
MSP Christine Grahame asked Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop to look at the project's viability.
Scottish Borders Council said the building at the Borders Railway terminus had great economic potential.
A spokesperson said: "The Great Tapestry of Scotland is a joint project with the Scottish government and other Borders Railway blueprint partners.
"The government is committing £2.5m towards the project's delivery and the council agreed to spend up to £3.5m.
"The Great Tapestry of Scotland is part of the Borders Railway blueprint programme, which has the potential to invest over £10m in various projects and initiatives to promote and realise the full economic benefit of the railway."
The council said the tapestry centre would "help generate tourism and promote economic development" and could be a "vital tool" in showcasing other Borders attractions.
"During its construction, a number of local jobs will be provided, with around 17 posts established once the centre is operational," the spokesperson added.
"The proposed tapestry building will also be a flexible space for use for a range of other events to support tourism and economic development in the Borders.
"It is also expected that other visitor attractions will benefit to the tune of an extra 10,000 to 12,000 visitors a year as a result of the tapestry visitor centre."
The authority said that site clearance had recently started after the council approved the project in late 2014.
"As with any large project within the capital plan, it will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it represents value for money," the spokesperson concluded.
