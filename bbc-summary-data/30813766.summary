The Lion Theatre, in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, was built in 1988 in the back of the Red Lion Hotel by volunteers and the then landlord.
Last year, owners RBNB boarded up the Grade II listed building and this month asked the actors to move out.
The theatre company said its pantomime would go ahead this month and hopes to find another venue later in the year.
Shirley Moffat, chairman of the group, said: "It's really sad that it has come to this. We've got our pantomime coming up which ends on Saturday, 7 February.
"We will then have a couple of days to empty the theatre and leave.
"We are hoping the end of the theatre won't necessarily be the end of the theatre company, but if we do go we go with a bang."
Ms Moffat said she had spoken to the lawyers who said there were some options available to them but for the time being it had to be assumed they have to leave.
They hope the building will be bought by a sympathetic publican who will allow the group to continue running the 90-seat theatre.
Nobody from the BBC could contact RBNB.
