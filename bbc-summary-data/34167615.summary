Naomi House at Sutton Scotney has been closed for a year while facilities, including new accommodation, a bereavement suite and roof terrace were built.
The charity supports children with life-limiting conditions in Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Surrey, West Sussex and the Isle of Wight.
The first families are due to use the new facilities within the next week.
During the closure, nurses and carers have continued to operate from temporary spaces created within the charity's hospice for young adults, Jacksplace.
The charity launched its Butterfly Appeal in 2014 to provide updated accommodation for both children and their parents as well as larger kitchens and a new communal arts and play area.
The ten-bed complex includes a bereavement suite and a new memory garden.
Naomi House spokesman Keith Wilson, said the building was "nothing short of incredible".
"While we may have modernised the entire building, and equipped it with a vast array of the latest technology, it doesn't feel cold or clinical in any way.
"The design has preserved that welcoming and homely feel that Naomi House always enjoyed," he added.
