Jeremy made the big reveal during his appearance this morning on BBC Radio Two's The Chris Evans Breakfast Show.
Jeremy said of joining Strictly, "I love it. Things I love:
1. Len shouting SEVEN.
2. When someone suddenly pulls off an astonishing dance that makes you cry, like Natalie Gumede.
3. Watching it with my young daughters when so few programmes have family overlap these days."
When asked about the judges, Jeremy commented "They are the scariest bunch of people I have ever seen assembled in one place, but I love the fact that their expertise shines through."
The 13th series of Strictly will start in September.
The other celebrities taking part will be announced over the course of the next few weeks.
Last year's competition was won by new Xtra Factor presenter Caroline Flack, who beat celebrities including Saturdays singer Frankie Bridge and EastEnders actor Jake Wood to win the glitterball trophy.
