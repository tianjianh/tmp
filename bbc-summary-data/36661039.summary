[SN]TITLE[SN]
Europa League: Aberdeen 3-1 CS Fola Esch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoppage time goals from Niall McGinn and Adam Rooney left Aberdeen with a far more comfortable Europa League return leg after a night of tension and drama at Pittodrie.

Intense pressure finally paid off with Shay Logan's close range volley putting Derek McInnes' side in front.
Julien Klein drew the visitors level after a corner was not cleared, and Ash Taylor had two goals disallowed.
But McGinn's late shot squirmed home, before Rooney converted a penalty.
This was potentially the easiest tie in Aberdeen's quest to reach the Europa League group stage but proved a genuine test, as will the return leg in Luxembourg.
Stefano Bensi's shot off the post in the first half was a real scare, while Taylor saw the first of two goals ruled out after Jonny Hayes' cross has gone out of play.
The home side's second half approach suggested Aberdeen would take some sort of lead with them; laying siege on their opponents goal with Taylor almost netting within minutes of the restart.
McGinn saw a free-kick parried, a shot blocked then a close range header palmed behind.
Substitute Rooney somehow couldn't net from a couple of yards, then struck a post form close range as the visitors looked like completely capitulating.
When Logan's goal hit the net there was only one winner in most observer's eyes - if it was a boxing match it might have been stopped - but Fola Esch stunned Pittodrie with an equaliser.
Poor defending from a corner allowed the ball to be cut back to captain Klein and he confidently powered the ball home.
That knocked Aberdeen's confidence a little and Jakob Dallevedove found space to test Lewis but his shot was parried.
Aberdeen regained their superiority and Taylor again had the ball in the net only for the referee to rule it out for a foul on the goalkeeper.
And they thought they had been a denied when the flag went up after McGinn's shot slipped through, but this time the Danish referee overruled his assistant.
Their passage to the next round was made considerably easier when Rooney confidently netted a penalty deep into the seven minutes of injury time.
It was a fantastic spectacle, a genuine test for Aberdeen and they'll be mightily relieved to have achieved a two goal advantage at the end of it.
