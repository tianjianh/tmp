The company said visitor numbers had risen by 40%, boosting turnover by 50% to Â£580,000.
The cash will be reinvested into the centre, with plans to produce a new film about the distillery and the people who live there.
Tomatin is a distillery-based community, with 80% of staff living and working on-site in 30 distillery homes.
It is located 16 miles south of Inverness.
Distillery general manager Graham Eunson said: "We're delighted with the increase in visitor numbers and the top-class facilities we are offering whisky enthusiasts.
"Our community lies at the heart of everything we do, and the world-class product we are offering is testament to the respect for tradition, dedication, skill and attention to detail of our craftsmen."
