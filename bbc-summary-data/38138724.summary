Here, Ellie answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
If you weren't an athlete, what would you want to be and why?
I would either be a coach or a physiotherapist, so I'm still involved in gymnastics or sport.
Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
I usually start training at 10am and finish at about 6pm.
Training involves a lot of condition, cardio and strength work and also training your routines and learning new skills.
What keeps you motivated to train?
I think just how you feel when you get to go out there and compete for you club or country just gives you such a buzz you just want to keep doing it because there no feeling like it!
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
I don't think people realise really how much time, dedication and determination you really need to become a successful sportsperson.
What advice would you give to other young people wanting to get into competitive sports?
I think that you should set your goals but don't be to disheartened if they don't go to plan - just create more stepping stones and keep pursuing your dreams!

How do you feel before a major event or competition and how do you manage your nerves?
Obviously you're going to always be a bit nervous but I think the thing that calms me down is that I know how much hard work and training I've put in to be ready for the competitions.
I tell myself: "if you weren't ready you wouldn't be there".
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
Not particularly. Depending on my nerves I either talk to people about something totally different to gymnastics or just put my headphones in and get in my zone.
What kind of support network do you think you need in the sports industry?
I think you just need someone who is willing to support you through good and bad times and those people are usually friends, family or coaches. They see the day in and day out progressions and struggles.
Who do you think is a brilliant role model for aspiring athletes?
I think people who are at the highest level in their sport and still are so humble about it are amazing role models, people like Mo Farah and Max Whitlock.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career?
I can't decide between my individual all-around European bronze medal or our World Team bronze medal - I am really proud of them both!
