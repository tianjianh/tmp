Maguire fired a stunning six-under-par round to lie seven shots off the lead in a tie for 22nd place on three under.
The Cavan woman carded seven birdies and a solitary bogey to make up ground after her disappointing opening 74.
Northern Ireland's Meadow is joint 38th on one over to improve dramatically on her first-round 77 on Wednesday.
Meadow, from Jordanstown in County Antrim, posted six birdies and a bogey to equal the fifth best round of the day, while Maguire's score was the joint second best of the second round.
Inbee Park of South Korea leads on 10 under after a second successive 66, with Stacy Lewis of the United States moving into second spot courtesy of a fabulous 63.
Great Britain golfer Charley Hull currently shares the bronze medal position with Canada's Brooke Henderson on eight under after a 66.
Maguire, the world's top amateur, recorded birdies at the first and ninth holes, and followed that up by picking up shots at five holes on her inward nine, her card marred only by a dropped shot at the 15th.
Meadow, 24, finished third in the US Women's Open in her first season as a professional in 2014 but has struggled over the last 18 months.
The death of her father from cancer last year was a devastating blow for the Ulsterwoman and she has dropped to 473rd in the world rankings.
Meadow was a late inclusion in the Olympic field after the Dutch pair Anne Van Dam and Christel Boeljon were withdrawn from the 60-strong field for not meeting their country's qualifying criteria of being in the world's top 100.
Maguire, 21, finished top amateur at the recent British Open when she shared 25th place.
