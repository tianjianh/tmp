Councillors have approved plans for the next phase of the Â£100m redevelopment of a Dorset town centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Dorset District Council earlier gave the go-ahead for phase 2b of the Brewery Square scheme in Dorchester.
The development will create a cultural quarter, including a hotel, shops, restaurants, a theatre, fountain and ice rink.
The 12-strong development committee voted unanimously in favour of the former Dorchester Brewery site plans.
Among the approved proposals is the conversion of the 130-year-old former brewery building into a hotel and spa, and homes.
The Grade II listed brewhouse will be transformed into a 52-bedroom hotel and 17 apartments.
New homes and shops will also be built on the site.
Phase one of the scheme, which is now complete, involved the construction of a new health centre and the redevelopment of the old Eldridge Pope building into shops and apartments.
Phase two, due for completion in October, includes a new cinema on Brewery Square.
