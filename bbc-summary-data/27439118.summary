The Jamaican, 24, clocked 14.71 seconds, finishing ahead of compatriot Kemar Bailey Cole (15.00 secs).
"It wasn't a good day but to have an injury-free race is good," Blake, returning from injury, told BBC Sport.
Elsewhere, Olympic champion Greg Rutherford won the men's long jump with a best leap of 8.02m.
"It's always nice to win," said Rutherford, who became the British record holder last month with an 8.51m jump in San Diego.
"The performance itself was way down on where I wanted to be. Technically I didn't look good, but it's good to go up against top competitors and pull it out of the bag somehow."
It was Blake - the second fastest man in history and the 2011 100m world champion - who took top billing in Manchester but he was some distance from bettering the world best of 14.35 seconds set by Bolt in 2009.
"I didn't get to warm up properly but I won't use that as an excuse," added Blake, who missed most of last season with a hamstring injury.
"It was Christine Ohuruogu's first race outdoors this season. We don't know what stage she is at in training and it's hard to be critical. She's at a different stage to the other athletes. Christine likes to build her way into the season so I wouldn't read too much into this performance."
World 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu (24.06 secs) was third in the women's 200m, a race won by Britain's Shana Cox in 23.28 seconds.
Britain's World 60m indoor champion Richard Kilty finished third in the men's 100m, behind winner Femi Ogunode (10.10sec ) of Qatar and European junior champion Chijindu Ujah (10.14).
"I only arrived from the States yesterday (Friday) and I felt a little jet-lagged," said Kilty, who clocked 10.19 secs.
"Today was more about enjoying the competition and putting on a good show for the crowd, rather than running a fast time."
The men's 200m hurdles was won by Britain's Andy Turner (22.58 secs) in a closely-fought contest with Olympic 400m hurdles champion Felix Sanchez (22.61 secs).
But it was a commanding 25.05-second victory for Meghan Beesley in the women's 200m hurdles. She dipped home ahead of British team-mate Eilidh Child (25.84).
Tiffany Porter ran an impressive 12.66 secs, the fourth fastest time of the year, to win the women's 100m hurdles, beating Olympic bronze medallist Kellie Wells (12.83) and former Olympic champion Dawn Harper, who stumbled at the third hurdle.
In a close men's 110m hurdles race, Lawrence Clarke came out on top, pipping reigning Commonwealth Games champion Turner to the line by four hundredths of a second.
Clarke, 24, secured the A qualifying standard for the Commonwealth Games with his winning time of 13.51 secs.
Germany's Felix Streng, 19, won the men's IPC 200m T44 in 22.40 seconds, the quickest time of the year.
Earlier, America's Paul Peterson ran 11.47 secs to comfortably win the men's IPC 100m T44, while Marlou van Rhijn also easily won the women's T44 100m in 13.39 secs.
