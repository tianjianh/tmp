She made 10 appearances for Durham Women last term, but her departure was announced two days ago.
"With training more, I want to improve both technically and physically, and then if I'm given the opportunity to play I'll take it and play well," she told the Belles website.
"When she played against us, she was outstanding," said boss Glen Harris.
