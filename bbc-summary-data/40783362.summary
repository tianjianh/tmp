Abrahams, 18, made his Orient debut in March and scored twice in nine games.
Terms of the move will allow him to train and play for Norwich's under-23s, while remaining in Orient's first team.
"Heading back to Orient works well for me because I want to play as much first-team football as I can," he said.
