Unbeaten Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights.
The 29-year-old Belfast man had to relinquish his IBF super-bantamweight belt before the fight.
"The Mexican fans are getting worried now it is getting closer," said Frampton in New York.
Frampton was also stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger, Cuba's Guillermo Rigondeaux.
The last time Frampton fought in the United States, he recovered from being knocked down twice in the opening round to retain his IBF super-bantamweight title with victory over Alejandro Gonzalez Jr in Texas.
"I feel good. It does not feel like I am the away fighter. I am expecting it to be noisy on the night," Frampton, who has won all 22 of his professional fights, told BBC Radio 5 live.
"You will see the best performance yet from me. I am full of energy. I will refuel and then come back a bigger man than Santa Cruz on the night. I will be stronger than him and will do the business."
