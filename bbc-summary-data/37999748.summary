Sir Bradley Wiggins says nothing will ruin what might be the final race of his career after a successful opening day of the Ghent Six Day event.

The five-time Olympic champion is in a share of third place with Rio silver medallist Mark Cavendish.
Wiggins, who was born in the Belgian city, had expected the exhibition event to be his professional farewell.
But after last month's London Six Day the 36-year-old hinted he could be tempted to race there again next year.
Since winning his fifth gold medal in Rio, the first British winner of the Tour de France has found himself under scrutiny for his use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), while UK Sport are also investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the sport.
However, Wiggins has insisted he is in shape for the Belgian event, which runs until Sunday.
"I've trained hard for this, you know? I've been looking forward to it, I really have," he told the Daily Telegraph.
He told reporters to ask him again on Sunday whether this was his final appearance, but admitted he would be emotional during the event, because it reminded him of his father, a former professional cyclist who died in 2008.

"I'm sure I will," he added. "Especially when my kids come. Because I always think of my father.
"I was sat in the [infield] with my dad when I was one and I've got pictures of that. And because I have my own kids now... it will be really nice."
Wiggins and Cavendish won the second points race of the night and were second in the team elimination after the Manxman was beaten in the final sprint.
Cavendish was second in the flying-lap time trial before teaming up with Wiggins to win the first madison.
Cavendish then won the derny final, but he and Wiggins were less successful in the final madison of the night and dropped to third overall on 72 points, 18 points behind leaders Kenny de Ketele and Moreno de Pauw, the Belgian pair who beat them in the London Six Day.
