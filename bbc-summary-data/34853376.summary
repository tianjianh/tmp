Paris attacks: Security flaws and challenges highlighted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The aftermath of every terrorist attack leaves the question: what could be done to prevent it happening again?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Already, a number of intelligence failures and security challenges have been identified in the wake of the Paris attacks.
The first challenge is for the French security services.
A number of those involved in the attacks, such as Omar Mostefai and Sami Amimour, Â­were known to the authorities for extremist links and yet made it out to Syria and then were able to get back to France apparently undetected.
There may well have been a specific failure here but it is hard to be sure yet. A large terror operation like Paris takes considerable planning and normally that would leave some kind of a footprint - often in the form of electronic communications and contact with people under surveillance - that intelligence agencies would hope to pick up and yet in this case they did not.
That may be due to operational security by the group involved, especially if they found ways to communicate that were not monitored (there have been reports they used encryption apps but there is no clear evidence of that yet).
But a real problem for French security is the numbers - 1,000 individuals are thought to have gone to Syria from France and keeping track of all of them and of the movements of those who come back is a problem that risks swamping any security service.
The main task is risk assessment and prioritisation to try to work out where to devote limited surveillance resources. But this is an art not a science and the risk-profile of individuals can easily be underestimated. This problem of numbers applies to many other European security and police services as well, including that in the UK.
A second problem is the international dimension. Jihadists operate internationally and the Paris attackers moved across Europe and over borders. Jihadists will always exploit the weakest link in security, including internationally. In the Paris case they appear to have organised in Belgium.
The Belgian state is smaller and its security services lack the capacity of the French.
Security services are focused on their own nations and have to rely on liaison with other services to track people who are moving.
That leads to a reliance on relationships and information sharing which is not always as good as it should be. Turkish authorities for instance have said they informed French counterparts in 2014 and 2015 about Omar Mostefai being linked to four terror suspects in the country that the French were asking for information on but say they heard nothing back until after the attacks.
The pressure may grow for improving intelligence sharing at a European level - and also with the US - and especially at borders.
Police appear to have stopped individuals involved in the plot and then let them go in some cases.
The Austrians are thought to have halted Salah Abdeslam in September when he crossed over from Germany with two men. The real question in a case like this is whether they had, or should have had, any information to suggest he was a threat but that would have had to come from other countries.
The possibility that one attacker posed as a refugee, perhaps using a faked Syrian passport, adds another element of complexity.
The vast flow of people who have entered Europe makes it much easier to hide and move than in the past. Until recently, there was little evidence of any jihadists hiding among refugees but the Paris case, Â­if confirmed, may change that. The problem is that border and entry checks vary from place to place.
Some countries have fingerprinted and registered refugee arrivals, others have not, sometimes because they are overwhelmed but also because they simply want to usher refugees onwards as fast as possible to the next country.
Border controls and the refugee crisis are politically potent issues domestically in many countries which will make finding common ground harder.
Every successful terrorist attack is, in one sense, an intelligence failure but hindsight always makes that clearer. The problems are often easy to spot afterwards but the reality is that they are often complex and hard to fix.
