Craig Gilroy is back after missing Saturday's victory over Treviso after taking a bang on his head in the opening win over the Dragons.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac will bring in Hadleigh Parkes to partner Jonathan Davies in midfield.
Meanwhile, Liam Williams moves to the wing with Aled Thomas at full-back and Lewis Rawlins returns from illness.
Another Ireland international, Iain Henderson, could make his campaign bow for Ulster after being named as a replacement.
Charles Piutau returns to the Ulster starting line-up after being ruled out of last week's game with a minor thumb injury.
Andrew Trimble and Rory Best are still being rested for the hosts after playing major roles in Ireland's summer tour to South Africa.
Jared Payne continues to recover from a calf injury picked up at an Ireland training camp last month.

Meanwhile hooker Rob Herring will make his 100th appearance for the Irish province.
Among the eight changes from last week's victory in Italy, Stuart McCloskey returns in the backline, with Callum Black, Peter Browne, Alan O'Connor and Robboe Diack bolstering the pack.
Louis Ludik switches from full-back to the left wing to accommodate the return of New Zealander Piutau, while Angus Lloyd still awaits his first competitive appearance after being an unused substitute against Treviso.
While the Scarlets have lost their opening two games against Munster and Edinburgh, Ulster assistant coach Clarke is still expecting a tough test against the club that defeated Ulster home and away last season.
"I know they have gone zero from two but they have played plenty of footie and have created plenty of opportunities and are a team that physically can mix it with the best."
Scarlets' disappointing start follows a summer when they recruited Wales and Lions centre Jonathan Davies and Blues fly-half Rhys Patchell.
They were the top-placed Welsh region in the Pro12 last season, and are Wales' only representatives in the European Champions' Cup this term but have scored only one try in two league matches.
