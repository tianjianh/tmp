Denbigh hospital owners lose £900,000 repair bill appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a derelict Victorian hospital complex have lost an appeal over a £900,000 bill paid by the county council for emergency repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denbighshire council has welcomed a decision by the Welsh government to dismiss the claim by the owners of the Denbigh-based North Wales Hospital.
A spokesman for Freemont (Denbigh) Ltd, which will have to pay the bill, said it was disappointed.
The council is hoping it can purchase the site and restore it.
In 2011, it served an urgent works notice on the British Virgin Islands-based company after becoming frustrated at the deterioration in the condition of the listed buildings.
The council said the owners did not comply with the notice so it carried out the work, costing £940,000.
Last year, it served a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) for the site on the owners but they objected, prompting a public inquiry which was held in March.
A decision on the CPO is expected within the next two months.
Plans for a large-scale mixed development have been submitted on behalf of the Prince's Regeneration Trust, working in conjunction with the council, assuming the CPO is granted.
