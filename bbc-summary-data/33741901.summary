Six farmers loaded up trolleys with milk, clearing the shelves at Morrisons, Tesco and Lidl in Yate on Thursday.
Trolleys were then left at the checkout. One of those involved, Matt Kingston, told BBC Points West that British dairy farming could be a "thing of the past" unless something is done about prices.
Morrisons, the supermarket shown in the video, said it buys milk from processors - not farmers - and those businesses set the price paid to farmers.
