County Championship: Northamptonshire progress at Sussex held up by rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire reached 142-2 to trail Sussex by 36 runs, but rain at Arundel checked their progress on day two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Only 29.1 overs were possible before the weather turned during lunch and play was abandoned at 17:10 BST.
Northants opener Ben Duckett missed out on a third Championship century of the season, edging Ajmal Shahzad to Chris Nash at slip to be dismissed for 72.
Duckett was the only Northants wicket to fall, while captain Alex Wakely will resume 46 not out on the third day.
Azharullah's 6-68 helped to bowl out Sussex for just 178 on day one.
