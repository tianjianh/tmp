Murray, the second seed, said there is no ill feeling between him and Rosol after a dispute in Munich last year.
"I have actually got along fine with him apart from that day and he's a tough, tough opponent," said Murray.
"He's a big, strong guy, he goes for his shots and he takes a lot of risks. It's a tough opening round, for sure."

Djokovic said he hopes to be close to full fitness for the start of the tournament, but admitted his left wrist has not healed fully.
He first felt pain in his wrist in the week before the Rio Olympics, where he lost in the opening round to Del Potro.
"I'm doing everything in my power to make sure that I'm as close to 100% as possible during the course of this tournament," said the 29-year-old.
"I'm just hoping that when the tournament starts I'll be able to get as close to the maximum of executing my backhand shot as possible."
Djokovic also said he was dealing with "private issues" when he lost to Sam Querrey in the third round at Wimbledon this year, but that those issues have now been resolved.
He added: "I am in a position, like everybody else, like all of you.
"We all have private issues and things that are more challenges than issues, more things that we have to encounter and overcome in order to evolve as a human being."
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
"Rosol is the man who beat Rafael Nadal on Wimbledon's Centre Court in 2012, and was told by Murray that "nobody likes you" after the Czech bumped into him while changing ends at an event in Munich last year.
"Murray could face Kei Nishikori in the last eight and Stan Wawrinka - or even Juan Martin del Potro - in the semi-finals, while chief rival Djokovic, still troubled by a left wrist injury, could play Marin Cilic and Rafael Nadal at the same stages.
"It would be wrong to describe Djokovic as an unknown quantity at this US Open. He is the defending champion and has a sensational record on hard courts, but he has had an emotional few months after completing the career Grand Slam at Roland Garros."
