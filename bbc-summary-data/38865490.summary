[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 3-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull debutant Regan Charles-Cook scored twice as the Moors thrashed Sutton United at Damson Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlton loanee Charles-Cook only needed a minute to notch his first, firing in on the rebound after Ross Worner saved his initial effort.
Sutton then grew into the contest, having a penalty saved by Solihull goalkeeper Nathan Baxter in the 38th minute, but Charles-Cook sucker-punched them with his second on the breakaway in first-half stoppage time.
Charles-Cook then turned provider, squaring the ball for fellow debutant Oladapo Afolayan to make it 3-0 with 20 minutes remaining.
