The animal, believed to be an American Bulldog, was shot dead after officers were unable to bring it under control, Northumbria Police said.
It happened at about 17:00 BST on Saturday in a garden on Millbrook in Felling, Gateshead.
Ch Insp Dave Gould said it was an "horrific attack by a dog that was highly agitated and a danger to other people".
"Officers at the scene spent more than an hour attempting to bring the dog safely under control but, unfortunately, despite best efforts, it continued to remain highly agitated and posed a real danger," he said.
"We did not want to have to destroy the animal but our main concern has to be public safety - we already had one young girl who had been seriously injured and we had to do what we could to prevent anyone else from coming to harm."
Shooting the dog was a "last resort" after other options had been considered, he said.
The teenager has been treated in hospital for serious, but not life-threatening, arm injuries.
American Bulldogs are not banned in the UK, although they are in some other countries.
