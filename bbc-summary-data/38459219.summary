Lawro's Premier League predictions v comedian Arron Crascall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

Lawro's opponent for the fixtures on 2, 3 and 4 January is comedian Arron Crascall, who has more than 4.2m followers on Facebook and a new sketch show starting on BBC Three in the new year.
"I've supported Arsenal my whole life," he says. "My dad hates it as he's a Spurs fan and we're a family divided on football. I sided with my mum. My favourite football memory is definitely us winning the Double in 1997-98, winning 4-0 against Everton. I was at the game in the North Bank and it was unforgettable.
"Ray Parlour is one of my football legends. I got to meet him recently and I had a fan girl moment! True Arsenal hero."
If the year of 2016 was a full season, how would Arsenal have got on?

Tottenham v Chelsea (20:00 GMT)
Tottenham were impressive at Watford and they seem to have found a momentum now with Harry Kane and Dele Alli finding form. I have a feeling they will halt the Chelsea surge which has been so impressive. To win 13 games in a row is just fantastic but Chelsea have some hard fixtures on the horizon.
This fixture always leaves me wondering why the fans hate each other so much? They seem to detest the opposing club. Why I don't know, but it will make for a spicy atmosphere.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Arron's prediction: 3-2
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Luke Reddy.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week thirteen v Tim Vine)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
