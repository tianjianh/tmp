[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unison will look into Betsi Cadwaladr after the Welsh government put it into special measures over leadership concerns.
It has already received more than 1,000 questionnaire responses and will host meetings at three hospitals in August.
The health board said it is conducting a "listening exercise" with staff alongside Unison's survey.
A spokesman said it is "engaging with staff to get their views on the future direction for health and health care in north Wales".
