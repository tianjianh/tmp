It is understood one resident was in their living room when the car burst through the garden wall and into the front of the house on Whiterock Road.
A man was arrested but two others fled.
A post on the PSNI west Belfast Facebook page said: "We would also appeal for these suspects to make with contact with us ASAP... you left your mobile phones behind lads!!!"
The family who live in the house "are understandably very shocked," according to SDLP councillor Tim Attwood.
It is understood they have had to be re-homed as a result of the crash.
Mr Attwood visited the family on Wednesday morning and call for those responsible for the incident to face the "full brunt of the law".
"This horrific incident caused significant damage to the front of the home but could have easily caused serious injury," the councillor added.
The police also said residents of Whiterock Road had "narrowly escaped serious injury or perhaps worse" when the vehicle crashed between 22:00 and 23:00 BST on Tuesday.
The car has now been removed from the scene.
Earlier, firefighters and officers from Phoenix Gas were called to the crash site to investigate the smell of gas. A pipe is believed to have been damaged.
Officials from Northern Ireland Electricity are also assessing the scene for damage to their network.
In a statement, Insp Alan Swann said: "A 36-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of a number of driving and drug offences and two other males, one reportedly wearing a hi-vis vest, made off in the direction of Whiterock Grove."
