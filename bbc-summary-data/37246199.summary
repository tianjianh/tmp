[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have abandoned their attempts to sign free agent Reuben Reid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Plymouth striker has been in talks with County manager Warren Feeney for a number of weeks after he rejected Argyle's contract offer in the summer.
"That deal is probably dead now, we have spoken to him, but I think I am probably going to leave that one now. It is gone," Feeney told BBC Wales.
"I won't be waiting around, so we can probably put that one to bed now."
He continued: "He is a great fella - but I want players who are ready to come in and play.
"I am sure he'll sign somewhere. I have plenty of strikers but would have taken one more, you can't have too many strikers, I honestly believe that."
Feeney added three players to his squad before the transfer window closed on 31 August.
Newcastle United defender Kyle Cameron, Cardiff City forward Rhys Healey and Queens Park Rangers forward Reece Grego-Cox have joined on loan until January.
