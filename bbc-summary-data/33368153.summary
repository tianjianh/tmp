Pauline Carmichael murder: Accused said he would 'throw body over bridge', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his father's partner allegedly told friends he was "going to throw her off the bridge" after she called police to remove him from her home, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Norman Foster, 37, denies killing 61-year-old Pauline Carmichael on 23 February this year.
Her body was found in Lough Neagh, about a mile from the house she shared with Mr Foster at Hillside in Antrim.
A judge at Ballymena Magistrates' Court refused to grant bail for Mr Foster.
A detective told the court that a driver crossing a bridge close to Ms Carmichael's home saw a man matching Mr Foster's description "throwing a body over the railings of the bridge".
A second driver "saw a male throwing an object which appeared to be red in colour over the bridge", the detective added.
The witnesses reported their observations to police when they saw media reports of Ms Carmichael's disappearance.
Their alleged sightings came about half-an-hour after police had removed an "extremely irate" Mr Foster and his friends from Ms Carmichael's flat.
Mr Foster allegedly re-entered the property when police left the scene.
Evidence had been been obtained that he later left, carrying Ms Carmichael over his shoulder after telling friends he was going to throw her over a bridge, the court heard.
He returned, the detective said, changed his clothes and shoes and left again, telling his friends he "had to go back to burn the body".
According to witness statements, he returned again and allegedly said "her body was gone, it must have floated away".
The court heard that a post-mortem examination found that Ms Carmichael had died as a result of drowning and she had also sustained a broken bone in her throat and multiple rib fractures.
Police objected to bail over concerns Mr Foster would interfere with witnesses.
He was ordered to appear again via videolink on 28 July.
