The 21-year-old woman, who police said was a sex worker, was found early on Wednesday in Springwell Road, off Water Lane, in Holbeck.
She was taken to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment, but died a short time later.
A 38-year-old man was later arrested and questioned by officers investigating the death.
West Yorkshire Police said the woman's identity was known, but her family had not yet been informed.
Det Supt Simon Atkinson said they wanted to hear from anyone who was in the Springwell Road area between 20:00 GMT on Tuesday and 01:30 on Wednesday.
He added: "We can confirm that the victim was a sex worker and the incident has taken place in the managed area where sex workers operate within a defined area during set hours.
"We are therefore appealing to anyone involved in any aspect of sex work in the managed area in Holbeck to let us know anything they have seen or heard that could assist the investigation."
