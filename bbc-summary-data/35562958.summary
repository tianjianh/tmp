The 1970s Santos FC jersey was one of a collection sold by Swansea valley side Cwmtwrch RFC to raise money for a new club house.
In total, the memorabilia raised £18,000 at the auction.
But the highest bid of the day was the £19,000 paid for a Wales rugby jersey worn in the 1905 victory over New Zealand.
