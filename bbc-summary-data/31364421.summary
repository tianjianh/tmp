Students who want to live in alcohol-free accommodation are being given the chance at St Andrews University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been introduced to cater for students with religious beliefs or medical conditions that do not allow drinking.
The move from the Fife institution is thought to be the first time alcohol-free student accommodation has been offered in Scotland.
It will be offered at David Russell Apartments in Fife Park from September.
The flats each hold between four to six people.
Students will be asked to tick a box on their accommodation forms giving them the option.
Pat Mathewson, St Andrews Students' Association, said: "Our residential services have decided they will offer a small section and then see what the uptake is like.
"We're always in favour of anything that will make our students more comfortable.
"By no means are any students going to be forced into student accommodation they haven't asked for."
A St Andrews University spokeswoman said: "The University of St Andrews is committed to creating a safe, healthy, and inclusive campus experience for all of our students.
"We know that not all students drink alcohol.
"What's more, we believe student learning lasts a lifetime, so reinforcing positive behaviours during this period of development can have a lasting influence."
She added: "We're proud that our Students' Association is working to shape new attitudes towards responsible alcohol consumption and making our student experience more inclusive. We want our students to think about their lifestyle choices, and to support the choices of others."
