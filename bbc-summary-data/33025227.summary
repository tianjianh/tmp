Down's blood test 'would cut risk of miscarriage'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A safer test for Down's syndrome that reduces the risk of miscarriage could soon be available on the NHS.

One in every 200 women loses her baby after an amniocentesis, in which the fluid around the developing foetus is tested for genetic disorders.
A trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital of the new test - for fragments of foetal DNA in the mother's blood - suggested it could be cost-effective.
The NHS is to decide if it should be added to screening for Down's syndrome.
About 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome in the UK each year.
All pregnant women are offered testing for genetic disorders.
Initially an ultrasound scan and chemicals in the mother's blood are used to assess the likelihood of the baby having Down's.
Anyone calculated to have up to a one-in-150 chance of a baby with Down's syndrome is offered an amniocentesis - in which a needle is used to extract a sample of amniotic fluid, which surrounds the foetus.
But those women, of whom most would probably not have a baby with Down's, need to decide whether to have the risky test.
Fragments of the developing foetus's DNA naturally end up in the mother's bloodstream.
"Non-invasive prenatal testing" - or NIPT - uses this DNA to test for major genetic abnormalities.
It is already used in nearly 100 countries, but Great Ormond Street Hospital has assessed how it could be used on the NHS.
Prof Lyn Chitty, who led the trial, told the BBC: "It's a much more accurate test, so it's 99% accurate for Down's syndrome so it reduces the number of [invasive] tests significantly.
"In our study it reduced the number of invasive tests by more than 80%."
However, it does not completely eliminate the need for an amniocentesis.
Anyone who has a positive NIPT test result would still need final confirmation with an amniocentesis.
One anonymous mother who took part in the trial said: "We probably wouldn't have done [invasive testing] because there's a risk of miscarriage.
"I think that we were very lucky, it's enabled us to make an informed choice about what happens for the rest of our lives."
Prof Chitty, who will present data from the trial involving 2,500 mothers at the European Society of Human Genetics conference, said the measure could be cost-effective.
While the blood test is costly, it could also help the NHS save money by reducing the number of expensive amniocenteses.
She also rejected the idea that the extra testing would lead to more abortions.
Prof Chitty said the trial showed that many women who would have refused an amniocentesis chose to have the safer test to help them prepare.
The UK's National Screening Committee will begin assessing the idea this month.
Dr Anne Mackie, its director of programmes, said: "Before NIPT can be safely introduced we must be sure it is accurate when used on large numbers of women and that there are quality-assessed pathways in place providing the care, support and information women need."
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would each make their own decision on whether to make any recommendations.
