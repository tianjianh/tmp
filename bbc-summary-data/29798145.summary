Your tonsillitis tips as Paolo Nutini cancels two gigs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Paolo Nutini cancels his second show after being diagnosed with severe tonsillitis, we've been asking for your home remedies for the illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish singer was supposed to perform in Glasgow last night and tonight but has called the gigs off after "medical advice".
Concert promoters say fans should keep their tickets and look out for rescheduled dates.
It's hoped he'll be well enough to perform in London on Thursday.
We must warn you the following tonsillitis tips for Paolo haven't come from doctors and we have no idea if they work, but some of you swear by them:
The NHS recommends drinking plenty, getting lots of rest and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen for the pain.
If symptoms are severe or last more than four days you should see your GP.
A statement on the singer's website says: "We wish to sincerely apologise to all ticket holders for the inconvenience and disappointment this has caused.
"We thank you for your patience and understanding."
