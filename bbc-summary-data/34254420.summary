Hemswell Cliff wind farm rejected by the government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-turbine wind farm in Lincolnshire has been refused planning permission by the Communities Secretary Greg Clark.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An application by RWE Innogy for the 415ft (126m) turbines at Hemswell Cliff, near Gainsborough, was rejected in 2013 but the company appealed.
The government cited a number of issues it had with the project including the impact on the landscape and the effect on designated heritage sites.
RWE said it was "disappointed" with the Secretary of State's decision.
The main issues for Mr Clark were the effects on "designated heritage assets" like the Hemswell Conservation Area.
He also stated that the turbines would have a "significant" impact on the landscape for about 3km (1.86 miles) from the site.
The plans had been met with a number of objections from local residents who formed the campaign group Villages of the Cliff Against Turbines.
They said the development would have "ruined the countryside".
The group was backed by the MP for Gainsborough Sir Edward Leigh who said he was "delighted" the plans were turned down.
RWE Innogy had argued the wind farm could power 11,600 homes.
Mark Crawford, its regional development manager, said: "We are disappointed that the Secretary of State has refused planning permission.
"At a time when onshore wind farms like Hemswell Cliff could make a real positive difference to climate change, energy bills and local investment, it is a shame that the project will not proceed further."
The decision can be challenged at the High Court by the firm within six weeks.
