[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Devon beach has been named the best in the UK for the second year running in a traveller review survey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woolacombe beach was described in reviews on TripAdvisor as a "magnificent stretch of sand" with "great surf".
Cornwall had more beaches in the top 10 than any other county, with the four including Perranporth beach and Fistral beach.
Beaches in Weymouth, Jersey, Swansea, and Bournemouth also made the top 10.
Phil Hill, the RNLI lifeguard manager for Woolacombe beach, said "having such a beautiful beach in a beautiful setting with all those facilities" meant the beach was "a great destination to take your family".
The beach is part of the north Devon coast which has protected status as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
It boasts nearby parking, surf hire, showers and toilets. There are also plenty of cafes, pubs and shops nearby.
The Travellers' Choice Beaches Awards were determined by the quality and quantity of traveller reviews and ratings for beaches, gathered over 12 months.
