Reeves scored 10 goals in 42 games for Milton Keynes last season, but rejected a new contract at the club.
The 25-year-old Northern Ireland international played under Addicks boss Karl Robinson at Stadium MK between July 2013 and October 2016.
"He is someone that has won a Player of the Year and a promotion with me, so I know him very well," Robinson said.
"I want to thank the board. This was a deal they really wanted to do as well, and it was one that was really backed by the club."
