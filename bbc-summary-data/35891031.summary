Curators said the some of the works at York Art Gallery, from the Imperial War Museums, have been brought together for the first time since 1919.
Laura Turner, for the museum, said it was the only venue outside London for the "incredibly moving collection".
The exhibition, Truth and Memory, opens on Friday and includes paintings by Paul Nash and Stanley Spencer.
Ms Turner said: "The pictures have helped shape the nation's perception of the conflict and war itself."
Wold War One began in 1914 and fighting raged across the world until the armistice on 11 November 1918.
Paul Nash's pictures of Western Front landscapes show a despairing view of war.
His We Are Making a New World, 1918, shows the devastation of the landscape and the unseen cost to humanity.
The exhibition also has art created on the home front, showing factory work and the dangerous conditions many women endured in supporting the nation's war effort.
