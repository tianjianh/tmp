From "How many farms were flooded to create Rutland Water?" to "Why do they call inhabitants of Tideswell Sawyerheads?"
Here's how we have got on with answering your questions.
We start with an easy one this week. The Rams won it in 1946, beating Charlton Athletic 4-1 at Wembley.
Here's a picture of captain Jack Nicholas with the trophy to prove it.
Leicester City's club historian, John Hutchinson, said the fox part of the badge represents the county and the white flower, a cinquefoil, is for the city.
The cinquefoil can also be seen on the logos for organisations, including Leicester City Council and the University of Leicester.
The fox was chosen in the 1940s when many of the club's directors came from the county, a popular fox hunting area.
The club has had a number of different badges, but this current one came into existence in 1992.
We spoke to the Peak District National Park Authority, which told us the name is most commonly spelt "Saw Y'eds" and comes from an ancient tale of a local farmer who sawed the head off one of his cows (not the one pictured) after it got stuck in a fence.
As the story goes, a doctor then came along, sewed the stricken animal's head back on and it magically came back to life.
A nice tale - but please don't be tempted to try it yourself.
First of all, we compiled a list of towns and villages in the county starting with these letters: Thurmaston, Thrussington, Thurnby, Thornton, Thringstone, Theddingworth, Thurcaston and Thurlaston. There are also a few with "Thorpe", but we'll get on to them.
Dr Richard Jones, from the University of Leicester, said most of these contain Scandinavian personal names, such as Thormothir (Thurmaston) and Thorsteinn (Thrussington).
Most of the place names also have "tun" at the end - Dr Jones said that was Old English for "estate, farm or village".
He doesn't, however, believe there is any kind of link between the settlements.
However, Professor John Martin from De Montfort University said he was "pretty sure" the "Th" at the start of place names was a variation of the term "thorp", meaning small hamlet or village.
We have a few of those in Leicestershire as well: Thorpe Satchville, Thorpe Astley, Thorpe Arnold and Thorpe Langton.
He said it's also quite common at the end of village names, like Countesthorpe.
Rose used to visit a relative in Oakham, and was interested in how many farms were flooded to create Rutland Reservoir - one of the largest in Europe.
Apparently, 29 agricultural tenancies were lost when it was created in the mid-1970s.
In total, 3% of the entire county was flooded to create the reservoir.
