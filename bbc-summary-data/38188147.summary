The athlete set records for the fastest marathon for a double amputee and has won two Paralympic 200m gold medals.
Photographer David Baird has charted Whitehead's progress for many years, including his training build-up to the Games.
Whitehead said the resulting exhibition was "quite special".
"There's lots of photos around my 40 marathons in 40 days and the success and the struggle that we had in that, but also the training towards London and Rio and the different aspects of training," he said.
"The ability to showcase your talent on different levels but also what goes into it is quite special.
"For me this is really important to show not just what my success looks like but also the people involved in that."
The runner, from Nottingham, successfully defended his Paralympic gold medal in the 200m T42 in Rio after taking up the discipline because there was no marathon in his category.
In 2013 he ran from John O'Groats to Land's End in 40 back to back marathons.
Mr Baird said the photographs give people a sense of the training required and is now working with Paralympic hopefuls.
"Quite often in training it looks very lonely, all that time in the gym and on the track.
"The athletes get a lot of exposure during the games but they can be forgotten for the years in between, I think it's important they get the recognition for the preparation work they do."
Mr Baird's exhibition will be at Sneinton Market, in Nottingham.
