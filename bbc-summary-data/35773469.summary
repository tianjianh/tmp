Van der Sar answered an SOS after VV Noordwijk - his first senior club - were left without cover when their keeper picked up an injury.
The fourth-tier match against Jodan Boys ended 1-1 after Van der Sar saved an early penalty.
He is not expected to play for the club again.
"We are thrilled that Edwin wants to help," Noordwijk director Peter Vink told Voetbal in de Bollenstreek before the game.
Van der Sar spent five years at VV Noordwijk before joining Ajax, aged 20. He won four Dutch league titles and a Champions League title with the Amsterdam club.
After Ajax he signed for Juventus, before arriving in English football with Fulham, who sold him to United.
He earned a record 130 caps for the Netherlands and collected four Premier League crowns and another Champions League title at United, before retiring in 2011.
