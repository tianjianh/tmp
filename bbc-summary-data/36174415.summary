[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Cardy, from Barrow, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for rape and perverting the course of justice by witness intimidation.
Preston Crown Court heard the 54-year-old from Low White Close assaulted a 22-year-old woman in early 2014.
Later that year he assaulted a 46-year-old man while holding a knife to his throat.
Two other men - Sean Mills, 40 , of Ramsey Park, Barrow and Alfred Howard, 83, of the same address - have been handed 12-month suspended sentences for perverting the course of justice through witness intimidation.
They were found guilty of intimidating Cardy's two victims in an attempt to make them retract their complaints of rape, having been persuaded by Cardy to do so.
Det Sgt Wayne Dixon said there were was "no excuse for the unthinkable actions of Cardy".
"The actions of Mills and Howard could have led to a rapist remaining on our streets.
"Attempting to pervert the course of justice is a very serious crime and only makes the ordeal even more traumatic for the victims."
