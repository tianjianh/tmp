Peta Mellors, who has lived at the farm in Llandefalle, Brecon, for 30 years, said it "looked like a bomb had gone off".
She said hens had recently been moved out of the barn, but an antique tractor, camper van, and BMW Z3 sports car were all written off.
BBC Wales weatherman Derek Brockway said the likely cause was a squall.
Peta Mellors said she heard strong wind and hail against the window at about 05:00 GMT.
She said when she looked outside: "I could not take it in -  this medieval barn was just gone. It had imploded."
Mr Brockway said: "There have been showers around today. Some of them heavy and wintry with snow and hail in places combined with strong to gale force winds.
"The air is cold and unstable so I wouldn't rule out a squall or sudden gust of wind which could cause damage."
