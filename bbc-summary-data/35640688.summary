UUP bid to change teachers' employment law blocked by Sinn Féin and SDLP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attempt to repeal a law that gives schools an exemption from an aspect of fair employment legislation has failed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Religious discrimination is outlawed in Northern Ireland but schools have been allowed to use religion as a factor when selecting teaching staff.
The Ulster Unionists wanted to amend the Employment Bill to drop that veto.
Forty-five MLAs voted to remove the exemption, but it was blocked as Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were opposed to it.
They deployed a petition of concern on the matter, meaning it could only pass if it was supported by a majority of both nationalists and unionists in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Sinn Féin said that although it would like to see the law changed, it wanted it to be done after proper consultation.
But Ulster Unionist MLA Sandra Overend accused the party of "scrambling about looking for a reason to oppose" the move, adding that teachers "deserve equal and fair treatment like all the rest of us".
"It is an issue we have highlighted for three years now, the need to get rid of the loophole in the law which gives teacher recruitment an opt out from fair employment regulations," she said.
