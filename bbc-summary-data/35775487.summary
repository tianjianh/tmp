Hughes Insurance: Branch closures lead to loss of 20 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hughes Insurance is planning to close half of its branches in Northern Ireland with the loss of 20 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company says the move is part of an operational restructure.
It has 11 branches, six of which will shut in April. The firm has its headquarters in Newtownards.
Staff were informed on Thursday that branches will close in Ballymena, Ballynahinch, Lisburn, Magherafelt, Newry and Omagh.
Five other branches will remain unaffected.
It is understood that some staff members will be offered the opportunity to relocate to company headquarters or other branches.
In a statement the company said it will "make every effort to avoid redundancies where possible".
"Where it isn't possible, any redundancies will be voluntary led, or for certain roles, the opportunity to reapply for new positions may exist," it said.
