He was taken to hospital on Tuesday following the incident at about 20:30 BST in the Hugo Boss store in Bicester Outlet shopping village in Pingle Drive, the company said.
Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses.
Investigating officer Det Insp Steve Duffy said: "Our thoughts are with the family at this time."
He added: "We are currently investigating the circumstances of this boy's death and we would ask anyone who was in the Hugo Boss store at around that time on Tuesday to please contact us as a matter of urgency."
In a statement the designer retailer, who have closed the store until further notice, said: "Everyone at Hugo Boss is devastated by this tragic accident and we would like to extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to his family.
"Hugo Boss will assist the authorities in any way with an investigation into the accident."
A company spokesman refused to reveal the size of the mirror or give details of how it fell and whether it fell from height.
The boy died at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.
The Health and Safety Executive said they were not involved in the investigation into the death of the boy as shops are the responsibility of local authority environmental health departments.
