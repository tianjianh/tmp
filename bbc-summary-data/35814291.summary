Saints arrived at Sandy Park on the back of five wins in six games and led 12-3 at the break thanks to tries from Lee Dickson and Ken Pisi.
Olly Woodburn scored in the corner to cut Northampton's lead.
And Gareth Steenson kicked four penalties, to add to a first-half effort, to seal victory for Exeter.
Exeter, who have won four of their last five matches, have never finished in the top four but look well set for a play-off place and sit first after Saracens lost to Leicester later on Sunday.
Rob Baxter's side were completely transformed after half-time as they dominated the breakdown and won 10 second-half penalties, with Saints failing to earn one.
Saints finished last season as the league leaders but it has been a mixed campaign this time around following a poor start.
Their pack struggled to impose themselves in the second half, although they thought they had nicked a losing bonus-point just before full-time but the Television Match Official ruled no try.
Exeter assistant coach Ali Hepher: "We looked as though we weren't enjoying our rugby in the first half as we were frightened to make mistakes.
"We had a quiet word at half-time and this freed us up. We created a different, positive mindset and we said that we needed to be positive and not afraid of errors.
"We took on the message and turned the screw, we had a bit of self-belief."
On replacing Thomas Waldrom: "We struggled at the breakdown, Thomas wasn't injured and Julian Salvi is one of the best in that area in the Premiership."
Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder: "It's frustrating, we didn't get the bounce of the ball and a few refereeing decisions went against us.
"I thought we scored a good try right at the end, which would have got us a bonus point, and the officials were wrong to disallow it.
"I thought we were very good in the first half as we took our opportunities but our second-half performance was poor as we coughed up possession and kicked away too much ball.
"The Six Nations period was a good one for us as we've won more than we've lost and hopefully we'll be able to integrate our international players back into our side."
