New Zealander Ko hit 11 birdies and a bogey for a stunning 10-under-par 62.
Hull, meanwhile, started the day one shot off the lead but the 20-year-old is in a share of sixth, five behind Ko, after a two-under-par 70.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew is 10 shots off the pace after a one-under 71.
"Going into today I just wanted to focus on my game," said Ko.
"Obviously it's a great round and I'm in a better position than I ever could have imagined. Over the weekend I just have to focus on me."
