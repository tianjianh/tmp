High tides in parts of north Wales battered by storms hours earlier have passed without further major flooding.

Lifeboat crews from south Wales were drafted in to help colleagues in the north amid fears coastal areas could be hit for a second time in 24 hours.
The fire service has been pumping flood water from homes in Rhyl, Denbighshire.
Arriva Trains Wales has cancelled the Chester to Rhyl service until Saturday because of flood wall damage with Conwy Valley services also stopped.
Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies will visit residents in the worst affected areas and Rhyl fire station.
Fire crews worked using high volume pumps worked through the night in the Garford Road area of Rhyl.
Hundreds of people in the town spent the night away from their homes after properties were evacuated on Thursday when high tides and gale force winds hit the region.
There was also major disruption as schools were closed and transport severely disrupted.
Two severe warnings - suggesting there was a danger to life - were issued, along with flood warnings across the region.
By 16:30 GMT on Thursday all warnings had been lifted, although more minor flood alerts remained.
Natural Resources Wales said it had not expected any serious flooding overnight but precautions were taken.
The RNLI, which helped emergency services rescue at least 25 flooded residents by boat, said extra resources had been called in from elsewhere in case conditions worsened.
Among them were two members of Barry Dock RNLI lifeboat station.
In addition to homes being flooded in Rhyl, about 400 properties were left without power and they were advised by Denbighshire council to attend a rest centre set up at the town's leisure centre.
Thursday's winds and high tide caused a major storm surge.
In Rhyl, residents said streets were flooded within minutes of high water.
Kinmel Bay was also badly hit. Most of the water had receded by Thursday evening, but an Asda car park remained under water.
One resident, builder Kieran Jones, bricked up his own doorway to give extra protection, as local people feared a second surge overnight.
"I used rapid hardening cement so it will set before any flood waters arrive," he said.
"It was quite scary to see the flood waters coming towards the house this morning.
"We were lucky they didn't get inside the house earlier, but I don't want to take any chances tonight."
Other incidents were reported across the region, including:
North Wales Police said extra patrols would be monitoring flooded properties in Rhyl and Kinmel Bay, Conwy, overnight.
Mohammed Mehmet, chief executive of Denbighshire council, said storm precautions had worked well in most areas.
He added: "However some areas were affected and teams from the council and all the emergency services have worked diligently to respond to the flooding issues, and efforts are still ongoing to try and find alternative accommodation for those who need it as quickly as possible.
"Those efforts will continue into the evening and for the coming days."
There will be an information centre open at Rhyl fire station from 11:00 GMT on Friday.
A fund will be launched by Rhyl Town Council for people to donate money but Denbighshire council has asked people not to send them donations of goods.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are in contact with the UK government on the general situation, and with Natural Resources Wales and responder agencies in Wales on conditions in north Wales."
Flood alerts updates and information are available on Floodline 0845 988 11 88.
