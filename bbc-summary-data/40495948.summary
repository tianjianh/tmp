Super League: Huddersfield Giants 40-0 Widnes Vikings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Giants improved their chances of a top-eight finish in Super League as they eased to victory over struggling Widnes Vikings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giants led 18-0 after 16 minutes with tries from Shannon Wakeman, Jermaine McGillvary and Ryan Hinchcliffe.
Adam O'Brien and Darnell McIntosh crossed either side of half-time to extend the lead to 30 points.
McGillvary and Ukuma Ta'ai went over late on as the hosts moved four points clear of ninth-placed Catalans.
While England winger McGillvary was in dominant form, the Giants were just as impressive as a defensive unit, as they held an opponent without points for the first time since April 2016.
Widnes have now ended a game scoreless two times this season, having lost 34-0 at home to leaders Castleford in March.
The Vikings were already out of contention for a place in the top eight ahead of the Super 8s split, as they remain in 11th place with two games to play.
Huddersfield Giants: Rankin; McGillvary, Cudjoe, Gaskell, McIntosh; Brough, Ridayrd; Rapira, Leeming, Wakeman, Roberts, Ta'ai, Hinchcliffe.
Replacements: Clough, Dickinson, Mellor, O'Brien.
Widnes Vikings: Thompson; Ince, Bridge, Runciman, Marsh; Mellor, Heremaia; Dudson, White, Buchanan, Whitley, Houston, Cahill.
