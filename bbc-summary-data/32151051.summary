[SN]TITLE[SN]
Second ward at Dumfries Infirmary shut by norovirus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second ward has been closed at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary following an outbreak of norovirus, the NHS has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward 10 has been shut to admissions and transfers, and there is a temporary restriction on visiting.
It follows the closure of ward nine on Monday, after 11 patients displayed symptoms of the winter vomiting bug.
An NHS spokeswoman said a total of 28 patients and four staff had experienced sickness and diarrhoea.
Dr Martin Connor, consultant microbiologist and infection control doctor, said: "We appreciate that this temporary visiting restriction to wards nine and 10 may cause some frustration, but this measure will allow us to help prevent further spread of the infection and ensure safe patient care and dignity, at this difficult time."
"Where circumstances are such that relatives are concerned about the need to visit their loved ones in wards nine and 10, they are asked to contact the ward before coming to the hospital.
"All members of the public who plan to visit other areas of the hospital are asked not to visit if they are suffering symptoms of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, and to comply with the hand hygiene and infection control measures in place."
Both wards nine and 10 are general medical wards.
