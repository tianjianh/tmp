Olivia Burke and Niccolai Schuster, also both 21, are expected to be buried on Wednesday, while LorcÃ¡n Miller will be laid to rest on Thursday.
The sixth victim, Ashley Donohoe, 22, was buried in California on Saturday.

Five of the six people who died were Irish students based in the US as part of a work exchange programme.
Mr Culligan's funeral is taking place at the Church of the Annunciation in Rathfarnham.
A guard of honour was formed outside the church by students from his former school and members of the Ballyboden GAA club, where Eoghan played gaelic football.
Ms Walsh's funeral is taking place at the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Foxrock.
Meanwhile, one of the other Irish students injured when the balcony collapsed has been released from hospital in California.
Sean Fahey, from Rathmines in Dublin, is now due to travel home to Ireland.
Another six students injured in the tragedy remain in hospital.
