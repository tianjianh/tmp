The cat found itself stranded on the ledge just outside a window - but couldn't get back in.
It was spotted by a neighbour and rescue officers came and used a pole with a plastic loop to grab it!
Officers below stood with a big blanket stretched out just in case things went wrong but luckily the cat was unharmed and reunited with its owner.
