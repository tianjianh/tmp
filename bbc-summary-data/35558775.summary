[SN]TITLE[SN]
Moray Council: 'No redundancies or reduction of services'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Council workers in Moray are being assured there will be no redundancies or reductions to services in the 12 months, ahead of budget talks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors are set to discuss the budget proposals at a special meeting of the council next week.
The budget proposals include reductions to training budgets.
Earlier this month, the local authority dropped plans to put up council tax by 18% and said it would maintain the freeze on household bills.
The council's ruling independent/Conservative administration initially said the move was necessary to protect frontline services.
However, council leader Stewart Cree said the amount it could raise would be "all but wiped out by Scottish government penalties".
Every Scottish council accepted the Scottish government's funding deal.
