A co-founder of National Dance Company Wales has stepped down from his post as artistic associate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roy Campbell-Moore's decision comes after he was suspended following a complaint about his behaviour by members of staff.
The issue was being investigated by a third party.
Mr Campbell-Moore said he had decided to embark on a freelance career as a photographer.
Founded in 1983 under the name Diversions, the company based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff is currently on a spring tour.
He had been an artistic associate, having previously founded the company and then leading it as artistic director.
Announcing his decision to step down, he said: "In the last few years I have had the opportunity to develop my interest in photography alongside my dance work and I have decided to embark on a freelance career as a photographer."
News of Mr Campbell-Moore's suspension last month came just weeks after he and his wife Ann Sholem, who founded the company with him, were presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the inaugural Theatre Critics of Wales Awards for their contribution to the arts in Wales.
After Mr Campbell-Moore announced his decision to stand down, Prof Andrew Davies, chair of National Dance Company Wales (NDCWales), wished him well in his future career.
"He and Ann Sholem have made a huge contribution to the dance and arts scene in Wales through the establishment of NDCWales," he added.
NDCWales said it would make no comment about the progress of the investigation into Mr Campbell-Moore.
