A woman's body has been found on a motorway outside Portsmouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The M27 was congested westbound near Downend Road bridge, causing long delays for motorists.
Hampshire Constabulary was called at 13:30 GMT to reports of a body between junctions 11 and 12. The motorway was closed but has since reopened.
The death is being treated as unexplained and it is unclear how the body got there, police said. Motorists were advised to avoid the area.
