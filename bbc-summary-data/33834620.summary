[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rugby Championship: Australia 27-19 New Zealand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nic White's late scoring burst gave Australia victory over New Zealand to claim the Rugby Championship in Sydney.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scrum-half came off the bench, kicked a penalty and converted his own try as the Wallabies beat the All Blacks for the first time since 2011.
Prop Sekope Kepu and winger Adam Ashley-Cooper also crossed for the Australians with Nehe Milner-Skudder scoring twice on his New Zealand debut.
The All Blacks led 19-17 with 11 minutes left before White took control.
Victory gives Michael Cheika's side a boost before next weekend's Bledisloe Cup decider at Eden Park, as well as the forthcoming World Cup.
Dan Carter kicked New Zealand into a 6-3 lead in the first-half, with Matt Giteau responding for the Wallabies.
Aaron Smith's sin-bin started the second-half drama, and Australia capitalised on the extra man as Kepu danced over for his first Test try - to make amends for his early yellow card.
Carter's third kick of the game made it 10-9 and it saw the All Blacks fly-half become the first person in Test rugby union history to reach 1,500 points.
With Nick Phipps in the bin, Milner-Skudder raced over to put the Kiwis ahead again but Ashley-Cooper restored Australia's lead when he snuck in to score in the corner, and Giteau converted.
Winger Milner-Skudder scrambled over for his second to make it 19-17, but Carter missed his second conversion, and White stole the glory to win it late on for the Wallabies.
