Peak District bird of prey project results 'disappointing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A five-year project to boost bird of prey populations in the Peak District has returned "disappointing results", official have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bird of Prey Initiative aimed to increase breeding populations of raptors in the Dark Peak area of the national park.
Results showed peregrine numbers had declined while others were below expectations.
Illegal persecution and availability of prey were cited as possible causes.
Rhodri Thomas, ecologist with the Peak District Park Authority, described the results of the report as "concerning and disappointing".
The Dark Peak is a mostly wild area in the north of the national park - mostly within Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. It was designated with Special Protection Area status in 1996 due to being an important site for raptors.
The initiative - which focused on populations of merlin, peregrine falcon and short-eared owl - had aimed to restore numbers to the levels seen around the time of the designation.

Numerous theories have been put forward to explain the decline, including climate change, predation, disturbance and availability of food.
However, Mr Thomas said none had been proven.
He said in the case of short-eared owls the fluctuation in numbers was likely to be caused by the availability of food.
Climate change has been suggested to explain the possible departure of merlin - which have been reported nesting and breeding at higher altitudes.
A decline in the numbers of young starlings as a food source has also been put forward as a reason, Mr Thomas said.
"Disturbance - either accidental or otherwise - is another possible cause," he said.
Mr Thomas said the decline in peregrine numbers was the hardest to explain as numbers in other parts of the park were increasing, and there was no obvious reason why they were staying away from the Dark Peak.
He added he was determined to "bottom-out" what was causing the decline.
