"The club is disappointed Celtic did not take up its ticket allocation," said Linfield chairman Roy McGivern.
"It was their decision and we respect that but we remain disappointed."
Linfield say they were initially given an allocation of 1,000 tickets for the match at Celtic Park but received an additional amount after making a formal request to Celtic.
"It's a massive game for all concerned and that creates pressure," McGivern said. "But we truly look forward to the occasion."
