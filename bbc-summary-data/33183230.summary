June is the time of year when people are most likely to be attacked by seagulls.

After pairing up and nesting in May, the birds become defensive and are on the lookout for even more food than usual.
But local authorities have no legal power to deal with them.
The RSPB said even though more and more are being seen, they are actually protected because of their reducing numbers.
Margaret Parry from Moelfre on Anglesey, was attacked by a seagull which felt its chick had been threatened.
"She cut me on my face, couple of inches cut, hospital job," she said.
Ms Parry told BBC Radio Cymru's Manylu programme that her wound had to be glued, she needed a tetanus injection and experienced headaches for three days.
Contractor Geraint Williams, from Caernarfon, uses a distress alarm to attract seagulls and then releases a bird of prey which is trained to scare them away from the area.
It is a method designed to get rid of the birds from company buildings without killing them.
"They are very inquisitive birds and if they hear one of their own in distress, they will come to investigate," he said.
