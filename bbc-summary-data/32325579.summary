Bosses have met with unions in a bid to prevent further strikes at Scotland's regional airports.

A joint statement from Highlands and Islands Airports (Hial) and the Prospect union said both parties were "hopeful of finding a solution".
Security staff staged a 48-hour walkout earlier this month as part of an ongoing dispute over pay.
Hial operates 11 Scottish airports in Dundee, Inverness, Argyll, the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland and Wick.
After the earlier strike saw flights cancelled at Dundee airport, Hial bosses said they were ready to make a "formal offer" to the union, which represents more than 120 staff from security firm AMSL.
The joint statement read: "Hial met with Prospect today to discuss potential solutions to the recent dispute.
"These discussions are on-going and both parties remain hopeful of finding a solution."
