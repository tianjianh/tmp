Nicola Urquhart's comments came after Corrie Mckeague's grandparents offered a five-figure reward for information leading to his discovery.
The RAF gunner from Dunfermline went missing on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September.
Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Louisa Pepper said she was confident in her team of officers.
She said the force was using an "inordinate" amount of resources in the hunt for Mr Mckeague.

Mr Mckeague's mother Mrs Urquhart said: "The police have behaved in such a way that they have utterly destroyed any faith or trust I have in them actually trying to do something to find Corrie.
"They have absolutely destroyed my belief that they are competent and they know what they're doing.
"This is more than just resources, this is an utter betrayal of trust."
Temporary ACC Pepper said she was "surprised" and "disappointed" by Mrs Urquhart's comments.
"We are using the similar resources we would put into a murder investigation," she said.
"I'm absolutely confident that my officers are doing everything they can to find Corrie.
"They are highly skilled, they are highly professional and they're determined to find him and understand the circumstances around his disappearance."
Meanwhile, Mary and Oliver Mckeague said they are offering a reward to the "individual who provides information that leads to our grandson's discovery and return".
Mrs Mckeague said she believed he might "have gone" with a "third party".
Corrie Mckeague was last seen on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Brentgovel Street, Bury St Edmunds, at about 03:20 BST.
