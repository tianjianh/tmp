The teenager died at the Sick Kids hospital following the accident which happened on Silverknowes Road at about 16:00 on Friday.
Another 14-year-old, who was a passenger on the bike, is being treated in hospital for serious injuries.
Police appealed for witnesses to the crash which involved a white Vertigo motorcycle and a black Toyota Aygo.
The accident happened near the junction with Silverknowes Court. Both vehicles were travelling north.
Police Scotland are particularly keen to trace the driver of a white Mercedes limousine-style car which was travelling north on Silverknowes Road at the time, as they believe the driver may have information.
Sgt Brian Smith said: "This collision has resulted in death of a teenage boy and our condolences are with his family at this sad time.
"Our inquiries continue in order to establish the full circumstance surrounding this, and anyone who may have witnessed the collision is urged to get in touch."
The road was reopened at about 21:45.
