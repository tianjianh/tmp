Election 2015: Bridge tolls a 'cash cow', say Lib Dems

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats have accused their election rivals of planning to use Severn Bridge tolls as a "cash-cow" when they return to public ownership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party says scrapping the tolls in 2018 would save commuters up to Â£1,300 a year more than other parties' plans.
Lib Dem candidate Jenny Willott called the tolls a "huge barrier to business".
Conservative Chancellor George Osborne announced in his March Budget that Severn Bridge tolls for cars and vans will be cut to Â£5.40 in 2018.
Ms Willott said: "Tolls are extremely rare in the UK, so I see no reason why people should be forced to pay to enter Wales."
"Plaid, the Tories and Labour all want to keep the tolls as a cash-cow - the Lib Dems won't let that happen," she added.
Plaid Cymru candidate Steffan Lewis said his party would lower the fee to Â£2 per car and wants to see the Welsh government take control over the bridge.
Labour and the Conservatives have been asked to comment.
