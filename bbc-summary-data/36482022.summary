A Swansea PCSO was killed when he tried to avoid potholes on his bike and veered into the path of an oncoming car, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Lewis was on a family holiday in July 2015 when the accident happened as he cycled with a friend in Combe Martin, Devon.
An inquest in Exeter heard Mr Lewis, 41, died of multiple injuries after the head-on collision.
A conclusion of accidental death was returned.
Mr Lewis and his friend had been travelling about 26mph (40 km) when they approached a blind bend on a steep hill, the inquest heard.
PC Michelle Innes said there was an area of "poorly conditioned road surface" near the accident scene.
But she told the inquest it was unclear if Mr Lewis had ridden through the potholes before braking harshly and veering into the path of a Skoda.
His riding companion, Stephen Howell, said: "He drifted, I am not sure why, to avoid potholes or the road was a bit slippery."
A report by Devon council confirmed the road had a "worn, degraded surface".
South Wales Police said Mr Lewis was a "hugely respected" PCSO who was married with a family in Swansea and worked in Neath.
