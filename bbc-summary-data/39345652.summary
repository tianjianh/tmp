Pet 'poisoning' warning at Bryn Glas Road, Holyhead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six pets from the same street on Anglesey have suffered suspected poisoning, prompting an RSPCA warning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five cats and a dog were reportedly poisoned on Bryn Glas Road in Holyhead.
One of the cats had to be euthanised after it had ingested anti-freeze.
The RSPCA said it was not known whether the poisonings were deliberate, but so many incidents in one area was "particularly concerning" and asked people to be cautious.
