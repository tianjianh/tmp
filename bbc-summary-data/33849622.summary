The WalkCar can reach a top speed of just over 6mph (10km/h) and can support riders weighing up to 120kg (265lbs).
Inventor Kuniaki Sato said the device was designed for recreational use as well as for business.
He told Reuters: "I want to show the world that Japan can also be innovative."
Mr Sato is hoping to secure crowdfunding before the gadget can be mass produced.
