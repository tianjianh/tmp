The BBC's world affairs editor, 72, first revealed his illness last week.
He tweeted: "Thank heavens for Stuart McKechnie & the ICU team at the Radcliffe. I'd not have survived, due to a rare & deadly allergic reaction."
On Sunday, Simpson thanked a well-wisher on Twitter, saying it was "terrifying but all fine now".
Simpson's wife Dee Kruger Simpson said he was suddenly taken seriously ill on Thursday 9 September with a bout of mild food-poisoning and dehydration.
She told the BBC he had "an acute and toxic shock to his system which made him suddenly very unwell".
"Within an hour of being admitted to the John Radcliffe Hospital (in Oxford), Dr Stuart Mckechnie and his medical team were suddenly fighting to save John's life.  A rare and unusual case, was how doctors described it, and a certain amount of pure bad luck," she said.
"Doctors are expecting that John will make a full recovery and he is very much looking forward to resuming his work."
He was discharged from hospital on Sunday and is now resting up at home.
Simpson praised the staff of the hospital in another tweet on Sunday, crediting them with saving his life.
And on Monday, he posted: "Thanks again to the magnificent NHS - my Monday outlook is perfect."
Simpson joined the BBC at 25 as a sub-editor in the radio newsroom, before becoming a political reporter and then political editor. He later became a foreign affairs correspondent.
In 1991, he was the BBC's key correspondent in Baghdad during the Gulf War, staying in the city despite being ordered to leave by his employers.
Since becoming the editor of the BBC's world affairs unit, the stories he has covered included the fall of Ceausescu in Romania and Nelson Mandela's release from prison.
Simpson currently reports on areas including Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, China, Russia and Ukraine.
