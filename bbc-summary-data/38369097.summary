The 30-year-old, who has nine senior international caps for Wales, joined Bath in September on a short-term deal.
The former Newport Gwent Dragons and Biarritz player began his career at Ospreys, and also had a short spell with Cardiff Blues.
"I've really enjoyed getting a good run of games under my belt," Brew told Bath's club website.
Director of rugby Todd Blackadder added: "Aled has brought so much to the team, on and off the field, since his arrival and will continue to form an integral part of the squad."
