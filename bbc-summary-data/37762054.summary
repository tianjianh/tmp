More than 75kg of the drug were found near the tourist hotspot of the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare.
Revenue customs officers responded to a report from a member of the public about the suspicious device.
They believe it may have been attached below the waterline of a cargo ship or other sea vessel.
Small bales of cocaine, each about a foot long and weighing about 1kg, were found wrapped in plastic inside the 6ft metal tube on Monday.
A spokeswoman said: "It is not possible at this stage to say either where the drugs originated or their intended destination."
Officials said the alarm was raised thanks to a programme that urges people living in coastal communities, maritime personnel and people living near airfields to report unusual or suspicious activities.
