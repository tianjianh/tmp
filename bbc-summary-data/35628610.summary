The family and friends of man who drowned in the sea at Scarborough have raised money to fund a sea safety campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew McGeown, 32, died after jumping into the sea to rescue his dog on 22 February 2015.
Mr McGeown was pulled unconscious from the water by the crew of the town's lifeboat and taken to hospital but was later pronounced dead.
The funds will be spent on sea swimming training for children in the town.
Donna Loveland, Andrew McGeown's sister, said: "It has been a very difficult year for us all since we lost Andrew.
"We do not want other families to go through what we have. With the help of family, friends and the local community we have raised around Â£11,000 to help reduce dangers at sea."
Training sessions will be held for seven to 14 year olds in Scarborough during the summer, run by the Amateur Swimming Association and the RNLI as part of its Swim Safe programme.
Money will also be spent on erecting safety signs along the resort's promenade.
