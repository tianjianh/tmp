County Championship: Adam Rossington helps Northants push for Sussex win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Rossington's career-best 138 not out on day three put Northamptonshire in a strong position against Sussex in their Division Two game at Arundel.

Rossington reached his fourth first-class ton off 101 balls as Northants declared on 478-5, exactly 300 ahead.
He hit 17 fours and five sixes, and was also involved in an unbroken 199-run partnership with David Murphy (60 not out) before the declaration came.
Openers Chris Nash and Ed Joyce saw Sussex to 70-0 at stumps, 230 behind.
The visitors will aim to complete their first Championship win of the season on Saturday and will hope that the bad weather which caused almost 100 overs to be lost on the first two days will not prove costly.
Murphy was one of five Northants batsmen to pass 50 in their first innings.
Earlier, captain Alex Wakely (46) failed to add to his overnight score but a fourth-wicket stand of 119 between Sean Terry (54) and Rob Keogh (75) forged a lead.
