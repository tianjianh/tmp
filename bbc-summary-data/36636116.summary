The 62-year-old is the long-term replacement for Christian Gourcuff who stood down from the position in April.
Rajevac is best known in Africa for coaching Ghana's national team, guiding them to within a penalty kick of the 2010 World Cup semi-finals in South Africa.
The Serbian coach also previously managed Qatar's national team.
The Algerian Federation confirmed Rajevac had signed a contract on Sunday.
The Federation also stated he would be in Algeria in mid-July, when he is set to be officially introduced to the world's press.
No details of Rajevac's contract were revealed but he is likely to be in charge of Algeria's qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Algeria were drawn in a challenging group for the World Cup qualifiers on Friday, featuring alongside Nigeria, Cameroon and Zambia in Group B. The group matches kick off in October.
Rajevac will also guide Algeria at the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Gabon next year.
