US election daily dig: Ready to air some dirty laundry?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With just 11 days to go until election day, Donald Trump's sheets come under scrutiny, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama have a love-in and Gary Johnson denies being a dummy.

It's all gone a bit girl crush and bromance on the campaign trail. In their first public appearance together, First Lady Michelle Obama heaped praise on "her girl" and "her friend" Hillary Clinton. Mrs Clinton reciprocated by eulogising: "Seriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?" There was even a sitting dance - by Michelle Obama - and a big hug.
Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin and Mr Trump have been working on their bromance. This time it was Mr Putin's turn to flatter. "He behaves extravagantly of course... he has chosen a method to get through to voters' hearts," he told a conference in Sochi. "[Donald Trump] simply represents the interests of simple people."
And there seems to have been a rare meeting of right and left, with Mr Trump tweeting that he agrees with liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, who suggests in his film, Michael Moore in TrumpLand, that the Republican nominee could win the election because working-class Americans are sick of the Washington establishment.
"The dispossessed will walk into the voting booth... and put a big [expletive] 'X' in the box on the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives - Donald J. Trump," he says, before he goes on to make the case for Mrs Clinton.
It hasn't all been a love affair, though. After the grand unveiling of Trump International Hotel, the Inside Edition decided to do a bit of reconnaissance work, forking out $900 for a room to spray a fluorescent UV logo on sheets, pillows and a bathrobe to see if the cleaners were up to scratch.
The verdict? Leave the bathrobe on its hanger. Not that we're airing any dirty laundry.
In other news, the Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding Mr Trump as he argues about the election being "rigged," claiming his argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities.
And the Republican nominee doesn't seem to have won many friends in the UK parliament - with 64% of British MPs questioned believing the world would be "much more dangerous" with him in the White House.
Vice-President Joe Biden is at the top of a short list that Hillary Clinton's transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, reports Politico.
There was a jaw-dropping moment during Thursday night's debate between Democrat Tammy Duckworth and Republican Mark Kirk in the Illinois Senate race debate. Iraq war amputee Duckworth - whose mother is from Thailand - was talking about her military service, and Kirk rebutted: "I'd forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington." Not cool.
Meanwhile, Yale Record, which has a 144-year-old policy of not endorsing presidential candidates, has stuck to its guns, saying it will not even back its alumnus, Mrs Clinton. But the newspaper added tongue-in-cheek: "We do not endorse Hillary Clinton's exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye." Rhetoricians will recognise this device as apophasis, where a speaker appears to reject a topic, but actually supports the idea.
Finally, Libertarian candidate for president, Gary Johnson, of Aleppo "mind blank" fame, has lashed out at independent candidate Evan McMullin for being a "spoiler" and accused the press of treating him as "a dummy". "I'm not a dummy. I'm not. I'm human," he told the Guardian.
5 million
The money Hillary Clinton could still spend every day from now until Election Day. The Democratic presidential nominee still has a $62m stash of cash in the bank, the latest Federal Election Commission reports show. They also reveal Mr Trump hasn't raised any money for the Republican National Committee this month.
Hillary Clinton is holding two early vote rallies in Iowa, while her running mate Tim Kaine campaigns with former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was shot while attending a constituency event in 2011, in Tucson, Arizona.
Her surrogates are also out and about, with President Barack Obama in Orlando and Bill Clinton in Pennsylvania.
Donald Trump is campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire and Maine, while his running mate Mike Pence is holding rallies in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
