Froch, 38, from Nottingham, who has been crowned world champion four times, has now retired from the sport.
The super-middleweight fighter's last bout ended in victory against George Groves in front of a record breaking crowd at Wembley in May 2014.
Injury ended plans to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in Las Vegas in March.
Last week Froch said he would consider returning to the ring for one fight to reclaim his title.
The boxer, who has won 33 of his 35 fights at super middleweight level, grew up in Gedling, just outside Nottingham.
When he was notified of the MBE in June, he said it was a "massive honour and a big surprise".
He became an honorary freeman of of the city in September 2014.
