Swansea City boss Paul Clement will have gained a lot as a manager from their battle against Premier League relegation, says West Brom head coach Tony Pulis.

The Swans were bottom of the league when Clement arrived in January as replacement for Bob Bradley.
Clement has won 26 points from his 18 games in charge and has been nominated for manager of the season.
"I'm sure they will be much better off for it next year," Pulis said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Sport, Pulis continued: "Paul would have got a lot of experience from his time at Derby, although it didn't go that well for him there.
"The fact he's managed to come into Swansea, roll his sleeves up and pull them out of trouble, he'll become a better manager himself but I'm sure the club will do better next year under him."
Clement was assistant to Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, Real Madrid, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich, and Pulis says he has adapted well to working at a smaller club in Swansea.
He was sacked as Derby boss, his only managerial role before Swansea, after eight months in February 2016.
"I think the great thing is that you've got a smashing manager who's had wonderful experience as an assistant at top clubs," Pulis added.
"He's had a go at Derby himself so he's found the pitfalls there and come back and done a fantastic job at Swansea.
"He'll understand and recognise that when you are working with a smaller club, those small margins are even smaller than what you could imagine to get the results that you need."
Swansea host West Brom in their final Premier League game of the season on Sunday.
