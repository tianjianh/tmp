[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Pembrokeshire man paralysed from the waist down was caught driving at 80mph while over the drink-drive limit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Laville, 21, pushed his right hand on his right leg to accelerate and his left hand on his left leg to brake.
Laville, of Pembroke, admitted dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol, no insurance and no licence.
A Swansea Crown Court judge said it "defies belief" and Laville was jailed for 12 months, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for two years.
Laville, who was paralysed in a motorcycle crash in September 2011, drove his girlfriend's Toyota Yaris, which had not been adapted, along the A477 near Kilgetty before being stopped by police.
A breath test showed a reading of 46 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath; the legal limit is 35.
Defending, David Williams said: "He is impulsive and unable to think through his actions."
Laville, who appeared in court in a wheelchair, was also ordered to pay Â£900 in prosecution costs.
Judge Paul Thomas described his attitude as "appalling" and said Laville should have appreciated what the consequences could have been for other road users.
