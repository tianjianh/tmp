The Frenchman, 29, joined the Canaries from Hamilton in February 2015, but made only eight first-team appearances.
He spent last season on loan at Dundee United in the Scottish Championship, where he scored 19 goals in 43 games.
"He is a goalscoring number 10 and a versatile attacking player that can play anywhere along the forward line," said Coventry boss Mark Robins.
Checkatrade Trophy holders Coventry have now made 12 summer signings following relegation from League One in May.
Goalkeeper: Liam O'Brien (Portsmouth)
Defenders: Rod McDonald (Northampton Town), Dominic Hyam (Reading), Jack Grimmer (Fulham), James Pearson (Barnet)
Midfield:  Michael Doyle (Portsmouth), Liam Kelly (Orient), Peter Vincenti (Rochdale), Tony Andreu (Norwich City)
Strikers:  Marc McNulty (Sheffield United), Maxime Biamou (Sutton United), Duckens Nazon (Wolves)
