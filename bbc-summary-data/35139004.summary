The 25-year-old's toe-poke gave the Owls the lead early in the first half following a scramble in the box.
Kieran Lee doubled the hosts' lead two minutes later, drilling the ball low past Birmingham keeper Tomasz Kuszczak.
Forestieri wrapped up all three points with a thumping right-foot shot in the second half, as the visitors managed just two shots on target.
Wednesday dominated the early passages of play and Jack Hunt's cross from the right caused chaos in the Birmingham box before Forestieri took advantage.
The visitors were unlucky to fall two goals behind almost immediately after as the ball ricocheted off a City player and into Lee's path, allowing the midfielder time and space to find the back of the net.
Having failed to register a single shot on target in the first half, Blues fell further behind just three minutes after the break as forward Forestieri scored his second, carrying the ball from his own half before cutting inside and firing past Kuszczak.
It was a second consecutive win for Sheffield Wednesday, but for Birmingham it was a sixth defeat in 11 matches.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal: "We waited for our moment to start opening spaces and when we did we scored one then a second.
"At half-time we corrected a few things and more importantly, I said that we need to show Birmingham that we want the third goal.
"Fernando got the third goal and after that everything was in our players' control."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: "They've got some really good individual players who can hurt you on any given day, but until the first goal I thought there wasn't a great deal in the game.

"They got the opening goal and it was a very poor goal from our point of view, but I've seen the replay and you can quite clearly see there's a foul from Atdhe Nuhiu and then the ball comes off Forestieri's hand.
"As we see in this division, if one or two things go against you it can be a mountain to climb."
