Youths gathering in an Anglesey town centre face being ordered to move, after police imposed an anti-social dispersal order in the area.

It follows complaints over gangs of young adults gathering in Llangefni, drinking alcohol and causing criminal damage.
The power allows police and community support officers to force troublemakers to leave.
The order will remain in force until 01:00 BST on Sunday.
"The action we are taking is twofold," explained Sgt Tracey Llewellyn, from Anglesey's Safer Neighbourhood policing team.
"Initially we would like to reassure those living in or visiting the town centre that we are taking positive action against youths causing repeat issues of anti-social behaviour in and around the town to ensure that they are not plagued by the behaviour of certain youths.
"Equally importantly is to protect young people from the excesses of alcohol and its potential consequences."
The dispersal order means any person under 16-years-old can also be taken home, or to a place of safety.
Individuals can also be banned from the area for up to 24 hours, or face arrest if they return.
