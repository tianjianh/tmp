Dynamo, Gary and Frosty, the South American animals, attend Millgate School.
Student Keenan said: "When you're angry, you can just come and calm down and feed them, get your emotions out."
Staff said the alpacas have "definitely" had a "noticeable affect" on the pupils.
The residential school, which is home to 72 boys, said it was the children's idea and there are plans to get donkeys in the future.
