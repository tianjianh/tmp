An appeal has been launched to raise £5,000 for the funeral of seven-year-old Conley Thompson, who died on a building site.

June Bacon started the campaign "to give this little boy a good send-off".
A post-mortem showed that Conley died after entering a vertical pipe on a building site near his home in Worsbrough, Barnsley, earlier this week.
The FundRazr appeal raised £1,050 after 20 hours.
Ms Bacon, from Barnsley, said she wanted to "make life easier for Conley's family at this tough time".
She said she was "heartbroken" when she heard about Conley's death and has been overwhelmed at the public's response to the appeal.
"It's absolutely amazing the amount of people who have contributed and dug into their pockets, spare change or whatever," she said.
Conley was reported missing at around 22:00 BST on Sunday after not returning home from playing with friends.
His disappearance prompted a large overnight police search and his body was found at 08:30 on Monday.
On Tuesday, South Yorkshire Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.
But officers have issued an appeal for people to help piece together Conley's movements before he died.
