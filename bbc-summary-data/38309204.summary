Glasgow v Racing 92: Warriors raring to show Paris win not one-off - Henry Pyrgos

Scotland scrum-half Henry Pyrgos says Glasgow are raring to show that beating Racing 92 in Paris was not a one-off in their quest for European progress.

Pyrgos believes the Warriors will have to play even better in Friday's return Champions Cup pool fixture to overcome the French giants for a second time.
But victory at Scotstoun would give Glasgow a shot at a last-eight spot.
"We've been competing at the top end of the [Pro12] league for a while but we have not cracked Europe," Pyrgos said.
"When you look at the Racing team sheet you can probably see why. Every team you come up against is a real quality side.
"In the past we have had good wins but we are going to have to back it up week after week and play really well consistently.  That is the challenge for us this weekend.
"It is an exciting one and the boys are raring to go.  They want to go out and show we can do it again against quality opposition."
Doing the double over Racing would give Glasgow a third victory from four matches in Pool One, ahead of their final fixtures in January against current leaders Munster (at home) and Leicester (away).
But with only the best three runners-up progressing alongside the five pool winners, qualifying for the quarter-finals for the first time remains a stiff target.
Despite their euphoria at what Pyrgos describes as "one of the best wins we have had as a club", the 27-year-old insists the Warriors are taking nothing for granted about their European prospects.
"Winning away in France is huge for the group," acknowledged the scrum-half, who has signed a new two-year contract until 2019.
"It was obviously a great win and it doesn't happen all the time, especially against world-class opposition at club level.
"But even if we win again this weekend, there are still two huge games to go.  You saw the result Munster had [38-0 against Leicester] at the weekend and obviously the performance they put in against us recently [a 16-15 win at Scotstoun].
"Leicester are still a quality side even if they are not playing as well as they would like to.
"So we take nothing for granted. The win on the weekend was amazing but we are going to have to back it up and then do it again and again."
Pyrgos, the Warriors' co-captain this season alongside Jonny Gray, has seen Ali Price emerge as a serious rival for club and country in the past month while he was sidelined with a knee injury.
Citing the squad's potential to add more trophies to their 2015 Pro12 title as a key factor in his decision to sign a new deal, Pyrgos is confident he will remain a central figure in the club's development.
"The whole time I have been here there has been competition to play scrum-half - it has never been an easy thing," he added. "But I am confident in my own ability to compete for that shirt.
"It is a good challenge. Ali is going really well but if you want to be part of a good team, there is going to be competition.
"When you are out injured that gives someone else an opportunity. But it is great to be back fit and training again, and great to be involved last weekend.  I am just working really hard to get back to the level I can play at and go from there."
