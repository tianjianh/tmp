But as Liverpool fans scramble to find out more about the big German they'll soon discover some pretty funny facts about how he works and where he's come from.
Here are the eight things we think you need to know about one of the brightest young managers in the game.
Jurgen Klopp's middle name is actually Norbert.
Klopp spent his entire playing career with one team. He was at German side Mainz 05 for 12 years before going on to manage the team for another seven. He is still the longest serving manager in Mainz's history.
Klopp had a hair transplant, similar to Wayne Rooney, in 2012 and is very proud of how it turned out. Talking to journalists  in an interview at the time he said: "Yes, it's true. I underwent a hair transplant. I think the results are really cool, don't you?"
At his old clubs Mainz and Borussia Dortmund he became famous for his passionate celebrations. Whether it's doing a funny dance, sliding across the grass on his knees or kissing his own players Liverpool fans could have as much fun watching the dug out as the games. Klopp even tore a muscle once during one famous celebration.
Klopp loves long walks and has admitted that he often strolls home after matches to think about what he could have done better.
He is only the second German ever to manage in the Premier League. The first was Felix Magath who took charge of Fulham in 2014.
Jurgen is not just entertaining, he's good at his job too. He took Borussia Dortmund to back to back league titles in Germany. He was also named German Football Manager of the Year in 2011 and 2012, still the only man to have won the award two years in a row.
When Borussia Dortmund were preparing for their Champions League match against Arsenal in 2014, Klopp turned down the chance to train at the Emirates stadium and took his team to London's Regent park instead.
