Police in the Highlands have scaled down their search for a missing man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lachlan Simpson, a chef from Embo, near Dornoch, has not been seen since he left a dance in the town at 01:30 last Sunday morning.
Dozens of volunteers joined police teams, search dogs, coastguard and an RAF mountain rescue team in the search for the 22-year-old.
Police said co-ordinated volunteer searches had been concluded but investigations were continuing.
On Saturday, 56 volunteers joined police and rescue services to search outlying parts of Dornoch and an area known locally as The Links.
Ch Insp Iain MacLelland said: "Once again, I would seek this opportunity to voice my appreciation to those volunteers who have provided tremendous support over the past few days and once again this morning.
"It has now been a week since Lachlan was last seen and it goes without saying that we remain concerned for his welfare.
"It is possible that he may have sought shelter so we would again appeal to people with outbuildings or sheds to check these and report anything unusual to us.
"Co-ordinated volunteer searches have now concluded but I would stress that this is still a missing person inquiry and investigations do remain ongoing.
"We have carried out detailed searches of the areas where Lachlan was last seen including coastline and in-land areas surrounding Dornoch.
"We are continuing to keep Lachlan's family updated and provide them with support at this difficult time."
Mr Simpson is described as 6ft tall, slim-medium build, with short fair hair.
He was wearing a green and white top when he went missing.
