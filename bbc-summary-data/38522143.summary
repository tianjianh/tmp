[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A neighbour of a woman alleged to have been tied up and murdered said he heard moaning and the sound of a head hitting a wall on the day she died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Davenport told jurors at Warwick Crown Court the sounds appeared to be coming from the bathroom where Bethany Hill's body was found.
It is alleged Miss Hill, 20, was killed by Jack Williams and his girlfriend, Kayleigh Woods, at the flat they all shared in Stratford-upon-Avon.
The pair both deny murder.

Mr Davenport told the court there had been terrible anti-social behaviour at the one-bedroom flat occupied by Mr Williams, 21, and Ms Woods, 23.
Jurors heard he made five recordings between 01:30 and 03:00 GMT on 3 February last year to pass on to the housing association, which ran the block of flats on Hertford Road.
Describing events after he was woken by a loud bang at about 01:30, Mr Davenport said he heard "what I thought was something hitting a wall".
"It sounded like a head or something hitting a wall," he said.
During the third recording, which began at 02:21 and lasted for 15 minutes, he said he heard the sound of a female moaning.
"It basically sounded as if somebody was in distress," he said.
Mr Davenport, who also told the court he had heard a cutlery drawer being opened and closed aggressively, was cross-examined by Michael Duck QC, who is defending Mr Williams.
Asked why he had not dialled 999, Mr Davenport added: "I thought somebody had fallen or they were drunk."
The court was told Miss Hill died of a neck wound inflicted with a blade that was later found dumped in a river.
The trial continues.
