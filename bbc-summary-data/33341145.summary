The incident happened at Baltimore Harbour on Tuesday evening.
Irish state broadcaster, RTÃ‰, said the two who died have been named locally as Barry Ryan from Baltimore and Niamh O'Connor from Glanmire in Cork city.
A Coast Guard helicopter has joined the search for Mr Ryan's son and Ms O'Connor's boyfriend, Barry Davis Ryan.
It is understood the victims were part of a group walking close to Baltimore harbour when one of them fell into the sea.
Two others then went into the water in an attempt to rescue the first person, but all three got into difficulties.
The alarm was raised at 18:40 local time by a member of their group who remained on the shore.
Mr Ryan Sr, who was in his 50s, and Ms O'Connor were brought ashore by a Baltimore-based lifeboat but they were both later pronounced dead.
The search for Mr Ryan Jr was called off due to fading light on Tuesday night, but resumed early on Wednesday.
