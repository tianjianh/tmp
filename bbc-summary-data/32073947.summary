The 26-year-old Gambian only recently returned from a year-long knee injury by playing for Boro's reserves, but is yet to make a first-team comeback.
He joins a Seagulls side who are 16th in the Championship table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.
Carayol joined Middlesbrough from Bristol Rovers in 2012 and has scored 12 goals in 54 appearances for Boro.
"Mustapha is an exciting, dynamic player," said Brighton manager Chris Hughton.
"He is quick and direct, and he gives us a different option alongside our other attacking players.
"While he has played for Boro's Under-21s and has recovered from the injury, he is yet to feature in the Championship so it will be a case of reintroducing him to the rigours of first-team football."
Meanwhile Emmanuel Ledesma has returned to Middlesbrough after his loan deal at Brighton expired.
The 26-year-old winger failed to score in four games during his one-month stay at The Amex.
