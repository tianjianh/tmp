Shrubsole took two for 17 in four overs as her Perth Scorchers side restricted the Sixers to 124-5 at the Waca.
But Perth fell seven runs short in the run chase, reaching 117-7, with Brunt top-scoring on 35 not out.
It is the Sixers' first title, having lost in the final of the inaugural competition in 2016 to Sydney Thunder.
The Scorchers later thrashed the Sixers in the Big Bash League final.
