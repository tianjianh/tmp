Rio 2016 Olympic: Scott Evans holds nerve in Rio cauldron to book last-16 spot

Irishman Scott Evans overcame local man Ygor Coelho de Oliveria and a vocal home crowd to book his last-16 spot in the men's badminton competition in Rio.

De Oliveria, 19, was raised in a nearby favela but despite receiving ear-splitting support he was beaten 21-8 19-21 21-8 by the 28-year-old Irishman.
Evans ripped off his shirt and celebrated wildly after his win much to the displeasure of the home crowd.
"I'll definitely never forget tonight," said the Dubliner.
"I knew that the crowd would be crazy tonight but it beat all my expectations.
"Of course the crowd was against me and I understand that, but to play in that kind of atmosphere, it's something really special."
On Friday, Evans became the first Irishman to win a badminton game at an Olympics as he beat German Marc Zwiebler and his victory on Saturday guaranteed his progress to the knock-out stages.
De Oliveira, raised by a badminton-loving father, soaked up the attention after fulfilling his dream of competing at his home Games.
"It was just fantastic," added the Brazilian youngster after he was cheered incessantly by about 200 badminton-playing children and fans from his neighbourhood of Chacrinha.
"In the beginning I was nervous but the people helped me to get up.
"In the second game, it was fantastic I could play my best. In the third set, I think I lost my mind and he played well. But I played my best."
De Oliveira's loss eliminated him from the tournament but he is sure of more vocal support in his dead rubber against German Zwiebler.
His father Sebastiao Dias introduced the genteel sport into Chacrinha by building a court next to his home.
Hoping to get local kids off the street, he began offering training as a social project but had to overcome some initial scepticism.
Introducing samba music into training sessions proved a master-stroke and the school now has about 200 local children training there.
Badminton is a mystery to many Brazilians but De Oliveira has risen to a world ranking of 64, a remarkable achievement given the lack of top coaches and elite compatriots to train with.
Another player from the school, 20-year-old Lohaynny Vicente, also competed at Rio, losing her second pool match earlier on Saturday to be eliminated despite similar deafening barracking.
