Shaun Whalley scored a freak second-half winner straight from a corner to stretch Shrewsbury's unbeaten League One run to five games at Doncaster.

Rovers were by far the better side in the first half but could not make their pressure count as they failed to score for the third time in four games.
They were made to pay on 63 minutes when Town wide man Whalley's inswinging corner flew in at the near post.
His second goal in successive games leaves Rovers without a win in 10.
Visiting keeper Jayson Leutwiler was Shrewsbury's star man with a string of saves, capped by a magnificent effort to tip away Cameron Stewart's injury-time free-kick. And, when he was beaten, Andy Butler had a header cleared off the line by Ian Black.
Shrewsbury Town boss Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"It's a massive victory. The questions the lads have been asked were answered with three points.
"It's a vitally important goal. This is what you get at this time of the season and it's always good to get clean sheets.
"I am delighted with our performance. We needed the energy and enthusiasm of the whole squad to get a result. We had desire and commitment."
