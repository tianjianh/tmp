The list is a countdown of the year's most popular songs voted for by listeners of the alternative music station.
Triple J said there were "a whole range of reasons" behind the decision.
The main one is a social media campaign, originally instigated by Buzzfeed Australia's Mark Di Stefano, to get Shake It Off on the list.
Readers were encouraged to tweet #Tay4Hottest100 to get the song to appear on the countdown, which was thought to be too much of an influence.
Some thought Swift's track was too commercial for the alternative music station, while others said banning the song would be seen as elitism.
The list was topped by Chet Faker's Talk Is Cheap, with Peking Duk's High and Cosby Sweater by Hilltop Hoods completing the top three.
Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk finished sixth on the poll, while alt-J have three songs in the top 30.
Triple J pointed out that Taylor Swift wasn't played at all on the station in 2014 but would have finished ahead of all alt-J's tracks if it wasn't disqualified.
Vance Joy's Riptide won the 2013 poll, which saw a more commercial top three include Lorde's Royals and Get Lucky by Daft Punk.
Triple J presenter Lewis McKirdy, who made the announcement that Taylor Swift's track wouldn't be allowed in the list, directed listeners to a Buzzfeed parody titled 8 Hilarious But Totally True Reasons You Didn't Hear Shake It Off In The Hottest 100, for more information about the decision.
