British pair Thomas Toolis and Kate French came 13th in the mixed relay.
On Saturday, Britain's defending world champion Samantha Murray finished fifth in the women's final.
In the men's event, Jamie Cooke was the highest placed Briton in 22nd. No GB pentathlete has yet qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.
The next chance for Britain's pentathletes to qualify comes at the European Championships in Bath in August.
Bartu said having Cooke, Nick Woodbridge and Joseph Choong qualify for the final was good, but the end result was not.
"They just couldn't follow through and they are better than they showed," he told BBC Sport.
"As far as the girls are concerned there's a real sort of disappointment not seeing Kate French - at least - in the finals."
Bartu added: "We have some work to do up to the European Championships in Bath."
