Venezuela has denounced new US sanctions against it, with its foreign minister saying the US was trying to promote a humanitarian crisis.

Jorge Arreaza also said his country was a victim of "fake news" that exaggerated its economic difficulties.
The US accuses President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government of violating human rights and subverting democracy.
President Trump's order bans trade in Venezuelan debt and blocks its state oil firm from selling bonds in the US.
Mr Arreaza said that the sanctions and "threats" amounted to "uncivilised politics".
President Maduro would not attend the UN General Assembly in New York next month, he said.
Announcing the new sanctions, the White House said the "Maduro dictatorship" was denying Venezuelans food and medicine.
It said the controversial new constituent assembly - which has voted to take powers from the opposition-led parliament - amounted to a "fundamental break in Venezuela's legitimate constitutional order".
Earlier this month, the US imposed sanctions on President Maduro and some of his closest aides.
Separately on Friday, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said that the US was not planning military action in Venezuela "in the near future".
President Trump had controversially raised that possibility two weeks ago.
