One-Day Cup: Warwickshire thrash Surrey in Lord's final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire made short work of claiming the ninth Lord's triumph in their history with an eight-wicket One-Day Cup final destruction of Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surrey were bowled out by the Bears for just 136 as they suffered a second successive Lord's cup final defeat.
England's Chris Woakes, Oliver Hannon-Dalby, Ateeq Javid and Jeetan Patel all took two wickets in a team effort.
Jonathan Trott then made an unbeaten 82 as Warwickshire knocked off the runs in the 31st over.
It was one of the most one-sided Lord's finals there has been - there have only ever been three lower first-innings scores and Surrey never looked like making Lord's history with the lowest first-innings score to win a final. That mark remains the 168 set by Sussex, which Worcestershire failed to reach, in the very first one-day final in 1963.
The Bears' only mildly scary moment came when their first wicket fell on 45.
As it was, after Sam Hain's dismissal to a reverse sweep, the only other batsman to fall was captain Ian Bell, who failed to add to his previous Lord's final scores of 65 not out, 54, 107 and 81, making only 17 this time.
It was Warwickshire's first one-day knockout triumph since beating Somerset here in the 2010 CB40 Trophy, although, as the Birmingham Bears, they did win the T20 at Edgbaston in 2014.
Picking a man of the match cannot have been easy after such an outstanding performance in the field by Warwickshire.
Surrey old boy Laurie Evans' superb one-handed catch to dismiss Jason Roy off Chris Wright was one of the best seen in recent years on the famous old ground.
But Roy had only been forced into such a risky aerial route by Wright putting the brakes on after Bell introduced him in just the seventh over.
I hope someone's got a photo of it. I'd get that framed
England all-rounder Woakes, the man who has even been dubbed the "Brummie Botham" this summer, came back on at the end to finish things off in the manner of the great all-rounder himself.
But his two wickets merely matched what Hannon-Dalby and spinners Javid and Patel had already done.
And Hannon-Dalby and Patel had also combined to good effect with the run-out of Tom Curran.
For all Surrey's struggles, they actually got off to a flying start with a 45-run opening stand. But their early scoring rate of eight an over had already been slowed when Roy was removed by Evans' stunning one-handed catch.
Partner Steven Davies may well have been still in shock when he departed 16 balls later, with just five runs added, stumped off Javid's first ball.
Kumar Sangakkara helped Burns to patch things up with a patient stand of 49 in 14 overs but he became the first of two quick victims for Hannon-Dalby, as three wickets went down in 16 balls for three runs, Ben Foakes and Zafar Ansari becoming the first two of three Surrey ducks.
Sam Curran hit two boundaries before he played on attempting a wild yahoo through midwicket off Javid.
But then, in the space of 24 balls in which they did not score a single run, Tom Curran was run out by Patel after being sent back in a mix-up, skipper Gareth Batty was bowled without scoring by Woakes and finally anchorman Rory Burns was bowled by Patel.
Jade Dernbach did end that scoreless sequence, when he bludgeoned Patel for six over wide mid-on, just a ball after the spinner looked to have got him plumb lbw, but an over later he was gone too, clean bowled by Woakes - a sorry end to a sorry effort.
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell told BBC Sport:
"It was just a great all-round performance. I don't think it was necessarily Surrey playing really badly, although they might be harsh on themselves, it was just that we were outstanding with the ball. After that catch and the stumping, our bowling was high class.
"We peaked at the right time. You have to enjoy these wins. They don't come round very often. It means a lot to us senior guys especially. We don't know we'll be here again.
"We'll enjoy it tonight then tomorrow we'll get our heads around beating Lancashire in the Championship next week to make sure we stay in Div One.
"I can't remember a Warwickshire support like we had today. We must have had some frustrated supporters this year. But it was unbelievable. It felt like a home game. I know we were playing well, but the support was outstanding."
REACTION: Ian Bell speaks to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire
Man of the match Jonathan Trott:
"When you're reaching the end of your career, you want to put in performances and create memories.
"This was my fourth final but it's the first time I've got above 15 or 20. It's always nice to be able to say that I managed a score like that.
"It's a surreal moment. It didn't go too well here early on in my career, but it's been better to me the older I've become. Maybe it's the lunches!
"Once you step out of international cricket these finals are the closest you get to that level. It feels nice to have done well."

Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Sport:
"It was obviously a tired surface, but it certainly wasn't a 136 all out surface, as Jonathan Trott showed. He stuck to his guns and played beautifully.
"We could have applied ourselves for longer periods but, when it goes as wrong as that, all the analysts in the world will be able to pick whatever they want out of it.
"Fundamentally you can't put in a performance like that and expect to win too many games. Any side would have found that difficult to defend. We just didn't turn up."
