[SN]TITLE[SN]
Caledonian Sleeper service workers balloted on industrial action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RMT union members working on the Caledonian Sleeper rail service are to be balloted on industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RMT said the service, which links Inverness and Fort William with London, has been suffering from defects such as broken toilets and fire alarms.
This has led to delays and cancellations, the union said.
Serco, which took over Caledonian Sleeper earlier this year, said it was disappointed the union was considering industrial action.
It added that it was working hard to improve the sleeper service.
