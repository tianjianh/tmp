[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kidderminster Harriers 0-0 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kidderminster Harriers were relegated from the National League after a goalless draw against Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite winning their previous two league games a point against Barrow ended the Harriers' 11-year stay in the top tier of the non-league football.
Barrow's Ben Tomlinson had the best chance of scoring at Aggborough when his close-range effort hit the post.
Kidderminster managed four shots on target but failed to really test Barrow keeper Joel Dixon.
