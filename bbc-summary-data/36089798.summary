Australia's Adam Scott has announced he will not compete at the 2016 Olympics, in order to focus on the PGA Tour.

The world number seven, who won the 2013 Masters, had previously described Olympic golf as an "exhibition".
The sport returns for the Games in Rio after a 112-year absence.
"My decision has been taken as a result of an extremely busy playing schedule and other commitments, both personal and professional," the 35-year-old said in a statement.
Australia had hoped to pair Scott with world number one Jason Day.
Golf Australia chief executive Stephen Pitt said: "We're obviously disappointed Adam will not play because he's one of the best players in the world but we understand his position."
Fiji's Vijay Singh, a three-time major winner, announced last week that fears over the Zika virus would prevent him competing in Brazil.
