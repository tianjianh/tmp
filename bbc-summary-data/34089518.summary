The 19-year-old, who can also play left midfield, is yet to make a first-team appearance for the Premier League side.
"He's a young prospect at Liverpool and they have been looking to get him involved in first-team football," O's boss Ian Hendon told BBC London 94.9.
"It looks like he will be a good addition and we are looking forward to working with him."
Meanwhile left-back Shane Lowry has left the Matchroom Stadium after exercising a clause in his contract.
The 26-year-old, who had a year left on his deal, made 40 appearances for Orient last season after joining from Millwall.
However Lowry spent time on trial at Birmingham this summer and has not featured in a match day squad since Hendon took charge of Orient.
"I wouldn't say he has strung us along but we were waiting until 31 August to see what was happening," Hendon said.
"We won't miss him at all because from the moment the agent said he wasn't going to be here at the start of the season, he was never going to be part of the plans until he sorted the clause in his contract.
"He has made a decision and good luck to him. The club is bigger than any one player and we have moved on."
