It follows an altercation with Bradley Wood in the 39th minute of their National League match against Lincoln.
Storer, who appeared before a Football Association regulatory commission in London on Thursday, was also fined Â£750 and warned over future conduct.
The 29-year-old was initially booked after the incident, on 30 April, as Cheltenham went on to win the game 3-1.
He also scored in the game on the final day as the Robins were presented with the league trophy.
