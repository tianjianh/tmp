The attack took place in the Sabaa al-Bour area, about 30km (20 miles) north of Baghdad.
At least 25 people were wounded in the attack, which targeted evening prayers.
There has been a surge in sectarian attacks in recent months on targets like mosques, restaurants and local markets.
The suicide bombing came after three other attacks in the north of Iraq killed a further nine people.
The violence has rekindled fears the country is being dragged towards a wider conflict between the Shia majority and the Sunni minority.
Sunnis have accused the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of discriminating against them - a claim the government denies.
Last month was the bloodiest in Iraq since June 2008, with 1,045 civilians and security officials killed.
