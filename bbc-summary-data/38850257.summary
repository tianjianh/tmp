Tracey Neville's side were competitive and trailed 16-13 at the end of the opening quarter at the Echo Arena.
But nine unanswered goals from the Silver Ferns stretched their lead to 31-19 by half-time and they continued to dominate in the latter stages.
England, who beat South Africa in their series opener, meet Australia at the SSE Arena Wembley on Sunday.
The fixture will be televised live on BBC Two from 13:00 GMT.
England struggled against the physicality of New Zealand, who converted 61 of their 66 shots compared to the hosts' 37 from 49.
"We played well for 10 minutes in three quarters but couldn't capitalise on it," Neville told Sky Sports.
"We came out of that third quarter having drawn it, going into the fourth on a real positive but we just couldn't maintain the momentum. What disappoints is that casualness."
