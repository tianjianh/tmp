The former Hamilton's shirt factory on Foyle Road in Londonderry has been demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were concerns about the stability of the building, which has been derelict for years, after the collapse of an internal wall last week.
Contractors began work on Friday night.
The Environment Minister Alex Atwood recommended the demolition in the interests of public safety.
Mary O'Dwyer, Chair of Foyle Civic Trust, said a strategic approach is needed for the future protection of heritage in the city following the demolition.
"Many of our members believe that this is a very sad event.
"The factory is part of our industrial heritage and more should have been done to save it.
"Others believe something had to be done because it was a health and safety issue," she said.
"We would like to see a consensus and a strategic vision of all of the organisations in the city that have a remit for protecting our heritage."
Foyle Road, which was closed between the lower deck of the Craigavon Bridge and John Street roundabout, has reopened.
