Welsh boxer Joe Cordina wants to fight on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's heavyweight title fight with Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in April.

The 25-year-old turned from amateur to professional as he signed up with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing on Wednesday.
"I want to be topping these bills and be on the likes of Klitschko v Joshua," Cordina told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"Obviously my aspiration is to win a world title and be a multi-weight world champion."
Joshua's IBF title and the vacant WBA Super and IBO heavyweight crowns will be on the line when he fights Klitschko on 29 April.
"I spoke with Eddie and we did mention that bill," said Cordina.
"Hopefully I can get on that which would be a lovely place to have my debut, if I'm ready in time.
"I could be on just before it, hopefully in Glasgow on the Ricky Burns bill."
Scotland's Burns is aiming to unify the WBA and IBF light-welterweight titles when he faces Julius Indongo in Glasgow on 15 April.
Cordina, a former European amateur champion, will fight at super-featherweight in the paid ranks and train in Essex with Tony Sims.
He will sign a management deal with former two-weight world champion Joe Calzaghe.
"If you're in boxing and you haven't got any ambition to win a world title or medals as an amateur, there's no point being there," Cordina added.
"I'm in it to win and do big things. I want my name up in lights, that's all I want.
"I want to be able to secure mine and my family's future and be part of the big shows that happen in British boxing."
