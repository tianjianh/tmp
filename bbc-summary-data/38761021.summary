Carlton Cole: Notts County keen on ex-England, Chelsea & West Ham striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Kevin Nolan expects Notts County to come out of their transfer embargo within 72 hours, when he hopes to sign former England, Chelsea and West Ham striker Carlton Cole.

Cole, 33, left Celtic in August and is a free agent after a spell in the USA.
Nolan played with Cole at West Ham and said his ex-team-mate, who won seven England caps, is a "great lad".
"We have had a chat. It would be fantastic if I could bring him over," Nolan told BBC Nottingham Sport.
"The best thing is to see if he is interested and we can work something out. He has a few things in the fire.
"He will be a breath of fresh air. He is a top pro and a good player. If we can make it happen and the embargo gets lifted, then we will try our best to do that."
Nolan said he hoped have more news about Notts coming out of the transfer embargo, imposed on them because of money owed to HM Revenue & Customs and other football clubs, "in the next 48-72 hours".
