[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the former dual-code Wales international is in talks over a severance deal, with his contract due to run until the end of next season.
Harris, 39, has officially been on sick leave since Salford's loss at Hull KR in June, but watched Huddersfield's win at St Helens on Thursday for the BBC.
His assistant Ian Watson has been acting head coach in his absence.
Harris took over at the AJ Bell Stadium in April 2014, replacing Brian Noble on a two-year deal, and guided Salford to a 10th-placed finish last season.
In June, Salford owner Marwan Koukash said Harris's job was safe following the arrival of World Cup-winning Australia coach Tim Sheens as director of rugby.
The Red Devils have won both games so far in The Qualifiers section of the Super 8s, having finished 11th during the regular Super League season.
