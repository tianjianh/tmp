A woman who absconded from prison four days ago is being treated as a wanted person by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amy Stewart, 31, failed to return to HMP Cornton Vale in Stirling on Sunday.
She was jailed in 2004 for the murder of a 21-year-old man in Glasgow.
Police believe she may be in the Blantyre area with a 23-year-old man and have appealed to her to hand herself in to a police station or return to prison.
Insp Jim Young said: "We are continuing our search for Amy Stewart who we are now treating as a wanted person.
"Through our inquiries we suspect that she may be in the company of a known 23-year-old male in the Blantyre area and that they are both aware we have been looking for her.
"Amy's conduct remains a cause for concern due to her breaching the terms of her temporary release.
"Although we don't believe she poses an immediate risk to the public we strongly advise the public not to approach her and to report any sightings of her immediately to the police".
