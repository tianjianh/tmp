Officers were called to Silverdale, Clifton at about 01:00 BST and found a man, 38, who was "seriously hurt" after being attacked by a group, police said.
Detectives are questioning a 15-year-old boy. The injured man remains in intensive care.
He was taken to hospital with stab wounds, a broken arm and a head injury.
Greater Manchester Police said the incident was not being linked to the murder of Paul Massey.
The security boss and businessman, was found dead with gunshot wounds outside his Clifton home on 26 July.
Det Ch Insp Clare Devlin said: "This is an isolated set of circumstances surrounding this attack and it is not being linked to the murder last week or any other incidents.
"However, this does not detract from the fact we have a man lying seriously ill in hospital after he was stabbed and clearly we are treating this incident with the utmost importance."
She added that enquiries were ongoing to identify a number of people who may have been involved in the incident.
