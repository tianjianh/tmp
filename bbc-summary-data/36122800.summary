Falkirk 1-0 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk held on to secure second place in the Championship and a Premiership play-off semi-final berth with a narrow, fraught win over Morton.

Paul Watson's diving header in the second half, from Lee Miller's cross, delivered the critical goal, but there were moments of tension to endure.
Falkirk striker John Baird missed a first-half penalty, and Morton were lively, dangerous opponents throughout.
Declan McManus and Alex Samuel went close for the visitors.
Had their finishing been more accurate, the conclusion would have been even more dramatic.
But it will be Hibernian who will contest the play-off quarter-final against Raith Rovers, with the winner then taking on Falkirk in the semi-final.

The Bairns were trusting that their accomplishment would be enough to seal their fate. They sought to be typically poised on the ball and crisp in their passing - and that refinement allowed an elect of command in the early stages.
The occasion could not be denied its influence, though. Once in the final third, the home side had a tendency to be too anxious; to rashly aim for the risky pass rather than the more reliable one.
A feature of the opening half was home manager Peter Houston rushing to the touchline to tell his players to calm down and to urge Lee Miller to hold the ball up as the centre-forward and not keep trying flicks and feints.
Vigilance was also required, since Morton carried a threat in the sharpness and guile of Denny Johnstone and McManus up front. Defender Lee Kilday was presented with a half-chance inside the Falkirk area, but hit his effort straight at Falkirk goalkeeper Danny Rogers.
If Falkirk were alarmed, it did not disrupt their approach. There were moments of hope, when Craig Sibbald headed over and Baird almost converted from close range.
Regret was the players' companion as they left the field at half-time, though, after Baird saw his penalty kick saved by Derek Gaston.
The Falkirk striker had earned the spot-kick with a run that seemed to be ended by a trip in the area. Relief was etched on Baird's face three minutes after the break, as he celebrated his side making the breakthrough.
Miller, who along with Mark Kerr was a steadying influence throughout, delivered the cross to the back post that Watson converted with a diving header.
Moments later, Miller had a chance to double the lead, but saw his header from Sibbald's cross saved.
The lead was fragile enough for Falkirk to need a spell of care and composure. Morton were intent on playing an active role in the final drama of the Championship campaign, and Ross Forbes' free-kick was pushed away by the diving Rogers.
As Hibs were racking up chances and two goals at Easter Road against Queen of the South, Falkirk were living on the edge. McManus shot wide after a skilful run, then Samuel headed wide from close range.
In the closing minutes, Falkirk defended with a combination of panic and determination. They did enough to hold on, though, and Hibs were unable to score the two further goals they needed to pip the Bairns to the runners-up spot.
