Manager Pedro Caixinha says Rangers fans can expect to see a far more competitive team next season.

The Ibrox men finished the campaign third in the Premiership, 39 points behind champions Celtic and nine behind second-placed Aberdeen.
But ahead of his first transfer window as Ranger boss, Caixinha has assured supporters of a brighter future.
"We're going to have a competitive, strong team that will please our fans and the history of this club," he said.
"The team will be something different next season, definitely.
"We have four competitions to fight for and we will see (if we are celebrating with silverware at the end of next season). The first rule is to build a squad, the second step is to create a winning mentality and the third is to put it into practice in the games."
Rangers finished their campaign with a 2-1 win at St Johnstone courtesy of goals from Kenny Miller and Jon Toral.
Caixinha refused to be drawn on his summer transfer targets but said he has been working towards the summer recruitment drive since taking over in March following a stint in Qatar with Al-Gharafa.
"We've been working in that direction since we arrived," he said. "We hope to have the job done as soon as possible.
"I'm definitely glad to have had an overview in the last two months. One of the main reasons we came to the club early from Qatar and why Rangers had to pay for us to come was to assess and make decisions.
"That was really important. If we could not have arrived two months ago and would only have arrived at the end of the season it could have been different, but now we have made decisions and we are working on the next steps - we're just waiting on it."
Caixinha spent time with the Rangers fans after Sunday's win in Perth and revealed his determination to give them something to smile about next season.
"I'm a guy of the people, I like to enjoy these times with fans," said the Portuguese, who also confirmed defender Danny Wilson is starting a 10-week recovery period from a knee injury.
"For sure I hope there will be more success for them in future. We work for the supporters. We have the best fans in the world.
"We love to make them happy and we want to share that happiness with them."
