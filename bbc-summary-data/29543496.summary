Her debut single In the Music was a hit, and she has since released two albums - Wonderwoman and The Lasso of Truth.
If You Ask Me, the soulful song Omawumi performs for Africa Beats, tells the story of a girl made pregnant by her own father, and demands action be taken to confront and stop child abuse.
The song is produced by Cobhams Asuquo, one of the most influential figures in Nigerian contemporary music.
