Finance Minister Arlene Foster has said she intends introducing her new budget in the assembly next Tuesday.

She gave a paper on the details to the other Executive parties last Friday.
The plan, drawn up on the basis that welfare reform has been agreed, has become known as the fantasy budget.
The DUP minister says the Stormont finance committee will this week consider a request to give the budget bill accelerated passage through the assembly.
This is in the hope it receives Royal Assent by 31 July.
Asked if she believed Sinn FÃ©in would agree to the proposals she said "I don't know, that's a matter for them."
The Secretary of State has said it would be "helpful" if Northern Ireland politicians could agree a provisional budget.
The Stormont administration is facing a multi-million pound shortfall due to the continuing failure to implement welfare reforms.
