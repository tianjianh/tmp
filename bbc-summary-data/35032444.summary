Police were called to Leadenhall Street to reports of a stabbing, and an ambulance took the wounded man to hospital in the early hours of Sunday morning.
He was described as in a "life-threatening condition" and died at 03.41 GMT on Monday.
Next of kin have been informed.
Police believe a group of men were arguing inside the Caravaggio restaurant before leaving the venue and fighting in Leadenhall Street and St Mary's Axe.
Four men, aged 24 to 28, were arrested at the scene and have been bailed.
Detective Chief Inspector John Osibote, of the City of London Police's major crime team, said: "I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the argument inside Caravaggio or who saw a group of black males fighting in Leadenhall Street to come forward and speak to detectives.
"The victim went out on Saturday night to attend a party and has lost his life in a needless, violent act."
