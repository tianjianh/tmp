Iron Maiden aviation firm 'losing millions' after dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An aviation company chaired by the Iron Maiden frontman is losing millions of pounds because of a dispute over landing rights, he has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bruce Dickinson set up maintenance business Cardiff Aviation in 2012 at RAF St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.
He said it was after verbal assurances from the Welsh Government he could use a landing system that he still does not have access to.
The Welsh Government said it will discuss the issue with Mr Dickinson.
Mr Dickinson said the Ministry of Defence (which owns RAF St Athan) will not let the company use an instrument landing system (ILS).
An ILS uses radio beams to give precision guidance to pilots as they approach the runway.
Without it, Mr Dickinson said planes can only land and take off during week days, in office hours and in good visibility, which has stopped him being able to bid for lucrative contracts.
He said he needs planes to land 24 hours a day and will have a meeting with the Welsh Government to discuss the issue.
A Welsh Government spokesman said it had worked closely with Cardiff Aviation and Mr Dickinson "for a number of years".
He added that officials will meet him next week to "discuss how we can continue to best support his business".
"The introduction of an ILS procedure is a matter for the Ministry of Defence and we continue to lobby them on behalf of Cardiff Aviation and the wider enterprise zone to ensure a favourable outcome for what is one of Wales' flagship industries," he added.
The MOD has been asked to comment.
