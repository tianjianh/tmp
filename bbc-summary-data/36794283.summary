Line: A guide to Japan's messenger giant
Line has about 218 million monthly active users and is famous for selling cute virtual stickers, games and various merchandise.
It is wholly owned by South Korea's Naver Corporation, which is looking to raise funds to expand into more Western markets.
However, analysts say the app faces stiff competition from other messaging services provided by Facebook and Google.
In Japan, Line has a strong following and claims more users than Facebook or Twitter. However, in markets such as South Korea, it lags far behind rival app Kakao Talk, and it is blocked in China.
