The U's started well but Chris Porter and George Moncur missed the target.
The Iron opened the scoring when Tom Hopper steered home a low left-wing cross from Conor Townsend.
Neal Bishop crossed in for Paddy Madden to pounce from close range, before Madden scored the hosts' third goal in eight minutes with a low angled shot.
Scunthorpe United caretaker manager Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside:

"We just asked them to go out and be fearless. I think we were a little bit tentative at times in the first half, maybe a little bit over-eager to please.
"I think we were just a little bit off it in the first half. I think the second half we worked together as a team, both in possession and out of possession. I think we stayed in the game by the defending, and the blocks and the willingness to put your body on the line and that's what you've got to do.
"We prepared all week to execute that plan. The score line suggests that we did execute that plan but ultimately down to some good fortune, some good defending and some great finishing."
