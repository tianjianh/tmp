Paul McCauley: Man appears in court in connection with Derry man's murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 61-year-old company director has appeared at Londonderry Magistrates Court charged in connection with the murder of Paul McCauley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Buckingham from Nash Court Gardens in Margate, Kent, is charged with three offences of withholding information.
Mr McCauley, from Londonderry, was attacked and left in a vegetative state while at a friends barbeque in 2006.
He died nine years later in a care facility in June 2015.
At the time, Police believed up to 15 people were involved in the attack.
Mr Buckingham is accused of withholding information about Mr McCauley's murder, withholding information about an attempted murder and withholding information about a police investigation into an incident of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent.
The defendant, who made no reply to the three charges, is alleged to have committed the three offences on 16 December 2015.
The district judge ordered Charles Buckingham to have no contact with anyone involved in the case.
Last year, Piper John McClements, previously known as Daryl Proctor, was charged with Paul McCauley's murder.
In April, 28-year-old Matthew Brian Gillen from Kennedy Place in the Fountain area of the city was charged with murder.
Mr Gillen is also charged with GBH and attempted GBH.
A defence barrister for Mr Buckingham said there was a slight issue to the connection of the charges which would require a further hearing.
Mc Buckingham was released on bail until 8 June.
