Englishman Rose, 35, hit a three-under round of 69 to end the day in the chasing pack tied at eight under along with Scotland's Martin Laird, 32.
American Steele, 32, hit a 70 to remain top of the leaderboard on 11 under.
"I'm very happy to keep the momentum up and post a decent score, really not playing great golf," Rose told PGA.com.
"I played pretty scrappily, some ugly shots out there, some long par-save putts, so for me it was a really good 69."
Rory McIlroy toiled for 71 to stand five under, Northern Ireland's world number three positioned 19th.
Steele, who was the overnight leader after a breathtaking first-round 63, has a two-shot lead over compatriot Will Wilcox (67) and Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas (71).
Canada's Graham DeLaet and America's Harold Varner III are also tied for second on nine under.
