She says kids should have to earn money from their parents by helping out rather than just expecting it.
A recent survey says that 85% of children don't have to help out to get spending money.
The Dragons Den star says it doesn't help children to understand the value of money which is really important when you grow up.

I personally don't earn pocket money by doing chores.  I can understand both sides of the argument but I don't feel it will affect me in later life.
