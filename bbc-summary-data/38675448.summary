Cardiff is aiming to become one of the UK's leading cycling cities over the next 10 years.

The target is get half of commuters in the city out of their cars by 2021 and 60% by 2026.
The city's council wants more people using public transport, cycling or walking to work and has been working with experts who helped create the cycling scheme in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Cabinet approved the strategy when it met on Thursday.
The plans include setting up routes from Cardiff Bay to north-east Cardiff and from the east of the city to the north-west.
There will also be 600 parking spaces at the new bus station in the city centre.
Councillor Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for planning, transport and sustainability, said Cardiff was "perfect" for cycling and walking.
"There's little doubt that there are too many cars on our roads and as the city grows our roads can't support more and more vehicles," he added.
"This is why we will be investing to make other forms of transport - like cycling - more attractive to residents, visitors and commuters."
If approved, the plans will go out to consultation.
