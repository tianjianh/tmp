[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Skipper Sergio Ramos scored twice as Real Madrid recovered from back-to-back defeats by edging past mid-table La Liga rivals Malaga at the Bernabeu.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema both missed clear chances, while Malaga's Chory Castro hit the post, before centre-back Ramos planted in a free header from Luka Modric's corner.
Ramos netted again shortly before half-time when he slid in another set-piece - despite appearing to stray offside following Toni Kroos' delivery.
Malaga replied through Juanpi's thumping 15-yard drive, but it was not enough to avoid a fifth straight defeat.
The 13th-placed visitors, who have now not won in eight, failed to build on their foothold in the game and rarely looked like stunning the home crowd with an equaliser.
Madrid looked likelier to kill the game off in the closing stages, Ronaldo hitting the base of the post with an angled drive.
However, they more than deserved to move four points clear of second-placed Sevilla, despite not adding a third.
Sevilla travel to bottom club Osasuna on Sunday (11:00 GMT) while Barcelona, a point further back in third place, go to ninth-placed Eibar (19:45).
Zinedine Zidane's side were looking to avoid a third straight defeat after seeing their 40-match unbeaten run ended by successive losses at Sevilla and Celta Vigo.
And they produced a functional, if far from vintage, display against a struggling away side expected to offer little resistance.
A nervy atmosphere engulfed the Bernabeu at various stages of Saturday's match, with home fans heard jeering their players - notably Ronaldo and Benzema - as they failed to hit their usual high standards.
Club legend Zidane, who has lost just two of 38 league games since replacing Rafa Benitez last January, urged supporters to show more understanding with his players.
"Our fans are always very demanding, but sometimes the players and coaches need more affection," said the Frenchman.
"When we have difficulties, we need the fans to be calm and support the team."
Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has struggled to make an impact in the past three matches, in which France striker Benzema has failed to score.
Zidane also saw left-back Marcelo limp off in the first half, joining a growing injury list that also includes Wales forward Gareth Bale, centre-back Pepe and right-back Dani Carvajal.
"Karim and Cristiano might not have scored in recent games, but I'm not worried," he added.
"It's not the form of the attackers which worries me at the moment, it's the injuries."
