[SN]TITLE[SN]
SNP holds two seats in Fife Council by-elections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP has held two seats on Fife Council following by-elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharon Wilson and Ian Ferguson were elected to seats in the Rosyth and Dunfermline North wards.
Mr Ferguson won 1,056 votes, ahead of Labour candidate Joe Long on 719, while Ms Wilson won 1,214, ahead of Labour's Vikki Fairweather on 926.
The elections were triggered by the resignation of two SNP councillors, one of whom, Douglas Chapman, became MP for Dunfermline and Fife West in May.
Turnout in each ward was just over 24%.
