Blanc, who signed a new two-year deal in February, led PSG to the Ligue 1 title in each of his three seasons in charge, but lost in the Champions League quarter-finals each year.
Sevilla boss Umai Emery has been linked with the vacant post.
Emery, 44, won the Europa League with the La Liga side in each of his three full seasons in charge.
Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi had hinted at changes earlier this month.
"I've been here for five years and this is the first time we have had this sense of failure," he had said.
In a statement on the club's website, he thanked Blanc for his service but said he was "opening a new chapter in the development of the club".
PSG, who have won consecutive domestic quadruples, lost to Manchester City in last season's Champions League quarter-finals.
Blanc, 50, had previously had a spell as manager of France but stepped down after losing in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 to eventual winners Spain.
A cultured centre-half, he made 97 appearances for his country and also played for Barcelona, Inter Milan and Manchester United.
