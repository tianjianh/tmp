The new 8km road, which is used by 18,000 motorists daily, includes a new roundabout at the Drones Road and three flyover junctions.
Construction of the scheme began in early 2015.
About 27km of drainage pipe has been laid, 32km of fencing used and 24,000 tonnes of concrete has been poured.'
Deidre Mackle of the Department for Infrastructure said: "The upgrade, which has retained the iconic Frosses trees, will have knock-on impacts for the local economy and contribute to wider economic development for the region both in the short and in the long term."
"I am mindful of the inconvenience experienced by local businesses and landowners on the route during the construction phase and would wish to extend my gratitude to them for their patience," she added.
