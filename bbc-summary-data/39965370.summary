Aaron McEneff gave Kenny Shiels' side an early lead but Graham Burke equalised for Rovers on 21 minutes.
Barry McNamee put City in front on the stroke of half-time and McEneff netted a late penalty to secure the win.
The Candystripes, who remain fourth in the table, are unbeaten in their last seven Premier Division matches.
They are in league action again on Tuesday when they travel to champions Dundalk who are second.
Derry took the lead against Shamrock Rovers on five minutes as McEneff fired into the top corner after the ball fell to him just outside the penalty area.
The home side looked in control of the game, with McEneff close to grabbing his second, but the visitors drew level on 21 minutes when Burke scored past keeper Gerard Doherty with a fine volley.
Rovers took the initiative after their goal, but went behind just before the interval when McNamee scored his sixth goal of the season from close-range after being set up by Lukas Schubert.
Derry looked to put the game out of the reach of Rovers, who had goalkeeper Tomer Chencinski to thank as he pulled off a fine save from Ronan Curtis on 54 minutes.
Rovers thought they had grabbed an equaliser on 74 minutes after Doherty spilled the ball from a free-kick, but referee Ben Connolly pulled play back for a foul on the Derry keeper.
Connolly pointed to the penalty spot after Curtis was fouled in injury time and McEneff scored to secure the three points for Derry City.
Bray are now just two points clear of Derry in third place as they fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Bohemians.
