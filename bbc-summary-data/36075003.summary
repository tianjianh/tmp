They will dine at Kensington Palace after joining the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle - the day after her 90th birthday celebrations.
The president will also stage a press conference with David Cameron.
His UK stay is part of a tour including Saudi Arabia and Germany.
"Their Royal Highnesses are very much looking forward to welcoming President and Mrs Obama to Kensington Palace," a statement from Kensington Palace said.
The Obamas met the Queen, Prince Philip and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their state visit in 2011.
The president's most recent visit to the UK was for a Nato summit in 2014, while Mrs Obama came in 2015 to promote her Let Girls Learn initiative.
Prince William met Mr Obama at the White House in Washington DC in 2014, while Prince Harry first met the president during a visit to the US in 2015.
Prince Harry has met Mrs Obama a few times through his support of wounded military personnel and work with the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style championship for injured military personnel from across the globe.
