Vilas hit his career best score while Ryan McLaren made 107 as the pair put on 231 in Lancashire's total of 593.
Anderson then dismissed Jimmy Adams, Rilee Rossouw and George Bailey while McLaren and Kyle Jarvis took one each as Hampshire's top order collapsed.
They reached 50-5 at the close, still trailing by 148.
South African Vilas came together with his compatriot McLaren on the evening session of day two and they batted together for 59.4 overs until the latter was out to Gareth Berg who took four wickets.
Vilas was supported by Jordan Clark (24) and Jarvis (30) as he accelerated but was eventually last man out to Matt Salisbury.
England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson then took the wickets of Adams and Rossouw in consecutive balls in the third over of the visitors' reply before Jarvis bowled Michael Carberry four overs later.
Anderson - who bowled eight overs taking three wickets for five runs - then had first innings centurion George Bailey out lbw for 10 and McLaren dismissed Vince (29) three overs from the close.
Lancashire batsman Dane Vilas told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"When you get a hundred you want to go on and get a big hundred because that's what gets noticed.
"I've seen guys get hundreds and lose concentration and that makes it difficult for the next guy coming in.  I don't want to be the guy who puts pressure on the next man coming in.
"It's scary how well Jimmy Anderson is bowling at the moment, I had a great view at slip. It's so nice to see his passion and what he brings to the club."
Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Solent:
"It was a massively frustrating and disappointing day. We've let ourselves down there. We looked very very average. You can't drop catches at this level but we did and we got punished massively.
"Both the catches we dropped in the second over of the day should have been taken. All I ask the boys is that they be switched on when we go out into the field and it didn't look as though we were.
"We stuck at it with the ball. Brad Taylor stuck at it but Matt Salisbury struggled. Both Gareth Berg and Kyle Abbott's workloads were high. The effort was there from the bowlers. We were just let down in the field really."
