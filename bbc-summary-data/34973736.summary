[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish engineering firms 'still facing tough times'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish engineering companies have reported tough business conditions for the fourth quarter in a row, with the fall in oil price having a "devastating" effect on some firms.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A survey by industry body Scottish Engineering suggested recruitment and output was down, while orders were static.
It found exports were suffering from sterling's strength against the euro.
The report also indicated weak domestic demand was pushing down prices.
On a more positive note, the survey suggested the displacement of staff from the oil and gas sector had helped to ease long-standing skills shortages across the central belt.
Scottish Engineering chief executive Bryan Buchan said: "This is not a total panacea, as a number of companies which provide sub-contract services to the oil and gas sector are themselves recording a drop in orders.
"But it is allowing us some degree of hope for the future."
