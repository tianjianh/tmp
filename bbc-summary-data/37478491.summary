A statement from Institute said that Grace is now "conscious and talking and able to recognise family and friends".
Grace, 24, has been moved out of intensive care to a main hospital ward.
"While Niall is still showing signs of confusion and frustration, the family are hoping his condition will continue to improve," said Institute.
The Institute statement added that the club had been informed of the player's progress by his family.
"The Grace family would like to extend their sincere thanks and appreciation for the love and generosity they have been shown during this difficult time," continued the Institute statement.
Following the incident which happened in Waterloo Street in Derry City in the early hours of 11 September, a 22-year-old local man was charged with a one-punch attack on the footballer.
