Licence fee money should not be used to fund future regulation of the BBC, Scotland's culture secretary has said.

The communications watchdog Ofcom will take over regulation of the corporation from the BBC Trust next spring.
Fiona Hyslop said the UK government should commit to "adequate funding" of Ofcom, which had a "pivotal" role in ensuring Scotland was treated "fairly".
A UK government spokesman said it was "appropriate" the BBC funded its own regulation.
The Scottish government has said it wants to bring decision-making on Scottish output "closer" to viewers and listeners, which it argued would require closer scrutiny by Ofcom.
Ms Hyslop said: "The decision to appoint Ofcom as the BBC's external, independent regulator means it now has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the BBC delivers for Scotland and that this nation is treated much more fairly than it has in the past.
"The UK government must commit to adequate funding for Ofcom, but this must not be funded by the licence fee.
"People across Scotland pay their licence fee to allow the BBC to deliver high-quality productions, not the regulation of the BBC. Instead, this funding should be provided by the UK government.
Ms Hyslop said she was committed to helping the corporation "realise its true potential and deliver more for the people of Scotland".
She said she had offered to meet with senior figures from the BBC and Ofcom to continue to "progress the position supported by the Scottish Parliament and the wider sector in Scotland."
A spokesman for the UK department for Culture, Media and Sport said: "The BBC currently funds its regulation by the BBC Trust and has done since its inception.
"As regulation moves to Ofcom, it is appropriate that the BBC continues to fund its regulation."
The Scottish government has also led calls for a more "Scottish-focused" six o'clock news broadcast.
BBC Scotland has produced pilots for a programme, which could eventually replace the Six O'Clock News and Reporting Scotland programmes on BBC1 Scotland.
Last week the UK's culture secretary, Karen Bradley, announced the corporation's new charter in the House of Commons, which sets out the BBC's plans over the next 11 years.
