How do you fancy watching YouTube music videos without the adverts? Well you can, for £9.99 a month.

The video-sharing website, owned by Google, has announced plans to launch YouTube Music Key.
For the monthly subscription fee users will be able to watch advert-free videos and download videos to view offline.
The new app will launch on Android devices before being made available on Apple's iOS systems.
The internet giant's move into online streaming is a significant one.
It is the biggest provider of music in the world, with more than a billion users per month.
YouTube Music Key will be a direct competitor to streaming services such as Spotify, which has 12.5 million pay-monthly users.
Anjali Southward from YouTube said: "It's important to stress this is about choice. We have had a lot of feedback for these features.
The music industry as well has been very supportive and encouraged us to take this step."
Last week Taylor Swift removed her music from Spotify because she didn't agree with how much the service paid songwriters and producers.
However, her music will be available on YouTube Music Key.
This service has been in the works for years, and Google claims to have most of the major and independent record labels on board.
The company's biggest challenge will be trying to get users to pay for a slightly different version of a experience they currently get for free.
"The quick five-second ones [adverts] are fine but the minute-long ones drive me crazy," said fashion student Molly.
As well as watching her favourite artists, Molly, 19, uses YouTube for tutorial videos.
She says she wouldn't pay £9.99 a month for the extra features.
"Maybe in the future when I have money to spare but while I'm a poor student definitely not," she said.
YouTube makes its money from the adverts on the site, but bosses at the company say it's only a matter of time before viewers will want them gone for good.
Retail worker Taylor says he would part with the money, if it meant advert-free browsing.
"I spend three hours a day on YouTube, mostly watching music, checking out new songs.
"Ten pounds a month seems decent. If you chuck in the the fact that you can download stuff as well, then definitely."
