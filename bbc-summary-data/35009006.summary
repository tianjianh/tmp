Mortonhall baby ashes memorial opens at crematorium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial to infants at the centre of the Mortonhall baby ashes scandal has been opened in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The garden sits in the grounds of the crematorium, and includes specially designed plaques inscribed with the names of 149 babies.
It was created as one of the recommendations in the report by Dame Elish Angiolini in January 2013.
A second memorial is also proposed, in Princes Street Gardens, as some parents do not want to return to Mortonhall.
Dorothy Maitland, a former operations manager for infant deaths charity Sands, said: "I think it's very important to have a memorial and I know some parents will find it very difficult to go back to Mortonhall but I'm hoping that they will change their mind when they see the garden.
"Some parents are still finding it so difficult to accept what happened that right now a memorial is not of any comfort.
"I really hope that in time when they heal a bit more that they will be able to visit the garden and have their baby's name added and find comfort by doing this.
"It means so much to many parents to have somewhere where they can go that is nice and tranquil. It shows to everyone that each of these babies matters whether their names are on the memorial or not - it's for all babies.
"Obviously there has been a lot of hurt but the council have taken what has happened very seriously and made sure all of Dame Elish's recommendations have been met. The memorial has been done in a very sensitive way which speaks volumes."
Dame Sue Bruce, former Edinburgh city council chief executive, said: "This has been a very difficult process for so many people over the past three years so I want to acknowledge my personal appreciation of the support and feedback from parents in helping choose such a fitting memorial.
"The design reflects their wishes for a garden that will provide a private and peaceful place for personal contemplation and reflection."
Andrew Kerr, chief executive of Edinburgh city council, said: "The work of the Mortonhall Multi-Agency Working Group will continue so nothing like this can happen again.
"Lessons have been learnt and the action plan produced last year has now been fully implemented so we can ensure the highest possible standards are adhered to at Mortonhall."
