Fellow forward Charlie Austin remains sidelined, while Virgil van Dijk is unlikely to play again this season.
Bournemouth will assess Ryan Fraser's hamstring problem, while Harry Arter and Junior Stanislas could return from respective calf and groin injuries.
Lys Mousset is also a doubt and Tyrone Mings is still suspended.
Adam Federici, Callum Wilson and Rhoys Wiggins remain out with knee injuries.
Simon Brotherton: "Bournemouth's recent upturn in form has eased fears of being drawn into the relegation scrap and means they go into this game level on points with Southampton.
"Eddie Howe's team could win three in a row for the first time in just over a year and, if they did, it would be a first ever win away to Saints.
"Interestingly, Bournemouth's three-match unbeaten run has coincided with Jack Wilshere dropping out of the starting line-up, costing him his England squad place.
"Meanwhile, two more Southampton players, Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse, made their debuts for the Three Lions in the recent international break.
"Add in the under-21s, an impressive total of seven players were called up from St Mary's for England duty."

Southampton manager Claude Puel: "We now have many players available for the team with good spirit. When I can't take an international in the team like Jordy Clasie, it's difficult for me for him to stay at home.
"It's always difficult to make a choice, but it's important for all the team to have the respect of the staff and all the players.
"They must keep a good attitude because we have many games [coming up]."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "We've never won at Southampton, so we want to create history this weekend.
"From our perspective, this weekend is a bit of a different game for us. We want to give our supporters something to shout about.
"We've been more consistent recently, but we know there's a long way to go and that we have a tough run of fixtures ahead."
Southampton turned Bournemouth over when they met earlier in the season but I don't think they will repeat that at St Mary's.
Local pride is at stake here and I can see Bournemouth putting up a decent fight and leaving with a point.
