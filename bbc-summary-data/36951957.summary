New Fleetwood Town manager Uwe Rosler says he will urge his League One side to have a top-six mentality and play attacking football.

The 47-year-old former Leeds, Wigan and Brentford manager replaced Steven Pressley as Fleetwood boss on Saturday.
Rosler took Brentford to a League One play-off final and left shortly before they reached the Championship in 2014.
"When I joined Brentford they were a mid-table team and look where they are today," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I played a major role in that and I think with having the owner so ambitious and committed to the club, we can do similar things here.
"We have to create a top-six mentality and over time when you have that mentality that will give top-six results, and that is ultimately where we want to be in my time here."
The former Manchester City striker and East Germany international also said his side will deploy a direct and forward-thinking style.
"My team will always be high energy with a lot of transitions," he added.
"We will try to be direct but not with long balls; being direct with quick, forward passes and a lot of runs forward and players committed into the box.
"It can be a very attractive way [to play] but the most important thing is that you finish off the good work."
