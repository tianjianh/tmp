[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 0-0 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United lost ground on Championship leaders Hibernian as they failed to break down a stubborn and lively Morton side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was second versus third at Cappielow, and there was very little between the two teams.
Morton threatened through Jamie Lindsay and Mark Russell, but neither could beat United goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
Tony Andreu and Jamie Robson came closest for the visitors, but the breakthrough remained elusive.
Both sides would have been expecting an exacting test, since Morton were on a run of six consecutive league wins while United had won their last seven games.
The players might have been brimming with confidence, but the upshot was an encounter that quickly fell into a stalemate.
United were the more assertive at the outset, and midfielder Charlie Telford rifled an early shot just over. Morton are capable of being dogged, though, and their defence was built on the solid foundations of Thomas O'Ware and former United centre-back Gavin Gunning.
The home side's resurgence was also reliant on the clever movement and direct running of their front men, Gary Oliver and Jai Quitongo. Both were capable of alarming the United defence, and the latter would have been the reason why a number of scouts were due at the game.
As well as his strength and purpose, the first-half also saw evidence of his temper, as he threw the ball at United defender Mark Durning after a heavy challenge, prompting a yellow card from referee Crawford Allan.
United were marginally more incisive, with Blair Spittal - from a header - and Simon Murray, who finished tamely, both registering attempts on goal before the break.
As a cold rain fell ever more heavily, the game seemed stuck in its ways. The two sides even traded similar chances, with Morton midfielder Jamie Lindsay breaking through the United defence but shooting straight at goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
Then Scott Fraser found himself in a near-identical situation at the other end, and his effort was saved by Morton goalkeeper Derek Gaston.
He had to look lively again moments later, when Charlie Telfer slipped through Andreu and the United midfielder swept a shot on target that the goalkeeper saved.
Both sides pushed hard for a breakthrough, and United almost secured all three points in the closing stages, but Gaston was alert enough to block Robson's shot from the back post with his legs.
Morton's Jim Duffy: "For the first hour we played well. In the last half-hour, Dundee United got a grip of the game and started causing us problems. Derek Gaston had two or three fantastic saves, but in the first hour we probably just edged it.
"Dundee United might think they had clearer chances, and they probably did, but in the first half I thought we were slightly better. In the second half, they were better, so a decent point for us.
"Dundee United will be expected to challenge for the title. We're not at that level but in any given game we're tough opponents. Without being brilliant, we still made it tough for Dundee United and gave them a real competitive match.
"We needed a bit more composure in the first half when we had chances, and at set pieces we normally attack the ball better and we didn't capitalise on one or two opportunities. But in the last 20 minutes in particular, Dundee United had two or three great chances and one goal would probably have won it.
"It's November, it's far too early [to talk about making the play-offs] and far too many things can happen. Teams can start well and fall away and it can happen the other way around. At this moment in time, get as many points on the board, see where you are at the turn of the year and then we'll take it from there."
Dundee United's Ray McKinnon: "It was [frustrating], it's a tough place to come, Morton are on a good run and you can see why. They work extremely hard, but overall on chances we're disappointed not to take the three points.
"As the game goes on, it opens up and we played some nice football until that final third, when we just couldn't get it in the goal. On another day we probably would have won the game, but it's a difficult place to come, they're a good side, well organised with some dangerous players.
"Over the 90 minutes, we probably deserved to win the game [but] football's not like that, you don't always get what you deserve.
"In the last 30 minutes especially, [the players] really wanted to win that game and they gave everything. I'm pleased with that, I can't always get the result that I want, but I can get the attitude and the desire. We definitely had that today."
