Glamorgan oppose petition to form a Wales cricket team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan have said they are against the idea of a Wales cricket team participating in ICC competitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An 187-name petition calling for a Wales side was handed to the National Assembly's petitions committee.
They have written to the Welsh Government's sports minister Huw Lewis and are to contact the England and Wales Cricket Board, Glamorgan and Sport Wales.
But Glamorgan's Alan Hamer has said they oppose moves to form a Wales side.
The Welsh county say they would not attend any meeting to discuss the setting up of a national team fearing a Wales side would affect the staging of international matches at the Swalec Stadium in Cardiff.
And Glamorgan fear that would have serious financial repercussions for the club.
I'm not heard about the proposed February meeting so would be extremely unlikely that Glamorgan would attend
The Swalec Stadium is to host an England versus Australia clash in 2015, as well as a Test against New Zealand in 2013 and Glamorgan do not want a Wales cricket team impinging on that.
"Glamorgan Cricket have informed the Welsh Government that they do not support moves to create a Welsh cricket team," said Glamorgan chief executive Alan Hamer.
"It would signal the end of England internationals being played in Cardiff including the 2015 Ashes.
"This would have serious financial repercussions on the club and as such, it is not something that we want to be involved with.
"We have also informed the Welsh Government that Glamorgan, being Wales' sole professional cricket team, effectively represent Wales on an annual basis by competing in the 4-day [County Championship], CB40 and T20 competitions and that the current playing standard is far higher than that on offer for tier two ICC nations.
"I've not heard about the proposed February meeting so would be extremely unlikely that Glamorgan would attend.
"Similarly, although I cannot comment on the ECB's intentions, I would be surprised if they attended as well."
Wales already have a side which plays in the minor counties competitions.
From 2002 to 2004  a Wales side which included Glamorgan and Welsh players, played a 50-over match against England each June.
In the first of the matches Wales recorded a shock eight-wicket victory, although England won the other two before the fixture was abandoned.
