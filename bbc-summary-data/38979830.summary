She had arrived at a running club meeting in Kings Heath when three men demanded she hand over her car keys before using a stun device on her, police said.
She alerted a passing van and the men ran away.  She was left "shaken, bruised and with burns", the club said.
There were similar reports between 5 and 10 February.

West Midlands Police said there were six reports of alleged assaults involving "small stun devices" in Moseley, Kings Heath and Acocks Green.
It is not yet clear whether the incidents are linked.
Four teenage boys, two aged 15 and two aged 16, were arrested and bailed in connection with a robbery in Acocks Green on 5 February. Witnesses are being urged to come forward.
A post on Kings Heath Running Club's Facebook page said: "There was a serious incident prior to club run last Thursday.
"It was an attempted car theft by three young men who demanded a runner's car keys.
"She refused and an electric Taser device was used on her during a physical struggle.
"She was shaken, is bruised and has seen a doctor who has assessed the burns left by the Taser.
"This was a random event - the runner took no risks in parking her car on a well-lit road next to the school."
