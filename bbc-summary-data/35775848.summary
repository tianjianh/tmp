Brian Pepper sent explicit content via Facebook and text messages before attempting to meet her at a fast food restaurant and a hotel.
The 65-year-old, of Homer Close, Gosport, was sentenced to four years in prison and put on the sex offenders register for life.
He was also given an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.
Pepper was arrested following an investigation by Hampshire Constabulary and South East Regional Organised Crime Unit.
At Portsmouth Crown Court on 1st February he admitted charges of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming.
Det Insp Gary Towse said: "This type of online activity initially targets vulnerable and underage victims, often in their own homes, due to the use of social media websites.
"It then escalates to face to face meetings which can have even more devastating consequences for the victims."
