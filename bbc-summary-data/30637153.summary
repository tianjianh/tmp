The report found 14 inmates at HMP Garth in Leyland had refused to return to their cells during the incident before Christmas.
The prisoners who were "believed to be under the influence of hooch" began "behaving in an aggressive manner".
The Prison Service said the incident was under investigation.
According to the report: "Staff withdrew when the prisoners began behaving in an aggressive manner and throwing items around.
"CCTV cameras were smashed and other parts of the spur sustained minor damage."
Three specialist units, trained to deal with violence in jails, were deployed to deal with the disorder.
The prisoners later returned to their cells.
One prisoner, who claimed to have swallowed a bag of heroin, was taken to hospital for checks.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "An act of minor concerted indiscipline by a small number of prisoners at HMP Garth began at 5pm on 15th December and was quickly resolved by 7.15pm without any damage to property or injuries to staff or prisoners."
They added that the incident was being investigated and would be followed by "any appropriate internal disciplinary action".
HMP Garth at Leyland, near Preston, is a Category B prison for inmates who do not require the highest conditions of security.
