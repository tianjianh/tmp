[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Akwasi Asante's hat-trick secured Solihull Moors' first win in eight matches as they triumphed at Maidstone in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts opened the scoring through Liam Enver-Marum's strike in the 20th minute but were pegged back six minutes later when Omari Sterling slammed home a powerful half-volley.
Moors took the lead when Asante got his first from the penalty spot and shortly after netted his second to double the visitors' lead, but Dan Sweeney managed to pull one back for Solihull before the break.
But Asante latched on to a through-ball by Ryan Beswick to seal the league's first hat-trick of the season and all three points.
