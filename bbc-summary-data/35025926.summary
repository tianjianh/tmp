Mohammad Akhlaq was beaten to death by a mob in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh state in late September.
His son, Mohammed Sartaj, told BBC Hindi's Salman Ravi that he "is waiting for the police to charge the suspects".
Six people have been arrested in connection with the attack.
"We will go to the president of India if we have to. We will also demand an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation [India's top investigative body] if we feel that the Uttar Pradesh police is trying to save those involved in the case," Mr Sartaj, who works for the Indian Air Force, told BBC Hindi's Salman Ravi.
He was responding to reports which said Mr Akhlaq's family had said they were satisfied with the compensation they had received and did not want further investigations.
Mr Sartaj said that the police had already spoken to his family.
"They have also taken statements from eye witnesses. My family has told the police about the people who were involved in the attack.  Now we have to see if the police tries to save them [the suspects] or presents evidence against them," he told BBC Hindi.
The slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.2bn people.
Uttar Pradesh is among a number of Indian states which have tightened laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef.
The beef ban has also provoked outrage with many questioning how the government decides what is on their plate.
