These are the bank's first results since the UK voted to leave the EU.
The bank said the referendum result "appears, so far, not to have had a major effect on the Northern Ireland economy".
However, it warned that the post-referendum interest rate cut will have a negative impact on its results.
The bank's chief executive, Kevin Kingston, said: "We are now operating in a lower interest rate environment than we had anticipated.
"Whilst interest rates had generally been expected to start rising during 2016, post the EU referendum it seems clear that we will now be operating in an environment of historically low interest rates for a prolonged period."
He also cautioned that  uncertainty around Brexit remains a factor for corporate customers.
"While we are not seeing business projects being cancelled as a result of the referendum vote, equally we are not seeing new projects being brought to us at the same rate as in the first half of the year."
The bank's performance was driven by continuing improvements in the mortgage market.
There was a 63% increase in mortgage approvals to customers in quarter three compared to the same period in 2015.
