A concert by the pop star Jennifer Lopez in Morocco has led to calls for the country's communication minister to resign, according to local media.

Prominent members of the ruling Justice and Development Party said the singer's performance at the Mawazine Festival in Rabat was "a breach of public decency".
The Minister of Communication Mustapha Khalfi was criticised for allowing the gig to air on public television.
He has rejected calls for his resignation, newspapers say.
Lopez, who is often referred to as J-Lo, performed in front of 160,000 people at the festival on Friday.
The event was transmitted, with a short delay, on the 2M public TV network to the delight of fans.
But local media criticised the singer for her "suggestive poses" and for being "scantily" dressed.
A number of MPs have requested that the "education, culture and communications committee of parliament hold a meeting" to discuss why the show was broadcast.
Speaking on Twitter, Mr Khalfi said he planned to contact 2M TV's ethics committee to discuss the issue.
"What was broadcast is unacceptable and goes against broadcasting law," he added.
Singer and producer Pharrell Williams also performed at the festival over the weekend, with Usher, Placebo and Maroon 5 also scheduled to take to the stage over the coming days.
