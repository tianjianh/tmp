[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 28-year-old man was arrested by Nottinghamshire Police on suspicion of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm and has since been bailed.
The suspensions follow an investigation into a suspected plot to harm someone.
National newspapers said the prison officers allegedly goaded Muslim inmates until they needed to be restrained as part of a racist game.
The Prison Service confirmed eight people had been suspended from HMP Nottingham but said it would be "inappropriate to comment further."
