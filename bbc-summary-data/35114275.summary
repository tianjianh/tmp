Legal challenge to Lews Castle apartments unsuccessful

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hotel operator has been unsuccessful in its legal challenge to plans for part of Lews Castle in Stornoway to become self-catering apartments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenman Holdings, which has a number of properties in the Lewis town, claimed the privately-run apartments were being developed using public money.
Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - is leading the redevelopment of Lews Castle.
Kenman has failed to secure a judicial review of the apartments contract.
Judge Lord Tyre at the Court of Session in Edinburgh found in favour of the local authority, ruling that the legal challenge had been delayed "for an unreasonably long time".
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has been leading a project to redevelop 19th Century Lews Castle, which has been closed for 25 years.
Council leader Angus Campbell said: "The comhairle was always confident that its processes in the awarding of the contract were proper and competent.
"The restoration and development of Lews Castle is hugely popular and will provide a major economic boost for the islands when the museum and the luxury hospitality development opens next year."
