[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Belfast man whose bail was once relaxed so he could go to a Madness concert has admitted involvement in a 2010 paramilitary shooting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Joseph O'Neill, 41, whose address was given as no fixed abode, had been due to go on trial at Belfast Crown Court.
He had been charged over a November 2010 gun attack in north Belfast's Brompton Park.
The victim was shot several times in the groin and abdomen.
On Tuesday, O'Neill's defence lawyer asked that he be rearraigned.
He admitted possessing a Glock pistol with intent and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm.
A prosecution lawyer said that in light of O'Neill's guilty pleas, he would apply for another count of wounding to be "left on the books".
O'Neill's lawyer asked for him to be released on continuing bail, "not withstanding the serious nature of the charges" he had now admitted.
However, the prosecution said that O'Neill had admitted involvement in a shooting in which five shots were discharged, leaving the victim with "life changing injuries".
A judge remanded O'Neill into custody and said he would face a substantial custodial sentence.
