The shop on Glasgow's Buchanan Street opened three years ago but the Californian-based company has told staff it is closing the outlet.
Retailer H&M has announced it will move into the property as it opens a new flagship store.
H&M will also retain its existing unit in nearby Buchanan Galleries to house one of its other brands.
A spokeswoman for Forever 21 said: ""Forever 21 is constantly evaluating our portfolio of stores and has proposed one recent store closure in Glasgow.
"We made the proposal to close this store after careful consideration of the long-term profitability of the particular location.
"Forever 21 operates multiple stores across Europe, where our customers will continue to have access to the fast fashion they have come to love and expect from Forever 21."
Owners of the Buchanan Quarter building said there had been strong demand from parties interested in the 65,000sq ft space being vacated by Forever 21.
A spokesman for Land Securities said: "Immediately following the Forever 21 decision to exit, we received strong interest in the store on Buchanan Street and subsequently let the unit to H&M as a flagship.
"The strong demand for the space reinforces Glasgow city centre's position as the UK's top retail destination outside London."
H&M country manager Carlos Duarte said: "We are delighted to be relocating to 185 Buchanan Street. This is a very exciting opportunity to expand our brand.
"The store will offer something for everyone, no matter your age, budget or personal style."
