Can Man from U.N.C.L.E. avoid The Lone Ranger's fate?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The concept of taking an old TV show and reinventing it for a modern audience is not a new one. Can The Man from U.N.C.L.E avoid the fate of box-office flops like The Avengers and The Lone Ranger?

One of the biggest film industry disasters of 2013, The Lone Ranger should, on paper, have been a massive success.
Based on a long-running radio and TV series, it reunited director Gore Verbinski and actor Johnny Depp, the dream team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and was produced by Walt Disney.
But audiences stayed away in droves and the film barely made back its production budget.
Two years on, Depp's co-star Armie Hammer is sanguine about the film's reception.
"The reception is not my responsibility" he explains. "My job is done the final time the director says 'Cut'.
"My involvement, my input, my everything as an actor is done, it's on to the next project.
"I was lucky enough to make The Lone Ranger and it's one of the best shooting experiences I've ever had with a crew. I'm still family with every one of them.
"I had the experience of 10 months just riding through the desert so, regardless of the reaction, it was an amazing project to be a part of."
Hammer is now starring opposite British actor Henry Cavill in Sherlock Holmes director Guy Ritchie's reboot of Cold War spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
Broadcast on NBC between 1964 and 1968, it starred Robert Vaughn and David McCallum as secret agents Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin and is now considered something of a cult classic.
For Hammer, who had never even seen the show, there were certainly doubts over whether to chase the part of former KGB agent Kuryakin.
"I have doubts about every project that I start, because I'm just convinced they're all going to fail. But this one I had more faith in, and that's just having Guy involved.
"He's a fantastic film-maker, he's funny and witty and charming and can get all those things onto film, which is great. But I was also assured that we weren't just remaking this TV show."
History has not been kind to remakes of 1960s TV shows. In 1998 The Avengers, starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sir Sean Connery, was nominated for nine Razzies.
Tim Burton's recent Dark Shadows was panned by critics, while Eddie Murphy's I Spy made less than its (relatively meagre) $70m production budget.
Some fare better. The juggernaut that is the Mission: Impossible franchise has invigorated Tom Cruise's career and is now on the fifth film in its series.
The moderate box-office success of Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, meanwhile, was enough to warrant a sequel.
Cavill is currently starring in another franchise, having played Superman in Man of Steel in 2013 and again in the soon-to-be released Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice.
Yet he is just as reticent about whether reinventing a popular '60s series can work.
"If you start thinking about that, then you start thinking about the wrong thing. You can worry about that right before the movie comes out, that's your choice. But I don't, that's my personal choice.
"If you worry about it while you're still trying to come up with a character, then you're pretty much screwed from the beginning."
Reviews of The Man from U.N.CL.E. have thus far been mixed.
The Hollywood Reporter said:  "It's not unenjoyable to sit through, but at the same time, the tone and creative register never feel confident and settled. It's not bad but not quite good enough either."
Variety added: "Though the pic is solidly made, its elegant vintage flavour simply doesn't feel modern enough to cut through the tough summer competition."
The film acts as something of an origins story, explaining how spies Solo and Kuryakin end up working together for the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement.
Everything seems aimed at building a franchise, something Cavill readily admits.
"The nature of franchise-building, which is what a lot of studios are doing these days, is that you have to have the audience fall in love with the characters, and that requires a growing period.
"So to do an origins story makes the audience feel like they are on a journey with the characters. That's the important thing."
Cavill may have his hands full with Superman and the potential for a slate of Justice League films, not to mention batting off rumours about succeeding Daniel Craig as the next James Bond.
Nevertheless, the actor says another Man from U.N.C.L.E. film would suit him down to the ground.
"I would be so happy. I love playing Napoleon Solo, I love Armie, I love Alicia [Swedish co-star Alicia Vikander], I love Guy and Lionel [Wigram, the film's co-writer and producer].
"If I could work with Guy and Lionel for the rest of my career and no one else, I'd be happy. This was the perfect job for me."
Hammer, understandably, is slightly more cautious about whether a franchise is on the cards.
"I think as a result of The Lone Ranger, I'm very hesitant to talk about franchises, so I honestly don't know.
"If Guy call me asks me to do another movie, I would jump at the opportunity."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is out now in the UK and Ireland.
