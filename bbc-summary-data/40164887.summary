Tim Atkins, 48, from Southsea, was pronounced dead at the scene, outside the Harvester pub at the junction of Eastern Road and Burfields Road on Friday evening.
The second male cyclist involved in the crash suffered minor injuries and the man driving the van was uninjured.
Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
A statement, released by police on behalf of Mr Atkins' family, said: "You could never hope to meet a man with as big a heart as him.
"A devoted father, son, brother, and uncle, taken far too soon, we as a family are heartbroken and ask to be left to come to terms with our loss."
Investigations into the circumstances surrounding the crash "remain on-going at this time", Hampshire Constabulary said.
