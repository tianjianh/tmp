Ben Morris's try, added to seven points from Tom Barrett, gave the Titans a 10-8 lead at the break, after Jack Lam's try and Gavin Henson's penalty.
Jamie Broadley added to the lead but Bristol fought back with further scores from David Lemi and Charlie Amesbury.
A late penalty try could prove crucial for the hosts in the return leg.
