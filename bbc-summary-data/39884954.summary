One-Day Cup: Glamorgan win despite Stevens' Kent record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An incredible Kent record innings by 41-year-old Darren Stevens just failed to overhaul Glamorgan's highest-ever limited-overs score in Swansea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stevens' 147, a new List A record for Kent, came off 67 balls and included 14 sixes, among a match total of 35.
His dismissal was one of five for David Lloyd as Kent were all out for 341.
Earlier, Colin Ingram (114) and Will Bragg (94) shared a stand of 212 for Glamorgan's third wicket as the hosts made 356-7, setting up a 15-run win.
It was Ingram's third century in four games and Bragg's career-best score in List A cricket, while the game equalled the UK county record for sixes struck in a List A game.
The pair came together after two early losses, with Matt Coles bowling tightly, and averaged nearly seven runs an over over the course of their partnership.
Ingram struck eight sixes as he took his campaign tally to 564 runs, while Bragg also scored at nearly a run a ball to give the Kent bowlers no respite.
Chris Cooke and Andrew Salter continued the momentum as Glamorgan hammered 105 runs off the last 10 overs.
But, after a double strike by Lloyd, Stevens took over the game.
The veteran all-rounder completely dominated a stand of 131 in 15 overs with Sam Billings (24), hitting several mighty blows into the Mumbles Road.
He took the visitors ahead of the run-rate as he beat Kent's previous best of 146 by Andrew Symonds.
But a superb boundary catch by Marchant de Lange off Lloyd got rid of Stevens, though the lower order kept swinging bravely and took the game down to the last three overs with the result in doubt.
Chris Cooke then added a run-out to his five catches to finish the game off, as Glamorgan claimed their fourth win in the eight match campaign while Kent remain at the bottom of the table despite their part in an extraordinary day's play.
Glamorgan all-rounder David Lloyd told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was very difficult bowling at him (Stevens), he's a player who can hit the ball anywhere round the park so in a way it was nice to watch but he took the game away at one stage and we kept on fighting, in the end it paid off.
"The only way we were going to win was taking wickets, and that's what we did- it's great personally (to take five wickets) and to get the win as a team is very pleasing."
Batsman Will Bragg added:
"Colin (Ingram) is one of the best one-day batters I've played with and it's very easy to bat with him, we're very fortunate to have him.
"We've gathered a bit of momentum and we've shown the supporters and ourselves we're a force to be reckoned with in this format, but we started a bit slowly in the competition, unfortunately we've come to the party a bit too late."
Kent all-rounder Darren Stevens:
"It's all a bit of a blur, it'll take me the six-hour journey to think about it. I'd say it's my best knock, it's just a shame we didn't win the game on a belting pitch.
"Definitely we should have won, all the boys down the order and the (last) run-out, we didn't need to take that on, we only needed 16 to win.
"It must have been pretty special to watch with 35 sixes in the game, Braggy played brilliantly and Colin does what he does, he's so hard to bowl at."
