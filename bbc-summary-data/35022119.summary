A man has been charged with malicious communications following an investigation into Facebook messages sent to an MP, Scotland Yard says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Wallace, 23, who is also known as Muhammad Mujahid Islam, was arrested at an address in north London.
He remains in custody and will appear at Hendon Magistrates' Court on Monday.
It comes after Labour MPs Simon Danczuk and Neil Coyle reported to police alleged death threats after voting in favour of Syria air strikes.
A number of MPs have complained they received death threats after voting in favour of extending UK operations against so-called Islamic State (IS) militants into Syria.
Police declined to name the MP, but said the politician does not represent a London constituency.
Mr Wallace was arrested following an investigation into messages sent on Thursday 3 December.
