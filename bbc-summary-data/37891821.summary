Arsenal midfielder Wilshere, 24, was left out of the two previous squads but his form has improved during his current loan spell at Bournemouth.
Spurs striker Kane has recovered from the ankle injury that saw him miss the matches against Malta and Slovenia.
Wilshere is a player that we feel has a lot of class and is now starting to get more 90 minutes under his belt
Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw are not in the squad.
Both defenders were declared unfit for United's 3-1 win at Swansea.
Spurs midfielder Dele Alli also misses out having twisted his knee during training in the build-up to Tottenham's 1-1 draw against Arsenal on Sunday.
Burnley's Michael Keane is included again, having received his first call-up as injury cover for last month's games. Full-back Nathaniel Clyne and midfielders Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling also return to the set-up after overcoming injuries.
"Over the last few weeks we've been looking at as many games as possible and keeping track of all of the players," said interim England boss Gareth Southgate.
"Wilshere is a player that we feel has a lot of class and is now starting to get more 90 minutes under his belt. It's good to bring him back into the squad."
England face Scotland on Friday at Wembley Stadium and then play Spain on Tuesday, 15 November.

Wilshere's loan move to Bournemouth from Arsenal was designed to revive his career with club and country - his England recall for the first time since the doomed Euro 2016 campaign proves its success.
The midfielder was left badly exposed by former England manager Roy Hodgson's misplaced loyalty in selecting him for France on the back of 141 minutes over three games for Arsenal at the back end of last season.
He looked totally ill-equipped physically to play and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger clearly felt the only way he could recover was to go somewhere else and get regular games away from Emirates Stadium.
Wilshere has impressed at Bournemouth and his fitness has improved to such an extent he played his first full 90 minutes in the goalless draw with Spurs on 22 October.
Southgate has taken note, recalling how Wilshere has been an international influence when fully fit, and brought him back for the World Cup qualifier with Scotland and the friendly against Spain at Wembley.
