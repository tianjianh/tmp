Evelyn Maria Celgy was fatally injured during a family visit to Nottingham's Capital FM Arena, on 11 July.
Her father Celgy Thomas, of Crewe, cried as his statement explaining what had happened was read at the city's coroner's court.
Coroner Mairin Casey returned a conclusion that Evelyn died in a road traffic collision.
Evelyn died later at the Queen's Medical Centre, after sustaining a traumatic brain injury.
The inquest heard Mr Thomas was unable to see her when the accident happened, because of the blindspot on his Nissan Qashqai.
Ms Casey told him there was "absolutely nothing you could have done to avoid this situation".
In his statement, Mr Thomas said:  "I had only moved forwards a short distance when I heard my wife scream."
He told the hearing he got out of the car and walked round to the back, where he saw his daughter lying on the floor.
"I was in total shock and disbelief and knew she was seriously injured," he said.
"I then realised I had accidentally run over her."
He could see his daughter was unresponsive and lifted her up.
"I could see blood running from her nose. I began to scream," he said.
PC Mark Gascoigne, a forensic collision investigator, did tests with road cones stacked to the same height as Evelyn - 92cm - and confirmed her father would not have been able to see her while driving.
"These types of vehicle do have this problem where you've got a substantial blindspot, especially when dealing with low objects," he said.
In his statement, Mr Thomas said: "I cannot put into words the complete devastation that I, my wife, children, family and friends are feeling following the death of Evelyn.
"My life, our lives, will never be the same as I attempt to come to terms with what has happened.
"Evelyn was much loved and will be very sadly missed."
