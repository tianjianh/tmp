Adam Hill, 35, from Lincolnshire, was jailed for 15 months in July for causing the head-on collision which left Beth Tyson unable to walk unaided.
He was released after four months, subject to a home detention curfew.
Ms Tyson, 20, said she felt like the one who had been punished.
Hill, of Caistor, was on the wrong side of the A46 when he hit the vehicle Ms Tyson and her friend Kate Hunter were in, in December 2013.
He denied causing injury by dangerous driving but was convicted, jailed for 15 months and disqualified from driving for three years.
Ms Tyson, from Tealby, who was an avid horse rider, said she needed pain relief every day and had to give up on her dream to become a paramedic.
"Some days I just don't want to do anything," she said.
"The pain makes it harder to accept and get over the accident because I wasn't like that before.
"I feel like I'm the one who has been punished for something that I didn't do and had no control over."
Amy Aeron-Thomas, from the charity Road Peace, said it was usual to serve half the total jail term, but that should have been seven-and-a-half months.
"If he had pleaded guilty he would have got a sentence discount of 30% - that would reduce his total to 10 months and he then would have served half, five months.
"But he didn't do that, he put the families through so much more extended trauma."
The Ministry of Justice said it could not comment on individual cases but said only prisoners who passed a strict risk assessment can be released on a home detention curfew (HDC).
Prisoners who are serving sentences of between three months and four years will usually be considered for HDC unless they have committed certain violent or sexual offences.
If eligible they are released between two weeks and four-and-a-half months before their automatic release date.
