A man has been charged after his dog fatally injured a neighbour in West Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Ellam, 52, suffered multiple injuries near his home on Riddings Road, Sheepridge, Huddersfield, on 15 August and later died in hospital.
Aaron Joseph, 29, has been charged with owning a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death.
He was also charged with possession of cannabis and bailed to appear at Kirklees Magistrates' Court on 2 March.
The dog involved had been returned to its owner several days previous to the attack after it was seized as a suspected banned pit bull breed.
It was destroyed in late 2016 after vets found it was suffering from a terminal illness, West Yorkshire Police said.
It is thought Mr Ellam was protecting his terrier when the larger dog turned on him. Mr Ellam's dog, called Rolo, needed emergency veterinary treatment.
The case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, with an investigation ongoing.
Mr Ellam's family previously said he volunteered at Huddersfield Town FC and also worked as a lollipop man.
