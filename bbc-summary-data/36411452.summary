Two Bosnian artists created the work, moved by Bowie's death in January at the age of 69. It is 13m (43ft) high and 10.5m (34ft) wide.
The project's mastermind was a local musician, Vedad Trbonja, who called the British singer his "spiritual father".
In 1994 Bowie bought an anti-war painting by artist Peter Howson showing a Bosnian Muslim woman being raped.
The new mural in Sarajevo is on a ruined building near the street known as Sniper Alley during the 1993-1995 war. Sarajevo endured a bloody siege by Bosnian Serb forces in which civilians became snipers' targets.
The mural pays tribute to Bowie's hit songs Heroes and Fashion, bearing the slogan: "Fashion changes, but you'll always be my heroes".
It is the work of Enis Cisic, a Marvel comics illustrator, and Zoran Herceg. A crowd of several hundred attended the unveiling on Saturday.
