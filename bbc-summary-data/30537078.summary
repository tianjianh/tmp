The prince visited the Mants'ase Children's Home in Maseru, Lesotho.
"Festive cheer! Despite it being 32 degrees, someone gave out Christmas hats and inevitably one found its way on to my head," he wrote.
"All the children, orphaned for one reason or another, absolutely loved the hats and balloons."
Prince Harry was supporting the charity Sentebale which assists projects that work with disadvantaged children, many of whom have Aids or have become orphans because of the disease.
He was also photographed participating in the building of Mamohato Children's Centre.
This will give emotional and psychological support to young people affected by HIV and Aids.
The prince visited a Mamohato Network Club in Maseru and said: "These are children who have never had the chance to talk about their illness, and who had no idea that they were one of so many in their age group.
"It was really emotional watching them interact with each other. Some really outgoing chatty kids, others slightly overwhelmed, but all with huge smiles.
"This confirmed to me again that what we're doing is going to change thousands of children's lives, and hopefully save a generation."
Prince Harry also revealed his own love of photography and shared some images that he had taken.
"I have always enjoyed photography and the challenges that come with trying to capture the perfect shot, although privately I don't take many photos," he said.
"The best photos I have are in my head - I have some very special memories, mostly from Africa.
"But on this visit, I had the time and opportunity to be on the other side of the camera and take some photos in the stunning country of Lesotho for my charity, Sentebale."
