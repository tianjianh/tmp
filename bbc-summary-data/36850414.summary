The Tigers opened talks with an interested party in May.
They have been up for sale since 2014, after the Football Association turned down owner Assem Allam's request to change their name to Hull Tigers.
It has been a tough summer for Hull, who have just 13 fit players because of injuries, and whose manager Steve Bruce was a candidate for the England job.
Bruce was interviewed on Monday for the England post, which is set to go to Sunderland's Sam Allardyce.
A club statement said: "Whilst the owners intend to continue discussing a sale to interested parties in September, the priority for the coming weeks is strengthening the squad ahead of the start of the new Premier League season, particularly given the number of injuries sustained to key players during pre-season."
Hull - who won promotion back to the top flight in May - open the Premier League season by hosting champions Leicester on Saturday, 13 August.
