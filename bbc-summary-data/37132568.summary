Post Office staff have voted for strike action over planned cuts to jobs, services and pensions, the Communication Workers Union has said.

In a ballot of 3,500 members, just over half took part and 83% voted to strike.
Union officials said the Post Office was "on the path to extinction" and the government must now intervene.
In April, the Post Office announced plans to move up to 61 more branches into WH Smith stores over the next year.
The move is part of a 10-year agreement to relocate more branches into the retailer's stores.
Dave Ward, CWU general secretary, said: "Staff in the Post Office face 2,000 job losses this year, the closure of their pension scheme and a strategy of slash and burn from the board of the company.
"The Post Office is at crisis point and the government has to step in."
