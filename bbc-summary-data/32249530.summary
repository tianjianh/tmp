Ten-year-old thoroughbred Al Co has been given odds of 25-1 after his shock 40-1 win at the 2014 Scottish Grand National.
His owner, Bangor-on-Dee businessman Frank Lloyd, said he hopes his horse stands a good chance despite his usual jockey suffering a broken leg.
It has been 110 years since a Welsh-trained horse won The Grand National.
"Al Co is a good horse who jumps well but he has his own wild racing," said Mr Lloyd, who owns a warehousing and transport company in Wrexham.
"If we can get a place I would be delighted and if we can win it would be fantastic," he added.
Mr Lloyd has been involved in the sport for 40 years but it is the first time one of his horses has raced at the Aintree Grand National.
