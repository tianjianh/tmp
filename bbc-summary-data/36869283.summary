Former Tranmere trainee McGurk joins Shaun Derry's side after just one year of a two-year deal at Fratton Park.
The 27-year-old joined Pompey last summer after helping Burton win the League Two title and scored six goals in 36 games last campaign.
However, following Pompey's play-off semi-final defeat by Plymouth Argyle, McGurk was placed on the transfer list.
