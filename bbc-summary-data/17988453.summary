Turkey country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Once the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the modern secular republic was established in the 1920s by nationalist leader Kemal Ataturk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Turkey's strategically important location has given it major influence in the region - and control over the entrance to the Black Sea.
Progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting after Ataturk's death in 1938, and the army - seeing itself as guarantor of the constitution - repeatedly ousted governments seen as challenging secular values.
Joining the European Union has been a longstanding ambition. Membership talks were launched in 2005, but progress has been slow, as several EU states have serious misgivings about Turkish EU membership.
Kurds make up about a fifth of the population. Kurdish separatists who accuse the Turkish state of seeking to destroy their cultural identity have been waging a guerrilla war since the 1980s.
Population 74.5 million
Area 779,452 sq km (300,948 sq miles)
Major languages Turkish (official), Kurdish
Major religion Islam
Currency Turkish lira
President: Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power in 2003 in the wake of a sweeping electoral victory by the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), of which he was a founding member.
He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role.
To his supporters Mr Erdogan has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him.
In July 2016, the AKP government survived an attempted coup which saw clashes on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara that left 256 people dead. The authorities subsequently detained thousands of soldiers and judges on suspicion of involvement in the attempt that President Erdogan said was inspired by his exiled opponent Fethullah Gulen.
Turkey's parliament approved a new draft constitution paving the way for a presidential system of government in January 2017, in a move which would significantly increase Mr Erdogan's powers.
The bill will be put to a referendum, probably in April, and will become law if more than 50% of voters back it. Critics say the move could usher in authoritarian rule, and amounts to a power grab.
Mr Erdogan says the changed system will resemble those in France and the United States.
Turkey's airwaves are lively, with hundreds of private TV and radio stations competing with the state broadcaster, TRT.
Television is by far the most influential news medium; both press and broadcasting outlets are operating by powerful business operators.
For journalists, the military, Kurds and political Islam are highly-sensitive topics, coverage of which can lead to arrest and prosecution.
Some of the most repressive restrictions have been lifted on the path to EU entry, but it remains a crime to insult the Turkish nation and president, and a wave of prosecutions of journalists under Recep Tayyip Erdogan has prompted new concern for press freedom.
Some key dates in Turkey's history:
