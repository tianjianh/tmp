Nine out of 10 of this year's bestsellers are British acts.
Ed Sheeran's X and Sam Smith's debut In The Lonely Hour lead the line-up in the Official Charts list.
Coldplay's Ghost Stories, their sixth studio album, was the bestselling release until Ed Sheeran released his second record in the UK in June.
X spent eight weeks at number one in the Official Albums Chart.
It is the fastest-selling artist album of 2014 after shifting more than 182,000 copies during its first week on sale, and has since sold in excess of 634,000 copies.
Ed Sheeran said: "I'm so happy people have been enjoying my album so much.
"Looking forward to playing it live to my UK fans when the tour starts next week."
The only international act to make the list is Pharrell Williams with GIRL.
British newcomer, Sam Smith, who was the winner of the Brits Critics' Choice Award and BBC Sound Of 2014 poll, also overtakes Coldplay between July and September to take second place with his debut album In The Lonely Hour.
The record, which hasn't left the top five since its release in May, debuted at number one and spent two weeks at the top before returning to pole position for a further two weeks in September.
To date, it has sold 487,000 copies.
Coldplay, who led the best sellers list at the halfway point of 2014, slip two places to number three with Ghost Stories.
The album, released in May, became their sixth chart-topper and has since racked up sales of 470,000.
Meanwhile, Paolo Nutini's Caustic Love is at number four with sales of 440,000 and Paloma Faith claims the accolade of the bestselling female album of the year so far with A Perfect Contradiction (five), which has so far shifted 342,000.
Paloma also achieved a personal best on the singles front last month when Changing, her collaboration with dance duo Sigma, hit number one on the Official Singles Chart.
Further down, Dolly Parton makes a new entry at number 12 with Blue Smoke.
Released to coincide with her show-stopping performance at Glastonbury, the album is the fourth biggest seller of the third quarter of 2014, spending 12 consecutive weeks in the top 10 and has sold 208,000.
George Ezra is also new at number 15 with Wanted On Voyage on 183,000.
