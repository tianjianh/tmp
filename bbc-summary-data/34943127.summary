Cleveland Police said the Audi A4, which was travelling at speed, crashed into the property in Throston Grange Lane at 03:30 GMT.
It ended up on its side in the neighbour's garden and the driver fled.
The car, which was a write-off, caused extensive damage to the house, smashing windows, police said.
A spokesman for the force's road police unit said: "The vehicle was stolen during a burglary, unfortunately this resulted in some very poor driving. Luckily no one was hurt.
"Efforts are still being made to trace the driver."
