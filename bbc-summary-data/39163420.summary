Notts County 2-1 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Jorge Grant screamer and Shola Ameobi's first Notts County goal ensured boss Kevin Nolan kept his unbeaten home record intact as they beat fellow strugglers Hartlepool at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
County were handed a golden opportunity to take the lead after 28 minutes as Lewis Hawkins handled the ball to gift the hosts a penalty.
But Ameobi's weak effort from the spot was pushed onto the post by goalkeeper Joe Fryer.
The striker made up for his miss shortly after the restart when Grant played a fine ball through to the forward who fired a low strike into the bottom-left corner of the net.
The hosts doubled their lead in emphatic fashion thanks to a 20-yard screamer from Nottingham Forest loanee Grant, who has now scored four goals in his last six games.
The visitors pulled a goal back eight minutes later when Haydn Hollis put the ball into his own net, but it was not enough as the Magpies held on to take all three points.
