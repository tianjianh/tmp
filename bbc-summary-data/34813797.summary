[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
While significantly smaller than the 542-strong contingent at London 2012, it is the biggest squad sent to an 'away' Olympics since Barcelona 1992.
Great Britain won 29 golds, and 65 medals, on home soil four years ago.
UK Sport - which funds elite sport in Great Britain - has set Team GB a target of 48 medals for 2016, but believes the final tally could be as high as 79.
Archers Patrick Huston and Naomi Folkard will be the first Britons to take part in Rio, with their ranking round scheduled for 5 August, the day of the opening ceremony.
By the time the Games draw to a close 16 days later, and the flame passes to 2020 host Tokyo, Great Britain will have been represented in another 22 sports.
