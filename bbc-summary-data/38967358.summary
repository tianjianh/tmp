Competitors from across Europe have been competing in what might be one of the most unusual sports you'll see this year, lawnmower racing! On snow!

The contest took place in Finland and the drivers had to complete as many laps as possible in 12 hours.
It wasn't easy though, temperatures got to as low as -4 degrees and quite a few of the mowers suffered mechanical failures.
In the end Anna and Stella were crowned the champions. Have a watch to see what happened.
