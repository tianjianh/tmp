[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nama deal: Top civil servant to give evidence to NI inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Department of Finance's most senior civil servant is to give evidence to the committee investigating the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Sterling will appear before Stormont's Finance Committee.
He is expected to be asked what the department knew about the sales process and what contact it had with bidders.
The portfolio was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than £1bn last year.
An Irish politician, Mick Wallace, has alleged that £7m was due to be paid to a Northern Ireland politician in the wake of the deal.
The National Crime Agency (NCA), which is leading the criminal inquiry into the loan sale controversy, is concerned its investigation could be undermined.
Last week, Stormont's Finance Committee had to postpone its first hearing so it could work out how to proceed without prejudicing a police investigation.
The committee has now drawn up a draft terms of reference.
Its chairman Daithí McKay said they had to ensure the committee's scrutiny role does not interfere with any investigation or potential criminal trial.
On Thursday, the committee is due to consider papers provided to it by the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP).
It is then scheduled to question Mr Sterling and another senior civil servant.
A hearing by the Irish parliament's Public Accounts Committee has already established that a firm interested in buying the portfolio approached the then-Northern Ireland Finance Minister Sammy Wilson in June 2013.
The international law firm Brown Rudnick, acting on behalf of the Pimco investment fund, wrote to Mr Wilson "seeking guidance" before engaging with Nama.
Mr Wilson forwarded the letter to the Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan who advised that Brown Rudnick should contact Nama directly.
Pimco later dropped out of the bidding, after it revealed that Nama's former Northern Ireland adviser Frank Cushnahan was due to receive a £5m fee if its bid was successful.
Brown Rudnick then went on to act for the successful bidder, Cerberus.
Brown Rudnick paid £7.5m to the Belfast's solicitors firm Tughans for advice on the deal.
Tughans' then-managing partner, Ian Coulter, later moved the bulk of that fee to an Isle of Man bank account.
Mr Coulter said the money was moved for "a complex, commercially and legally sensitive" reason.
He said that no politician, nor any relative of any politician, was ever to receive any money from the deal.
The money was later moved back and Mr Coulter left the firm.
He remains in dispute with his former partners about the events surrounding the Isle of Man transfer.
All parties involved in the deal deny any wrongdoing.
