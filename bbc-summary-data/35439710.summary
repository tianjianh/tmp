[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chievo 0-4 Juventus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Juventus secured their 12th successive Serie A win - and briefly went top - as they beat mid-table Chievo easily.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morato tapped home Stephan Lichtsteiner's cross for the opener.
Morata added a second before Brazil defender Alex Sandro made it 3-0 after finishing at the back post.
Paul Pogba made it 4-0 with his fifth league goal of the season to put Juve top, but Napoli regained the leadership later in the day by beating Empoli 5-1.
The result equalled Juventus' record number of consecutive league wins in a single season.
Massimiliano Allegri's side, who won just two of their first eight league games, are chasing a fifth successive domestic title, and could have won by a greater margin, as Pogba hit the bar late on.
They have won all their league games since 28 October when they lost 1-0 at Sassuolo.
