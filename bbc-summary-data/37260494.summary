Unbeaten Joshua, 26, defended his title for the first time with a seventh-round knockout of American Dominic Breazeale in June, having won the belt against Charles Martin in two rounds in April.
The British boxer's opponent will be named on 26 September.
"I can't wait to get back up north," said Joshua, who beat Konstantin Airich in Manchester in his eighth pro bout.
"I have been inspired over the summer by the fighters in the Olympics. It has given me a new perspective and huge hunger to get back in ring."
