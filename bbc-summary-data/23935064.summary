Arsenal have signed Palermo goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old is Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's third signing of the summer and the deal includes the option to be made permanent.
Viviano has won six caps for Italy, but is not in their squad for forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.
The signing will provide competition for Arsenal's current keepers, Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski.
