[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield's Devonshire Street shops to be knocked down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to demolish a row of shops in Sheffield have been approved despite a 20,000-signature petition against the scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The shops include music and book store Rare & Racy which has traded on Devonshire Street since 1969.
Proposals approved by Sheffield Council will see apartments, a restaurant and a shop built on the site.
Hundreds of placard-waving protesters gathered outside Sheffield Town Hall on Tuesday ahead of the decision.
Seven councillors voted in favour of the plans, with three against and one abstention.
Adam Murray, director of Coda Planning Ltd which submitted the application, said: "The simple truth is that these buildings are in a state of disrepair.
"This means that if no action had been taken then in the longer term the buildings would not be able to be occupied and would have become a serious blight to the area."
The shops will be replaced by a three-storey building which will include a shop unit, restaurant, two studio apartments, six single bedroom apartments and four two-bed apartments.
