The budget airline has banned alcohol on this route following various drunken incidents.
This includes alcohol bought in duty free which will have to be put into the hold.
In September a flight was diverted apparently due to passengers causing trouble while drunk. The footage was filmed and uploaded to YouTube.
A spokesperson for Ryanair told Newsbeat: "Having consulted with our customers and the airport, passengers flying from Glasgow Prestwick to Ibiza will no longer be permitted to bring duty free alcohol on board the aircraft."
"Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind."
"The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time."
Overall, alcohol-related incidents on flights have risen in the past five years, according to the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
"There is no excuse for rude or aggressive conduct by passengers towards cabin crew or fellow passengers on board aircraft," a CAA spokesman explained to Newsbeat.
"It is actually a specific criminal offence to be drunk on board an aircraft, and also to refuse to comply with instructions from the captain.
"We support UK airlines' efforts to deal with disruptive passengers to ensure the safety of all those on board, and welcome criminal prosecutions where appropriate."
