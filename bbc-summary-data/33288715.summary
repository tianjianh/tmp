People are being asked for their views on proposals to redevelop the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull New Theatre and Woodford Leisure Centre.
The gallery will get a £4.5m facelift ahead of it hosting the Turner Prize in Hull's City of Culture year in 2017.
Other proposals include a new front of house and café bars for the theatre and a new 25m pool for the sports centre.
Detailed plans for the Ferens and New Theatre will be displayed inside a bus that will be parked in Queen Victoria Square from 10:00 to 16:00 BST. They will also go on show at each of the three venues from Monday.
Under the proposals, the gallery would receive a major overhaul of its existing lighting and temperature control systems, as well as a new café and lobby area, the council said.
The theatre's backstage areas would be improved "to bring in bigger, more ambitious shows", while the leisure centre would get a learner pool, new sauna and steam facilities and a café.
Comments from the public will be included in a planning application, which is expected to be submitted next month, the council added.
