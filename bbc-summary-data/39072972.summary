Football League Division One: All-Star Mattie Donnelly left on Tyrone bench

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All-Star Mattie Donnelly has been left on the Tyrone bench for Sunday's Football League Division One game against Cavan despite being cleared to play following a concussion protocol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donnelly missed the draw with Dublin due to a bang on the head sustained in the opening day win over Roscommon.
Mickey O'Neill replaces Niall Morgan in goal as part of manager Mickey Harte's rotational policy.
Mark Bradley is suspended so Ronan O'Neill comes in at corner forward.
Bradley received a straight red card against the Dubs at Croke Park a fortnight ago.
Sean Cavanagh is still waiting for his first start of the season, having come in as a substitute against both Roscommon and Dublin.
Cavan and Tyrone both drew their last games, but it was the Breffni men who came out on top when the sides met in the opening Dr McKenna Cup game back in January.
Former Tyrone attacker Mattie McGleenan makes his first visit to Healy Park as Cavan manager, looking for his first win in the current campaign.
Tyrone: M O'Neill; P Hampsey, R McNamee, C McCarron; T McCann, J McMahon, A McCrory; C Cavanagh, D McClure; C Meyler, N Sludden, P Harte; D McCurry, C McShane, R O'Neill.
