Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha says he told Aberdeen counterpart Derek McInnes not to come into his office following Wednesday's meeting in Glasgow.

Aberdeen claimed their first win at Ibrox since 1991, Graeme Shinnie and Ryan Christie scoring before Martyn Waghorn's reply for the hosts.
Caixinha said he was left waiting over 15 minutes for McInnes in his office at Pittodrie in April before leaving.
But McInnes insists his opposite number was "mistaken".
Caixinha said following his side's 2-1 defeat in Glasgow: "I was just saluting him and saying I didn't understand the reason why he invited me to be received in his office and didn't show up at the previous match.
"So I said that if you didn't show up in the previous match, you are definitely not welcome to come to my office. It is a question of respect. If I am not being respected then, please, don't show up.
"If he didn't show up and I waited more than 15 minutes, what do you call that?"

But McInnes said of events at Pittodrie after Rangers' 3-0 win on 9 April: "I was doing my media duties as I normally do and there is absolutely no way I would be like that with any manager and I never will.
"Every manager is welcome in my office and I always make the point.
"It's not something you can aim at me. He's wrong, he's mistaken. If he thinks that then maybe he should have said to me before - I don't know.
"[Assistant] Tony Docherty and my staff were there at the time and told me they came in, had a quick glass of red wine and shot away. They made their apologies for having to leave so soon.
"I was still doing my media work and it was no longer than any other time. I would never disrespect any manager in terms of after the game."
The Dons boss had said this week that Rangers "should probably be embarrassed that they've not finished second" owing to the Glasgow side's greater financial clout.
Aberdeen will finish as Premiership runners-up for the third season running with Rangers consigned to third place.
"Managers and benches can get passionate on the touchline," said McInnes. "There was a couple of calls, one or two things, and I argued with him as he did with me."
And Caixinha added: "I'm not focused on Aberdeen next season. The focus at this club is always to be number one.
"We don't misunderstand things here. I know what it represents to be in this chair, despite many others who should like to be here but they aren't.
"I know what the job represents and I am here to defend the club and work for the club."
