PC Jeremy Fowler, 40, from Brecon, Powys, was accused of attacking the man at Merthyr Tydfil police station.
He had denied the assault, saying he merely rubbed the man's hair and face as a "bit of fun" while PC Matthew Davies held him to the floor.
The officers still face an internal investigation over the alleged assault.
PC Davies was cleared of assault at Cardiff Magistrates' Court last year, after he claimed the incident was nothing more than "horseplay".
A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said the force "took these allegations against two serving police officers extremely seriously and a thorough criminal investigation into what happened took place".
She said: "We immediately referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure independent scrutiny."
She said the alleged victim and colleagues affected by the incident had been supported throughout the investigative and court processes.
"Now that the criminal proceedings are completed, significant attention will be given to internal misconduct processes, which will examine the conduct of police officers in relation to this case," she added.
