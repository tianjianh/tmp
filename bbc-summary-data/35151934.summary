[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hatton Garden accused had 'habit of falling out with people'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of four men accused of the Hatton Garden raid had a "habit of falling out with people", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon Harbinson, 42, said he didn't speak to co-accused William Lincoln, who is his uncle, for 20 years until they reconciled a year ago.
Mr Harbinson is said to have been involved in the plan to get rid of the cash, diamonds and jewellery stolen by a gang in the heist.
Both men deny being involved in the burglary.
Taxi-driver Mr Harbinson told Woolwich Crown Court he had not met any of those who had admitted being involved in the raid at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London apart from John Collins, who was in a relationship with his aunt, and William Lincoln.
He had also not spoken to his aunt for 10 years.
"It's a bit of a pattern with me," he told the jury. "I fall out with people."
When asked about items of jewellery found at his home, Mr Harbinson said one piece, a necklace, was given to him by his grandmother, which had sentimental value to him.
Another item, a sovereign ring, was a present from his parents, while another half-sovereign was a gift to his sister when he got his first job, he told the court.
Earlier on Monday, Mr Lincoln's friend James Creighton gave evidence.
He said Mr Lincoln was known as "Billy the Fish" by friends at the Porchester Spa in Bayswater.
Mr Creighton was given the nickname "Jimmy two baths" as he often stays all day at the spa, sometimes having two baths, the court heard.
Both he and Mr Lincoln used to "do quite a lot of schmeissing", or Yiddish whipping, the jury was told.
Schmeissing is a technique carried out in a hot steam room, where the body is soaped all over with a coarse brush and then scrubbed vigorously.
The trial continues.
