[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 2-0 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A quickfire second-half double helped Macclesfield ease past Braintree on home turf in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite a goalless first half there was no shortage of half-chances to keep the crowd on edge.
Rhys Browne prodded over from close range as John Askey's Silkmen shaded the opening period.
Mitch Hancox made an inspired run midway through the second half and threaded a neat ball to Connor Jennings who put his side in front.
Then Chris Holroyd capitalised on a slip by the Braintree defence to make it 2-0 with an assured left-footed finish just two minutes later.
