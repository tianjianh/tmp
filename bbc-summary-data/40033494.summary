Celtic will "never give up" chasing European glory, according to the club's chairman Ian Bankier.

The club are celebrating the 50th anniversary of their 1967 European Cup final win over Internazionale.
Bankier says Celtic will always strive to replicate that success, but concedes the disparity in resources with the continent's leading clubs makes it a difficult challenge.
"You would never banish these hopes and ambitions from your mind," he said.
"Right here, right now, it's very difficult because of the economics of Scottish football. The only thing I would say as chairman of the club is you never, ever give up.
"Of course you want to go as far as you can in Europe, get into the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals. Whether we do is another thing altogether."
This season, Celtic reached the group stage of the Champions League for the first time in three years but finished bottom of their group.
Rodgers' men won the League Cup by beating Aberdeen in the final and secured the Premiership in April, eventually finishing 30 points clear of the Dons.
And it is Aberdeen that stand between Celtic and a clean sweep of domestic honours in Saturday's Scottish Cup final at Hampden.
Rodgers has spoken of his desire to add to the playing squad this summer, and Bankier believes the emphasis will be on quality rather than quantity when it comes to recruitment in the upcoming transfer window.
When asked what the level of investment would be in the playing squad this summer, the Celtic chairman said: "We're in the hands of Brendan on that one.
"The reality today is that we have a team that has been invested in quite well. You can see the standard of football that's being played.
"I think from Brendan's point of view he'll just want to continue with more of the same. I would see it more in the department of finishing touches than a wholesale going out and buying the world."
