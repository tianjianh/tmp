Ex-Arsenal midfielder Serge Gnabry scored a debut hat-trick as Germany brushed aside San Marino in a one-sided World Cup qualifier in Serravalle.

Gnabry, now at Werder Bremen, opened his account inside 10 minutes and hit two more after the break to become the first Germany debutant to score three times since Dieter Muller in 1976.
Sami Khedira, Jonas Hector (2) and Kevin Volland also scored, while Mattia Stefanelli conceded an own goal.
Germany lead Group C by five points.
Gnabry, 21, joined Bremen for an undisclosed fee in August after finishing as joint top scorer at this summer's Olympic Games as Germany lost the final to hosts Brazil.
"I did not count on scoring three goals on my debut," said Gnabry, who joined Arsenal from Stuttgart in 2011 and made 18 appearances for the club, scoring once.
"I am very happy. The last two years were difficult but now I am playing many games and am in scoring form. I hope it will continue."
