RSPCA appeal after horse stuck in mud at Kidwelly Quay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RSPCA is trying to track down the owner of a horse it rescued after it became trapped in mud in Carmarthenshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The thoroughbred mare had to be hauled out by firefighters and an equine vet after getting into trouble at Kidwelly Quay on Monday.
Inspector Nic de Celis said: "She was so exhausted she couldn't stand and just sunk back in the mud."
He said the mare had been stranded by the tide and had fallen into a gully.
"We used all the equipment and manpower we had to free her.
"We used a groundsheet as a sledge and it took around a dozen people to slide her out of the gully.
"There were some touch-and-go moments, as she collapsed and we were fearful she might not make it."
The mare was treated at the scene and has been taking to a boarding stable where she is being monitored.
Anyone with information about the horse should contact the RSPCA inspectorate appeal line on 0300 123 8018.
