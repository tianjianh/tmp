The new Bulmershe School building, based in Woodley, Reading, was unveiled by Wokingham borough mayor UllaKarin Clark. It boasts a 400-seat auditorium.
It also houses six classrooms with computer workstations, a sixth form centre, meeting rooms, reception area and administration offices.
Councillor Rob Stanton, who is chairman of the school's project board, said "every detail" had been debated.
He added: "We've planned and planned for these new facilities... but there's nothing quite like seeing it up and running [and] seeing just how much of a difference it will make to this school."
The borough council has invested £6m in the school in the past three years to improve standards.
Head teacher Emma Reynolds said the auditorium and "21st Century learning environment" represented "further superb opportunities" for students.
