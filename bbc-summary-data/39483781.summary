Who is the new first family?
The first lady lives in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, and has largely remained out of the spotlight since her husband took office.
Mrs Trump and her son are expected to move into the White House after Barron finishes the school year.
She plans to focus on the problem of cyber-bullying among children, according to her biography on the White House website.
Mrs Trump, a native of Slovenia, is the second first lady to be born outside of the United States.
Louisa Adams, wife of former President John Quincy Adams, was born in London.
