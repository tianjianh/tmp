Tin Tin Yu, a football super-fan from Burma, says sex is more important to men than it is to women.
Meanwhile Nawal El-Saadawi, an 84-year-old feminist and author from Egypt says: "Marriage is not essential and motherhood is not essential."
The BBC's 100 Women also speaks to Louise Schwartz, an 87-year-old former showgirl from Jamaica, Jenni Rhodes, an 83-year-old British model and textile designer and Kamini Kaushal, an 88-year-old Bollywood star from India.
