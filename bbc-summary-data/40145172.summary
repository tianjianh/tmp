Camanachd Cup: Lovat cruise past Glenurquhart into quarter-finals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lovat cruised to a Camanachd Cup quarter-final at Kilmallie when they defeated Glenurquhart 3-0 in their second-round replay at Kiltarlity - but not before the pitch was cleared of a large quantity of stones.

In the other replay, Oban Camanachd earn the right to go to Inveraray with a 1-0 victory over Kinlochshiel.
Kyles went three points clear of Kingussie at the top of the Marine Harvest Premiership with two games in hand when they beat their rivals 3-1 at Tighnabruich.
Three miles from Kiltarlity at Beauly, the problem was rabbits. The home side overcame an infestation of them on their pitch to record a 5-1 home win over Inverness in the National Division where Inveraray had a 2-1 away win over Strathglass.
All games involving the first and second teams of Kilmallie and Fort William were postponed following the death of Duncan Rodger who played for both clubs.
Due to an application of topsoil which included several large stones, the Kiltarlity pitch was declared unplayable for Lovat's reserve game at noon. Officials then worked flat-out across the lunch hour to remove the stones so the first-team encounter with Glenurquhart could go ahead.
It all worked out well for the hosts, who had the game wrapped up by half-time with goals from Lewis Tawse, Lorne MacKay and Greg Matheson.
Andrew McCuish scored the only goal of the game to send Oban Camanachd through at the expense of an under-strength Kinlochshiel side, weakened further by Conor Cormack becoming their second red-carded player in a week.
In the Premiership, Grant Irvine and Roddy MacDonald had Kyles 2-0 up within half an hour. Lee Riddoch pulled one back for Kingussie early in the second half before Innes MacDonald put the game to bed with Kyles' third.
Inverness scored first at rabbit-infested Beauly through James Cameron, but goals from Craig Rankin and Jack MacDonald both within a minute of half-time put Beauly in front. Rankin went on to complete a hat-trick and MacDonald a double after the restart.
Lewis MacNicol and Allan MacDonald gave Inveraray a 2-0 half-time lead at Cannich and Darren Reid got one back for Strathglass in the second period.
Skye's relegation means that the only West Coast derbies this season against Kinlochshiel are between their second teams. However Shiel had to supply their weakened first string while the islanders could field no first team, so had extra players on call.
The upshot was a 9-0 Skye victory in North Division One, led by four, including a treble in eight minutes, from Conor Gilpin.
