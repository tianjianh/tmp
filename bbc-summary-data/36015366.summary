Lady Melinda Rose Woodward - known as Linda - who was married to the star for 59 years, died on Sunday morning at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.
"Surrounded by her husband and loved ones, she passed away peacefully," a statement on 75-year-old Sir Tom's website said.
He recently cancelled concerts due to a "serious illness" in his family.
Sir Tom, famous for hits like Delilah, It's Not Unusual and Sex Bomb, had been due to perform at a number of his tour dates in Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, but apologised to fans after pulling out.
He met his wife, his childhood sweetheart, when they were both 12 and growing up together in Treforest, Pontypridd.
They started dating at 15 and married when they were 16.
They had one son Mark, 59, who is also Sir Tom's manager.
In his 2015 autobiography titled Over The Top And Back, Sir Tom revealed they wanted more children, but a miscarriage had left Lady Linda infertile.
