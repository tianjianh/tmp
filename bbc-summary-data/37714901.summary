[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kirsty Williams asks experts to review Education changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
International experts have been asked to review changes to the Welsh education system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has invited the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to assess whether Welsh Government reforms are "on track".
A previous report by the OECD said the government lacked a long-term vision for education.
It comes ahead of the OECD-run Pisa test results in December.
The performance of Welsh pupils in these international tests has fallen short of results in other parts of the UK.
Ms Williams has already outlined how the Welsh Government plans to reform teacher training, introduce a new school curriculum, support poorer students and secure additional resources for school improvements.
