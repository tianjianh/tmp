Burton Albion 0-0 Barnsley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton were unable to make second-half pressure count as they were held to a goalless draw at home by Barnsley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors started brightly, with striker Adam Armstrong curling an early chance wide of Jon McLaughlin's goal.
Burton lifted their game after the interval and Chris O'Grady almost put them in front against one of his old clubs, but Adam Davies saved well.
Tom Flanagan shot wide with the goal at his mercy and Davies denied O'Grady again as Barnsley held out for a point.
The visitors were boosted by the return of skipper Conor Hourihane from suspension for the meeting of two sides promoted from League One last term.
Burton suffered a setback when Northern Ireland international Jamie Ward had to go off with a wrist injury in the 12th minute, with Lucas Akins pushed into the middle to partner O'Grady.
Their second-half pressure forced Tykes boss Paul Heckingbottom to switch from 4-4-2 to a 4-5-1 formation, as Josh Scowen replaced Armstrong.
The Brewers had failed to score in three previous matches against Barnsley and were frustrated again as Davies made another good stop to keep out Ben Turner's header, and then foiled sub Stuart Beavon at point-blank range in stoppage time.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "We have hit the target a lot today and the goalkeeper has made some good saves including a couple of fortunate ones.
"I think when one hits him on the head and loops over the bar in the 91st minute we know it just might not be our day.
"In terms of attacking intent in the second half I thought we were magnificent. We hope we will get our rewards over the next 28 games if there is any justice.
"I would still say that it was two points lost today because I thought our performance was so good but any point you get in this league is a very good point."
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: "Obviously we have got to be pleased with the clean sheet especially how Burton came at us in the second half.
"I thought it was the classic game of two halves: we felt we had the better chances first half which could have made the game a lot easier for ourselves it we had taken some of them but as the game wore on Burton came more and more into it.
"We knew we would have to defend our box coming here. We had to defend really well and when they did breach us, Adam Davies did really well with a double-save at his near post and then one at the end that hit him so you know he is in the right place for that one."
