The 28-year-old, who previously said he would be missing for three months, has now stated that he will be out for between four and six months.
Nasri posted a picture of himself with former Arsenal team-mate Marouane Chamakh on his Instagram account.
"Just had surgery everything went really well hopefully will be back in 4 to 6 months," he wrote.
Nasri has made eight appearances for City this season - scoring once in the 2-0 win at Everton in August - but has started only two games.
The France international has not featured since coming on as a second-half substitute in the 5-1 Premier League win over Bournemouth on 17 October.
