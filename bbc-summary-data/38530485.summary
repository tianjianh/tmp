Colchester boss John McGreal says his side must not get carried away after rising from the relegation zone to just outside the play-off places.

The 44-year-old won League Two's manager of the month award for December after four wins from five games.
"The run that we've been on, it's only a small portion of the season. We can't get carried away," said McGreal.
"We've got loads and loads of work left. Our main job at the minute is to keep minds focused on the next game."
The former Ipswich defender took his first job in management in the summer following Colchester's relegation from League One.
The U's struggled at the start of the campaign, including a winless run of 10 matches from September until mid-November, but have taken 19 points from the last 21.
McGreal told BBC Essex: "The small window I've had as a manager, it has been a roller-coaster. There's been some ups and downs but every single moment I've enjoyed it.
"Even on the winless run I've enjoyed it. When we're winning it's great but you just want to keep improving.
"We've had the relegation, we don't want to keep banging on about that, it was tough losing a lot of players, it's a new team and new management team but we're just trying to win games of football."
Colchester will move into the play-off places if they win Saturday's home game against third-placed Carlisle United.
