Following manager Steve Burr's sacking after Tuesday's 2-0 defeat at Torquay, the Cestrians trailed again through Robbie McDaid's 38th-minute header.
Chester substitute James Alabi then came off the bench to head in a superb hanging cross from John Rooney.
But Matt Rhead nodded on Lee Beevers' cross for Imps sub George Maris to net.
Chester had to play the final quarter of an hour with 10 men after losing top scorer Ross Hannah, just two minutes after Alabi's 73rd-minute equaliser.
The Imps' 81st-minute winner, in their first game since manager Chris Moyses announced his end-of-season departure, earned their first victory in six games.
It leaves Chester in 17th, still four points clear of trouble, but having played one match more than most of the teams around them.
They have now picked up just three points from seven games since beating Aldershot 8-2 last month - the biggest win Chester fans had seen since 1972.
Alabi had not scored in six starts since his four goals that night, but at least responded to being dropped by ending his personal drought.
Lincoln City coach David Preece told BBC Radio Lincolnshire:

"It was familiar territory, wasn't it? Going 1-0 up and being pegged back but this time it was different. We showed a bit more resilience. We were always in control in the first half.
"Sometimes this season we've been accused of not having a Plan B, but what everyone's seen as Plan A all season turned out to be Plan B.
"We just want to finish the season as strong as possible. It's been a big week for the club and the players and sometimes when things like that happen you don't know how players are going to react, but this shows how Chris Moyses has always had the backing of the boys and he will do until he steps down."
Chester caretaker manager Jon McCarthy told BBC Radio Merseyside:
"I'm certain we would have taken at least a point, so to be hit by the blow of losing Ross Hannah is really frustrating. We definitely would have got something.
"We'd just gone 1-1, we'd turned the game completely around and, with the psychology of that, everybody knows we were waiting for that.
"You would have seen Lincoln go under a little bit and our players grow an extra six inches and that we feel would have been chance to go on and win."
