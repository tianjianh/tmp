Aberdeen will aim for a tie-killing away goal when they take on Fola Esch in the second leg of their Europa League qualifier in Luxembourg.

The Dons hold a two-goal lead thanks to last week's 3-1 success at Pittodrie.
They know if they plunder another, it should be enough to book their place in the second qualifying round.
"I think the amount of chances we created last Thursday gives us a lot of hope for an away goal," said defender Graeme Shinnie.
"If we can get that, it could be very crucial in the game.
"Last year was my first involvement and I think we scored in every away game.
"We won't necessarily need one. I think the scoreline last week shows that, but obviously it would be nice as it would give us an even bigger cushion.
"I think, when you get drawn in European games like this, you don't know what to expect until you actually play them."
The Dons will give Niall McGinn the chance to recover from a hectic schedule when they take to the field in Luxembourg.
McGinn returned from Euro 2016 duty with Northern Ireland and within days was thrown in from the start against the side from Luxembourg in the first leg at Pittodrie.
Indeed, the forward scored the Dons' second goal to break Fola resistance and help the Scottish Premiership side to the cusp of the next round.
But manager Derek McInnes has decided now is the time to allow the Ulsterman the opportunity to catch his breath ahead of another energy-sapping campaign.
The Dons have put in some strong performances on their European travels under McInnes.
And he is hopeful the Fola return will represent another chance for his team to impress on the road, as they did in victories in Groningen and Rijeka in particular in recent seasons.
"We've had some good results, we've been to some difficult places. We've got some away goals and put in good, winning performances, " McInnes told BBC Scotland.
"At home, we've got ourselves into strong positions because of our away performances.
"This time round, we've been at home first and, while we've got an advantage, there's nobody thinking we're home and dry.
"Experience tells us, to get through in Europe, you have to bring two decent performances in two legs.
"We feel as though we've had one and the onus is on us to try and improve on that again and put in another to get us through."
