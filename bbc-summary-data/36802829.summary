Henry VIII's flagship has undergone 34 years of conservation since it was raised from the Solent in 1982.
Small viewing panels have been replaced with floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony entered through an airlock, at the purpose-built museum in Portsmouth.
Conservation manager Dr Eleanor Schofield said it was an "emotional" moment.
"You think about all the people involved in the project and their commitment and perseverance. It's fabulous to see the ship like this.
"It feels like you can reach out an touch it - you get a sense of the compartments and relate it to all the artefacts and the people on board," she added.
The warship, which sank in 1545 while leading an attack on a French invasion fleet, was discovered in 1971.
It was taken to an atmospherically controlled dry dock where it was sprayed with a mist of cold water, then water-soluble wax, before an air-drying process began.
The latest development, which saw the ship close to public view in November, cost about £5.4 million to complete.
The £39m museum first opened its doors to visitors in May 2013. The ship goes back on public view on Wednesday.
Dr Alex Hildred, head of research and curator of ordnance, who was among those who dived on the wreck in the 1970s and 80s said: "When we excavated the Mary Rose we wanted people to see even a little of what we, as archaeologists, saw and experienced underwater.
"The fact that you can see it from three different angles that you've never been able to see before, except for when she first came up, is brilliant."
