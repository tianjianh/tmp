Bayern Munich will finish second in Champions League Group D after a surprise 3-2 defeat by FC Rostov.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Russian Premier League team earned their first victory in the competition's history on a night temperatures dropped below -4C.
They also became the first Russian team to beat the Bundesliga giants in Champions League history.
Bayern, five-time winners, will finish behind Atletico Madrid, and could face Leicester City in the last 16.
With one round of matches remaining, 12 teams have already qualified, meaning four places are still up for grabs.
Sevilla, Lyon, Porto, FC Copenhagen, Benfica, Napoli and Besiktas are vying for those places in the knockout stage.
Bayern defender Jerome Boateng had a forgettable evening in Rostov.
The former Manchester City centre-back was turned and left face down on the pitch as Sardar Azmoun opened the scoring, gave away the penalty Dmitry Poloz scored to make it 2-1, then went off injured before Christian Noboa scored the third.
Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had little sympathy for the Germany international.
"Jerome needs to find a bit more quiet again," he said.
"It's a bit too much for me since the summer. It would be in his interest and the whole club's if he came a little down back to earth."
Besiktas pulled off their own 'Miracle of Istanbul' as they recovered from 3-0 down at half-time to draw 3-3 against Benfica in Group B.
The home crowd created a spectacular atmosphere which inspired a remarkable comeback.
Besiktas fans, who have previously broken the decibel record for the loudest crowd at a football match, took part in a silent celebration in support of the hearing and speech impaired, as well as a stand against racism.
Fans were encouraged via social media to use sign language to show support for their team at kick-off.
Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have swapped ownership of the Champions League goalscoring record since the former passed Raul's mark of 71 in 2014.
Real Madrid forward Ronaldo ended last season on 93 goals - 10 clear of Barcelona captain Messi.
But the Argentine's double in a 2-0 win over Celtic, added to his hat-tricks against both the Scottish side and Manchester City earlier in the competition, moved him to 92 - just three goals behind Ronaldo.
Who will hit 100 first?
