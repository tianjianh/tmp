[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coal bed methane complaint against council rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A complaint about the way Dumfries and Galloway Council dealt with planning applications for a coal bed methane development has been thrown out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An opponent of the plans near Canonbie claimed a series of applications submitted between 2007 and 2009 should not have been considered individually.
She told the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) they should have been considered a "major development".
The ombudsman did not uphold the complaint against the council.
The complaint was made by a woman referred to as Mrs C in the report by the SPSO.
She claimed that planning officers were "not sufficiently expert" to deal with the applications, which included the formation of a gas compressor station.
Mrs C also said the council did not ensure appropriate public consultation.
However, the ombudsman ruled in the council's favour.
The report said: "There was no evidence to suggest that the developments constituted a major development or that officers were not sufficiently expert to deal with the applications.
"All the planning applications had been publicly advertised and requirements for neighbour notification fulfilled."
A council spokesman said:  "It would be inappropriate for Dumfries and Galloway Council to comment through the media on an individual decision of the SPSO."
