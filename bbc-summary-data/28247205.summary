The 28-year-old lock succeeds Steve Borthwick, who retired at the end of last season.
"Alistair has shown exceptional leadership qualities since arriving at the club," Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said.
"He is unequivocally respected by staff and players alike and we feel certain he will lead the squad brilliantly."
Hargreaves joined Saracens from Super Rugby outfit Sharks in 2012 and has played 44 games for the Premiership club.
He made his Test debut for South Africa against Wales in 2010 and has won a total of four caps.
