[SN]TITLE[SN]
Legal review agreed on William Payne fatal crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Crown Office has agreed to review its decision not to prosecute the driver of a Range Rover who knocked down and killed two students.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mhairi Convy and Laura Stewart were killed when William Payne apparently lost control of the car in Glasgow.
He had been charged with causing death by driving while uninsured but it was later dropped.
A fatal accident inquiry last year heard that he had had six blackouts in the three years before the accident.
The fatal crash took place in December 2010.
Ms Convy, of Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, and Ms Stewart, of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, were accounts students at the former Central College of Commerce.
