Gaston Ramirez is also available after an ankle knock and the only absentee is Calum Chambers, who is ineligible to face his parent club.
Arsenal could welcome back captain Laurent Koscielny after two games out with an Achilles issue.
Petr Cech could also return after a calf injury but Lucas Perez and David Ospina remain sidelined.
Ian Dennis: "Arsenal will certainly not want another meek Monday night after their sorry showing at Selhurst Park.
"Last week their team coach was delayed in traffic in south London, but I remember 10 years ago the Arsenal bus, en route to the Riverside, took a wrong turn and started heading towards Darlington. They lost 2-1 to Middlesbrough that day.
"Critics of Arsene Wenger will say the club is lacking direction. The statistics certainly reinforce those that think Arsenal have lost their way - they've won seven points out of a possible 24 since the end of January.
"Sam Allardyce tactically exposed Arsenal but can Steve Agnew follow suit? A winning formula is essential because time is running out for Boro, who have scored the fewest home goals of any side in the top four divisions in England."

Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: Of course they [Arsenal] are in a difficult moment, certainly away from home. But they have got top-quality players throughout the team, so we have no doubt it will be a really, really difficult game.
"It is a challenge because he's got top, top players through the squad. It's full of internationals and Arsene Wenger, in my opinion, is one of the most talented coaches there's been around for many years."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on his side's top-four prospects: "We might get there, we might not get there, but the only thing to get there is to believe we can do it and that's what we have to focus on.
"It's not the fear to fail, it's the desire to make it and that's the only chance we have to make it."
Arsenal were all over the place against Crystal Palace last time out but Middlesbrough will not cause them anywhere near the same sort of problems.
