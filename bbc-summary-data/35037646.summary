Hove residents campaign against seafront tower

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign to halt plans for a 17-storey building on Hove seafront is gathering pace after a public meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two hundred residents met to voice their concerns at the structure which they believe is out of keeping with the area.
Campaigner Valerie Paynter said it would "deeply and horribly" impact on the housing behind it.
The developer insisted the "high-quality, landmark" building would ease pressure on local housing supply.
The cylindrical high-rise would sit on the corner of Sackville Gardens and Kingsway.
It would provide 107 homes, ranging from penthouse apartments to "affordable" flats, some with rooftop gardens or balconies.
Developer The Hyde Group said the derelict site had been an "eyesore" since a former hotel partially collapsed and had to be demolished in 2006.
Angelique Henderson of campaigner group No to Sackville Towers agreed something needed to be built on the site.
But she said: "This cylinder does not enhance our local area. It is just so huge. It will loom and dwarf all of our houses."
Tom Shaw of The Hyde Group said: "By developing a tall building we are having less impact on the neighbouring properties than we would if we developed a shorter building but taking up more of the footprint of the site.
He said there would not be a noticeable reduction in daylight and sunlight for the existing homes and gardens.
He said changes had been made to the scheme after a public consultation and would be available to see when the application was submitted.
Peter Kyle, MP for Hove and Portslade, is against the current design.  He said the "round, muscular" building was "too solid for this part of the seafront".
"I feel we need to build higher, but I also feel this is perhaps a case of the right building in the wrong place," he said.
He also feared the homes would be bought up by property speculators from abroad.
However, local councillor Robert Nemeth of Wish Ward supports the proposal.
He said: "With housing targets imposed upon us, we have little choice but to get building.
"This means either tall developments in the city or sprawling over the South Downs.  I'd much rather go up than out."
