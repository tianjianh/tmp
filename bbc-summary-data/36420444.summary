England manager Roy Hodgson and Wales boss Chris Coleman have announced the 23 players who they will each be taking to France next month to compete in the European Championships, and there have been some surprises on both teams.

Striker Marcus Rashford has earned a place in the England squad after scoring in his international debut against Australia last week. The 18-year-old player has had a quick rise, having made his first appearance in the Premiere League for Manchester United only 3 months ago.
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is also named, despite missing both of England's warm-up games. And while Leicester City's hero Jamie Vardy makes the squad, his team-mate Danny Drinkwater misses out.
Goalkeepers
Joe Hart (Manchester City), Fraser Forster (Southampton), Tom Heaton (Burnley).
Defenders
Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Everton), Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool).
Midfielders
Dele Alli (Tottenham Hotspur), Ross Barkley (Everton), Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), James Milner (Liverpool), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal).
Strikers
Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Jamie Vardy (Leicester City), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Marcus Rasford (Manchester United).
For Wales, midfielder Joe Ledley has been selected to go to France less than a month after breaking his leg.
The manager said he deserved his place in the team, despite being unsure of what stage of the group games he'd be fit for.
Ledley's not the only Wales player with a question mark over his fitness: striker Hal Robson-Kanu is suffering with what the manager called a 'leg issue' while Joe Allen has also been unfit.
Goalkeepers
Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Danny Ward (Liverpool), Owain Fon Williams (Inverness).
Defenders
Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Neil Taylor (Swansea City), Chris Gunter (Reading), Ashley Williams (Captain, Swansea), James Chester (West Brom), Ashley Richards (Fulham), James Collins (West Ham).
Midfielders
Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal), Joe Ledley (Crystal Palace), David Vaughan (Nottingham Forest), Joe Allen (Liverpool), Jonathan Williams (Crystal Palace), George Williams (Fulham), Andy King (Leicester), Dave Edwards (Wolves).
Forwards
Gareth Bale (Real Madrid), Hal Robson-Kanu (Reading), Sam Vokes (Burnley), Simon Church (MK Dons), David Cotterill (Birmingham City)
Both England and Wales have one last friendly before they head to France for the championships. England play Portugal and Wales face Sweden this week in their final warm-up games.
On 16 June the two sides will face each other as they battle to get through the group stages of the tournament.
