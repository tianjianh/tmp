A group of staff at Perth Royal Infirmary have received a message of thanks from UK astronaut Tim Peake.

Major Peake sent the greeting from the International Space Station after his mother-in-law Madeleine King spent time as a patient at the hospital.
The astronaut posed for a photograph of himself holding up a sign which read: "Thank you NHS PRI for all you do!!"
Staff on ward 8 at the hospital said they are going to frame and display the photograph.
Senior charge nurse Samantha Edmonds said: "It was a lovely thing for Major Peake to do and it has given all the staff on the ward a real lift."
Associate nurse director Jim Foulis said: "The brightest stars are those who shine for others and I am very proud of the staff here in PRI that the high quality of care they provide for their patients has been recognised in the highest of places."
Major Peake described his first walk in space last month as "exhilarating".
