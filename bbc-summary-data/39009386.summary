Martyn Graham, 58, also seriously injured two other motorists in the crash of the A421 Bedford bypass on 12 January 2016.
A web cam in his cab showed the brake lights ahead for 17 seconds before the collision.
Graham admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
He also pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
A collision report said Graham had not reacted or braked at all, and the court heard the cause of his inattention remained a mystery.
He was not using a mobile phone, was not tired or ill, and had driven about two million miles over the previous years without incident.
Wayne Cleaver, prosecuting, told Luton Crown Court the couple who died were grandparents Martin Spratt, 70 and his wife Evelyn, 68, of Buckden, Cambridgeshire.
Davina Stubbs, 54, from Bedford sustained serious injuries and had to be cut free from her Vauxhall Corsa. She now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Danny Delasalle, 32 from Stevenage, who was driving a flatbed Transit van, had to wear a neck brace for three and a half months after the crash, the court was told.
Judge Philip Bartle QC said the crash had "devastating consequences" for those involved.
Graham said later he had no memory of the events leading up to the accident and could not explain why he had not braked.
Ian Bridge, defending, said Graham was thoroughly remorseful and thought of the accident every day and had sleepless nights.
Graham was also banned from driving for five years.
