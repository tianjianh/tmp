A car driver has been jailed for texting a woman on his mobile phone shortly before causing the death of a cyclist in St Albans.

Mark Greenwood, 57, of Redbourn was cycling on the A5183 when he was knocked off his bike and killed.
John Michell, 26, of Whaddon Close, Northampton, admitted causing death by dangerous driving.
He was jailed for 21 months at St Albans Crown Court and disqualified from driving for three years.
The court heard Michell, an accountant, had sent at least two messages during a Whatsapp conversation with a woman at about 18:15 GMT on 9 January 2014.
Mr Greenwood had been wearing a high visibility jacket and helmet, although the court heard the last CCTV sighting of him showed he did not have his lights on as he cycled out of the city centre.
Other motorists reported he had been riding slowly along the A1538 in a straight line near the kerb.
He died from multiple traumatic injuries.
The woman who had received the messages told police Michell had later told her "It was my fault because I was looking at my phone."
By coincidence, the two men had been living in the same apartment block in Redbourn at the time, but they did not know each other.
Mr Greenwood's partner Susan Ullman told the court she did not want Michell to be jailed because it would be another "life lost".
John Dye, Michell's counsel, said his client was genuinely remorseful and had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder as a result.
However, Judge Andrew Bright said the use of mobile phones while driving was like an "epidemic" and he had to send out a "loud and clear" message that if a death was caused then drivers could expect prison sentences.
