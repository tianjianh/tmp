Uber offers £20m settlement over 'safe ride' lawsuits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uber has offered £20m ($28.5m) to settle two US lawsuits which argued that its safety claims were misleading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As the lawsuits represent around 25 million US Uber customers, this amounts to an individual payout of just over a dollar each.
The proceedings claimed that the lift-hailing app was charging a "safe ride fee" but not carrying out adequate background checks on its drivers.
Uber said it would rename the charge a "booking fee".
It also pledged to change the wording of its advertising to avoid safety-related language.
The settlement requires court approval and applies to journeys booked in the US between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2016.
"We are glad to put these cases behind us and we will continue to invest in new technology and great customer services so that we can help improve safety in the cities we serve," the firm said in a statement.
Uber track its drivers' cars via GPS and shares a photo of the driver with customers before they get in the car.
"No means of transportation can ever be 100% safe. Accidents and incidents do happen," it added.
"That's why it's important to ensure that the language we use to describe safety at Uber is clear and precise."
