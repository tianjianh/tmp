One-time leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, will take his seat alongside party colleague Sir Malcolm Bruce.
Former Labour chancellor and head of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling, will also be entering the House of Lords.
Entrepreneur Michelle Mone has also become one of the 45 new members.
In all, Prime Minister David Cameron handed out peerages to 26 Conservatives, including former foreign secretary William Hague.
Also on the Tory leader's list was Ms Mone whom he recently appointed to carry out a review into how best to encourage start-ups in areas of high unemployment.
Labour nominated two women and six men, including Mr Darling.
Sir Menzies and Sir Malcolm are among the seven Lib Dem MPs who were nominated by their party.
Former Lib Dem ministers Vince Cable and Danny Alexander, who both lost their seats at the general election, are thought to have turned down the chance to enter the Lords.
