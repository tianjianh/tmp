Snowverkill? How the Brits and Americans react to snow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As people begin to question if the Storm Juno weather forecasts were exaggerated a bit, we take a look at the way snow is seen on either side of the Atlantic.

Whenever it snows in the UK, it seems everyone goes into meltdown (pardon the pun).
Roads, rail, airports and schools are often severely affected during cold snaps, even though other countries with historically higher snowfall manage to keep things moving.
And while there is a serious side to the effects of snowfall on vulnerable people such as the elderly and on drivers, it often feels as if just one or two inches of the white stuff is enough to cause widespread panic among us stoic Brits.
When a snowstorm was forecast in January 2013, the Daily Telegraph reported that people were stockpiling food in case they became snowed in.
According to the newspaper, "supermarkets reported a frenzy as people stampeded along the aisles, filling their trolleys with bread, milk, vegetables and other essentials, leaving stores 'virtually empty'".
It certainly seems to have a strange effect on some of us.
In 2010, a woman who dialled 999 to report the theft of a snowman from outside her home was branded "completely irresponsible" by Kent Police.
The force said the woman, from Chatham, needed them because she used pound coins for eyes and teaspoons for arms.
The same year, the government commissioned a review of how transport was faring during that year's snowy winter, as gritters struggled to cope with the demand.
And while many in the UK get excited by the prospect of some white flakes, it's true that many people hate the stuff.
With our weather more unpredictable than in many countries, we don't always prepare enough to cope with the cold, particularly if the preceding one or two winters have been mild.
The UK gets on average 33 days of snowfall or sleet a year. Most of this falls on higher ground, according to the Met Office.
Anything around 20cm (8in) is considered to be severe in the UK and is not common, although larger snow drifts are not unusual in parts of Scotland.
Four inches is often described as "heavy snowfall".
Stateside, it's a very different story - they're used to harsher winters and are well-equipped to handle it.
In New York City, rubbish trucks are fitted with snowplough attachments and the streets are swept regularly.
Some places, such as Detroit and Cleveland, get an average of more than 1.01m (40in) of snow every winter.
Snow tyres are commonplace in the US and some areas enforce a snow policy.
In Boston, for example, landlords are responsible for digging out their residents' driveways and you can be fined if you don't.
But weather forecasting isn't an exact science and even in the US, the temptation for exaggeration where snow is concerned is never far away.
Phrases such as 'snowmaggedon' and 'snowcopalypse' have become commonplace, while the hashtag 'snOMG' first began trending in the winter of 2009/2010.
Meteorologists have downgraded their predictions of Winter Storm Juno, having initially predicted up to 90cm (36in) of snow.
And blizzard warnings have now been lifted in New York City and New Jersey.
Up to 60cm (24in) is still expected in places across New York state, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
Weather forecasters may be left red-faced if the storm isn't as fierce as predicted in those areas, too.
But while we may moan and groan when the chill factor sets in, spare a thought for the residents of Sukayu Onsen in Japan, one of the snowiest habitable places on earth, with an average yearly snowfall of 17.6m (58ft).
Now that takes some shovelling.
