An England football fan has been jailed for 10 years for pushing a man on to live Tube tracks shortly before a train arrived.

Christopher Cole told the Old Bailey he pushed Polish builder David Pietraskzek at Bond Street Station because he was angry at Russian fans' behaviour during Euro 2016.
The victim managed to leap out of the way seconds before the oncoming train.
Cole, 32, admitted attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
The court heard Cole had got drunk and picked an argument with Mr Pietraskzek, 21, on a Central Line train after mistaking him as Russian on June 9, last year.
He pushed him on to the tracks 34 seconds before the next train was due.
The victim was taken to hospital suffering from a fractured finger, cuts and serious bruises on his back which at first were thought to be burns.
Senior investigating officer Det Chief Insp Paul Langley said: "There is absolutely no reason why Cole unleashed such an attack against his victim, which could have easily killed him."
Prosecutor Deanna Heer said: "What saved him was his footwear because he had rubber soles.
"Mr Pietraskzek says he landed on the rail, felt electricity coming through his body -  he could hear a train approaching.
"He had the presence of mind to get back on the platform as quickly as possible."
Cole ran off after the incident but was arrested in July.
He said he was annoyed at Mr Pietraskzek's attitude, acting as if he "owned the Tube".
In mitigation, Peter Spary disputed the prosecution claim the attack was racially motivated and said Cole attacked Mr Pietraskzek because his "manhood was dented".
