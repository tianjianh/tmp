Tony Pulis said his squad also had "one or two niggles" which would be monitored in the build-up to the game.
Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere faces a fitness test on an ankle problem.
Captain Simon Francis will miss out with a hamstring injury, while goalkeeper Adam Federici and striker Callum Wilson are longer-term absentees with knee injuries.
Jonathan Pearce: "Tony Pulis cut his teeth as a manager at Bournemouth. He signed Eddie Howe. Now the Cherries boss needs to learn valuable lessons from his old mentor in how to handle a team sinking in the top flight and refloat them.
"Pulis has made a career of keeping Premier League clubs up from troubled positions through sheer organisation.
"I'm not saying Eddie doesn't have those qualities. He does. But this is the first time his team looks in real trouble at this level. He needs to pull defenders with fine individual spirit into a more cohesive unit.
"They need to be tighter here. I expect them to be so."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "Bournemouth are in a reasonable position. They'll want to get a few results to be safe but I think they will be okay.
"For the previous two seasons [our] home form wasn't as good as we wanted. We've turned it round and scored plenty of goals.
"There are few things better than winning games and scoring goals in front of your home fans. We've done that and that's nice."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "You can't hide from the current form and it's up to us to bounce back and show what we can do.
"West Brom have ground out some great results and they've added real quality. Tony's teams are always hard to beat."
Bournemouth are on a slippery slope, without a league win this year.
I don't see it happening at The Hawthorns either. West Brom lost on the south coast in September, but I am backing them to get the points here.
