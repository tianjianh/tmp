Migrant crisis: EU Strasbourg parliament 'could be' shelter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The European Parliament's huge futuristic building in Strasbourg should be used to shelter migrants, a Green Party leader has suggested.

Philippe Lamberts said MEPs could move from the French city to their other building in Brussels, Belgium.
His suggestion came as new proposals to redistribute 160,000 migrants were announced.
An influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees has sparked a crisis in the 28-nation EU.
"This parliament where we are gathered today, well we use it only 50 days of the year," Mr Lamberts said as lawmakers debated an address by European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker.
"For the other 300 days, the 750 MEP offices, all heated, all with their own shower cubicle, remain empty and useless.
"We propose that this... perfectly equipped building be used as a temporary home for the migrants and refugees while we do our work in Brussels."
Migrants have been pouring into western EU countries, particularly Austria and Germany, where they are being cared for in registration centres. But officials say they are struggling to cope with the numbers.
The Green Party has been a fierce critic of the European Parliament's monthly move between Brussels and Strasbourg, branding it expensive and damaging to the environment.
The city stands on the Rhine facing Germany, and France insists it is a symbol of post-war unity and friendship.
Strasbourg hotels, restaurants and other services also benefit from the regular visits by MEPs, parliament staff, journalists and lobbyists.
The Strasbourg parliament building was inaugurated in 1999 by then French President Jacques Chirac.
In 2008, part of the ceiling in the plenary chamber collapsed. Fortunately, the room was empty at the time and no-one was hurt.
