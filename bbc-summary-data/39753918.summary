[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 4-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Dagnall hit his first hat-trick in seven years as Crewe drew the curtain on a disappointing League Two campaign by beating Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex top scorer Dagnall took his tally for the season to 14, of which 12 have come in his last 14 games, as Crewe, relegated a year ago, finished 17th, two points adrift of Barnet, who signed off in 15th.
Dagnall gave Crewe the lead in the eighth minute when, after taking down Ryan Wintle's ball, his shot crept under keeper Josh Vickers.
Barnet's Michael Nelson was denied by a reflex stop at a corner from Crewe keeper Ben Garratt, who also kept out Jamal Campbell-Ryce's free-kick.
But, at the other end, Vickers was powerless to prevent Dagnall's low drive hitting the bottom corner to double Crewe's lead in the 25th minute.
Barnet's Curtis Weston reduced the arrears when his 64th-minute shot found the top corner.
But Dagnall was not to be denied and he restored the two-goal advantage when turning in Zoumana Bakayogo's cross from close range, before George Cooper latched onto Garratt's long kick to tuck home the fourth.
Dagnall's last treble was in his days at Rochdale, in a 4-1 home win over Grimsby Town in March 2010.
