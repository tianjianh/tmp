Hester rode the 15-year-old stallion at the 2012 Olympics in London as Great Britain won gold in the team event.
Uthopia was bought at auction in May after the row, but has since been purchased on Hester's behalf by an anonymous supporter after negotiations.
"It's been a stressful time but I must thank the parties concerned in getting to this outcome," he said.

"Those involved wish to remain anonymous, and I hope that everyone can respect that, but they have my extreme gratitude.
"I must also thank all the supporters of British dressage for their good wishes and encouragement - it's meant a lot to me and my team."
Team GB's dressage squad for August's Games in Rio has not yet been confirmed, but Hester is one of 12 riders to be nominated for a place by the British Equestrian Federation.
