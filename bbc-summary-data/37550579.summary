Banks gets bold: How the sultry pop star learned to stand up for herself

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anyone who's ever watched a rock biopic knows the music industry can be a strange and intimidating place, even for the strongest of personalities.

So imagine what it's been like for Banks, a performer who used to suffer such severe stage fright she would sing with her back turned to the audience.
The Californian musician, whose full name is Jillian Banks, first came to attention in 2013 with her London EP - a collection of brooding, vulnerable R&B that earned her a spot on the BBC's Sound of 2014 list.
Her debut album, Goddess, reached the top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic, but the star quickly found fame stressful and frustrating.
"I had to learn how to talk to people and tell them what I wanted," she says, "But I felt people weren't listening. I felt really helpless sometimes."
Things came to a head when she took her music on the road.
"The first tour I went on, the guitarist slammed a door in my face. That would never happen now. If somebody treated me like that, they'd be out five minutes later."
The singer's metamorphosis from wallflower to self-professed "bad mother" is documented on her new album, The Altar.
"Do you see me now?" she demands on Mind Games, while on Weaker Girl, she chastises a lover who can't handle "the way I grew strong".
"You have to have that mentality in order to survive," she says. "Not only in this business, in life. You can't be like a feather blowing in every direction the wind takes you."
On the phone from Paris, she explains The Altar's backstory and why she keeps a replica of her severed head in a box.
Good afternoon, Banks. How is Paris?
I love it. I wish I could see more of it today.
Is there a country you've fallen in love with while you've been on tour?
I love Switzerland. I played the Montreux Jazz Festival and that was one of my favourite places.
But also - I don't know if this sounds funny - but when I saw more of America, I realised how different every city was. I always had this idea that Europe would be more exciting to me, which it was, but places like Boston and Seattle and Houston were just as exciting.
The Altar is out this week. Is it nerve-wracking to find out what fans think?
Yeah, it is. I feel different about it every 20 minutes.
It feels like a much more confident record. Did you feel emboldened by the success of your debut album?
No! I think I'm very introverted, first of all, so this business was very overwhelming. I was nervous to be around so many different people.
I mean, I don't think anybody knows how to tell 50 people on a video set that they want to make changes, especially when they're young.  But I felt, for the first time, like people weren't giving me the respect that I deserved.
And when I went into this album, I was feeling the after-effects of that frustration. I had this need to feel empowered. I needed to let go of that person who was afraid to say what she wanted.
The videos for this album have certainly been uncompromising. In F With Myself, you're abusing a mannequin that's been made in your likeness.
That was the most fun I've ever had on a video set! It represented exactly what that song means to me. I can be my own biggest bully - like, I'm chronically unsatisfied - but I've had to learn, especially over the last two years, to be my own biggest ally.
Deciding I wanted to make a prosthetic form of myself and interact with it, it took confidence to say that out loud, even.
It's one of those ideas that, I assume, sounded really good on paper - but turned out to be quite bizarre in real life.
It was weird! You only ever see a mirror image of yourself, so it was strange to see myself in 3D. But it was kind of therapeutic - especially hitting my own face, because it made me want to be really nice to myself. It was like seeing physically what I do to myself mentally sometimes.
What have you done with the head now?
I have it still. It smells weird because we lit it on fire, so I keep it in a box. But it's still mine!
You should get it out at Halloween and scare some trick or treaters to death.
Oh God! That's such a good idea. My mum hated that video, because she hated  seeing me slap my face around. But that means it's good, if your mum doesn't like something.
What about you? How do you feel about the songs now they're finished? Are they hard to listen to objectively?
Yeah, because it's like reading your own diary entries from the past: Nobody does that.
When I'm thinking about a concept for a video, I love going on long walks and listening to the song on a loop. But I would never normally go on a walk and, just for fun, listen to a song like To The Hilt.
To The Hilt is especially raw, though. In the lyrics, you describe how breaking up with your muse left you "drained creatively". Was it hard to record?
It was hard to write, but I'm happy I did and I felt deeply relieved that I got it out of my system.
The vocal is very unguarded.
I recorded it with  (British producer) SOHN and I did it twice all the way through, then I told him I wouldn't do it any more. So I think it's the first or second take. It was super draining.
You've spoken quite openly about how you suffered from depression while making this album. How did it affect your writing?
I've struggled with depression since I was younger. It's just how I was wired - but it's not all the time. It usually hits me right before I give birth to something new.
On this occasion, it was letting go and becoming this new version of myself. It's like the universe's way of pulling you backwards almost, and you have to fight to move forward.
Like emerging from a cocoon?
That's exactly what it is. The two years before I made this album, I felt the weight of learning to accept myself as a woman and an adult in this strange society that sometimes makes women feel less powerful than they should.
And I don't just write when I'm sad, by the way. Lovesick is a song about falling in love really hard, and it's very uplifting. And This Is Not About Us is a really empowering song.
You're part of a wave of female artists - from Beyonce and Grimes to Tove Lo - who are unapologetic about the strength they derive from their femininity. Do you talk to other artists about that?
I actually just emailed Feist because we have a mutual friend who thought we would get along. And I met Tove Lo at a festival in Toronto. She was standing side stage, singing all my lyrics. I just thought that was so cool, because for women to support each other and not feel competitive is so important. I already was a fan of her music and everything she stands for. It made me love her 10 times more.
I heard you wrote the verses to Trainwreck when you were 14. Most people would cringe at their teenage poetryâ€¦
It's funny. I actually recently found this old computer of mine that I had when I was young. It had this weird app on it where I could videotape myself, and I listened back to some of the songs and I was like, "Some of these melodies are really good. I want to mess with them more."
The Altar is out now on Virgin EMI / Harvest Records.
