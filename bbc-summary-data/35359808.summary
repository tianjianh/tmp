The total of £39m spent was up on the £34.4m spent in 2010 - but was still down on the record £42m spent in 2005.
The Lib Dems spent £3.5m, the UK Independence Party £2.8m, the Scottish National Party £1.5m and Greens £1.1m.
The UK Independence Party spent the least per vote gained - the Scottish National Party spent least per MP won.
In the 2015 general election the Conservatives had 331 MPs elected, Labour 232, the SNP 56, and the Lib Dems 8.
UKIP had one MP elected despite winning 12.6% of all votes cast. The Greens had one MP elected and won 3.7% of votes.
