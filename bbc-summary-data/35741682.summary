The Football Association is open to trialling video technology in England games, says FA chief Martin Glenn.

Live experiments with video assistant referees are set to begin by the 2017-18 season after being voted in by the game's law maker, the International Football Association Board (IFAB).
"We will definitely offer it," said Glenn, when asked whether England games could be a testing ground.
England and Scotland are among 13 countries offering to help testing.
"It would be a Uefa decision," added Glenn. "The whole point of doing it is to avoid there being bad decisions made, so it would have to be at the top end because only at the top end will you have camera systems to make it work.
"The limiting factor is it can only work properly if there are a lot of cameras."
Glenn added that he would also like to trial the technology in FA Cup ties but has already raised the issue of cost and feasibility with IFAB.
