Rory McAllister reacted quickly to fire in Jamie Stevenson's corner and give Peterhead a first-half advantage.
The visitors went down to 10 men when Michael McMullin's booking for simulation - his second caution - was followed by a red card.
Martyn Fotheringham levelled with a 30-yard shot and Michael Travis headed Forfar's winner on the night.
The two sides will meet again at Balmoor on Saturday.
