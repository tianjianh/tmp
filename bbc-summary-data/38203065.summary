Arjen Robben put the home side ahead when he cut inside from the right channel to curl into the far corner.
Robert Lewandowski tapped in when Arturo Vidal's deflected shot fell to his feet inside the six-yard box, adding the third when he diverted Muller's long-range shot past away keeper Diego Benaglio.
The victory was sealed when Germany forward Muller scored his first Bundesliga goal of the season before substitute Douglas Costa rifled in a cutback for the fifth.
"Of course I'm delighted for Thomas. But he does a good job on the pitch even when he doesn't score," said Bayern manager Carlo Ancelotti.
Bayern, aiming for a fifth successive Bundesliga title, started the weekend three points adrift of surprise leaders RB Leipzig.
But Ancelotti's team moved back to the summit after the leaders, who lost 1-0 at bottom club Ingolstadt, suffered their first top-flight defeat.
Lewandowski scored five goals in nine minutes after coming on as a substitute during the same fixture last season - and the Poland striker again helped put five past the visitors.
Wolfsburg reached the Champions League quarter-finals last season, but look a shadow of the side who remain the last to beat Spanish giants Real Madrid, back in April.
The Wolves stay fourth bottom with 10 points from 14 matches, now level on points with third-bottom Hamburg after they won 1-0 against Augsburg.
Darmstadt replaced Ingolstadt at the bottom of the table after losing 1-0 at Freiburg, who moved up to eighth.
Sixth-placed Borussia Dortmund's erratic Bundesliga form continued as a late goal from Marco Reus, who scored an equaliser at Real Madrid in midweek, nicked a 1-1 draw at Cologne.
Third-placed Hertha Berlin are six points behind the top two after they lost 1-0 to Werder Bremen, who earned their first away win of the season.
