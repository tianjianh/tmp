Eight more men have been arrested over an attack on a football supporter that may have left him with brain damage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cambridge United fan Simon Dobbin, 42, from Mildenhall, Suffolk, was knocked unconscious outside a pub in Southend, Essex, in March.
He is now conscious, but "looking at the possibility of having to live with a permanent brain injury", police said.
The latest arrests, of men from Essex and London, bring the total number in the case to 17.
The newly-arrested men are two 23-year-olds, from Rochford and Lewisham; two from Westcliff, aged 27 and 30; two 19-year-olds from Basildon and Wickford; a 29-year-old from Leigh; and a 22-year-old from Southend.
They were arrested on suspicion of assault and violent disorder and remain in custody. All of those previously arrested remain on police bail.
Mr Dobbin had been on his way home from the Southend United v Cambridge United match on 21 March when he was attacked outside The Railway pub in East Street.
He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he was put into a medically-induced coma.
Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore, leading the investigation, said: "It will take time to piece together the actions of all those involved but my team and I are determined to bring those responsible for this sickening attack to justice.
"I want to make it clear that Mr Dobbin was an entirely innocent person enjoying a day out watching a football match.
"He was not involved in any earlier quarrels or incidents, and it could have been anyone's loved one attacked on the day and now looking at the possibility of having to live with a permanent brain injury."
He asked anyone who knew what happened to contact police directly or through Crimestoppers.
