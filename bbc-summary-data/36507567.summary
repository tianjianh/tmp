Gary MacDonald Graham, 57, from Borras, Wrexham, had been walking on the A534 at Llan-y-Pwll link road when he was hit in the early hours of Friday.
A lorry driver from Lancashire has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision.
The 57-year-old has been released on police bail pending further inquiries.
Supt Steve Williams said: "The family are aware of these developments and will continue to be supported by specially trained police officers."
He thanked the public for helping with the investigation and appealed for anyone with further information to contact police.
Mr Graham was a former member of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards who fought at the battle of Tumbledown during the Falklands War.
Police said he had been walking between Holt Road roundabout and Wrexham Industrial Estate roundabout near to Wrexham Golf Club just after midnight on Friday when he was hit.
