Hawks used to deter seagulls from Swansea Market

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Specially trained hawks will be deployed to Swansea Market to keep seagulls away from its new roof.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea council said gulls nesting and scavenging on the roof had caused problems with droppings, damage and blocked guttering.
The council has hired a firm which has successfully addressed similar problems across the UK.
It added the project was "not about harming the gulls" but to keep them away.
Robert Francis-Davies, cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said: "It's crucial we continue to do all we can to preserve the attraction.
"It's about using highly-trained hawks to act as a deterrent."
The project is supported by European and Welsh government grants.
