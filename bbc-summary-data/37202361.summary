[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 1-0 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Sercombe scored the winner in the 88th minute as Oxford overcame Rochdale at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Just moments after Peter Vincenti had shot wide for Dale from a great position, new signing Marvin Johnson's cross was converted by midfielder Sercombe.
It was cruel on Dale, who are still looking for their first league win of the season.
The visitors had a great chance to open the scoring after just four minutes. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing's left-wing cross picked out Andy Cannon, but he fired over from six yards.
Oxford duo Kane Hemmings and Wes Thomas were both denied by goalkeeper Conrad Logan, and at half-time deadline-day signing Johnson replaced Hemmings.
Johnson was unlucky not to score with a back-header, and Thomas also went close for the hosts.
It proved to be a frustrating afternoon for Rochdale as Oxford goalkeeper Simon Eastwood parried a firece Mendez-Laing strike and Niall Canavan flicked an effort against the crossbar from a corner.
