The 50m (150ft) pylons would run from Carlisle to Heysham, Lancashire, to connect a new Â£10bn nuclear power plant at Moorside, Sellafield, to the grid.
Power Without Pylons and Friends of the Lake District say the National Grid is "ignoring" demands for the cables to go underground in "sensitive landscapes".
The National Grid said it "fully recognises the importance" of the area.
The campaign walk is taking place from Black Combe where the pylons will be visible, down to the National Park's costal boundary and across the mouth of Duddon.
Graham Pitts, chairman of Power Without Pylons, said: "This is a very serious decision. These pylons are going to be up for the rest of this century.
"I don't think people appreciate two things - one, how stunning the view is around here, and two, how much these pylons are going to affect it by their sheer size."
The Lake District is being put forward as the UK's next nomination for World Heritage status.
A National Grid spokesman said: "We have not yet made a final decision on how and where the new connection will be built.
"When building connections for generators, we strive to avoid designated landscapes. Where this is not possible, we work closely with stakeholders and communities and carry out consultations to develop a proposal which achieves the best possible balance between protecting the environment and ensuring everyone has an affordable electricity supply."
A formal consultation is expected to take place later in the year, with the final plans submitted to the planning inspectorate in 2017.
