Greig Laidlaw hopes to hold on to a starting slot after making his British and Irish Lions debut in the 13-7 win over Provincial Barbarians.

The Scottish scrum-half pulled on the famous jersey for the first match of the 2017 tour, emulating his uncle Roy, who played on the 1983 tour.
With the Blues up next on Wednesday, Laidlaw is keen for another run out.
"Now I have got the taste of it I want to get out there again," the 31-year-old Scot told the Lions' website.
"I am absolutely delighted and very honoured to have worn the jersey. Next time I get an opportunity I want to get out there and play again."
Anthony Watson's second-half try proved crucial in Whangarei as Warren Gatland's side survived a scare to win what was expected to be their most straightforward encounter of the 10-match tour.
Laidlaw, who kicked a crucial penalty, was just happy to get a victory.
"It was key to win and we left a fair few opportunities out there," he said. "I think it was four times that we were held up over the line.
"There was a big defensive effort in the second half, which was pleasing as well.
"It was tough, they played well. They were massively motivated and it was a World Cup final for them, wasn't it?
"We would be a lot more worried if we weren't creating opportunities, but we created a lot.
"Yes we were a bit rusty, of course we were, but I come back to the opportunities we created. On a different day we take them and the scoreline is a bit different. We have won the game so we are happy with that."
Laidlaw, who has made 58 appearances for Scotland, is confident the Lions will look a better outfit in the meeting with the Blues at Eden Park.
"Time together in the saddle will be very important now in training, putting together combinations and the team that goes out together on Wednesday, that is the next task in hand," he added.
"We need to make sure we go and win that now, we are off and running, one out of one so we are delighted with that.
"There were a lot of positive things from Gats (Gatland), he was delighted with the win and just wants to keep pressing on now, keep getting better day in, day out, and making sure next time we take the field we are a bit better so we can go on and win more games."
