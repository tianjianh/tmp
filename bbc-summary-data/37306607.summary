Segeyaro has scored five tries in seven games for Leeds since signing for the club in June as part of a deal which saw Zak Hardaker move the other way.
The 25-year-old started his career with North Queensland Cowboys, before moving to Penrith in 2013.
Leeds are top of the Qualifiers table, having won all four of their games.
