Labour's deputy leader Harriett Harman: "People know that the Lib Dems are every bit as much to blame as the Tories. They have backed the Tories every step of the way while people's living standards have fallen and the NHS has been going backwards. People know that the Lib Dems' manifesto can't be trusted. They broke the key promises in their last manifesto and are repeating them once again."
Chancellor George Osborne: "A vote for any of the alternatives to the Conservatives is a vote for that Ed Miliband government and their economic chaos. So I say let's stick with David Cameron's strong leadership and the plan that's working."
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett: "The Lib Dems have published an unambitious, business-as-usual manifesto that people won't trust them on anyway."
SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie: "Having effectively ripped up their 2010 manifesto when they entered coalition with the Tories, people no longer believe a word the Lib Dems say. We already know the reality of the Lib Dems. After five years propping up the toxic Tories, all Nick Clegg and his party have to show is a trail of broken promises."
