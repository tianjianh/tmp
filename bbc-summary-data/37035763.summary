The pair are Team GB's number one mixed doubles pairing and benefit from their on-and-off-the-court relationship.
"When people are missing their other halves when we're away for a long period of time, we're together," explains Chris. "That gives us a massive strength - it's something we gain from compared to a lot of other pairs in the world."
Mike also gets some playing tips from Gabby and Chris - and some of their off-the-court secrets.
