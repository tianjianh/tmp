[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey residents asked to identify land for building

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey's Environment Department has invited islanders to identify the parcels of land that could be suitable for development.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "call for sites" forms part of the second stage of a comprehensive review of the island's planning strategy.
The department has stressed that no guarantees will be given as to where development can take place, but it wants to assess the potential.
Islanders have until 17:00 BST on 13 September to submit applications.
The information will help form the Strategic Land Use Plan.
Two main areas have already been deemed suitable for development in Guernsey.
These are St Peter Port and St Sampson/Vale, which have already been extensively developed.
There are 10 further areas which are under consideration as "local centres", where development will be encouraged in order to provide housing and employment opportunities.
Only submissions relating to these areas will be considered.
Details of successful and unsuccessful submissions will be published in the final review, meaning there will be no confidentiality other than in respect of contact details.
Information about the consultation and the submission form required have been made available on the department's section of the States website.
