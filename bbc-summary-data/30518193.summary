Plans for Westbridge Park, in Stone, include a six-lane swimming pool and play area.
The proposals, which would still require planning permission, also feature a new sports hall and artificial football pitch at nearby Alleyne's Academy.
It is expected to be partly funded through a new M&S food store.
Stafford Borough Council said the store would also require planning permission, but it had been earmarked on land already developed within the park.
Council Leader Mike Heenan said: "These plans deliver the best leisure facilities for Stone whilst retaining valuable green space on Westbridge Park."
Previous proposals for the site, which included a larger supermarket in 2012, were met with strong opposition, including a 1,200-name petition.
Local councillor Jill Hood, part of the Keep Westbridge Park Green campaign, said the group was "over the moon" that the town would keep its park.
