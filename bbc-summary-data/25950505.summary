The offices are used by journalists working mainly for the firm's local newspapers - Glamorgan Gazette, Merthyr Express, Pontypridd Observer, Rhondda Leader and Cynon Valley Leader.
None of the papers are closing.
Staff will now work from the head office in Cardiff or from home, but five administrative and advertising jobs are being cut.
In a statement, Media Wales which also publishes the Western Mail, South Wales Echo and Wales on Sunday, said "There will be no editorial redundancies as a result of this announcement.
"Additionally, it is hoped that Media Wales will be able to secure agreement with prominent businesses in the three town centres, whereby journalists are given access to their premises to hold surgeries in the towns on a regular basis.
"There will be a reduction in head count of approximately five advertising management and administrative roles and the company has entered into a period of consultation with all affected staff."
Martin Shipton, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) at Media Wales, said: "Obviously we are pleased that no editorial jobs are being lost and we are anxious to ensure that coverage of local news continues to the same degree as in the past."
Last week, Media Wales' owner Trinity Mirror announced that the Daily Post newspaper was no longer being sold outside north Wales.
