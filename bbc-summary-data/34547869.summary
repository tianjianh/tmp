Manmohan Singh: Reprieve for India ex-PM in coal scandal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A special court in India has rejected a petition to summon former prime minister Manmohan Singh over a coal mining scandal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The court ruled that Mr Singh would not be made an accused in the case.
In 2012, federal auditors said India had lost $33bn (Â£20bn) because coalfield rights were sold off cheaply.
Mr Singh, who also held the coal portfolio, has always maintained that he was innocent and "open for legal scrutiny".
The petition was filed by former chief minister of Jharkhand state Madhu Koda, who is also an accused in the case.
Mr Koda had asked the court to summon Mr Singh, 82, since the former prime minister also headed the coal ministry.
In April, India's Supreme Court had suspended a summons issued to Mr Singh to appear in the trial court.
Known as one of India's cleanest politicians, the former prime minister has not been charged with any crime but is being investigated for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and corruption-related offences.
Last September, the Supreme Court cancelled almost all of the more than 200 coal mining licences awarded by the government since 1993, saying they were illegal. Mr Singh's Congress party was in charge when most of the licences were allocated.
The ruling BJP government has begun a process of re-auctioning the coal licences and says it hopes to recover the true value of the coal reserves.
