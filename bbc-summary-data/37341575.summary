The 29-year-old Australian agreed a move to Super Rugby club Queensland Reds in the summer, with the hope of furthering his international career.
Now that the Reds' season has finished, Houston is to return to The Rec.
"He's a fantastic character and a brilliant player. We know he'll settle straight back in," director of rugby Todd Blackadder told the club website.
