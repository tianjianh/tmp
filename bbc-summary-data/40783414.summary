Hearts have sold Bjorn Johnsen to Dutch top-rlight club ADO Den Haag for an undisclosed transfer fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old American born striker made 37 appearances and scored seven goals during his 12 months at Tynecastle.
Johnsen also made his first international appearance for Norway while a Hearts player.
The Edinburgh club has strengthened up front, signing Kyle Lafferty during this transfer window.
Johnsen was brought to Hearts by former head coach Robbie Neilson after leaving Bulgarian club Litex Lovech.
And Neilson's successor, Ian Cathro, had to deny reports of an argument with the striker at half-time during a game against St Johnstone in May.
Den Haag, managed by Alfons Groenendijk, the former Manchester City midfielder and former Ajax assistant, finished 11th in the Eredivisie last season.
