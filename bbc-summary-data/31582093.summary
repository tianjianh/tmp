Oscars 2015: The talking points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A four-hour ceremony with THAT many big names in one room is always going to get people talking.

And the 2015 Oscars didn't disappoint.
Best picture winner Birdman and Grand Budapest Hotel tied with four wins each, followed by Whiplash with three.
Eddie Redmayne won best actor for his role in The Theory of Everything, while Still Alice star Julianne Moore won best actress. But with more than two million tweets using #Oscars2015, the winners weren't the only talking point.
After winning best supporting actress, Boyhood's Patricia Arquette said: "To every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation.
"We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all.
"And equal rights for women in the United States of America."
The speech delighted Meryl Streep, who shouted "Yes! Yes!" from the audience.
In her similar vein, #askhermore trended during the evening.
The hashtag was used to encourage reporters to ask female stars more than "what are you wearing?" on the red carpet.
Reese Witherspoon was among the 320,000 people to use the phrase on social media.
Although thousands of kids, and big kids alike, were shocked that The Lego Movie wasn't nominated for best animated picture, it was won by Big Hero 6, the film was nominated for best original song.
That meant the artists involved, Tegan and Sara and comedy trio The Lonely Island, got to perform it.
It was GOOD. Think YMCA with too many e-numbers.
It involved animation, men dressed as builders cowboys and superheroes, and Oprah getting a Lego Oscar.
But the performance wasn't enough for the song to take the best original song award away from Selma's Glory by John Legend and Common.
Other performances on the night included Rita Ora's Grateful from Beyond the night, Maroon 5 playing Lost Stars from Begin Again and Tim McGraw singing I'm Not Gonna Miss You from Glen Campbellâ€¦ I'll Be Me.
The ceremony also marked The Sound of Music - which won five Oscars including best picture in 1966 - celebrating its 50th anniversary.
Enter Lady Gaga singing The Hills Are Alive.
Star of the original film Julie Andrews then arrived on stage to a lot of excitement from the audience - especially from Felicity Jones, Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lopez.
Safe to say the performance went down pretty well.
It was the How I Met Your Mother star's first go in charge of the awards, taking over from Ellen DeGeneres.
He tried a few magic tricks but despite his opening song and dance number, he didn't seem to be able to recreate the popularity of Ellen's hosting.
During the ceremony BBC entertainment correspondent Tim Masters said: "He doesn't seem to have found his groove. A live telecast is hard thing to hold together."
It's especially difficult when you're in your pants.
In a spoof of Birdman and Whiplash, the host performed a skit where he is locked out of his dressing room and is forced to walk on stage in his Y-fronts, accompanied by Whiplash star Miles Teller on the drums.
This section of the evening remembers the names from the film industry who passed away in the last 12 months.
The Robin Williams tribute generally went down well but many on Twitter, including John Barrowman questioned why Joan Rivers didn't appear on the list.
A year after getting Idina Menzel's name completely wrong, Travolta took the stage again with the Frozen star. He got it right this time.
But he also touched her face a bit too much for some peoples' liking.
The Grease star also had a hug on the red carpet with Scarlett Johansson.
That's fine but the strange stomach rub thing that followed was a bit odd.
And finally, he might have missed out on best actor but Benedict taking a big swig on camera made sure he got some social media attention.
