Kris Leonard, River Reeves, and Jack Dakin - all aged 20 - Tomas Lowe, 27, and their manager Craig Tarry, 33, died outside Stockholm on 13 February.
Warrington Council is raising funds for a lasting memorial in the town.
Mayor Geoff Settle said he hopes families and friends can "seek solace" through a tribute to "five young men who were set to take on the world".
"Warrington lost a talented young band on the verge of something special and a group of young people with their whole lives ahead of them.
"We remain deeply saddened and shocked at what happened and our thoughts are with families and friends in Warrington and beyond," he said.
A concert to be staged at Parr Hall on 2 April in memory of the band has sold out.
