The men, aged in their 30s and 40s, collapsed in Rochdale between 15:50 and 17:50 BST on Tuesday, police said.
It is thought the man in the most serious condition took a substance known as Clockwork Orange.
It follows eight incidents in the town on Friday and Saturday in which men fell ill after taking the highs.
Police said the latest casualties had taken a variety of substances including Clockwork Orange, Pandora's Box, and Kronic.
Det Insp Lee Hopwood, of Greater Manchester Police, said the force had issued warnings about the dangers of legal highs over the past few days.
"I cannot stress enough how dangerous they are and even though they might not be illegal, please do not take the risk," he said.
