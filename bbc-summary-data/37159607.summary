The man, dressed as a priest, stormed the stage of the Rose of Tralee International Festival in County Kerry on Monday night.
He held up a placard and shouted: "Fathers for justice!"
Television cameras cut away from the stage while the protester was removed by security.
The Rose of Tralee International Festival is a week-long pageant in which women of Irish descent from around the world vie to be named the Rose of Tralee.
The festival's organisers confirmed the man had purchased a ticket and was removed by Irish police after being taken from the stage.
They were satisfied adequate security measures were in place, they said in a statement.
The man took to the stage while the Cavan Rose, Lisa Reilly, was speaking to presenter Dáithí Ó Sé.
Irish Independent journalist Andrea Smith described the stage invasion as "very shocking".
"It was like something out of Father Ted, as suddenly a man dressed as a priest runs onto the stage, nobody knows what to do and he's shouting about Fathers 4 Justice," Ms Smith, who was live-blogging the event, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
"It probably gave the organisers such a fright, but it's also probably the most exciting thing that's ever happened in the history of the Rose of Tralee," she said.
It is understood the man was Matt O'Connor, a founder of Fathers 4 Justice, who is originally from County Kerry but now lives in England.
The group are best known for a series of high-profile stunts.
In 2004, a campaigner dressed as Batman held a protest on a balcony of Buckingham Palace.
Earlier that same year, two men threw packages of flour dyed purple at the then prime minister Tony Blair.
