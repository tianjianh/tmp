[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh language 'not part of Cardiff's social fabric'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh language is not part of Cardiff's "social fabric", according to the city's council leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Bale made the claim in a letter to the Welsh Language Society - Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg - about Cardiff's Local Development Plan (LDP).
Calling the comment "completely ignorant", the group said Welsh was "vital" to the city's social fabric.
The council said "technical" wording concerning planning guidance in the letter had been taken out of context.
Mr Bale survived a leadership challenge at the annual general meeting of Cardiff's Labour group in May.
He wrote in the letter: "On the basis of the evidence presented, this response comes to the conclusion that the use of the Welsh language is not part of the social fabric [of the city], in accordance with national guidelines.
"This means that it is not considered that development proposals which are noted in the Plan materially affect the linguistic balance communities across Cardiff, at the expense of the use of the language.
"As a result, I understand it is not considered that any specific policies are necessary in the plan to deal with the specific interests of the Welsh language."
Local Cymdeithas yr Iaith chair Carl Morris criticised the comment, in a letter to the Planning Inspectorate.
"It must be said that this claim is daft and completely ignorant, and obviously raises questions which need to be answered in terms of the attitude and the policy of the authority and its officers," he said.
"We are not of the view that the remark reflects the support of the present leader of the Council for the language, but rather the ignorance of officers in the planning department.
"We ask you to insist that the County, in its development plan, considers the Welsh language in terms of its status, requirements in terms of new schools and education provision, and its place in our communities."
A Cardiff council spokesman said the LDP was currently being considered by the Welsh government's planning inspector.
The spokesman said: "The wording that is quoted by the Welsh Language Society is technical language taken from a national planning guidance document.
"Unfortunately, the wording has been used selectively in this instance, as it fails to show the full context on how the wording was used in this planning document."
The spokesman added that is was "disappointing" that the issue had been raised so late, and "ample opportunity" had been been given for everyone to comment through the consultation process.
