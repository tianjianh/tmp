Tom Allin: Cricketer took his life in bridge fall, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former county cricketer took his own life in a fall from a bridge, a coroner has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Allin, who was 28 and a former Warwickshire fast bowler, died months after suffering serious leg injuries in a car crash, the inquest heard.
His body was found below the A39 River Torridge Bridge in Bideford, Devon, on 4 January.
Devon and Cornwall Police later found three suicide notes at his home written to family and friends.
More on the inquest, plus more Devon and Cornwall news.
The inquest at North Devon Civic Centre was told passing motorists, including an off-duty nurse, alerted the emergency services and tried in vain to give first aid to Mr Allin.
His parents, Tony and Beverley Allin, said their son had been through "several tough months" leading up to his death, starting in early October when his brother was seriously ill.
The court heard that in late October Tom Allin was in a road accident near Clovelly, Devon, and had to be cut from his car.
He had surgery and was "recovering well physically" but by early December he told a nurse his mood was "up and down" and was advised to seek help.
A police investigation did not find any suspicious circumstances or any third party involvement in Mr Allin's death.
A post-mortem examination found that Mr Allin died from "devastating non-survivable injuries". No drugs or alcohol were found in his body.
Dr Elizabeth Earland, senior coroner for Exeter and Greater Devon, recorded a conclusion of suicide.
"On the evidence I am in no doubt that Tom was the architect of his own demise and he clearly intended the consequences of what he did and there is no evidence of a third party involvement," she said.
