Both staff and patients at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington had been struck down by the virus, according to a spokeswoman.
"Quite a number" of wards were affected, she said, and some operations may be postponed.
Visitors will only be allowed in "exceptional cases" when a relative is extremely unwell.
Outpatients should attend as usual, she said.
"We are carrying out regular deep cleans of all wards, and staff are being extra vigilant around hand washing and other infection control procedures," said the hospital's spokeswoman.
"The situation is being reviewed regularly."
Norovirus causes diarrhoea and vomiting and usually lasts two or three days.
The hospital has asked visitors to call before visiting.
