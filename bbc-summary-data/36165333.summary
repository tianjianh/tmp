The 29-year-old fractured a tibia in Seattle Reign's match against Boston Breakers on 24 April.
The injury means Fishlock could be a doubt for Wales' European Championship qualifier against Norway at home on 7 June.
"Our first fears with Jess's injury were that she could be out longer," said Reign FC head coach Laura Harvey.
"We know she is fighter and will be back on the pitch as soon as she can. She is a true professional and will be working 24/7 to get herself back fit and healthy."
