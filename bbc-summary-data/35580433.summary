Scotland loose-head Allan, 23, has signed a two-year deal, while Tonga tight-head Puafisi, 27, has agreed a contract for another season.
Head coach Gregor Townsend said: "Alex has been working hard on his set-piece game to build on his outstanding ability in general play.
"Sila has played regularly for us this season and there's a lot more to come."
Puafisi, who has 20 caps for his country and played at last summer's Rugby World Cup, joined the Pro12 club last summer from Gloucester and has been ever present in the Warriors front-row this season.
Earlier this month, the Warriors signed tight-head Jarrod Firth on a two-and-a-half-year deal from Counties Manukau in New Zealand and Townsend thinks that retaining Puafisi ensures strong competition for places next season.
"Sila integrated so quickly after the Rugby World Cup it was if he'd been a Warrior for the past 10 years," said Townsend.
"His work-rate in training and in games is excellent and he has been really solid at scrum time."
Puafisi was pleased with the way he had settled in Glasgow.
"The set-up at the club is great and the standard of play is really high," he said.
"My wife and son really enjoy life in Scotland, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the season to see what we can achieve as well as next year too."
Allan, who joined the Warriors from Edinburgh in 2014, made his only Scotland appearance in the 24-6 win over the USA on the 2014 summer tour but is currently training with Vern Cotter's squad.
The prop said: "There's a great set-up at the club and the atmosphere in the squad is good as well.
"Last year was a great first season, but I'm always looking to improve and I feel I can do that at the Warriors.
"Being named in the Scotland squad for the Six Nations was a huge honour and I want to build on that selection and try and get more caps."
