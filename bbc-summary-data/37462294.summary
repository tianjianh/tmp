The 30-year old, who last played for the Teranga Lions in a friendly against Ghana in March 2015, has impressed since re-joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce last month.
"Moussa Sow has earned a recall because he made a big decision to return to elite football from the United Arab Emirates," Cisse told local media in Senegal.
But there is no place in Cisse's 24-man squad for the experienced forward trio of Mame Biram Diouf, Henri Saivet and China-based Papiss Cisse.
Under-23 midfielder Ismaïla Sarr, 18, has been rewarded for his impressive form with French side Metz and given a chance to establish himself in his country's senior squad.
Attention will also focus on Idrissa Gana Gueye, who has produced high-class performances for Premier League side Everton since joining from relegated Aston Villa in early August.
The West Africans are enjoying a brilliant run on the continent after emerging as the only team to win all their games in the 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifiers.
Senegal, who were quarterfinalists at their only World Cup finals appearance in 2002, are in Group D alongside South Africa, Burkina Faso and Cape Verde in qualification for the 2018 World Cup.
There are five groups of four teams with only the winners of each group making it to the tournament in Russia.
Senegal squad:
Goalkeepers: Abdoulaye Diallo (Rizespor, Turkey), Khadim Ndiaye (Horoya), Pape Seydou Ndiaye (ASC Niary Tally)
Defenders: Lamine Gassama (Alanyaspor, Turkey), Diawandou Diagne (Eupen, Belgium), Kara Mbodji (Anderlecht, Belgium), Zargo Touré (Lorient, France), Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli, Italy), Fallou Diagne (Werder Bremen, Germany), Saliou Ciss (Valenciennes, France)
Midfielders: Ibrahima Mbaye (Bologna, Italy), Idrissa Gana Gueye (Everton, England), Cheikh Ndoye (Angers, France), Cheikhou Kouyaté (West Ham, England), Pape Kouly Diop (Espanyol, Spain), Pape Alioune Ndiaye (Osmanlispor, Turkey), Younousse Sankharé (Lille, France), Mohamed Diame (Newcastle, England), Ismaïla Sarr (Metz, France)
Forwards: Famara Diedhiou (Angers, France), Moussa Sow (Fenerbahe, Turkey) Moussa Konaté (FC Sion, Switzerland), Sadio Mané (Liverpool, England), Keita Baldé Diao (Lazio, Italy)
