Southend United 3-2 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend United staged a stunning second-half fightback to see off Walsall in a thrilling League One encounter at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers seemed to be heading for defeat when their former midfielder Franck Moussa fired the Saddlers into a 2-0 lead.
But goals from Nile Ranger, Anton Ferdinand and Simon Cox saw Southend pick up all three points to move into the play-off places.
Substitute Moussa fired Walsall into an 18th-minute lead with a neat finish from Joe Edwards' left-wing cross and then doubled the visitors' lead with another clever finish after a poor clearance from Ryan Inniss.
However, Southend got back into the game in the 63rd minute with Ranger heading home Will Atkinson's left-wing cross following a quickly-taken Ben Coker free-kick.
The Shrimpers then drew back level in the 76th minute when skipper Ferdinand volleyed home from 12 yards after Anthony Wordsworth's free-kick had only been half cleared.
And Southend completed their comeback seven minutes from time when Cox curled a 20-yard free-kick into the top left-hand corner of the net.
