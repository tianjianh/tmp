[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 3-2 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Simon Russell's fortuitous late goal clinched North Ferriby a 3-2 win over Yorkshire rivals Guiseley - their first victory in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guiseley had fought back from two down to level but in the 88th minute defender Marcus Williams' attempted clearance rebounded off Russell beyond visiting goalkeeper Dan Atkinson.
North Ferriby took advantage of some poor defending to take an eighth-minute lead, with Ryan Kendall firing a cut-back into the top corner.
They doubled their lead in the 21st minute through Danny Emerton, who steered the ball home low after Guiseley's Jake Lawlor had failed to clear.
Guiseley got themselves back into it eight minutes later when Jordan Preston played in Oli Johnson, and the latter coolly lifted the ball over home goalkeeper Rory Watson.
The visitors levelled in the 84th minute when Johnson struck his second, but in a frantic finale North Ferriby, promoted via the National League North play-offs in May, snatched all three points.
