Wales and Ospreys flanker Justin Tipuric is back in full training after recovering from the concussion which led him to miss the final two months of the 2015-16 Pro12 season.

The British and Irish Lion, 26, was advised to take a three-month rest after suffering concussion playing for Wales against Italy on 19 March.
Tipuric missed Wales' 3-0 series defeat in New Zealand in June.
"I'm feeling healthy and enjoying pre-season," he said.
"I was well looked after, with excellent support from both the Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union medical teams.
"My welfare was put first, in front of everything else, and that's important. I'm extremely grateful to everybody for that.
"It wasn't the nicest of injuries shall we say. It was a pretty difficult time for me, sitting in the house unable to do anything for about five weeks.
"I'm not a good patient at the best of times. It's nice to be able to get out and do stuff again instead of sitting, staring at walls."
The 43-times capped Tipuric started for Wales in three of their 2016 Six Nations internationals, taking the place of the injured Sam Warburton against Italy in Cardiff.
But he departed after 16 minutes after falling heavily at a line-out.
Ospreys finished eighth in the Pro12 last season and missed out on a place in the 2016-17 European Champions Cup.
The new Pro12 season begins in September and Tipuric hopes the Swansea-based region's pre-season preparations will stand them in good stead this time around.
"It's been a good few weeks in fairness. It's been hard work as you expect in pre-season but there's definitely a good energy about the place," he said.
"Last season was disappointing by our standards and everybody wants to make sure we aren't in that place again this year."
