Delaney, who lives with her mother in a little village outside Madison, Wisconsin, is still planning to go to university.
"When I hear someone is called a 'Good Girl' I think she's a prude. Not fun at all," she told the BBC.
Her story is part of a series of six short films for the BBC 100 Women season called 'Good Girl', in which young women around the world talk about the pressure to fit in with society's expectations.
