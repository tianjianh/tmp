Craig Jones had given Westfields, who play in the ninth tier of English football, a dream start when he fired a ninth-minute penalty low and hard into the net to put his side in front.
Curzon, the Greater Manchester side from National League North, enjoyed the majority of possession but the home side always looked dangerous on the counter and deserved their lead going into the interval.
Marshalled by the superb James Febery, the Westfields defence stood firm and the home side almost doubled their advantage when Jones met Richard Greaves' pass on the hour mark.
But the linesman's flag came to Westfields' rescue when Kane Kahaki turned the ball into his own net with 20 minutes to go.
And with less than 10 minutes remaining, Westfields' hearts were broken as Morgan was quickest to react when a Luke Clarke corner created panic in the goalmouth.
Ashton continued to press in the closing stages but Westfields goalkeeper Kieron Blackburn claimed a number of dangerous crosses to ensure the game finished level and set up a replay for his side.
