Momentum must "not be lost" on work to boost the fortunes of Welsh cities, Economy Minister Edwina Hart has said.

Her comments came as she renewed the missions of the Cardiff Capital Region and Swansea Bay City Region boards to seek opportunities for growth.
Former BT Wales director Ann Beynon will take over as chair of the Cardiff Capital Region board from Roger Lewis, now chairman of Cardiff Airport.
Sir Terry Matthews will continue as chairman of the Swansea Bay board.
Set up in November 2013, the boards are made up of representatives from business, councils, unions and universities with the aim of providing "leadership, vision and strategic direction".
The Cardiff Capital Region board has been asked to promote joint working between interested parties, especially on projects such as the Metro transport scheme and the proposed "city deal" offering more than Â£1bn of investment.
The Swansea Bay City Region board will seek to identify major projects and encourage inward investment across south west Wales from Port Talbot to Pembrokeshire.
