Lancing Beach wind farm excavator stranded at sea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 80-tonne excavator used in the construction of an offshore wind farm is stranded at sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The digger was being used off Lancing Beach in West Sussex, to backfill cable duct trenches along the sea bed for the Rampion Offshore Wind Farm.
It was being driven back to the beach when it became stranded 1,968ft (600m) offshore on 4 April.
Rampion said diesel on board was removed and a plan was being developed to retrieve the digger.
It added that, for safety reasons, a guard vessel was on site and buoys had been placed around the excavator.

A total of 116 wind turbines are being installed, but the company said there would be no impact on the construction schedule.
Meanwhile, a survey of readers by the Worthing Herald has come up with a name for the digger - Moby Dig, with Digger McDigface a close second.
