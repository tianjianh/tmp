The vehicle's owner spotted it being driven away by two men at about 10:20 BST in Ashton-in-Makerfield.
He called Greater Manchester Police whose officers approached the car.
They ended up chasing the Land Rover down Warrington Road, where it was in collision with a Mercedes carrying two people, before hitting a lamppost and a wall. Four people are now in hospital.
Two men have been arrested, said a police spokesman.
