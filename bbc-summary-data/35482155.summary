[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raymond Nevitt, 51, of Manchester, absconded in 2006 following a conviction for defrauding the taxpayer.
Nevitt was sentenced to three years and nine months in his absence in 2008.
At Manchester Crown Court, Judge Steiger agreed not to add extra time on Nevitt's sentence as he had spent nine months in a South African jail.
Nevitt was ordered to pay £1.6m or serve a further 10 years following a Proceeds of Crime hearing in 2008.
His solicitor, celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman, said his client was "considering his legal position" in relation to appealing against the current sentence and the proceeds of crime matter.
Nevitt, described by one police source as "a walking fraud machine", had travelled on a fake passport first to Spain, then Thailand before hiding in Cape Town for five years.
He was arrested in May 2015. Police found him with 28 mobile phones and a large number of sim cards.
The Serious Fraud Office confirmed Nevitt was flown back to the UK on Tuesday.
The former director of three Trafford Park-based computer parts companies was first convicted of defrauding the taxpayer in 2006.
As his firms were going under Nevitt forged paperwork so companies would lend him money on the strength of bogus orders - known as "Fresh Air" invoicing.
In the final analysis, IBM Global Financing lost £1,6m and Barclays Sales Finance lost £654,857. Other creditors lost about £1m.
Mr Freeman said outside court his client wanted to "apologise to the judge, court and prosecution authorities for absconding" and said "he was at a very low ebb".
He added:"For the past nine months, he's been living in a hellhole in Pollsmoor jail, with 70 inmates in one room, 40 mattresses, one shower and one lavatory, neither of which worked properly.
"For many reasons, he's extremely relieved to be back on home soil."
