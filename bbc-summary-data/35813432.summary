The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.99 points to 17,145.65.
The S&P 500 fell 3.76 points to 2,015.88, while the tech-focused Nasdaq was down 21.61 to 4,728.67.
Analysts do not expect a US interest rate rise on Wednesday, but are eager for signs of the Fed's future plans.
"Policy will almost certainly be left on hold," said Jim O'Sullivan of High-Frequency Economics. "With no change in rates, the focus will be entirely on forward guidance."
The trading mood was dampened further by a weak US retail sales report and a 2% decline in oil prices.
Valeant was Tuesday's biggest loser after the company reported a larger than expected loss. The pharmaceutical company's shares fell over 51%  as fears rose that it may face a default on some of its loans.
Shares of drug maker Pfizer fell 1.8% and Merck fell 1.2%.
Commodity linked companies saw some of the day's biggest gains.
Rice Energy shares gained 8.9%. Shares of Barrick Gold climbed 3.8% and competitor Harmony Gold rose 4%.
