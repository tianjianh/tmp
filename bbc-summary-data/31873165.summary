Passports to record teaching career development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teachers in Wales are to be given more support to develop their careers and improve teaching in the classroom.

The so-called New Deal will reshape how they are trained as their career develops and help them to deliver the new "made in Wales curriculum".
Each of Wales' 37,600 teachers will be given a learning passport by September to record professional development.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said having "high capacity, high skilled professionals" was essential.
Policies for recruiting and developing teachers and other school staff are "underdeveloped," according to a report by the OECD think-tank, looking at schools in Wales last year.
There has been a small improvement in the quality of teaching, which is now good or better in half of schools, says the schools watchdog Estyn in its annual report.
But there are fewer schools where teaching is excellent.
The quality of assessment was also found to be variable in a minority of schools.
Teachers will be offered support but be expected to continually update their skills.
Mr Lewis will visit Brynnau Primary school in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, to highlight its record in developing its staff to benefit pupils.
He said: "We are currently undertaking one of the most ambitious series of educational reforms Wales has ever seen, aimed squarely at improving standards right across the board.
"However we know that excellent teaching and leadership is crucial to the learner experience and to our ongoing work of raising outcomes for all learners at all levels."
He added that "the quality of the professional at the chalk face has a huge impact on the quality of teaching and learning".
