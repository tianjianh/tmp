How Xbox One had to 'learn lessons' in first year

The man in charge of promoting Xbox in the UK has told Newsbeat the company is "happy" with the first year of the Xbox One, despite its main rival selling millions more consoles.

Marketing Director Harvey Eagle said: "We're early in the journey, we know that many more people will buy and enjoy an Xbox One in the future."
Overall Playstation 4 has outsold the Xbox One since both were released in 2013. But Eagle is confident sales of the Halo game will make a difference.
Halo: The Master Chief Collection is not a new game (the first version came out back in 2001) but it allows fans to play the complete Halo story on one console for the first time.
It has taken the franchise's previous games and re-mastered them with upgraded visuals and extra content.
At the game's launch event Harvey Eagle told Newsbeat: "We have learned a lot of lessons, the primary lesson of all is the incredible feedback we get from our fans and from the community.
"We've taken all of that learning on board, we've improved the product month over month, now what you're seeing is the incredible games come through that I know people are going to play."
It had looked so good for the Xbox One when it first launched last November, breaking all its previous first-day sales records.
The console then went on to post disappointing figures in comparison with its main rival the PS4 and has had to overcome technical issues.
However, Eagle says the company is pleased with the last 12 months: "Ultimately people buy a console to play the very best games. So usually what happens is the platform with the best games overall wins."
"Xbox One is the fastest selling Xbox of any console we've ever launched so in terms of the success of the console to date we're very happy with where we are.
"Consoles are usually around for eight or nine years and so we're only really into the very first year.
"We're early in the journey, we know that there are many more people that will buy and enjoy an Xbox One in the future."
But what can fans expect from Halo: The Master Chief Collection? Is it worth buying a remake of old games you might have played before?
YouTube gaming vlogger Ali-A told Newsbeat: "For the players who've played it for years they'll know how much they loved it back in the day and I'll think they want to come back."
Fellow vlogger MrDalekJD agrees saying: "Some people say 'what's the point of playing games you've already played before'?
"But with games like Halo you have like these prestigious memoriesâ€¦ they'll be moments you go back to and say I want to do those again."
If any game is going to boost sales for the Xbox One then it will be Halo.
"It's a franchise that's worth more than $4bn dollars in revenue, that makes it one of the top grossing franchises not just in gaming but in entertainment," said Eagle.
"So that makes it incredibly important not just for Xbox, but for gaming in general as well."
