One of Britain's longest married couples have been reunited to enjoy their 80th wedding anniversary.

Ken Harris, 102, celebrated with wife Margaret, 99, after being parted for the first time since the war.
Mr Harris feared he would never again see his beloved wife after he went into hospital with a broken hip.
But the couple, who were married in 1937, have been reunited again at a nursing home in Llangynidr, near Crickhowell, in Powys.
"They hold hands every day now because of the memory of being separated in the war," said daughter-in-law Pat Harris, 75.
Mr Harris, who has carried a photograph of their wedding day in his wallet since, was deployed to Burma in World War Two with the South Wales Borderers.
The couple from Llanhilleth, near Newbridge, who have two children, Alan and Ann, have spent every day together since.
That was until Mrs Harris was moved into a care home after being diagnosed with dementia.
The former butcher was then admitted to hospital after breaking his hip in a fall just six weeks before their 80th anniversary and believed it would be the last time he would see his wife.
But after spending a month in hospital, Mr Harris was given the all clear to leave and was found a room in the same care home as his wife in the Brecon Beacons.
"Ken went to war and Margaret stayed home working as a doctor's secretary but he always had her photo in his wallet," added Mrs Harris.
"When Ken went into hospital he didn't think he would ever see her again. It is so fortunate that a room became available at Margaret's home.
"It has been a real battle trying to keep them together. Ken gave his life for his country and he deserves to be able to be with his wife.
"They are a very loving couple and we are so proud to have celebrated their 80th anniversary with them."
