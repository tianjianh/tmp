Stephon Davidson, 19, was a back seat passenger in a car which was being chased and shot at in Ladywood, Birmingham.
He died in hospital a month later on 2 September.
Police said information had been given to officers and urged anyone who was scared to talk before to now do so.
Det Supt Mark Payne, head of homicide at West Midlands Police, said Mr Davidson was in a Citroen Saxo on 5 August 2008 which was being shot at on Monument Road by at least two men in a silver Toyota Avensi.

"A number" of shots were fired from the car and the teenager was hit in the neck.
"Eight years have passed since Stephon's death but we remain resolutely committed to establishing who fired the shots which ended such a young life," he said.
Offering a "full range of support" to witnesses, he said: "Investigations into his death have continued over the years; but as a result of some significant new information being given to officers, we are now re-opening the case and appealing for anyone who may have been scared or reluctant to talk to police to do so and finally bring some closure to Stephon's family."
Police have released new CCTV images of the car chase before the shooting. The Toyota has never been recovered.
Maxine Sharp, Mr Davidson's mother, appealed to people to come forward so her son's killers can be brought to justice.
"Stephon was full of life, a warm-hearted, loving and caring individual.
"As a family we had to watch his slow but peaceful passing. What we would like to see is for those individuals involved in his death to be brought to justice.
"It is like an open wound and we need closure."
