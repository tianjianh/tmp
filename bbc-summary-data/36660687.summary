The 27-year-old Commonwealth Games silver medallist suffered serious head injuries in a motorbike taxi accident in Vietnam last month.
She has been receiving treatment in Edinburgh after being flown back to Scotland from south east Asia.
Soon after the accident, doctors said she had just a 1% chance of survival.
A post on Facebook said: "Today marks another great step for Stephanie, this week her doctors acknowledged her great progress on her medical recovery, hence this morning Stephanie has been moved to a specialist rehab unit."
Stephanie, who is from Daviot, near Inverness, but has been living in Dunfermline, had previously received treatment in Vietnam and Thailand.
She had been in Vietnam for about four months, teaching underprivileged children, when the motorcycle accident happened.
Her skirt is believed to have become unravelled and caught in the wheel.
Friends and family set up a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her medical costs after it emerged her travel insurance was not valid because she had been in the country more than 31 days.
