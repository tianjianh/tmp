Olympic champion Usain Bolt recorded the second fastest time of the year in winning a 100m race in Jamaica despite stumbling out of his starting blocks.

Bolt ran 9.88 seconds at the Racers Grand Prix in Kingston. Only Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut (9.86) has gone quicker.
After a poor start, Bolt caught fellow Jamaicans Yohan Blake, the London 2012 silver medallist, and Asafa Powell by 60m before easing over the line.
"I'm happy I got a season best. It was not a perfect race but I won," he said.
"I was trying to control the start but it's just one of those things. It comes, it goes.
"I think I dragged my foot too hard so it kind of propelled me forward and then I just tried to correct myself, not try to panic and just make my way through."
Bolt, the 100m world record holder, added that he was "in good nick" ahead of Jamaica's Olympic trials which start on 30 June.
"The more I run, the smoother my running will become and the faster I'll get," he said.
Nickel Ashmeade finished second in 9.94secs, with Blake third and Powell fourth.
Kingston-born two-time Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won the women's race in 11.09secs, narrowly beating world indoor champion Barbara Pierre of the United States.
