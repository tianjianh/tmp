London's St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the claims against acting chief executive Paula Vasco-Knight related to a previous employer.
Dr Vasco-Knight was suspended from Torbay Hospital in 2014, accused of recruiting her daughter's boyfriend.
She resigned in May 2014.
Dr Paula Vasco-Knight has been acting chief executive at St George's for two weeks.
The trust said: "The trust board has asked the medical director, Professor Simon Mackenzie, to fill Dr Vasco-Knight's role.
"The allegations are financial in nature and relate to her work at a previous employer.
"The trust is not in a position to comment further at this stage."
A spokeswoman for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust told BBC News: "So far as we are aware these allegations do not relate to any previous role held at South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust."
Dr Vasco-Knight was the chief executive of Torbay Hospital but, in January 2014, a tribunal found Claire Sardari and Penny Gates had been victimised as a result of whistle-blowing about their concerns.
In May 2014, the then South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said she had decided to relocate to the north-west of England for "family reasons".
Jonathan Wood, director of finance at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, where Dr Vasco-Knight worked as a consultant for a year until July last year, said: "The Trust was satisfied with the work she carried out.
"The allegations do not relate to East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust."
Dr Vasco-Knight is yet to comment.
