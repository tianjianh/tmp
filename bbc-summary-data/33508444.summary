Edinburgh said nearly 1.1 million passengers passed through the airport - its second busiest month ever.
It was the second time in a row that the airport attracted more than one million passengers, having achieved the milestone in May.
Meanwhile, Glasgow recorded more than 905,000 passengers - an annual increase of 14.2%.
Edinburgh Airport saw domestic traffic rise year-on-year by 9.9% to nearly 476,000, thanks to increased services to London with Ryanair, Flybe and BA Cityflyer.
International passenger numbers rose by 11.1%, with a total of just under 623,00 people travelling through the airport.
Edinburgh said numbers were boosted by increased Easyjet services to Paris, Amsterdam, Milan, Nice, Berlin and Madrid and more Ryanair flights to Dublin, Rome and Barcelona.
Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar added: "We had an incredibly busy month in June with more passengers travelling through than ever before.
"As the summer properly gets underway we're anticipating our passenger numbers will continue to grow as people head off on the holidays."
Glasgow saw international traffic grow by 15.6% in June, while domestic passenger numbers were up by 12.2%.
The rise in domestic traffic was attributed to "significant increases" in demand for services to London.
An increase in demand for a number of regional services, including Belfast and Bristol, also contributed to the month's domestic growth.
Glasgow Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "June has always been a busy month at the airport with the arrival of the school holidays, but this year we were busier than ever as we continue to enjoy unprecedented levels of growth in our passenger numbers."
Aberdeen Airport recorded just under 324,000 passengers in June, a fall of 5.7% compared with a year ago.
Helicopter traffic continued to fall, slipping by 7.6% on 2014 levels, while fixed wing traffic was down by 5.4%.
Aberdeen Airport managing director Carol Benzie said "We have seen a reduction in traffic across both fixed wing and helicopter traffic last month compared with the same month last year as the oil and gas sector continues in its cost efficiency drive and the impacts are felt across the region.
"We also recognise that 2014 was a record year for us".
