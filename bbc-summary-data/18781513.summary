Hethel Innovation Ltd will support 300 businesses and look to create 24 new ones at Hethel Engineering Centre, near Wymondham, Norfolk County Council said.
The authority said the firm, part of a ??7.8m innovation project, will focus on low carbon technologies and help ensure Norfolk's global competitiveness.
The company will be funded at the centre for three years.
It is being paid for by a European grant and county council loan.
Norfolk County Council said the firm's aim was to help businesses at the hi-tech centre create new products and services as well as encouraging new spin-off companies and jobs.
It said the company would "create opportunities for businesses to explore, engage, experiment, collaborate and cluster in order to be globally competitive and secure Norfolk as a county that is home to world class business, providing world class products and services".
