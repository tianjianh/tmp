The archive is making available thousands of items too fragile to go on public display.
There will also be pages on the conservation work carried out by the Jersey Heritage Trust as it tries to preserve the past.
The trust looks after over 350,000 artefacts, works of art and information relating to the island's history.
The website also includes Occupation Archive material which was listed on the UNESCO UK memory of the world register in early 2011.
Linda Romeril, Head of Archives and Collections at Jersey Heritage, said the collections were "at the heart of what we do and it is our duty to protect and pass on these unique items to future generations".
"These collections define the Island; they hold the evidence for its historical development and act as the community's memory," she said.
