[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home which was put into special measures in January is still breaching regulations, inspectors have said.

The government's watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found that Sandridge House in Ascot was still "inadequate".
Inspectors said that there were not "safe staffing levels" at the specialist dementia care home.
Care home bosses have said that a "national shortage of trained staff" has made recruiting tougher.
The 33-resident care home was inspected in December 2015 and was put into special measures.
After the most recent inspection, the CQC reported that it had "found a number of breaches" which impacted on patient safety.
Not enough had been done to address the extreme risks of people falling, the watchdog added.
Its report said: "People continued to have injuries resulting from falls. We observed this occurred due to failure to assess, mitigate and review risks for people at high risk of falling."
In December 2015, the Health and Safety Executive said that there was evidence of legionella in the water pipework.
The bacteria can cause a pnuemonia-like illness called legionnaires' disease.
Inspectors also said that some people at high risk of malnutrition or dehydration were not appropriately monitored.
Group manager Naila Nanji said: "The standard of cleanliness has improved considerably and there is particular attention to good practices and stricter guidelines within infection control.
"There is a national shortage of trained staff, caused in large part by government policies restricting work permits for trained nurses outside of the EU, which ultimately causes an adverse effect and an acute shortage."
