The man, named only as Tim, works at the Weston Favell branch in Northampton and delivered the book to the woman after cycling to her house.
She posted a letter penned by the librarian on the Spotted Northampton Facebook page and wrote: "Nice... there are still genuine people out there.
"He bought the book himself for me."
The woman, named Abigail, wrote that she had waited nearly two months for the book.
"The man who was dealing with the issue for me turned up at my home this evening on his bicycle, with his shopping to deliver it to me by hand with this lovely letter," she wrote.
A spokesman for the library service said: "It's great to hear some wonderful feedback from one of our satisfied customers."
Writing on Facebook, Kelli Gower said: "There are actually still decent people out there, who still do kind things for others for no personal gain and with no ulterior motive."
Amy Khan posted: "This is the sort of things they would do back 30 years ago and no one ever questioned it - yeah times have changed but there are still honest people out there that don't expect anything back."
