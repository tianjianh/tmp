Peter MacKay, 63, from Maidenwells, died in the crash involving a grey Mitsubishi Shogun on the B4319 Pembroke to Maidenwells road on 2 July.
Mr MacKay was an urgent care worker for Wales Ambulance Service.
In a written tribute his family said his death had left a "massive void" in their lives.
The statement read: "Devoted husband, loving father, proud grandfather, loyal friend.
"It is impossible to sum up a fitting tribute to you Pete, dad, there is not enough space in this paper, nor the words in the dictionary to even begin to come close to describing the man that you were.
"The massive void that has been left in our lives will never be filled, but... the fond memories will always be there for us to call upon when the wicket becomes a little sticky.
"His life touched the hearts of so many... this has become apparent from the messages and support that has been given to our family."
