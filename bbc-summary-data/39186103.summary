The American fighter, 34, won the IBF super-lightweight title in 2007 and the WBA welterweight title in 2012.
He was beaten by British pair Amir Khan and Ricky Hatton and Saturday's defeat by Birmingham's Sam Eggington took his record to 36 wins from 44 fights.
Malignaggi said he has many "incredible memories" from boxing and he will continue to work in the media.
In a statement released 19 years to the day since his first amateur bout, Malignaggi said his life is now in a place he "never dreamed it could be in".
He added: "I'm looking forward to a long fruitful career now behind the mic, staying around the sport I love so much and the sport that changed my life for the better."
