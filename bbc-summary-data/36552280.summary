UK Border Force officials found 35 Afghan women, men and children in a lorry at Tilbury Docks in August 2014.
The container had arrived in Tilbury with 10 men, 10 women and 15 children on board from Zeebrugge.
Essex Police said McGlinchy, from Derryloughlan Road, Dungannon, County Tyrone, helped to organise the lorry's movements and drove the container to Dover.
Mclaughin, from Rose Park, Limavady, County Londonderry, supplied the lorry and allowed his shipping account to be used for the container's journeys.
A third man, Taha Sharif, from High Cross Road, Tottenham, who was convicted of the same offence last year, and who will be sentenced later this month, organised the loading of the people into the container.
When they arrived in the UK, the 35 asylum seekers were treated for shock, exhaustion and dehydration.
Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, from Essex Police, welcomed the sentence.
He said: "Vulnerable people seeking help were treated in an appalling way at the hands of these greedy criminals, which prevented any prospect of medical help for Mr Kapoor.
"My thoughts remain very much with his wife, children, family and friends, and the other surviving asylum seekers who endured such distressing and shocking conditions."
