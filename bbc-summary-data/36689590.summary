The display includes many famous TV characters from the past 70 years including Muffin the Mule, Gordon the Gopher, The Wombles, Sooty, Morph and the Teletubbies.
Exhibition organisers said they wanted to "look at how the magical programmes of our childhood have created memories and nostalgia in adults and children alike".
