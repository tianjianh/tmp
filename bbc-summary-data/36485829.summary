Mystery surrounds the death of a woman whose body was found on a cycle path along the Mawddach estuary in Gwynedd last December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Ann Jones, a 45-year-old laboratory assistant from Bilston, West Midlands, died from hypothermia, an inquest heard.
A detective constable said her computer indicated she had researched a peaceful and painless way of ending life.
An open conclusion was recorded.
The inquest at Llangefni in Anglesey heard Miss Jones had caught a one way train ticket from Wolverhampton, getting off at Morfa Mawddach, then must have walked four miles to where she was found.
A pathologist told coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones that tablets, including Paracetemol, and alcohol, although not a large amount, would have made her drowsy and she could then have fallen asleep.
Mr Pritchard Jones said if Miss Jones wished to end her life it was puzzling why she should walk four miles to do so.
He said suicide had not been established in law and what had happened would remain a mystery.
