The bodies of Sian Blake, 43, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four, were found at their London home on Tuesday.
Police are hunting for the children's father, Arthur Simpson-Kent, who travelled to Ghana days after they were reported missing.
The Ghanaian Police said their help was requested two days ago.
Detectives have been sent to the Cape Coast in the south of the country - where the extended Simpson family is from - as well as to other parts of the Atlantic shoreline.
In addition, police checks are in place on all of Ghana's official borders.
The authorities said while there is no official immigration record of Mr Simpson-Kent leaving the country, the delay in alerting them means he may have left via the borders into Togo, Burkino Faso or the Ivory Coast.
BBC correspondent Alistair Leithead who is in Ghana said while there have been some reported sightings of him, the investigation was low-key and had not been reported in newspapers nor on television.
No appeal has been made for his arrest.
Ms Blake and the couple's sons were not seen after 13 December but a missing persons inquiry was not launched until 16 December, when the NSPCC raised concerns about their welfare.
Police attended the family's home in south-east London and spoke to Mr Simpson-Kent, but that is the last time he was seen.
A search at the home uncovered three bodies in the garden on 5 January and police said significant attempts had been made to conceal them.
They all died from head and neck injuries, police said.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating how the Metropolitan Police handled the case.
Sian Blake, who had motor neurone disease, played Frankie Pierre in the BBC One soap between 1996 and 1997.
