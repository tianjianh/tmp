Kristi Kafcaloudis was posing for a photo at Trolltunga or "troll's tongue" on Saturday when she fell hundreds of metres, local media said.
The Australian government on Tuesday said it was providing assistance to her family.
The cliff, visited by thousands of tourists annually, has no safety rail.
Ms Kafcaloudis started studying at the University of Bergen, in Norway, last month.
In a statement, the university said it had been notified by police on Sunday morning of the young woman's death in Western Norway.
Ms Kafcaloudis's Australian university released a statement saying it is "deeply saddened" by the news and was liaising with her family.
Monash University said Ms Kafcaloudis was an Arts Science double degree student at its Clayton campus.
In recent years, the cliff has become a beacon for thrill-seekers posing on the edge of the rock overhang, sometimes jumping in the air.
Last month, well-known UK adventurer Toby Segar, was photographed doing a backflip on the cliff's edge.
