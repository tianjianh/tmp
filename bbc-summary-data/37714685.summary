The 22-year-old had made 14 appearances for the League Two side this season before injuring himself against Newport County on 8 October.
Scans showed Kinsella needed surgery, which he has already undergone.
"It's a tough blow for him but a tough blow for us. He had been doing well and gave us that balance from the left," manager John McGreal told BBC Essex.
