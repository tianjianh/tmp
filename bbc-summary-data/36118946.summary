[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League Two: Annan Athletic 1-0 Queen's Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen's Park edged Annan Athletic out of the promotion play-offs despite Peter Weatherson's first-half strike giving the Galabankies a narrow win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One more goal would have put the hosts into the semi-finals on account of having scored more goals, with the sides tied on goal difference.
The Spiders had the better chances before Weatherson headed home a cross from Josh Todd.
But it was the visitors who finished the stronger to secure fourth place.
Having been leapfrogged by Elgin City and Clyde, who both won their final matches, Queen's Park now face Cowdenbeath, who finished second bottom in League One, in their play-off semi-final.
