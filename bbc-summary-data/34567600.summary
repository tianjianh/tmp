Tim Sherwood: Aston Villa boss 'inspired by Alan Pardew'

Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is taking inspiration from Alan Pardew as he looks to improve his own fortunes.

Sherwood is favourite to lose his job after a seventh defeat in eight league games left Villa 19th in the table.
However, he says Crystal Palace boss Pardew has shown how quickly fortunes can change in football.
"I can take a lot of inspiration from people like Alan Pardew, who was screamed out of town in Newcastle and look at him now," said Sherwood, 46.

"I can only control what I can do and I remain confident in that."
Villa have not won in the Premier League since the opening day of the season - a 1-0 success at newly-promoted Bournemouth - and were easily beaten 2-0 by Chelsea on Saturday.
They are one place below Newcastle, who Sherwood's managerial rival Pardew left at the turn of the year.
The 53-year-old's time at St James' Park was described as a "loveless marriage" when he left the north east side 10th in the table.
His stock soon rose at Palace, where he saved the team from relegation - lifting them from 18th to 10th - while he has continued the progress this season with the Eagles currently sixth in the table.
Pardew has achieved his success at Selhurst Park by playing entertaining and attacking football, and Sherwood wants to do something similar at Villa Park.
"I want to go out on the front foot and, if I die, I die on my sword," the former Tottenham boss said.
"Why do we need to be more pragmatic? I would never be pragmatic. I've done it a few times but I don't like myself for it."
