'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chobani, a US-based yoghurt manufacturer, cannot label its UK products Greek as they're made in the US, according to a UK court ruling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A three-person panel upheld a lower court's ruling that the "Greek yogurt" label misled customers.
Chobani's yoghurt is strained a number of times to give it a thicker texture, which the firm has said is typical of a style found in Greece.
Chobani's rival, Fage, sued the firm in British courts last year.
Chobani was introduced in the UK only in 2012 but has been available in US markets since 2007.
The privately-held firm recently announced that revenue had surpassed $1bn (Â£602m). However, Chobani has also suffered several setbacks.
In September, consumers complained of "bloating" in some Chobani packages, forcing a recall.
At the end of December, high-end US supermarket Whole Foods recently announced that it would stop carrying Chobani's yoghurts.
