Sir Edward Heath child abuse claims probed by IPCC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police watchdog is to investigate claims a child sex abuse case was dropped because of threats to expose former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the inquiry concerns Wiltshire Police's handling of an alleged claim made in the 1990s.
It will also look at whether the force later took any steps to investigate these claims.
Anyone with information that can assist police is being asked to come forward.
The allegations, made by a retired senior officer, were referred to the IPCC by Wiltshire Police.
Sir Edward died at his home in Salisbury in 2005 aged 89.
An IPCC spokesman said: "It is alleged that a criminal prosecution was not pursued, when a person threatened to expose that Sir Edward Heath may have been involved in offences concerning children.
"In addition to this allegation, the IPCC will examine whether Wiltshire Police subsequently took any steps to investigate these claims."
In a statement, Wiltshire Police said: "Sir Edward Heath has been named in relation to offences concerning children.
"He lived in Salisbury for many years and we would like to hear from anyone who has any relevant information that may assist us in our inquiries or anyone who believes they may have been a victim.
"Some people may never have spoken out about the abuse they have suffered but we would urge them to please contact us and to not suffer in silence."
Sir Edward led the 1970-1974 Conservative government and took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community.
His time in power was beset by industrial action and economic difficulties that forced him to introduce a three-day week.
He lost his leadership of the party to Margaret Thatcher in 1975 - something he never forgave her for and he refused to serve in her cabinet.
In his later years he became the Father of the House of Commons, the longest-serving MP.
He was a successful author, an avid art-collector and a world-class yachtsman.
