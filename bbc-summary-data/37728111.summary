The Millers are currently bottom of the Championship after just one win from their opening 13 league games.
Alan Stubbs was dismissed on Wednesday following the club's sixth consecutive league defeat.
Jackett, 54, spent three years with Wolves before being sacked in July and will lead Rotherham for the first time against Reading on Saturday.
"It was probably the best interview I have had with somebody since I took over the club," chairman Tony Stewart told the club website.
"Kenny was available and we acted swiftly because we knew that he has got the experience, he has managed a great club like Wolves and if you check the stats out his record is superb."
Former Swansea and Millwall boss Jackett is the club's fifth full-time manager since the start of the 2015-16 season.
Steve Evans left in September 2015, before his replacement Neil Redfearn was sacked in February.
Neil Warnock was brought in until the end of the season and successfully kept Rotherham in the Championship before deciding not to stay at the club.
Stubbs, who had led Hibernian to a first Scottish Cup success in 114 years in May, signed a three-year deal.
However, one win in 14 league and cup games saw him become the fourth Championship boss to lose his job this season.
Jackett has taken charge of more than 800 games in a managerial career that started with Watford in 1993.
He won promotions with Swansea and Millwall and, after Wolves were relegated for a second successive season in 2013, he was appointed head coach at Molineux.
Jackett took them to the League One title with a record total of 103 points in his first campaign.
Wanderers came close to achieving a play-off place in 2014-15 but they finished 14th last season and he was sacked after the club was taken over by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International.
