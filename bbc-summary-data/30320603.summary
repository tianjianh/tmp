Edward Gibson: Murder accused could be bailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has indicated that a man accused of murdering Edward Gibson could be granted bail if a suitable address outside Belfast could be found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malachy Goodman, 58, of Rockmore Road in Belfast, faces charges of murder, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life
Mr Gibson, 28, was shot in his stomach and thigh in an alley near Divis Tower on 24 October. He died in hospital.
The killing is allegedly connected to a fight earlier the same day.
Opposing Mr Goodman's bid to be released, prosecution counsel claimed there could be a risk of interference with the main witness in the case, identified only as Witness E.
Defence lawyers have challenged the reliability of the description to police of the alleged killer.
Three different versions were given, including significant differences between the gunman and Goodman, they said.
The judge said he would not grant bail for the accused to live at his current home. The application was not dismissed.
Adjourning the hearing until an alternative location is provided, he said: "I'm satisfied this is a man who could be admitted to bail.
"I do not propose to make a final decision until an arrangement can be made at an address outside west Belfast."
Goodman is to remain in custody until an acceptable proposal is offered.
