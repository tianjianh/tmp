Ospreys: Alun Wyn Jones to be assessed ahead of Scarlets game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys will assess second row Alun Wyn Jones early next week before deciding if he can make his return in the Pro12 match with Scarlets on 6 May.

Jones has not played since injuring a shoulder in Wales' final game in the Six Nations against France on 18 March.
Ospreys need a point against Scarlets to secure a play-off spot following a 24-10 win over Ulster.
"There's hope of Alun coming back in this campaign but it's making sure he's ready," said coach Steve Tandy.
"But he's excited, it's great have him around the group around training, he's done a little bit of units last week so we'll assess him early in the week.
"We've said all along we're not going to rush a player like Alun back, he needs to be ready to perform."
Ospreys had lost their last three Pro12 matches without Jones before "riding their luck" against Ulster to all-but claim a play-off spot while causing potentially terminal damage to the Irish side's hopes of reaching the final stages.

Ulster will have to beat Leinster in their final game of the season and gain a bonus point to threaten Ospreys' play-off place.
In addition to having five more league points than Ulster, Ospreys' points difference is 73 better than their rivals.
Despite that, Tandy says his team are determined to win at Parc y Scarlets in their final game of the regular season.
Scarlets secured their place in the play-offs with a 30-8 win over Connacht later this evening.
"They are always great games and we know it'll be pretty ferocious going down there and everyone wants to beat each other," said Tandy.
"We've got to go down to the Scarlets clear in our own heads how we want to play.
"It's a massive points difference but we know Ulster have a lot of firepower and we don't know what sort of team Leinster are going to send over there so we've got to be really focussed and ultimately we're going down the Scarlets to win the game."
Tandy added it was a relief to bring an end to a four-match losing run which had threatened to derail their season.
"It's obviously a relief," he added.
"We've lost in the quarter final of a European competition and  lost to the top team in the league here when we've missed a last kick for a victory.
"It's small margins in high performance sport and we haven't had those margins in recent weeks, but I thought we had a bit of luck today and it's something we're pretty pleased with getting a victory against a strong Ulster team."
