Now trained by trained by Henry de Bromhead, the 2-1 favourite made it a fifth success in the race for the owners, the Gigginstown Stud.
Once the seven-year-old passed long-time leader Silviniaco Conti, the result was never in doubt.
Galway Plate winner Lord Scoundrel was third in the three-mile feature.
Walsh had retained the ride on Valseur Lido, who was switched from Willie Mullins' stable in September.
British raiders Silviniaco Conti and The Last Samuri set the pace until Valseur Lido cruised into contention.
He quickly put the race to bed and had 11 lengths to spare over the 10-year-old Silviniaco Conti.
Don Poli, was pulled up, while the Noel Meade-trained Monksland fell five out.
Walsh said: "He travelled super, he jumped super, but he didn't do anything that he hasn't done in the past."
