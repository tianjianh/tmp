Substitute Odion Ighalo gave Watford the lead in the second half when he bundled home from close range.
But Mark Byrne replied for the Gills with a stunning strike to take the tie into an additional 30 minutes.
Striker Bradley Dack was the match winner on 100 minutes, guiding the ball in at the back post via the crossbar.
Dack's winner made up for his penalty miss on 70 minutes, awarded after Elliot List was fouled inside the box by Juan Carlos Paredes.
The victory is Gillingham's first against top-flight opposition since sending Portsmouth out of this competition at the same stage in 2005-06.
Scotland winger Ikechi Anya should have given Watford a first-half lead but he shot straight at goalkeeper Stuart Nelson after Abdoulaye Doucoure's backheel pass.
The result means new Watford boss Walter Mazzarri is still awaiting his first win after two defeats and a draw in his first three games.
Gillingham boss Justin Edinburgh: "In the end we deserved it. We had to ride our luck a little bit in the first half. After Saturday we were a little fragile.
"When we missed the penalty I thought we missed our chance, but we showed great courage and spirit to keep going.
"It's a proud moment for the football club to come to a Premier League team with international stars and win. The level of fitness from my players was quite extraordinary."
Watford manager Walter Mazzarri: "I am massively disappointed. Especially for the fans who don't deserve to see us losing like that. They are very warm and they didn't deserve that performance.
"I need to change this mentality of the players when we go ahead. I'm very angry because we can't see the danger of teams when we go ahead."
