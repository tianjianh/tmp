[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inter-island air service in Orkney has welcomed its one millionth passenger.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service, operated by Loganair, has been going since 1967 and is now viewed as an essential part of daily life.
One leg is the 1.7 mile jump between Westray and Papa Westray - the shortest scheduled flight in the world. It should take two minutes, but can be done in 47 seconds if the wind helps.
Mobile banker Anne Rendall was the one millionth passenger.
The Royal Bank of Scotland employee has completed more than 10,000 trips on the service.
Other stops include Eday, Stronsay, Sanday, North Ronaldsay and Kirkwall.
Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair's managing director, said: "The route is a jewel in our network and known across the world.
"It's an essential lifeline service for the people of Orkney, connecting the individual islands via a convenient air link.
"It's used by teachers, doctors, policemen and school pupils, helping them to go about their daily routines with ease and simplicity."
