Public say on Deeside waste incinerator permit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public is getting a say on plans to burn hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste a year collected by five councils across north Wales.

The incinerator near Connah's Quay on Deeside aims to create enough energy to power 30,000 homes.
But before it is given a permit, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) wants to examine any potential impact and hear from residents and health bodies.
A drop-in session will be held on Wednesday.
US company Wheelabrator has said its Parc Adfer facility would process up to 200,000 tonnes of household waste a year.
If all goes to plan, building work could begin on the site on the Deeside Industrial Park later this year and the incinerator could start operating in 2018.
The drop-in session will be held at Deeside Leisure Centre from 13:00-20:00 GMT. The public will have a month to comment.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board and Public Health Wales will also be asked to look at any impact on people's health.
Sian Williams, NRW head of operations for North Wales, said: "We will only grant the permit if we are satisfied that the proposed facility can operate without harming the environment or the health of people nearby."
Waste would arrive by lorry from Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Gwynedd. Any recyclable material would be weeded out.
Combined heat and power technology would then incinerate the waste, while at the same time generating steam, which would produce electricity through a turbine and generator.
Plans were submitted last October.
