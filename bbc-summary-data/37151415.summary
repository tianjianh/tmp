[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 0-1 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin Lokko consigned Boreham Wood to a painful home defeat with a stoppage-time winner for Maidstone at Meadow Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two sides had sparred for the whole match until the defender advanced to bring Stones manager Jay Saunders a gleeful moment in his 300th match in charge.
In a fascinating tussle, Ben Greenhalgh nearly scored an outrageous second-minute opener for the visitors when he bent in a cross that hit the upright.
And Tom Murphy fired a shot over as the away side threatened.
But Kenny Davis could have made it a very different day for the Wood when he nodded an effort against the crossbar.
