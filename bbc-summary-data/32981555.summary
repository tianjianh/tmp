The party's 61,000 members will be eligible to cast their votes under an alternative vote system.
Ballot papers will be sent on 24 June with the result announced on 16 July.
The contest has been sparked by Nick Clegg's resignation in wake of the Lib Dems crushing electoral defeat.
Under party rules, a candidate must win the support of 10% of its MPs - which currently constitutes less than one of them - to get on the ballot.
They also need the endorsement of 200 members from at least 20 local party organisation.
Mr Farron, who confirmed his intention to stand in the leadership election in May, has reportedly been nominated by more than 400 party members from almost 100 local parties.
The Westmorland and Lonsdale MP, who stood down as party president in 2014, said he was "deeply honoured" to have been nominated.
Mr Farron promised to run a "positive and outward looking campaign" that focused on rebuilding the party from the grassroots up, and issues such as human rights, the environment, and building a "fairer and more equal society".
The other contender, Mr Lamb, said the party had to connect with the "many people who share our liberal values, but don't identify themselves as Liberal Democrats".
The Norfolk North MP said he wanted the party to be a "consistent and clear voice" standing up a liberal society which values equal opportunities, diversity and giving people control over decisions that affect their lives.
The winner of the contest will be announced on 16 July.
