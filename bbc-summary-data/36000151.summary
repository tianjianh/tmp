Karen Carney was the match winner late on, bundling home after initially hitting the crossbar.
Defender Alex Greenwood came close with a free-kick which was tipped on to the bar by the Bosnia goalkeeper in a goalless first half.
England are now two points ahead of Belgium, with the eight group winners qualifying for the finals.
The six best runners-up would also gain an automatic place, while the other two group runners-up go on to a play-off in October.
England will virtually guarantee a top-two spot in Group 7 with back-to-back wins over Serbia in June.
Goalkeeper Karen Bardsley retained her place in the side against Bosnia despite an error in the draw against Belgium, while winger Carney was given a start after impressing as a substitute in the same game.
England dominated possession, with the home side showing little attacking intent and their keeper Almina Hodzic in inspired form.
She saved well from a Jill Scott strike and brilliantly tipped over Jordan Nobbs' effort just before the hour mark.
Hodzic also pushed away shots from Fran Kirby, but having touched Carney's initial strike on to the bar, she could do nothing as the Chelsea Ladies winger stuck in the rebound.
