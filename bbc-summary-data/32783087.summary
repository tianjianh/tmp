[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for 17 years for raping and sexually abusing his three daughters, over an 18-year period.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 50-year-old, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victims, was found guilty of 75 charges.
The offences took place on dates between October 1994 and July 2012, at the family's Dublin home.
The judge said that the fact that the man had fought the case to conviction, added indignity to each of the victims.
She noted that defence said the man's wife still stands by him.
Victim impact statements from the three sisters were read out in court.
The eldest of the three sisters, said that her mother, who gave evidence in support of her husband, "used to be a nice person but seems to be insane now".
Her next youngest sister described having "nightmares about our father abusing me and my sisters" and that the family had difficulty in relating to each other now as they each "tried to deal with what went on in our own ways".
The other daughter said that she had had substance abuse problems since she was a teenager as a result of the abuse.
She said that she hoped her father would get the help he needs.
The man has 57 previous convictions, mainly for road traffic offences. He has no previous convictions for sex crimes.
The judge praised the victims as "persons of very great courage and determination".
