Police said the man entered the Mamies Day to Day store in McKenzie Street at about 21:40.
He threatened staff with a weapon and demanded money before running off in the direction of Tannahill Road.
Officers said the robber escaped with a "two-figure sum of money". No-one was injured in the incident.
Det Insp Thomas Parker said: "Officers are in the process of reviewing CCTV footage in an effort to gain more information about the suspect and the incident.
"It's imperative we trace the man responsible and I am appealing to anyone who may have been in area of Tannahill Road and McKenzie Street around the time of the incident to get in touch with us - you may think what you saw or noticed is unimportant but please do pass it on to police."
