Republic of Ireland striker Shane Long is likely to miss next month's World Cup qualifier against Austria after breaking a metatarsal.

The 30-year-old was injured during Southampton's Premier League victory over Middlesbrough last Saturday.
"Shane is unlucky with his broken metatarsal. We will see him next season," said Saints boss Claude Puel.
The Republic, level on points with Group D leaders Serbia, face Austria in Dublin on 11 June.
Prior to that, they face Mexico in New Jersey on 2 June and Uruguay in Dublin two days later. Both games are friendlies.
Long missed the away match against Austria in November, when James McClean's goal gave the Republic a 1-0 victory.
