The 23-year-old England squad member, who signed from Bristol City in February, is now tied to Reading until June 2018, having been named player of the year last season.
"Mary has fantastic ability, drive and passion," said manager Kelly Chambers.
"She had a huge impact in her first season. Her ambition fits perfectly with the direction of the club".
Reading Women finished eighth last season, conceding just 26 goals in their 16 league matches.
