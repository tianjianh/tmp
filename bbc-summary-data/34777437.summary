Christopher Badman, 37, from Bridgend, had put the bag on his head before entering the Marine Hotel in Porthcawl during the town's Elvis festival.
He was was seen on CCTV walking through the corridors but was disturbed by a guest after he broke into a bedroom.
Badman admitted burglary at Cardiff Crown Court.
The court heard the burglary took place on 27 September 2015 when the town was holding its biggest annual event, which sees Elvis impersonators from all around the world flock to the seaside resort.
Det Insp Andy Paddison, said: "The CCTV initially shows Christopher Badman walking through corridors and he goes to some trouble to ensure he isn't identified by the cameras by walking around with a carrier bag on his head.
"Then, for some reason, he decides to look straight into the camera from just a few feet away from the lens, and of course, his cover was blown."
Badman was ordered to pay Â£900 costs and a Â£100 surcharge.
