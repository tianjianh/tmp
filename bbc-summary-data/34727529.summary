She is one of a rising number of UK students considering studying abroad.
As well as being much less expensive, she thought going to a European university would give her an "edge" in the jobs market.
"It shows a certain quality, it shows bravery to go to another country and it's not that far from home," she said.
The distance does not seem daunting, she says as it is as quick to get home from the Netherlands as from some other parts of the UK.
