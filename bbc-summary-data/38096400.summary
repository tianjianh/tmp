Aryan Patel, from Leicester, died from internal injuries after the larger boy landed on him at Megazone Laser Tag.
The teenager told Leicester Coroner's Court he did not realise Aryan was there because of his slight build and the dark lighting in the room.
An inquest jury concluded Aryan's death in April was accidental.
The laser tag session included 33 other people who were above the age of six and taller than 3ft 7in (1.1m).
Aryan was carried into the arena's reception after the collision with the other player and was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary.
He died nearly an hour after arriving at hospital from a liver injury and subsequent blood loss.
Leicester City Council told the court it will be taking no action against Megazone because it was satisfied with the company's health and safety procedures.
After the jury delivered its conclusion, coroner Lydia Brown praised the Patel family for their "quiet dignity" shown during the two-day hearing.
Ms Brown also offered her "sincere condolences" for what she described as an "unexpected and tragic outcome from a fun activity".
Speaking after the hearing, the Patel family said in a statement they hope Megazone will implement a number of changes to improve safety.
The BBC has contacted Megazone for a comment but the company is yet to reply.
