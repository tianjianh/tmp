Joey Meek, 21, who hosted shooting suspect Dylann Roof at his home in the weeks before the murders, was arrested on Thursday.
He has been charged with lying to authorities and concealing information about the crime.
Mr Roof faces federal hate crime charges and nine counts of murder.
Appearing before a federal magistrate in Columbia, South Carolina on Friday, Mr Meek pleaded not guilty.
He faces up to eight years in prison if convicted on both counts. The magistrate set his bond at $100,000 (Â£64,000)
Mr Roof is accused of killing nine black church members during a bible study group in June.
Soon after the tragedy, Mr Meek told the Associated Press (AP) that Dylann Roof had complained that "blacks were taking over the world".
Before the shootings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Mr Roof occasionally stayed with his school friend at his mobile home in Red Bank, about 20 miles from Columbia, the state capital.
Unnamed law enforcement officials told the Washington Post and AP that Mr Meek was told a month ago he was being investigated for failing to report a crime and lying to police.
The killings shocked the nation and President Barack Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral of one of the victims, Pastor Clementa Pinckney.
