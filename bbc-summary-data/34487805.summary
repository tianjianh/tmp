Police have said a suspicious object found in the grounds of a hotel in Londonderry was a bomb.

It was discovered on Friday at the Waterfoot Hotel.
A controlled explosion was carried out and police initially said it was an elaborate hoax.
After a further examination, police said it was bomb. A police recruitment session is due to be held at the hotel next week.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said the bomb had the potential to harm anyone in the area and that those involved had shown a "total disregard for human life".
"We are obviously very thankful that this attack was thwarted and that no one was killed or seriously injured," he said.
Police said no warning was given and blamed dissident republicans for carrying out the attack.
Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers condemned those responsible.
"This device was intended to cause injury and sought to stop those people who want to secure a career in policing to serve their community and make Northern Ireland a better place," he said.
"It is a potent reminder of the threat the police and public still face from terrorism."
"The contemptible actions of those behind this incident are an affront to everyone who wants a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Raymond McCartney said those who had left the bomb had "nothing whatsoever to offer the people of Derry".
"Not only have they brought disruption to the city, they have also endangered the safety of hotel staff, guests, customers and passers by," he said.
"Their reckless actions are so far out of touch with the views of the vast majority of the people of Derry."
Two police recruitment events are under way in Belfast and Omagh after alerts at the planned venues ended.
Belfast Met's Millfield campus and the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh, County Tyrone, were evacuated and nearby roads were closed after the alerts began on Friday.
Police said on Saturday that nothing untoward was found during searches at both sites.
A planned republican protest is taking place outside the Millfield campus.
A large part of the town centre in Omagh was evacuated as a result of the alert at the Strule Arts Centre.
Shops, businesses and the town's bus depot were closed and students at South West College were sent home.
The alert at the Millfield campus caused disruption to rush-hour traffic in Belfast city centre.
Anne Connolly, the chair of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, said: "It is despicable that the suspect device at the Waterfoot Hotel has now been confirmed as a viable bomb.
"Despite the disruption, it is clear that that people wishing to pursue a career will not be deterred. It is positive that the recruitment seminars have been well attended and that 2,400 applications have been received to date."
