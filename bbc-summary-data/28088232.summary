The incident at the Glenavy River was reported on Friday evening at about 17:00 BST.
The NIEA said it was due to a "high severity" water pollution incident.
They have launched an investigation into the pollution.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: "I am concerned about this. I will be monitoring developments here closely along with NIEA officials."
A spokesperson for the NIEA said: "Officers initially observed a number of dead trout over a distance of approximately 500 metres in the Glenavy River.
"Further to the NIEA investigation, the polluting discharge was confirmed as an agricultural source.
"The source of the pollution was identified and samples have been taken with a view to initiating prosecution proceedings."
The incident was first reported on Friday by members of Glenavy Conservation and District Angling Club.
Club member Barbara McGeown said the incident was "very disappointing".
