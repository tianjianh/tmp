His routine on the pommel horse was the most-watched event of the day, with 9.4 million tuning in to the performance.
The event also saw his team mate Louis Smith win a silver medal.
Some 6.5 million also watched Whitlock receive Britain's first-ever Olympic gymnastics gold with victory in the men's floor two hours earlier.
Due to the time difference between the UK and Brazil, TV ratings are generally lower for the Rio Olympics compared with London 2012 with much of the action happening overnight.
In 2012, 20 million people tuned in to see Usain Bolt win the men's 100m final which aired at 21:50 BST.
This year's final - which saw Bolt win a third successive 100m title - was aired at 02:25 BST on Monday morning. Ratings will not be known until Tuesday.
The Olympic coverage has helped give BBC Four record ratings, with a peak audience of 3.3 million tuning in on Sunday night at 22:00 BST to watch Andy Murray in the men's tennis final.
The Games has also given BBC Sport record online figures, with 19 million unique browsers on Super Sunday. Across the week, some 58.2 million global unique browsers have followed the action from Rio.
