'Gay cake': US couple encourage Ashers Bakery to appeal ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US couple who run a Christian bakery have encouraged a Northern Ireland firm to appeal against the judgement that it discriminated against a gay customer.

A judge ruled Ashers Baking Company discriminated by refusing to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan.
Melissa and Aaron Klein, who run Sweet Cakes in Oregon, were fined $135,000 (Â£87,000) in April for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple.
They have now closed their shop and sell cakes from their home.
Mrs Klein said it had been a difficult few years for her family but they were going to appeal and "fight it as far as they can".
Mr Klein said he did not regret what had happened and believes he made the right decision by refusing to serve the couple.
"I believe in the Bible and I believe the Bible is God's inherent word. He said that marriage is between a man and a woman and also said not to take part in another man's sin," he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.
"Even though there has been a lot of stress it's a pure joy to stand on God's word."
In the case in Northern Ireland, Ashers was found to have discriminated against gay rights activist Gareth Lee on the grounds of sexual orientation as well as his political beliefs.
The judge said she accepted that the County Antrim-based firm had "genuine and deeply held" religious views, but said the business was not above the law.
Damages of Â£500 were agreed in advance by legal teams on both sides of the dispute.
The firm's general manager Daniel McArthur said they were "extremely disappointed" by the ruling and were considering an appeal.
Mrs Klein said she felt the judgement against the McArthur family, which owns the bakery, was "ridiculous".
"They should have the right to be free not to express something they don't agree with," she said.
"To me, being a baker, the cake is our canvas and we get to put our artwork on it.
"When you make a cake, you are putting your signature on it and they should have the right not to do it."
The Democratic Unionist Party is attempting to build into Northern Ireland's equality law a conscience clause that would allow businesses to refuse to provide some services if they clash with their strongly held religious convictions, and the Kleins said they would support such legislation.
Mr Klein said: "We're not trying to do something that is overtly trying to hurt someone, we're not trying to tell someone you can't have a cookie in my shop, we're just saying we don't support an event.
"My message to Ashers bakery is stand, fight this, it's time for Christians to unite."
