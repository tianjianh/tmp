Scots seeking health advice look up muscle, bone and joint injuries more than any other conditions, new figures show.

Since November 2016, 64,000 people logged on to the website, NHS Inform, to find out more about the disorders.
The top five most common ailments searched also included bronchitis, abdominal pain, flu and back pain.
The figures were released as part of NHS 24's redesign of its health information service.
They showed that 84,000 people logging on also accessed individual self-help guides about the conditions.
NHS 24's medical director, Prof George Crooks, said it was no surprise that muscle, bone and joint injuries were commonly searched for.
He said: "These types of injuries usually come on suddenly and can happen at any time, but are especially likely after playing sport.
"The top five reveals people are coming to us for information about a  wide range of health complaints. It also highlights the fact that it is better to use a trusted health resource rather than rely on so-called 'Dr. Google'."
Prof Crooks said the service was particularly helpful to patients during busy times, such as public holidays and allowed them to check their symptoms online, manage their condition or be signposted to the right service.
Since its redesign, the website now includes a Browsealoud feature - for people who prefer or need to listen to information.
An Info for Me personalisation tool has also been developed after some patients said they were better able to manage their own health condition if informed about treatment options.
