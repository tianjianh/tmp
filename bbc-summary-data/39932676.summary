British & Irish Lions 2017: Taulupe Faletau keen to play with cousin Billy Vunipola

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau is prepared to play in an unfamiliar flanker position to pack down in a British and Irish Lions back-row alongside his cousin Billy Vunipola.

Martyn Williams is among the pundits to say both players should start the Tests this summer in New Zealand.
Faletau says he will be happy to switch to blind-side flanker as he prepares for his second successive Lions trip.
"I would have no problems with that [playing six]," said Faletau, 26.
"If it means playing for the Lions, then I would not say no," he continued.
"Professionally, I have not played six, no.  I have played seven a couple of time, though. For Wales there, too."
If the Lions only consider Faletau in his favoured position, that would mean a head-to-head contest with his cousin for the Lions' Test number eight shirt.
Vunipola served further notice of his explosive game-breaking powers with a brilliant display in Saracens' European Champions Cup final victory over Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and Faletau was extremely impressed.
"Billy was immense at the weekend," he said. "He has been playing really well, and I am sure he will do that on tour.
"It is competition between us. It is healthy for me and him and the other back-row men.
"With the injuries I had in the season, I have had a good run of games towards the end of the season, and it has helped."
