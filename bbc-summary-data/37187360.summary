Annalise Murphy: Irish postie goes overboard to deliver letter to Olympic sailor

An Irish postal worker has pushed the boat out to ensure a strangely addressed letter was delivered to Olympic sailor Annalise Murphy.

Murphy has been showered with good wishes after winning a silver medal in the laser radial sailing event in Rio.
The letter included no street address, simply referring to her by name as an "Olympic silver medallist" from Dublin.
After receiving it, Murphy praised postal staff on Facebook for "doing a fine job" with limited information.
A spokesman for An Post (Irish postal service) said its staff often handled mail addressed to well-known people, with little information other than their names.
"Annalise Murphy is a new household name in Ireland and we're very proud of her achievements," he said.
He added that partial addresses were "not unusual" and said the "local knowledge" of postal staff regularly ensured that such letters reached their intended recipients.
The 26-year-old Dubliner's medal success in Rio was a rare silver lining for the Irish Olympic team.
The team's overall performance was overshadowed by controversies, including a ticket sales scandal, a failed drugs test and bitter disappointment for several Irish boxers who were expecting podium places.
Murphy's medal was the first won by an Irish sailor for 36 years.
She will celebrate her achievement in style later on Thursday, as her local council has organised a nautical homecoming in the coastal suburb of Dún Laoghaire.
Dún Laoghaire is home to the Irish National Yacht Club, where Murphy learned the ropes that propelled her to Olympic success.
She is due to sail into the town in a flotilla, accompanied by other Olympians and her fellow sailing club members.
After arriving at the pier, they will travel on to the People's Park, for a reception hosted by Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown County Council.
The chair of the council, Cormac Devlin, said: "Her dedication and passion for sailing has paid off and we are immensely proud of her achievements to date."
He added: "Dún Laoghaire, as a coastal port town, has a long and illustrious sailing tradition and Annalise's success, the first for Ireland in sailing in 36 years, is one we will cherish for generations to come.
"Annalise is a role model for so many other young sports enthusiasts, especially young women, who will be inspired to go on and achieve what she has done for Ireland in Rio."
