Teaching standards are outdated and are no longer fit for purpose, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has said.

The Welsh Government is due to propose new teaching standards for Wales on Thursday.
The standards set who can qualify to be a teacher and outline what is expected of them as they develop.
"These new standards are about making sure teachers develop the right skills throughout their career," Ms Williams said.
Teaching standards aim to set out the expectations of teachers.
Current standards include understanding the national education policy context in Wales, teaching clearly structured lessons or sequences of work, and managing teaching and learning time effectively.
Inspectors at Estyn recently raised concerns that the quality of teaching in Wales was weak.
Ms Williams said: "The standards that we have at the moment are outdated and no longer fit for purpose.
"They don't marry with my vision for our school workforce.
"These new standards don't set a minimum like the old ones did. They go beyond that expectation."
The new standards are expected to focus more on teachers' personal development and training than previously.
It is proposed that they apply to all serving teachers from September 2018 and initial teacher training programmes from September 2019.
