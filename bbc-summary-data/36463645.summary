Police are hunting up to six men who launched a "violent and unprovoked" assault on another man in his South Queensferry home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Detectives said at least one of the men had a weapon and the householder suffered "painful injuries" in the attack on Sunday afternoon.
They forced their way into the house in William Black Place at around 15:40, after their victim answered the door.
The men escaped in a blue Vauxhall Astra VXR and a large black vehicle.
Their victim was treated for injuries to his head and body at St John's Hospital in Livingston before he was discharged.
Police Scotland said officers from the violent crime reduction unit were pursuing various lines on inquiry.
They issued detailed descriptions of two suspects:
DC Ross Nicol said: "This was a violent and unprovoked assault that left the victim with painful injuries that are fortunately not believed to be life-threatening.
"I'm satisfied this was an isolated incident and there is not thought to be any threat to other members of the community.
"Our inquiries are at an early stage, however we understand the vehicles that the suspects used may have been in the area prior to the incident.
"I want to hear from anyone who saw these vehicles or who saw any suspicious behaviour."
