Spanish Grand Prix: Hamilton? Vettel? Who will win?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2016 Spanish Grand Prix gave us one of the races of the season, as a young buck named Max Verstappen wrote his name into the F1 history books.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the tender age of 18 years and 227 days, the Red Bull driver produced a masterful display of skill and aggression to claim top spot at the Circuit de Catalunya.
Admittedly, it only really happened because the dominant Mercedes managed to crash into each other.
Fast forward a year, and it's a Mercedes v Ferrari two-way contest, with Sebastian Vettel qualifying less than a tenth of a second behind Lewis Hamilton on the grid.
Make your selection for your top-10 race result... And bear in mind that it could rain on race day in Barcelona.
Who will finish in the top 10 at the Spanish Grand Prix?
