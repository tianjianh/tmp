Vincent Kompany: Man City captain to discover fitness for Euro 2016 on Monday

Manchester City and Belgium captain Vincent Kompany will learn on Monday if he will be fit for Euro 2016, according to City manager Manuel Pellegrini.

The defender suffered a groin injury during City's Champions League semi-final second-leg defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday.
"At this moment we don't know the results of the examination," Pellegrini said. "On Monday we will know.
"It is difficult to know about the Euros without the diagnosis."
Thirty-year-old Kompany has suffered five separate injuries this season, playing just 22 matches out of a possible 57, but Pellegrini rejected accusations he had mismanaged the centre-back.
"Every time he was in the starting 11 he was fully fit," he said. "You can be sure of that."
Kompany's absence would be a blow to Belgium, who are grouped with Italy, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland at the Euros.
Chelsea's Eden Hazard is Belgium's vice-captain and has led the side in previous games when Kompany has been unavailable.
