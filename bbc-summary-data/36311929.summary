Dame Barbara Windsor has said her final farewell to EastEnders with her character Peggy Mitchell seen apparently taking an overdose of pills.

The 78-year-old recently returned for the former landlady's final episodes.
Her character, who had been suffering from cancer, was seen talking to the ghost of her friend, Pat Butcher, before talking some unidentified pills.
"I will go as I have lived," she said. "Straight back, head high, like a queen."
In a poignant final scene, Peggy hallucinated the return of her former love rival-turned-friend Pat, played by Pam St Clement, who passed away in the soap from cancer in 2012.
"I'm being eaten alive and it hurts and I can't wait," Peggy said.
"I don't want that to be me, I don't want to be that little old lady in the bed, with people saying, 'Remember her? Peggy Mitchell? She's all skin and bones.'"
After the credits rolled, the camera returned to the room, showing an empty glass of water, empty bottle of pills, an envelope addressed to her son, Phil, and a clock.
Dame Barbara joined the BBC One soap in 1994 and has been one of the show's best-loved matriarchs.
Magazine programme The One Show was live in Albert Square to mark her exit and a feature, Peggy Mitchell: Last Orders, debuted on the BBC iPlayer.
Picking up the role from the original Peggy Mitchell, Jo Warne, Dame Barbara went on to feature in some of the soap's best-loved moments.
As the Mitchell family matriarch, her biggest storylines have included her battle with breast cancer, her marriage to Frank Butcher, her feud and friendship with Pat Butcher and her marriage to Archie Mitchell, which resulted in the family losing The Queen Vic pub.
She played the role full-time until 2010 and has returned occasionally since for special appearances.
When her final departure was announced in January, Dame Barbara said Peggy was "a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to her once and for all".
"Otherwise, she will always be there, urging me to go back, and that is something I need to shut the door on."
Her final scenes have also seen Ross Kemp, who plays her son Grant Mitchell, return to the soap after a 10-year absence, to join his on-screen brother Phil, played by Steve McFadden.
