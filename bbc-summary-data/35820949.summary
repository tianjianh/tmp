Italy threatened a shock in an error-strewn first half that saw Dan Jones and Matteo Minozzi land two penalties apiece.
But Wales got on top with tries from Harrison Keddie (2), Shaun Evans and Joe Thomas.
Jones took his points tally to 15 at a packed Parc Eirias.
Wales' closest match during the campaign was their 18-15 victory over Scotland in round two, when a 79th-minute penalty by replacement Billy McBryde capped a Welsh comeback.
They now face Ireland, Georgia and New Zealand in the Junior World Championship in Manchester in June.
Wales have previously taken the Under-21s Six Nations title in 2005, captained by James Merriman, and 2003, led by current Wales squad prop Paul James.
Ex-Wales fly-half Stephen Jones, now Scarlets backs coach, led Wales U21s' Five Nations triumph in 1999.
