"We are delighted that Dizzee Rascal will be joining the party this year, his live performances are incredible and I can't wait to see the crowd's reaction to his headline set," she said.
"From hip hop, pop, folk to Motown and alternative rock, this year's line-up will once again be a truly diverse offering.
"We look forward to announcing further exciting additions including our Saturday night headliner over the coming weeks."
