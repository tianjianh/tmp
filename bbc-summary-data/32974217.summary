Lewis Cook, 16, from Marston, Bedfordshire, and Mary-Anne Wykes, 16, a pupil at Comberton Village College in Cambridgeshire, died on the A421 near Brogborough in Bedfordshire on Friday.
Lewis was described as "cheerful and ambitious", and Mary-Anne as "beautiful and bright".
Genevieve Reason, 32, from Woburn Sands, Buckinghamshire, also died.
In a statement released by the Cook family, Lewis was said to be "an ambitious, outgoing, cheerful young man, with a loving, caring and generous nature".
"He brought a smile to so many faces with his cheeky sense of humour. He will be missed dearly by all his friends and family."
Mary-Anne's family said she was "a loving daughter, step-daughter, and sister, and a massive hole has been left in all of our lives by our devastating loss".
"Mary-Anne was a beautiful, popular, bright young woman with aspirations to become an air hostess, and the world will be a darker place without her in it."
Tributes have also been paid by her school and friends, some of whom held a vigil in her memory on Friday evening.
Two other men involved in the accident in the early hours of Friday were taken to hospital and later discharged.
Bedfordshire Police have appealed for anyone who saw the collision to get in touch.
