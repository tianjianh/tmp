[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maxine Showers, 42, was found in Hinton Street in the Fairfield area of Liverpool at about 08:00 BST on Monday.
A post-mortem examination found she had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head.
Merseyside Police said the latest person to be arrested was a 31-year-old man. Two others were held on suspicion of the same offence earlier this week.
Two men aged 31 and 40, both from Kensington, have been released on police bail.
Police said the mother-of-three "may have been working as a sex worker" and have appealed for information.
