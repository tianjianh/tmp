Christopher Tester, 37, from Torquay, intervened when his parents were being threatened with a gun at their cafe in Antigua on Christmas Day.
Mr Tester is being treated for brain damage at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where his family confirmed that he had been blinded in the attack.
More than Â£100,000 was raised in a crowdfunding appeal to bring him home.

Mr Tester's sister Vicky said: "A bullet entered behind his right eye and came out of his left.
"So he was extremely lucky it missed his brain, but unfortunately it has affected his eyesight."
The family are hoping that any brain damage will be minimal.
"He has been on pain killers a lot of the time," Ms Tester said.
"He's still recovering, but he's ok, he's eating and talking, so he's doing alright.
She said he would be at Derriford for at least another two weeks before going to a rehabilitation unit.
Antigua police are investigating the attack but no-one has been arrested yet.
