'No meat' Hindu school place offer 'outrages' parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Christian and Muslim parents in east London have been left "outraged" after their children were allocated places at a Hindu school with a no meat policy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty-one children were overlooked for their six preferred primary schools and were instead given places at Avanti Court Primary School in Barkingside.
The 11 children whose parents refused Avanti have no place for September.
Redbridge Council said none of the children would be of statutory school age before January.
Avanti Court Primary School has declined to comment.
Naz Qureshi, the Muslim mother of a four-year-old from South Woodford, said: "I was gob smacked and outraged when they told me I didn't get any of my six chosen choices of schools."
"I didn't want her to go to a Hindu school so I am surprised the council would think I would accept a faith school which I didn't even apply for."
Liz Beck, also from South Woodford, said her four-year-old son would struggle to fit in.
She said: "Culturally it's quite different and even though we don't want to shelter our son we feel it would be difficult for him to be in that environment where it's quite different from what we believe".
"The school says there's a strict no meat policy and that they practice meditation and yoga, which we are not comfortable with."
"I feel really angry and just let down, you would expect your child to get into a school they can at least walk too."
But one parent whose children do go to the school said it offered a positive environment for all children and another said "anyone who gets a place at the Avanti Court is extremely lucky".
Under current law, children in England must be in education from the term after their fifth birthday, but the law also allows for pupils to start school earlier.
The Department for Education said: "All parents have the right to appeal against the refusal of a place at any school."
