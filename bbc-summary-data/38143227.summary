Mrs Gandhi was admitted to Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital on Tuesday morning, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala said in a statement.
She would spend two days in the hospital, the statement added.
Mrs Gandhi, 69, is the widow of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. She is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has mostly ruled India since independence in 1947.
Her party lost the 2014 general elections to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Mrs Gandhi has been in and out of hospitals in recent years and her health has been subject of much speculation in the press.
In August, she underwent surgery to repair a shoulder injury.
In 2011 she went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition. In 2013, she was taken to a hospital for a few hours after she fell ill in parliament.
And in 2014, she was admitted to a Delhi hospital for treatment of an infection.
