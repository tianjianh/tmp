The 22-year-old Glasgow full-back replaces Tommy Seymour, who has been forced to withdraw.
Warriors winger Seymour sustained a neck injury during Scotland's 55-6 defeat by South Africa on Saturday.
He is a player who excites fans and he has shown time and time again he can contribute significantly in both attack and defence
British and Irish Lion Hogg will be making his international sevens debut at Ibrox, with Scotland joining New Zealand, Canada and Barbados in Pool A.
"It is disappointing to lose Tommy," said head coach Stevie Gemmell. "However, I'm delighted to be able to bring in a player of Stuart Hogg's calibre.
"Stuart is somebody who has shown at every level of his XVs career what he is capable of.
"He is a player who excites fans and he has shown time and time again he can contribute significantly in both attack and defence.
"Though he has not yet played international sevens, he comes from a background in the Borders that has been heavily influenced by the abbreviated game.
"His game understanding, along with the skills he has developed as a professional, will prove a strong addition to our existing playing group."
Hogg won his 24th cap in the heavy loss to the Springboks, having played in all four Tests on Scotland's summer tour.
Scotland Sevens squad: Richie Vernon, James Eddie, James Johnstone, Roddy Grant, Scott Riddell, Colin Shaw, Lee Jones, Colin Gregor, Scott Wight, Mark Bennett, Sean Lamont, Stuart Hogg.
