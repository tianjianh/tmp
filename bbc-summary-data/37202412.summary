[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Vaughan scored twice on his Gigg Lane debut as Bury eased to a comfortable victory over Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took only five minutes for the forward to find his feet when he capitalised on a mistake from Ben Purkiss to stroke the ball past Jak Alnwick in the Vale goal.
Jacob Mellis netted his first goal in 33 months in the 22nd minute with a stunning strike from the edge of the box.
Vaughan notched his second and Bury's third on the half-hour mark with a sweet finish following a mazy run by Danny Mayor.
Vale pulled one back on the 58th minute when Nathan Smith bundled the ball over the line.
Substitute Hallam Hope restored the Shakers' three-goal lead 17 minutes from time with a deflected strike which looped over the head of the helpless Alnwick.
Bury came close to a fifth late on but substitute Tom Walker was twice denied by Alnwick after being handed his Shakers debut from the bench.
