[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier has admitted knocking down four of his colleagues with a car outside an army base near Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kristofer Smith pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving following the incident in Ardersier, near the Fort George base, on 19 January 2015.
The soldiers were out for a morning run when they were hit by Smith's Volkswagen car and injured. One had to be airlifted to hospital for treatment.
The 33-year-old will appear for sentencing in Inverness in September.
Dean Tudor, Craig Smith, Alan Bowe and Alan Murray were all hurt in the crash, which occurred at 09:20 on Ardersier's  High Street.
There were initially fears that the crash may have been a terrorist incident, but this was quickly ruled out by police. Locals speculated that Smith may have been blinded by the low morning sun.
Fort George, an 18th Century artillery fortification that continues to operate as a barracks, is home to the Black Watch (3 Scots) regiment.
