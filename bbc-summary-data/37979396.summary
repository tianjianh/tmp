Nottinghamshire batsman Alex Hales says his absence from England's Test squad can help him come back "refreshed and strong".

The 27-year-old opener, who has a Test average of 27.28, chose not to tour Bangladesh and was then not selected for the current tour of India.
Hales told BBC Sport: "I would love to be out there at the moment.
"I am obviously disappointed but it gives me a chance to get refreshed and come back strong for Notts next year."
Although not in the Test squad, Hales is expected to be named in the one-day and T20 squads for the India tour, which takes place after the ongoing five-match Test series.
Hales, who made England's highest ever one-day score against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in August, has played in 38 one-day internationals and made 45 T20 appearances.
"I can't look past the white-ball stuff," continued Hales. "We have a pretty big 12 months to a couple of years with the World Cup coming up.
"If the Test stuff doesn't quite happen for me, there's still a lot to look forward to with the 50-over team. It's an exciting time to be part of it as well."
