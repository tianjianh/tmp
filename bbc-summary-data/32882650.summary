A manhunt was launched for Jed Allen, 21, after he was suspected of killing his half-sister Derrin Jordon, aged six, his mother Janet Jordon, 48, and her partner Philip Howard, 44.
They were found stabbed to death in Vicarage Road, Didcot on Saturday.
Allen's body was found in a wooded area of Oxford on Monday.
It is yet to be formally identified, but police are satisfied it is that of Allen.
Post-mortem examination results into the deaths of his half-sister, his mother and her partner are expected to be released on Wednesday.
Dates have yet to be set for the opening of the inquests, the coroner's office confirmed.
The search for Allen ended on Monday after a body was found off Marston Ferry Road in Oxford around 17:00 BST.
Police confirmed the 21-year-old was their prime suspect after officers discovered the bodies of Ms Jordon, Mr Howard and Derrin at 20:20 BST on Saturday.
More than 100 police, including specialist search officers, were deployed to search Oxford University Parks where Allen worked as a groundsman.
Detectives believed he had arrived in Oxford by train from Didcot at 17:45 on Saturday.
Police have reopened Vicarage Road, but a cordon remains in place around the crime scene where officers are expected to remain until Thursday.
