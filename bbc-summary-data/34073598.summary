Stoke City striker Jon Walters says he is dissatisfied with the Premier League club's latest contract offer.

The Potters rejected a Â£1.5m bid from fellow top-flight club Norwich City for the Republic of Ireland international.
After scoring at Luton to help Stoke reach the League Cup third round, Walters, 31, said the offer was not acceptable.
"In my eyes, if they valued me, it would be there but it's not," he told BBC Radio Stoke.
"People behind the scenes know why. I'll leave it with my agents and my lawyer. I can't really go too much into it.
"I've been here five years and improved every year. I can give you every stat for the past five years and I'm probably in the top two for everything."
Walters had been with nine other clubs before joining Stoke from Ipswich in August 2010.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes has said the club want to keep hold of a much-improved player, who is into the final year of his existing deal.
"There's a contract there," added Walters. "But talk's cheap when it comes to things like that. I'll leave it for the men behind the scenes to sort."
