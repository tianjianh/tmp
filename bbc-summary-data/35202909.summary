Sixteen-time world champion Phil Taylor suffered a major upset as he was beaten 4-3 by Dutchman Jelle Klaasen in the last 16 of the PDC World Championship.

'The Power' appeared to have escaped after 19th seed Klaasen missed four doubles to take a 3-1 lead, and double 18 to win the match in the sixth set.
Taylor took out 126 with a bullseye but missed double top to clinch it.
Klaasen rattled off four straight legs to win the final set 4-2 and book a quarter-final against Alan Norris.
Englishman Norris, on his PDC World Championship debut, was a comfortable 4-1 winner over Welshman Mark Webster.
But after the exit of world number one Michael van Gerwen on Tuesday, Taylor's demise left Alexandra Palace in shock for the second consecutive night.
Taylor looked far more confident and composed early on, but the quick-fire, superior scoring and consistent finishing of 2006 BDO champion Klaasen eventually told.
"I am gutted," Taylor said. "I had chances but I wasn't as good as Jelle tonight. I kept plugging away but I missed 64 and that was the turning point.
"I have got to look forward to next year now. I am not fit enough, I am not mentally right for it at the moment. I was pushing to get myself right to get through.
"I am getting divorced in February but hopefully next year I can push on."
Earlier, Suffolk-based Scot Peter Wright won a thrilling tussle with Dave Chisnall 4-3, taking the deciding set 6-4.
Englishman Chisnall led 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2, but the number four seed, sporting a striking red mohawk, hit back each time to level.
The standard in the decider was superb as both players repeatedly broke each other's throw to win legs against the darts.
Chisnall took out 130 to level the set at 4-4 before 2014 finalist Wright broke again, and after missing three attempts at a double with 24 left, finally landed double six to book a quarter-final against number five seed Adrian Lewis.
"I am over the moon. I have always found it hard to beat 'Chizzy'," Wright told Sky Sports. "He is a fantastic player and never gives up.
"The way Adrian is hitting treble 19s at the moment, he is a dangerous man. It should be another fantastic game."
