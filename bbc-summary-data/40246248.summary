The common riding season got under way in the Borders on Friday with the horses out in Hawick.
The 2017 Cornet Ali George and his Lass Katy Moffat led proceedings through the town.
Hawick is one of a number of Borders towns to hold such celebrations throughout the summer months.
They see a horseback group ride its way around the town's historic boundaries as part of the ceremony.
