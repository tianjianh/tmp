The 27-year-old joined Town in January on a deal to the end of the season, having left MK Dons last summer, and played in 17 matches.
The former West Ham and Leyton Orient right-back has made 178 career league appearances.
"It was an easy decision to come back. I've really enjoyed my time and this was where I wanted to be," said Spence.
