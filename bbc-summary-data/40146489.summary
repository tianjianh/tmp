County Championship: Jonathan Trott ton cannot prevent follow-on against Hampshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire were duly made to follow on against Hampshire at Southampton, but only after a brave recovery act led by Jonathan Trott and Keith Barker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After missing day two, having returned home for a family emergency, Trott came in at number eight with the Bears in real strife on their overnight 49-6.
He then hit 101, his 43rd first-class century, sharing a 104-run stand with the ever reliable Barker (63).
But the Bears were bowled out for 254 and, following on, are now 75-2.
After a first-innings failure, Bears skipper Ian Bell is on 47, having so far put on 66 runs for the third wicket with Trott, who ended on a dogged 17, having lasted 83 balls so far in his second innings of the day.
Earlier, Trott also had help in a last-wicket stand of 54 with young spinner Sunny Singh, who made 16 not out, having not scored a first-class run in his previous two innings.
Warwickshire still trail Hampshire by 186 runs going into the final day, with eight wickets in hand, but Trott's watchful ton, his third of the season, has at least given the Bears a chance of saving the game.
Other than 14 balls at the start of Warwickshire's second innings, Trott batted for the entire day.
Hampshire head coach Craig White told BBC Solent:
"It was a brilliant day's cricket. You have to give all the credit to Jonathan Trott as he has played outstandingly well in the circumstances.
"We were hoping the pitch might deteriorate a little bit more as the spin is slightly slow. The boys stuck at it well and tomorrow is a massive morning. For them to get level it will be close to two sessions.
"We need to break this partnership early and keep chipping away as there maybe some rain in the afternoon. It is one of those wickets where you can survive but trying to score runs and build a total is very hard."
Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"We managed to manipulate well and have given ourselves a chance. We ended up getting two batting points as well, so that might count for something at the end of the season.
"The tail stuck around nicely, especially Sunny Singh. In just his first couple of games he's done well. It's the first time I've thought I have to keep my pads on without a break as I was back in.
"We batted well tonight. Ian came in and made it look easy. It is quite hard at the non-strikers watching him bat so well. It is a sign of a side willing to fight."
