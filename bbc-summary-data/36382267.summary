Drey Wright: Colchester United winger signs new one-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United winger Drey Wright has signed a new one-year contract with the League Two-bound club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old made 13 appearances this season, but started only once, in a goalless draw against Shrewsbury.
He has largely been used as a substitute by the U's, coming off the bench in 40 of the 55 games he has featured in since his debut in 2012.
Wright follows Alex Wynter and James Bransgrove in agreeing new deals with the Essex side.
