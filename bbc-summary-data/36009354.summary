Oskar Pycroft, eight, never misses a home match and his bedroom is festooned in club merchandise and memorabilia.
Last year fans of the club and rivals Bristol Rovers helped raise Â£57,000 for an operation to enable him to walk.
In January, Oskar took his first steps at Ashton Gate at the Championship tie between City and Preston North End.
"I'm very excited - this club has meant so much to me, they've helped me a lot and thank you so much to the whole club and Bristol City fans," said Oskar about his nomination.
The Football League said Oskar was "an inspiration to his fellow fans and anyone fighting against a severe illness or disease".
"Not only has he become a totemic figure at Ashton Gate, his passion as a fan has resonated with others to the extent he even inspired fans of rivals Bristol Rovers to back his cause," a spokesperson said.
Oskar's mum Lizzie Pycroft said: "To me he's always my little boy, but to others he's an inspiration, and for him to be recognised is awesome.
"He's such a character and this shows what his character is like that he has brought so many people together, both City and Rovers."
Oskar is one of three people on the shortlist for the honour. The winner will be announced on 17 April at the Football League Awards.
