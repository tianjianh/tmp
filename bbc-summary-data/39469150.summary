Partick Thistle striker Kris Doolan believes his 100th and 101st goals for the club could prove his most crucial.

His brace against Ross County took him past the 100-goal mark and left Thistle on the cusp of their first top-six finish since the split was introduced.
That would ensure their best top flight placing since finishing sixth in 1981.
"I've scored a lot of memorable ones, but those, in a big game with what was at stake is something I'll remember forever," Doolan told BBC Scotland.

The striker has been at Firhill since 2009, joining from Junior side Auchinleck Talbot when Thistle were in the First Division.
He knows as well as anyone how impressive an achievement finishing in the top half of the league would be for Thistle.
"It was a huge victory for us," Doolan added after the 2-1 triumph over County at Firhill. "That cements us almost in the top six. We know we're not over the line but it gives us an opportunity to go and cement things over the next three games."
Alan Archibald's side are four points clear of seventh-place Kilmarnock, with three games to play before the split - away to Celtic and Rangers, with a home game against Motherwell in between.
Three points from those fixtures would all but guarantee a top-six place, with Kilmarnock due to play Rangers, Celtic and Hearts.
"It's a huge achievement for the club," added Doolan.
"It's been our aim for a couple of seasons now to get in that top six. We just missed out last year by one goal. It was pretty cruel and we all remember that feeling. As a club we want to be in the top six with the big clubs."
Doolan has made over 300 appearances for Thistle and quipped that his 101st goal is the starting point for another 100.
Now 30, though, the frontman is still relishing his role as Thistle's major goal threat, with 12 to his credit this season.
"A lot of strikers have come and gone. I've fought a lot of them off," he added.
"It's about producing on the pitch. If you're a striker and you come in and you're scoring goals, you can't be taken out the team. I'm just glad I'm at the top end of the pitch, putting the goals away for us."
