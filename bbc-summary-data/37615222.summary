Leeds went ahead when Chris Wood brought down Hadi Sacko's cross before lashing home a half-volley.
Michael Jacobs hit the post as Wigan fought back, while Pontus Jansson had a header cleared off the line for United.
Wood had a looping header brilliantly saved by Adam Bogdan before MacDonald scored via the woodwork as Latics secured a third successive draw.
Tuesday's EFL action as it happened
It was the Welshman's first goal since signing from Bournemouth and resulted in the first league draw between the sides.
Gary Caldwell's side remain in the bottom three despite denying Leeds a fourth successive home victory, something they have not done since December 2013.
For the home side it was just a second league draw of the season, after Wood scored a 93rd-minute equaliser against Fulham in August.
Leeds United head coach Garry Monk: "We are very disappointed not to get the three points. We paid a very high price at the end.
"We need to not rest and try to dominate. We need to go on and get a second and a third goal, that is the next step for the group.
"Wigan are a decent enough team but we should have won, we had the best chances."
Wigan Athletic manager Gary Caldwell: "We are happy to get the point and I'm really happy with the performance.
"We got what we deserved. Sometimes we just try and walk it in, but we have to be more ruthless in the box.
"The players have kept believing and were fantastic. When you are chasing a game it's never easy. We kept asking questions of Leeds."
