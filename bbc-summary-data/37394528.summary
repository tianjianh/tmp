[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 1-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall came within a whisker of a first away win of the League One season after battling out a 1-1 draw at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saddlers full-back Scott Laird slammed a shot against the inside of a post with four minutes to go at the ABAX Stadium.
The visitors had earlier been reliant on excellent saves from goalkeeper Neil Etheridge and a Flo Cuvelier goal-line clearance to keep them on level terms following a first-half exchange of goals.
Walsall hit the front when Simeon Jackson met a 16th-minute cross from Cuvelier to head home his fourth goal of the season, but Posh did not take long to level.
Marcus Maddison also grabbed his fourth goal of the season as he curled a sublime 27th-minute shot past Etheridge.
But they could find no other way past the Walsall number one who produced finger-tip stops to keep out a deflected Gwion Edwards shot in the first half and a goal-bound Tom Nichols header in the second period.
And even when Etheridge was beaten for a second time on the stroke of half-time, Cuvelier was on hand to clear an Edwards effort off the line as Posh had to settle for a third successive home draw.
