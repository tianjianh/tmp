The Amazing World of Gumball, the children's series on Cartoon Network, also won two awards.
Shaun The Sheep: The Movie won the biggest award of the night - best long form animation.
The character of Shaun The Sheep started life in a television series, as part of a spin-off from the Wallace and Gromit franchise.
The movie version was released last February and went on to take more than $100m (Â£69.9m) worldwide.
The awards, which are held every two years, were handed out at a ceremony at London's BFI Southbank on Thursday evening.
They honour British animators across a variety of categories including short films, animated graphics for film and television, children's series, music videos and commercials.
Teeth, a film which follows the story of a man whose life events are chronicled through the loss of his teeth, prevailed in the short film category.
Cartoon Network's The Amazing World of Gumball: The Shell picked up best children's series and the children's choice award.
The best music video category was won by Manchester-based band James, who won for the video to their single Moving On.
Elsewhere, the award for best TV/film graphics was won by Mattias Hoegg and Callum Cooper for their work on the Guardian Newspaper's The Power of Privacy documentary.
Animated Minds: Stories of Postnatal Depression was the winner in the best commissioned documentary animation category.
BAA Director, Jayne Pilling said: "It's 20 years since these awards began and we never cease to be bowled over by the sheer creativity and innovation in the British animation industry.
"The incredibly difficult decisions that our panels had to make to choose the winners prove that the animation industry is in better health than it's ever been."
There are also two awards handed out at the ceremony every two years to new talent in animation.
This year, they were won by Katie Lenton and Sarina Nihei, who took home the awards for best undergraduate film and best postgraduate film respectively.
