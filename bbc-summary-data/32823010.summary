[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's new health minister has challenged politicians to accept change as he outlined his vision for the future of local health services.

Simon Hamilton said if they want the highest standard of health and social care, then the current configuration of services is not going to work.
Mr Hamilton pulled no punches in his first keynote address in his new role.
He said the real challenge was the absence of political agreement on the future of health and social care.
Mr Hamilton acknowledged the worries that reform will lead to the closure of facilities.
But he added that its growing and ageing population means Northern Ireland has to do things differently.
In a hard-hitting speech with lots of plain talking, the minister said attachments to the bricks and mortar of the National Health Service [NHS] must not act as a barrier that inhibits people from getting the best healthcare.
Instead, he called on people to embrace change and allow the NHS to move with the times.
