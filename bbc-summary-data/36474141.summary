My Morning: Adele Roberts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As part of our #DontHitSnooze week, we've filmed the crazy routine Radio 1 DJ Adele Roberts.  Adele can't afford to hit snooze because if she does, who will wake up the nation's early risers?

Adele's schedule is manic; she is in bed by 8pm, wakes at 2am, is on air by 4am, comes off air at 6:30am and then is home, exercised and in bed again by 8am when most of us are just getting up.  How many people do you know who have two sleeps a day?
