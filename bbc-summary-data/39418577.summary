British and Irish Lions supporters travelling to New Zealand later this year are being offered free accommodation by local fans.

The "Adopt a Lions Fan 2017" Facebook page has been created because of a lack of affordable lodgings for the estimated 20,000 fans who will make the journey.
The tour, which starts on 3 June and finishes on 7 July, will include 10 matches - three Tests against the All Blacks, five matches against New Zealand Super Rugby teams, and games against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians and the Maori All Blacks.
"I really hope friendships will develop out of this, because rugby is a great vehicle for it," said organiser Adam Gilshnan.
"We don't want money to change hands at all, we want visitors to experience the famed Kiwi hospitality, and give Kiwi rugby fans the opportunity to look after their Lions guests."
More than 100 participants have already posted on the page.
