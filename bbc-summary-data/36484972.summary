A vast sinkhole shut down a busy area in the centre of the Canadian city of Ottawa.

The hole opened up next to a shopping mall, causing a gas leak and prompting the evacuation of a nearby hotel and other businesses.
The collapse continued to spread to the width of an entire street, swallowing a parked van and a lamppost.
The incident also halted construction on a nearby light rail transit line and the hole filled with water.
A burst watermain appeared to gush into the sinkhole on Rideau Street just after the collapse, but officials have since shut off the supply.
A power outage in the area was also reported, affecting about 850 customers, according to Canadian media.
There were no reported injuries, but officials have advised people to avoid the area until further notice.
It is unclear if the sinkhole was due to ongoing construction on the city's Light Rail Transit. A new section of the system was being dug out nearby.
Evacuated businesses include the Shaw Centre, a CIBC bank, a Chapters bookstore and the Rideau Centre mall.
