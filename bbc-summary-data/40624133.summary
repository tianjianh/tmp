On Saturday night the 21-year-old broke her own world record with a time of 28.61 seconds in the T53 200m to upgrade from her bronze in 2015.
"I honestly can't believe it - it's incredible," Kinghorn said.
"I badly wanted a medal and to come away from a home games with a gold and a world record is a dream come true."
Kinghorn came into the event having won three European Championships gold medals in 2014 and a worlds bronze in 2015.
And, while she will try to add to her medal tally in the coming days in London, the Scot says winning the gold marked a major moment in her life.
At the age of 14 Kinghorn was left paralysed following an accident at her family farm in the Borders, but she used sport as a means of getting her life back on track, despite her initial fears.
"It's 100% true - the moment I had my accident I thought I'd be in bed for ever and never get out," Kinghorn added. "Now, someone says I can't do it and I find a way to do it.
"To be here and to have won that medal, my life has changed completely and it's changed for the better."
Para-sport legend Tanni Grey-Thompson described Kinghorn's world record-breaking display on Saturday as "amazing" and "wonderful to watch".
That meant a huge amount to the Scot, who had taken inspiration from the 11-time Paralympic Games gold-medal winner.
"When I was stuck in my bed it was Tanni I watched every day on Youtube and I said to myself 'I'm going to be like her'," Kinghorn said.
"She's the person that got para-sport noticed and I can't thank her enough for that. I hope I can inspire people, because para-sport is amazing, it opens so many doors and you are able to travel the world and meet the most incredible people."
On a day when Great Britain won five golds and nine medals in total, Scotland's Stef Reid took top spot in the podium in the T44 long jump.
The 32-year-old, who won Paralympic Games silver medals in 2012 and 2016, was overjoyed to finally land gold.
"There's that part of your brain where you think 'Gosh, I don't want to be the silver girl forever'," said Reid.
"You have all sorts of questions that go through your head.
"You've just got to be tough, as a person that keeps on coming back, keeps on trying.
"I started in 2006, it's now 2017 and I am finally in the middle of the podium. That's what it takes sometimes."
