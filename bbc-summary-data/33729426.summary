A fisherman had to swim to shore after falling off his creel boat off the north east coast near Boddam.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peterhead and Aberdeen Lifeboats were called amid fears the drifting vessel was a danger to other shipping in the area.
The creel boat was heading towards Aberdeen Bay on autopilot.
A crew transfer boat managed to get someone on board, and brought it under control. The fisherman was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
The incident happened on Thursday afternoon.
