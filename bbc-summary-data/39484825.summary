Rainwater poured into the venue ahead of Saturday's performance of The Crucible.
Aberdeen Performing Arts (APA) said heavy rain combined with ongoing roof repairs led to the issue.
Customers received a refund and APA said no lasting damage had been caused to the venue.
A spokeswoman said: "Due to persistent heavy rain and ongoing roof repairs, we experienced an issue with water entering the auditorium.
"There was a lack of time to resolve this without causing a major delay to the beginning of the performance.
"The show was cancelled and refunds have been issued. There is no lasting damage and future shows will go ahead as planned."
