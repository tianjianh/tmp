Tracking Santa: Three ways to follow Father Christmas online

If you believe in him, he's definitely real.

With a little help from the US military, Google and some people with far too much time on their hands, you can now track Santa's progress this Christmas Eve.
As he delivers presents to children (who've been good girls and boys) all over the world, his movements will be followed closely.
Here are three ways you can keep up with Father Christmas online.
For one day every year the military agency charged with ensuring the safety of US and Canadian airspace turns its attention to a far more important task.
The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) runs the original Santa-tracking service.
Using a combination of satellites, radar, jet fighters and strategically placed 'santacams', NORAD claims to offer "a continuous picture of his whereabouts."
In case you're thinking they just make it all up, the agency states that it uses "the same satellites that we use in providing air warning of possible missile launches aimed at North America".
It all started by accident in 1955 when a department store advert offering children the chance to speak to Santa printed the telephone number for NORAD (or CONAD as it was then) by mistake.
Apps are available for iOS, Android and Windows Phones.
With a little help from Santa's 'developer elves', Google promises to give you minute-by-minute updates on the big man's progress.
On Christmas Eve the company will reveal Santa's dashboard, allowing you to follow his movements.
It could be an educational experience too with Google promising you'll be able to "learn a little about some of his stops along the way".
There are games and activities to pass the time while you wait for Santa to arrive in your region.
You can also ask Santa to record a special audio message for a loved one or a friend, but don't forget to read the small print, as the message states: "Even Santa has a legal team."
The best of the rest is the advert-free website trackingsanta.net.
With a constant feed of information all year round, there is plenty to keep even the most sceptical Santa-spotter interested.
The site boasts access to unique data "no other website out there has it and, for security reasons and Santa's safety, no other site ever will".
Using "sources selected by Santa himself" and "a signal originating from the north pole", the site provides multi-media coverage.
There are news updates on reindeer health, test flights and sleigh maintenance available at Santa Update.
And stay tuned for a 24-hour radio broadcast with all the latest news. Ho ho ho.
