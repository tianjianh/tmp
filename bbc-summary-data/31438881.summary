Michael Allen's try helped a sluggish Ulster into a 10-0 lead at the break but the hosts sparkled in the final 20 minutes as they scored five tries.
A penalty try was reward for constant pressure and Stuart McCloskey went over before Ireland wing Craig Gilroy sprinted in for the bonus point.
Andrew Warwick touched down before Gilroy completed the rout.
Ulster edged out Treviso in Italy last month and they were expected to brush aside the visitors on home soil.
However, Treviso applied the early pressure as Ulster made a lacklustre start to the game.
The Italians failed to capitalise on their territorial dominance and Ulster finally sparked into life, with a 19th-minute penalty from Ruan Pienaar getting the hosts on the scoreboard.
The opening try came seven minutes later, with Allen jinking inside and darting through before Pienaar added the extras.
Ulster were now the team in control although handling errors and stubborn Treviso defending kept the gap at 10.
Pienaar had the chance to extend Ulster's advantage with the final action of the half, but the scrum-half saw his penalty strike the upright.
Ulster pinned Treviso back on the restart but rustiness from the three-week break was evident as unforced errors denied them a try.
Lewis Stevenson rumbled over from close range but it was ruled out for offside, although Treviso captain Antonio Pavenello was sinbinned for a deliberate knock-down in the move.
His second-row replacement Tomas Vallejos was also yellow-carded as Treviso infringements mounted.
The pressure finally told courtesy of a converted penalty try on the hour mark and Ulster could now target the bonus point.
Treviso finally registered a score with Joe Carlisle's penalty before Ulster added a third converted try as replacement McCloskey muscled over in the corner on 68 minutes.
It was quickly followed by the bonus-point try, with Gilroy finishing off a passing move on his 100th appearance for Ulster although Pienaar missed the conversion.
Treviso were visibly wilting and Ulster were taking full advantage as replacement Warwick charged over before Gilroy intercepted a pass before sprinting in for his second try.
Pienaar converted both tries as Ulster came away with a victory which leaves them level on points with the pacesetting Ospreys.
