[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old former Chelsea and Leeds trainee spent two seasons with the Latics where he scored 11 goals.
Poleon, who can also play on the wing, becomes the fifth new arrival for the Dons this summer after their promotion last season.
"Oldham wanted to strike a deal with him, but he is a London boy," boss Neal Ardley told the club website.
"We tried to pull on the old heart strings to get him some home cooking back with his Mum."
Poleon added: "It was the best decision for me and my family. I believe that the manager here can get the best out of me."
Wimbledon have not disclosed the length of Poleon's deal.
