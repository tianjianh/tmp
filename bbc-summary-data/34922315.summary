Leigh Centurions have confirmed the signing of England half-back Rangi Chase on a two-year contract, with the option of a further year.

Chase, 29, was without a club after being released by Salford in October following a "disciplinary procedure".
He scored 15 tries in 42 game for Salford, and was previously the 2011 Man of Steel while at Castleford.
"Rangi has undoubted class that I am sure will flourish within our team," head coach Paul Rowley said.
"I will look forward to challenging Rangi in different roles to ensure we bring the best out of him and that the team benefits from his presence."
Director of rugby Derek Beaumont told BBC Radio Manchester in September that the Centurions were signing Chase, but the deal has only now been finalised.
