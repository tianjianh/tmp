She was woken up at about 00:30 BST on Saturday at her home in Chorley, Lancashire, to find the man assaulting her and demanding money.
The attacker pulled her from the bed and continued the assault before ransacking her house.
A 35-year-old man from Chorley has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary.
The victim is being treated at Wigan Hospital for non life-threatening injuries, police said.
After her attacker ran off, she managed to crawl to a neighbour's house in Aspen Gardens and police were called.
Det Insp Warren Atkinson, of Lancashire Police, said: "This was a brutal and sustained assault on an elderly lady in her own home.
"The level of gratuitous violence used on this vulnerable woman simply beggars belief and it is a miracle she was not more seriously injured."
Police arrested the man following an "incredible response" from the public to an appeal for information.
"As a result of their help and through police inquiries we now have a man in custody and he will be questioned in due course," Det Insp Atkinson added.
