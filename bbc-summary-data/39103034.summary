Tyrone Mings: Bournemouth starting berth tough to enjoy in winless run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth's Tyrone Mings insists he will find it hard to enjoy his prolonged run in the team until Eddie Howe's side end their poor run.

Mings has become a regular in the Cherries defence since Nathan Ake returned to Chelsea in January.
The 23-year-old missed almost all of last season because of injury and is yet to taste victory in any of his six starts this term.
"At the moment the losing feeling is not great and it is not nice," he said.
"Once the results come then I can start saying I am enjoying my run," Mings told BBC Radio Solent. "Personally, I am getting fitter, stronger and learning more as each game passes."
Bournemouth have conceded 23 goals in their last eight matches and are winless in 2017.
Defeat by West Bromwich Albion at the weekend was their third in a row, and they next face League Cup winners Manchester United at old Trafford on Saturday.
"If we keep conceding two goals a game, it is going to be difficult," the former Ipswich Town full-back added.
"You can be as good as you want attacking-wise but we need to start conceding less goals."
