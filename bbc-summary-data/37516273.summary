Donington Co-op ram-raid shop replaced with pop-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pop-up shop is to open in a village after its Co-op store was badly damaged in a botched ram-raid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbers fled empty-handed after the raid on the store in Donington in Lincolnshire in the early hours of Thursday.
CCTV footage showed a digger repeatedly being driven into the front of the store until part of the building collapsed.
Police said the offenders then fled in a flat bed vehicle and dark blue car.

The Co-op's area manager Simon Taylor said the pop-up shop will operate from a neighbouring pub car park.
He said it would stock a limited range of about 150 items to provide a service while repairs take place. It will open later.
No timescale for the work has been announced, but Mr Taylor said the rear of the building was not as bad as it looks at the front.
