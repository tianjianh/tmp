Jeremy Corbyn: Scottish Labour reforms will be backed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has said plans to give Scottish Labour greater autonomy and a seat on the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) will be approved.

Sources said the Labour leader tried to block part of the reform plan, which will be voted on later.
But Mr Corbyn told BBC Scotland he believed the plan would be approved, and he was happy for that to happen.
A fresh attempt to delay the plans was defeated at the Labour conference in Liverpool on Tuesday morning.
Allies of Mr Corbyn fear allowing Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and her Welsh counterpart to appoint a representative to the NEC will water down Mr Corbyn's influence over the party's ruling body.
Instead, they want the Scottish and Welsh representatives on the NEC to be elected by party members.
The proposals to give Scottish Labour greater devolution from the main UK party have not proved as controversial as the changes to the NEC.
And the chances of the new rules being adopted were boosted when NEC chair Paddy Lillis ruled that a show of hands at the conference was "overwhelmingly" in favour of considering them as a package.
Audience members were warned to "behave yourselves" by Mr Lillis when disgruntled left-wingers complained that the vote was too close to call.
It followed Mr Corbyn telling BBC Scotland on Monday that he would be "very happy" for Ms Dugdale to be able to appoint a representative to the NEC.
He added: "I work very well with Kezia. We have campaigned together. We have had a good conversation this week and we'll continue to do that.
"What I have said is there has to be a Scottish member of the National Executive and for that matter a Welsh member.
"The method of decision-making on that is what the discussion was about. We will come to that conclusion, and there will be a Scottish member of the National Executive."
Ms Dugdale had been a high-profile backer of Owen Smith's leadership bid ahead of Mr Corbyn being re-elected as Labour leader on Saturday.
When asked whether he believed Labour could win an election in Scotland, Mr Corbyn responded: "We can win a lot of support in Scotland", before saying that the Scottish party was "in good heart" after an increase in its membership and three council by-election wins.
Ms Dugdale, who addressed the conference on Monday, has also said she was confident the full package of reforms would be passed when delegates vote.
She has previously said the changes put Scottish Labour "on track to become fully autonomous within the UK Labour Party".
But it is not becoming a separate party and is expected to continue to share finances with the UK party.
The UK party would also effectively be able to overrule Scottish Labour on reserved issues such as Trident.
The reform plan has already been backed by Labour's ruling NEC but needs to be endorsed by the party conference in Liverpool.
