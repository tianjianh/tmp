Early rain on the fifth day prompted the umpires to abandon the match shortly before lunch, with only 81 overs bowled.
India had reached 80-0 after bowling South Africa out for 214 on day one.
India go into the third Test in Nagpur, which starts on 25 November, with a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.
"It's a pity we lost four days after being in such a strong position," said India captain Virat Kohli.
