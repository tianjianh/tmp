Boxing on the undercard of Carl Frampton's loss to Leo Santa Cruz, the 26-year-old from Prestonpans went the distance for the first time.
The Commonwealth super-lightweight champion now has eight wins since turning professional.
Despite being deducted a point for low punches he won by 78-73 on two cards and 79-72 according to the third judge.
Taylor described the experience of fighting in Las Vegas as "brilliant", but felt he did not hit top gear in the ring.
"It was far from my best performance," the Scottish fighter said. "I was a little bit too eager to impress on the big stage.
"I felt a little bit tight and tense. I couldn't get my footwork going, couldn't get flowing. I never felt like I was in any danger, I felt very comfortable in the fight. I felt like I never got out of second gear.
"He was very awkward, very hard to nail clean. When I did catch him he was very good at spoiling me. It was a good learning fight for me and to good get the eight rounds in."
