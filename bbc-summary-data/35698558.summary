A man who stole sex toys during a raid on a woman's Dundee flat has been jailed for 15 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Jamieson left the adult toys in full view of police officers who arrived at his home to arrest him.
Sheriff Alastair Brown told the 35-year-old he had "violated" his victims' home.
Fiscal depute Vicki Bell told Dundee Sheriff Court that Jamieson was caught in the act by the woman's neighbour, who saw him leaving the flat with a TV.
Jamieson, a prisoner at Perth, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft in Dundee's Hilltown on 12 December.
He admitted stealing a TV, guitar plectrum, keys and a plastic knife in addition to the adult toys.
Before jailing Jamieson, Sheriff Alastair Brown said: "When you go in to somebody's home you create in them feelings of violation and insecurity.
"And in this case it was made worse by the intimate nature of some of the items you took to your home.
"You and anyone else who is inclined to violate somebody's home must understand that this court will deal with that type of offence seriously."
