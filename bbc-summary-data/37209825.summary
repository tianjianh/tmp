The body of Shana Grice, 19, was found at a house in Chrisdory Road, Mile Oak, after she failed to turn up for work on Thursday morning.
Sussex Police said a 27-year-old man had been bailed until 29 September pending further inquiries.
Her parents have paid tribute to a "kind, thoughtful, caring daughter".
Ms Grice worked in the accounts department of Palmer and Harvey, a company in Hove.
Det Supt Jason Taylor said: "This remains an ongoing investigation and has understandably come as a shock to the local community.
"Our thoughts are with Shana Grice's family and friends and we would ask anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area, no matter how insignificant you may think it was, to get in touch."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been notified of Ms Grice's death as police had been in contact with her and "other people" previously, Sussex Police said.
