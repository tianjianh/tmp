Cheltenham secured the National League title on Saturday, ending a season-long battle for top spot with Pennock's second-placed side, their local rivals.
"He may have wanted to keep it secret but it was a lovely little touch," Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"Credit to him because he's been very humble. That was a bit of class there."
Pennock said: "He deserved it. We've had a good battle up there, being first and second all season.
"It was just a case of saying well done to him. He fully deserves it.
"Being manager at any football club is a tough job. He's come out on top and that was all it was."
Johnson added: "A bottle turned up yesterday in a package and we thought 'who is this from?' The card came out and it was from 'Ady Pennock, Forest Green.'
"I wish him well for the play-offs."
