[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Evans, 35, was stopped on the M62 near Goole, East Yorkshire, on 9 May.
He pleaded guilty at Scunthorpe Magistrates' Court to speeding and driving while over the limit.
Evans was also given a 12-month community order and told to complete 250 hours' unpaid work.
He was also ordered to pay Â£295 in costs.
The court heard Evans, of Mount Avenue, Hemsworth, recorded 78 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml of breath when he was stopped. The legal drink drive limit is 35 micrograms.
Speaking after the hearing, his solicitor Neil Davies said Evans was "exceptionally remorseful for the mistake he's made".
"A substantial element of the offence involved drinking heavily the night prior to driving, which, of course, is a mistake that many people sometimes make and something we all need to be very conscious of."
