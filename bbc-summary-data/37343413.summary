Jaap Stam: Reading fans have to get used to new style of play

Reading manager Jaap Stam says fans who do not agree with his emphasis on possession-based football will have to get used to the style of play.

Home fans booed on occasion when the Royals played the ball backwards during their 2-1 win over Ipswich last week.
"I can understand, in a sort of way, that they get nervous and want us to play the ball forward straight away without taking risks," Stam said.
"They probably need to accept that we are going to be playing like this."
In a game of three contentious penalties, Danny Williams scored a 95th-minute winner from the spot against Ipswich.
Victory preserves Reading's unbeaten run at home this season.
Stam insists that their approach, which saw them control 63% possession while failing to produce a goal from open play on Friday, will remain unchanged for the visit of Birmingham on Tuesday.
"We are going to play, sometimes, with a lot of risk and sometimes, maybe, certain mistakes will be made," he told BBC Sport.
"We of course don't want to do that and we are trying to prepare everyone very well so that they don't make mistakes.
"It's football, you work with humans and humans make mistakes. We will do everything in our power to prepare the players so they know to make the right decision at the right times."
The former Manchester United and Netherlands defender, who is in his first job in management, says there will be times where playing long balls and "not the way we want" will be required.
