A man from Ballycastle, County Antrim, is in a critical condition in hospital in Sydney, Australia, after allegedly being punched by his brother.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Lyttle suffered serious head injuries and is in a critical but stable condition.
New South Wales police were called to the Bayswater Road shortly after 03:00 local time on Saturday.
They were told a 33-year-old man had punched a 31-year-old man in the head, causing him to fall onto the footpath.
Barry Lyttle, 33, was later remanded in custody at Parramatta Court on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm. He is expected to appear in court again on Monday.
NSW Police Insp Michael Fitzgerald said the brothers were from Northern Ireland and were with their father on holiday.
"This is a tragedy. I've spoken to their father at hospital this morning," Insp Fitzgerald said.
"The pain the father is suffering now cannot be explained in words as a result of a one-punch attack from one brother to another.
"This was caused by one punch and we now have a father who is facing the reality of one son facing serious criminal charges and another son fighting for his life."
