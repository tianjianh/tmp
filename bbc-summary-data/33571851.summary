Northamptonshire Police released CCTV footage showing the vehicles, including a Cumbrian coach, making illegal U-turns at Junction 18 near Crick.
It shows them heading the wrong way down a slip road to get off the M1.
The drivers had been approaching a queue caused by a serious accident at Junction 19 on Sunday 5 July.
It was recorded just before 21:00 BST.
PC Dave Lee, of the force's tactical roads policing unit, said: "These people were behaving ridiculously.
"People joining the motorway aren't expecting other vehicles to be coming towards them.
"These drivers were not only putting their own lives at risk, they were risking the lives of everyone heading down that slip road."
Officers are now investigating the footage so action can be taken against the drivers who performed the illegal U-turns.
Wigton-based coach company Reays confirmed the driver who performed the U-turn has resigned.
