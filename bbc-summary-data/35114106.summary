[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Wood, 58, also denies being the passenger in a white Transit van pictured being driven by one of the robbers over the weekend of the raid.
Mr Wood is accused of involvement in the first part of the burglary on the night before Good Friday.
He is one of four men who deny charges relating to the Â£14m jewellery and diamonds raid.
The gems were taken on Easter Saturday after raiders bored through a wall into a vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd.
Mr Wood is charged with conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property.
His friend Daniel "Danny" Jones has previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
Prosecutor Philip Evans presented the jury at Woolwich Crown Court with surveillance images showing a man entering the building where the raid took place.
Mr Evans said: "That man has glasses, lives in Cheshunt, is called Carl, is white, about the right height, and he knows Danny Jones, and is in regular contact with Mr Jones.
"It is you isn't it?"
Mr Wood replied: "I totally disagree. It is not me."
He also denied being party to drilling a hole through the 6ft (1.8m) concrete vault wall and that he got "spooked" on the second night of the burglary.
Mr Evans showed the court a picture of a white Transit and said to Mr Wood: "The person who is driving is Mr Jones (Danny Jones) and you are in the passenger seat."
He also accused Mr Wood of lying about his alibi for the Easter Saturday evening, the second night of the burglary, where he said he was at home with his wife and daughter having a barbeque.
Mr Wood denied he was lying.
His wife told the court she was "shocked" when her husband was arrested on 19 May.
Prosecutor Philip Stott suggested that Mrs Wood would do anything for her husband of 40 years, suggesting she had lied about her husband's whereabouts.
Mrs Wood replied: "I have not lied."
William Lincoln, who is accused of helping to plan the raid and dispose of the loot, told the court he could not have been involved because he was at Billingsgate fish market on the morning of the burglary.
He regularly bought eels for his mother there.
He said he was introducing a man he knew only as 'Jimmy Two-baths' to the fishmongers.
He told jurors he met "Jimmy" at Porchester Hall Steam Baths in Westminster. "(He's called) Jimmy Two-baths because he goes down twice."
Jurors heard Mr Lincoln suffers from sleep apnoea, bladder issues and severe osteoarthritis which has led to him having a double hip replacement.
As a result of his ailments, he is unable to work and receives disability living allowance and employment support allowance.
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield; John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
The trial continues.
