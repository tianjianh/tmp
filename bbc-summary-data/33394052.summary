Police said the pilot, in his 60s, and his passenger, in his 50s, died when their microlight crashed at Enstone Airfield, near Chipping Norton, shortly after 19:00 BST on Friday.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is on the scene.
Both victims' next of kin have been told, but their identities have not been disclosed.
Mick Clarke, from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue, said: "This was a tragic incident that has led to two lives being lost. Our thoughts are with the family of those involved."
The aerodrome has declined to comment while investigation work is carried out.
The small airfield near the village of Enstone was originally built by the RAF during World War Two and is now regularly used by civilian light aircraft.
