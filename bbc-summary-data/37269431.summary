Women's Super League One: Reading Women 0-3 Chelsea Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea Ladies kept pressure on leaders Manchester City in the race for the Women's Super League One title with a comfortable victory at winless Reading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Katie Chapman headed in Karen Carney's free-kick to put Chelsea ahead, before Gemma Davison's classy finish and Ana Borges' low strike sealed it late on.
Reading remain second from bottom, six points above Doncaster Rovers Belles.
Chelsea must now win at City when they meet on Sunday, 25 September to have any hope of retaining the title.
Emma Hayes' side could have won by a greater margin at Adam's Park, but Gilly Flaherty headed wide and the Royals' goalkeeper Mary Earps denied Claire Rafferty early on.
Victory means Chelsea will secure qualification for the 2017-18 Champions League competition if they pick up two points from their final three matches of the season.
