Joe Copson, who was passing through the area, shot the footage on Saturday as police were called in to deal with three cows on the loose near the A140 Ipswich Road.
Two cows were shot dead by police marksmen in the "interests of public safety", a police spokesman said. A third was found dead soon afterwards, but it is not yet known how it died.
