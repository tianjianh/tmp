The Red Lion in Oakley Green, near Windsor, was registered as a community asset in March in a bid to protect it from development.
Punch Taverns is now selling the pub, which remains open, and community interest groups have until 14 July to confirm their interest.
According to a residents' association, a group of locals are hoping to run it as a co-operative.
Under Community Right To Buy legislation, any interested party would have six months from the deadline to put together a bid.
In a newsletter, the Oakley Green, Fifield and District Community Association said: "The wheels are in motion and various organisations have been identified as potential sources of funding.
"At some stage there may be an opportunity for local residents to buy shares in the business."
Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead communities councillor Samantha Rayner, said: "One of the Royal Borough's manifesto commitments is to support residents to access the government's Pub Loan Fund."
The government's pub loan fund, launched in September last year, is aimed at helping community groups take over the running of their locals by providing loans to carry out feasibility studies, pay for lawyers or buy refurbishment materials.
According to the local Campaign for Real Ale, there are nine pubs in Windsor and Maidenhead listed as community assets.
