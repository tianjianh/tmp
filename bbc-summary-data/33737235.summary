[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paralympian Simon Richardson admitted he was "terrified" about getting back on a bike for the first time since he was hit by a drink-driver in 2011.

Mr Richardson believed he would never ride again after the incident during training for London 2012.
But four months after an operation to put metal supports in his back, he is riding again.
Around 100 cyclists took part in the 36km and 60km fundraisers near his home in Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan.
Before taking to the road, he said: "I am terrified. It is the first time since 2011 that I have been back on the road and the ride also goes very close to where the accident happened.
"So it seems like I am facing everything in one."
While he has ridden a trike since the collision, this was the first time he has got on a specially adapted road bike.
The married father-of-two, 48, plans to start racing again, with rides across the USA and Land's End to John O'Groats in his sights.
The event, called Cycle for Simon, was organised by friends of the Beijing Paralympics double gold and silver medallist. They hope to raise Â£1,000 to fund a specialist gym and rehabilitation equipment for him.
Edward Adams was jailed for 18 months in 2012 for dangerous driving after he hit Mr Richardson, sending him 26m (85ft) along the A48 near Bridgend.
