Keziah Flux-Edmonds was found unconscious next to her father Darren, in East Cowes.
A post-mortem two months ago failed to establish a cause of death, but police launched a murder investigation on 3 June.
At the time of Keziah's death, her mother Nikki said she had been a "child full of happiness".
The funeral took place at St Thomas' Church in Newport at 12:00 BST.
Ms Flux-Edmonds said: "She was the beat of my heart. Without her I no longer live, I merely exist."
Mr Flux-Edmond, 44, was declared dead at the scene and a coroner confirmed he hanged himself.
The bodies of the family's two dogs were also found in the house.
After Keziah's death was announced, about 200 people attended a vigil in Cromwell Avenue, where she was discovered.
Mrs Flux-Edmonds added: "She loved school and had many friends. It was said she was constantly smiling and was always busy, which earned her the nickname Bumblebee."
"Her greatest desire was to sing Katy Perry's song, Roar, on Britain's Got Talent and she would practise every day so she would be perfect and wouldn't be buzzed off."
