Cheltenham midfielder Kyle Storer was sent off for lashing out at James Jones in the first half and the hosts still managed to take the lead through Billy Waters.
But Jones had the final say when he finished a well-worked move after 73 minutes.
Waters missed a good chance in the 33rd minute, but he rolled his shot past the post after James Dayton's cross found him in the six-yard box.
The 10 men went closest to opening the scoring before half-time when Dayton's corner found Aaron Downes, whose header was cleared off the line by Oliver Turton.
Alex Kiwomya set up Ryan Lowe for a chance in the 56th minute, but Russell Griffiths blocked the shot, which was straight at him.
Cheltenham took the lead two minutes later as Rob Dickie's close range attempt was well saved by Ben Garratt, but Waters followed up to score his sixth goal of the season.
Harry Davis saw a shot bounce just wide in the 69th minute as Crewe searched for an equaliser, which eventually came when Cooper set up Jones.
