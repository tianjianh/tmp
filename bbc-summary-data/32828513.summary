Off and running with Scottish horse racing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Horse racing in Scotland appears to be in a strong position, with an estimated total economic impact of more than £260m. So how does the industry plan to stay ahead of the field in the aftermath of hard economic times?

"I believe very strongly we're in the entertainment business," says Sam Morshead, general manager of Perth Racecourse.
He is speaking in a quiet moment ahead of racing at the three-day Perth Festival. It marks the start of a season which runs through to September.
As well as the racing, it is a chance for many in the tight-knit horse racing community - jockeys, trainers and stable staff - to meet and catch up.
For the public, there's food and entertainment on offer, like a small group of Samba dancers in vibrant costumes mingling with day trippers, corporate guests and more serious punters.
"We make a fantastic day out, with racing in the background - that's my philosophy," continues Mr Morshead.
"There's horse racing going on but there's lots else going on. Everyone knows it's got to be fun."
The turnover of the business is about £3m, of which £800,000 goes straight back into prize money.
The place is probably busy once or twice a week all through the year, with conferences and other non-race day business.
Mr Morshead says he thinks it is beginning to be accepted that more has to be done to attract people.
"Racing's at a difficult stage in its evolution," he explains. "There's a lot more betting on sports, betting on football and rugby and snooker and so the betting share is dropping and that's a threat.
"We have to counteract that by getting more footfall and more people through the gates, to spread the word that it is a fantastic sport, very entertaining and a great way to spend an afternoon."
Perth is one of five Scottish racecourses - along with Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso and Musselburgh - each of which has its own personality.
Last year nearly 300,000 people attended across all the race courses at 101 fixtures.
A 2010 economic impact study conducted by Scottish Racing, the marketing and promotional arm of the Scottish courses, concluded that total direct and indirect spending by race-goers was worth about £67.5m.
"We're always very pleased to hear that various hotels in Perth have run out of beer on race night and that has happened quite regularly," says Mr Morshead.
"There's a huge influx of people, they're all staying, they're all buying food, our impact is very significant on the local economy on race days."
Another important part of the mix is sponsorship or partnership.
"We get fantastic feedback when we take clients out and entertain them," says George Stubbs of GS Group.
From time to time the company sponsors a race or meeting or event. He sees it as a way to improve its local and wider profile.
"I think that as the economy has turned, you'll find that a lot more companies are beginning to spend and open up their entertainment budgets again," he said.
"It's a great way to do business because without spending time with clients you don't really get to know them, you don't get to know their businesses."
Alongside the corporate entertainment, the bookies are of course very much in evidence at racetracks across the country.
At Perth, most of them congregate down one end of the track, their stands laid out in rows, according to which pitch they have bought - front or back row.  As race time approaches, odds are shouted out even louder and money changes hands at a swifter pace.
"Obviously it's like a shop on the High Street, isn't it," explains bookie John Caulder. "If you're stuck up a lane it's not as good as the front."
He has been a bookie for 38 years and goes round the courses in Scotland and quite a few in northern England.
Being a successful bookie, he explains, can be a lot to do with location. He has just bought a front-row pitch at Perth and that makes it worth his while coming to a midweek race day. At some courses these pitches can cost thousands of pounds.
But do people still have money to bet?
"Yes they've got money to bet and money to drink," says Mr Caulder.
But he sounds a note of caution. "See the likes of five or six years ago, turnover's down quite a bit since then. Our turnover's down about a third and expenditure creeps up. It's going the wrong way."
What the punters have come to see, of course, are the horses. This Perth meeting has attracted not only local trainers but some from other areas including the Scottish Borders, Yorkshire and the south west of England.
"You obviously pick the best race for your horses," says Gordon Elliot, a trainer who has travelled by ferry from Ireland.
He is a regular at the track which he considers to be a lucky one for him. He's been training since 2006 and now works with about 100 horses. He has brought six over with him to Perth.
"You don't just come to Perth because it's a great craic, it's about finding the right race for your horse to try and win. Prize money is a massive help but to be fair they do a good job here."
Like any business, he is trading off his reputation. "If you're not training winners, you don't get horses," he adds.
There are something like 70 horses at this particular day's racing and a similar number for the following two days.
Organising all this is a real exercise in logistics. Humans and horses have to be catered for, fed and bedded and race day itself organised.
"We start at six o'clock in the morning with the ground staff and we go round and check that everything's all right," says Harriet Graham, clerk of the course at Perth.
Her role includes ensuring that races get off on time and overseeing horse and human welfare. There is a one-minute response time for any injuries.
"I always say to all the ground staff, if we've had a boring day that's great because it means we've had no injuries, no dramas - but you never know with horses what's going to happen next," she says.
"You'll think you've crossed everything and then you get one that gets frightened about something, maybe it's just someone with a screaming baby.
"So yes, there's anticipation - but slightly nervous anticipation - and certainly at the end of the day when the last person goes, there's a wee bit of a sigh of relief."
