The Swans have not won or scored in any of their last three games and were knocked out of the League Cup by Championship side Hull City on Tuesday.
Swansea's last victory was the 2-1 win over Manchester United on 30 August.
"We always react well when we have setbacks. It is the nature of the sport that we're in," Monk said.
"There's no worry whatsoever," he added.
Monk described the 1-0 loss at Watford on 12 September as a "poor afternoon" but his side responded with a 0-0 draw against Everton the following weekend.
"We've had good performances in all those games apart from Watford," Monk said.
"Midweek against Hull we were the better team and should have really won that game. Overall it was a very good performance.
"We've had one league loss this season so let's not forget that."
