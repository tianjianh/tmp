Eaton Square made it to the top of the property stack based on recorded land registry prices.
Built in the 19th Century around a private garden, it features stucco white facades and is handy for Knightsbridge and Chelsea.
It is one of three squares developed by the Grosvenor family following the end of the Napoleonic wars and the conversion of Buckingham House into a palace for King George IV.
Eaton Square takes its name from Eaton Hall in Cheshire, the country home of the Duke of Westminster.
It has boasted numerous famous residents including ex-prime ministers Neville Chamberlain and  Stanley Baldwin as well as actress Vivien Leigh, former Bond star Sean Connery and TV cook Nigella Lawson.
A £55m seven bedroom terrace, complete with a winter garden and retractable glass ceiling, on Eaton Square was the most-viewed home for online property website Rightmove in 2016.
The townhouse, which is listed with Knight Frank, also comes with a swimming pool, six bathrooms and a double garage.
Outside London, addresses in Surrey and Oxshott - the home of Wimbledon champion and Sports Personality of the Year Andy Murray - feature in the top 20 most expensive residential streets, along with Poole and Oxford.
North of London, England's most expensive address is Park Lane, Altrincham, with an average property price of just over £2m.
Wales has two streets with average property prices in excess of £1m - Llys Helyg Drive in Llandudno, where homes typically fetch £1,064,000, and St Anne's Close in Swansea where average properties go for £1,029,000.
Scotland figures were produced by the Bank of Scotland. Although the top spot went to a street leading to the first tee of St Andrew's Old Course, 10 of Scotland's most expensive streets are in Edinburgh.
Forecasters at the Royal Chartered Institute of Surveyors are predicting a 3% typical price rise for houses next year, in spite of Brexit uncertainties.
The Nationwide Building Society is more cautious, estimating prices will grow at 2%, fuelled by continuing low interest rates.
