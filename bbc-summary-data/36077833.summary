[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Pask's death was initially referred to the coroner after his body was found in his flat in Evington, Leicester, on 10 March.
Leicestershire Police said it took a 46-year-old man into custody on Sunday on suspicion of Mr Pask's murder.
The suspected cause of his death has not been released.
Det Insp Martin Smalley said: "His death was initially referred to the coroner, and we were asked to carry out further enquiries on their behalf.
"It is now a police investigation."
Police said the death is still being treated as unexplained and they are trying to establish Mr Pask's movements in the weeks and days before his body was discovered.
He was described as a "devoted husband" and "loving dad" of two children in a newspaper obituary.
Police said he regularly attended Trinity Life Church in Upper Tichbourne Street, Leicester, and The Salvation Army in Kildare Street.
