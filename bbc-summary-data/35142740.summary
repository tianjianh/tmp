Rescuers are trying to reach a passenger ship which is adrift in rough seas off of Indonesia with more than 100 people on board.

Authorities on Sulawesi island said that the ship was reported to have been hit by high waves and its engine had broken down.
Six rescue vessels have been despatched but are being hampered by bad weather.
Local search and rescue agency chief Roki Asikin said they were due to reach the ship early on Sunday.
There is no word yet of any casualties.
Officials said the last contact from the ship's captain said that water was beginning to enter the vessel.
The ship left Kolaka in south-east Sulawesi province with 118 passengers and crew on Saturday morning local time, officials said, and was bound for the port of Siwa across the Gulf of Boni.
Transport ministry spokesman JA Barata said a distress signal was sent out later in the day saying the ship had "had an accident as a result of large waves".
Indonesia has more than 17,000 islands linked by ferry services, but correspondents say the industry has a poor safety record.
