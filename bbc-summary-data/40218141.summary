General Election 2017: Memorable moments around England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the country faces up to a hung parliament following an election which saw Theresa May's Conservatives stumble and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour surge, here are some other unforgettable things that happened around England on election night and the morning after.

The Conservative MP for North East Somerset arrived at the count fully stocked up with sandwiches, all tidily packed up in plastic boxes. And what delights were within? Turkey, egg and cress - and tongue.
"I didn't make them myself," he said, without telling us who did.

What happens when no-one wins an election?
In Maidenhead, Berkshire, Lord Buckethead finished seventh out of the 13 candidates who stood in the prime minister's constituency with 249 votes. It was the third time he'd gone up against a prime minister - standing against Margaret Thatcher in 1987 in Finchley and John Major in 1992 in Huntingdonshire.
His policies included bringing back Ceefax.

Political artist Kaya Mar wields a painting of Theresa May, Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox. Not sure why the men appear to be naked.
Independent candidate for Cumbria's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency Paul Ellis, also known as Mr Fish Finger, puts a cheery thumbs up at Kendal Leisure Centre at the Westmorland and Lonsdale count.
He managed to win 309 votes, prompting international bafflement. A tweet from Spain said:" ¿Por qué tan poquitos?" or "why so few?"
Why indeed.
Understandably, the street on the day after an election is a hive of activity, with the media gathered outside Number 10. Less frenzied are the two resident cats - Larry from the prime minister's abode and Palmerston from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
No matter the outcome of the election and who's in power, the cats remain in their homes. They just have a change of staff.
Larry has even been tweeting:
