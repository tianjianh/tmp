The 21-year-old was the joint top scorer at this summer's Olympic Games with six goals as his Germany side lost the final to hosts Brazil.
Gnabry joined the Gunners in 2011 and made 18 appearances for the club, scoring once.
Reports on Tuesday suggested the player would join Bayern Munich before being loaned to Bremen.
However, the club's sporting director Frank Baumann has denied any other club is involved in the transfer: "There aren't any agreements with other clubs."
Gnabry said: "Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil have only said positive things about the club.
"I'm confident we'll have a successful season and push for the top half of the table.
"I had very good talks with the management and that has led me here."
