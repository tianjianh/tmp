A witness in the Rotherham child sexual exploitation trial said Karen McGregor, 58, told her to "earn her keep" while being fed and clothed at her home.
Ms MacGregor is standing trial in connection with the alleged sexual abuse of children in Rotherham over a period of more than 10 years.
She and six other defendants deny more than 60 charges.
The witness, who cannot be named due to the nature of the allegations, told Sheffield Crown Court Ms MacGregor "was always bringing back Asian men".
The witness said Ms MacGregor was "very nice at first, helpful and friendly, after time that changed and she indicated girls needed to earn their keep".
She continued: "I took that to mean sleep with Asian men, she wanted to pimp everyone out."
The witness told how on one occasion she had woken up to find five or six men in the bedroom where she was sleeping.
"I remember one of them sat over me instigating sex," the court heard. "Karen said 'Don't worry, it'll be all right - I'll sort it'".
Asked by prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC how she reacted, the witness said: "I was freaking out".
Arshid Hussain, 40, High Street, East Cowick, Goole, faces 30 charges, including five counts of rape.
Qurban Ali, 53, Clough Road, Rotherham, faces four charges, including rape and conspiracy to rape.
Majid Bostan, 37, Ledsham Road, Rotherham faces one charge of indecent assault.
Sajid Bostan, 38,  Broom Avenue, Rotherham faces seven charges, including four counts of rape,.
Basharat Hussain, 39, of no fixed abode, faces 15 charges including two counts of rape.
Karen MacGregor, 58,  Barnsley Road, Wath, South Yorkshire, faces four charges, including conspiracy to rape.
Shelley Davies, 40, Wainwright Road, Kimberworth Park, Rotherham, faces three charges, including conspiracy to rape.
Defending Ms MacGregor, Robert Wynn Jones questioned the witness's ability to recall the events in question saying her memory was "fuzzy" and that the alleged incident did not take place.
He said: "Social Services knew you were living at Karen's house and you had regular contact with social workers, the police and your mother knew where you were".
Prosecutors allege the seven people on trial played roles in the sexual exploitation of children between 1987 and 2003.
It is claimed the children were "targeted, sexualised and, in some instances, subjected to acts of a degrading and violent nature".
The trial continues.
