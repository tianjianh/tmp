[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A member of the public who called 999 over an injured pigeon has been criticised by emergency services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Midlands Ambulance staff received the call on Wednesday after someone spotted the pigeon looking unwell.
A spokesman for the service said the call was "unbelievable" and "a waste of time which used up an emergency phone line".
"We didn't send an ambulance because we're here for people, not animals," the spokesman said.
The service - which covers Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Coventry, and the Birmingham and Black Country area - advised that anyone concerned about an animal should watch it to see how badly it is hurt, and contact the RSPCA or take it to a vet or wildlife rehabilitator.
