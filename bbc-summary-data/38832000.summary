[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swimming pool proposed for historic Carbisdale Castle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A swimming pool is among changes proposed to what was once one of Scotland's most spectacular youth hostels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carbisdale Castle, which overlooks the Kyle of Sutherland in the Highlands, was shut down about three years ago.
The Scottish Youth Hostels Association (SYHA) had to close it because of rising repair costs.
Last year, it was sold for an undisclosed sum and is to be turned into a private residence.
The swimming pool has been proposed as part of a new terraced area at the castle. A gym, jacuzzi and new bedrooms are also planned.
The proposals have been submitted with Highland Council for consideration.
The Dowager Duchess of Sutherland had Carbisdale Castle built between 1907 and 1917 following the death of her husband, George Granville William Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Third Duke of Sutherland.
Lady Mary was the duke's second wife and after he died she became embroiled in a legal dispute over his will with her stepson, the fourth Duke of Sutherland.
Following the family feud, it was dubbed the Castle of Spite and, according to local legend, is haunted by a female ghost called Betty.
The castle was bought by a Scots-Norwegian family in 1933 and was used as a refuge for the Norwegian royal family during World War Two.
