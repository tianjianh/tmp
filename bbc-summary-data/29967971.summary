The boy was waiting for a bus near Manchester Art Gallery when he was sprayed with a lit aerosol on 1 November.
The cadet, who had been selling poppies for the Royal British Legion, suffered singed hair and reddening of the face.
Police said they are keeping an "open mind" as to the motive.
Det Insp Liam Boden said the man, who was captured on CCTV, was "seen in the vicinity of the attack and we believe he may have crucial information".
"This attack has prompted worldwide media interest and there has been a lot of speculation about possible motive.
"I want to be clear that we are still keeping an open mind about what motivated the offender."
He said the "very serious incident left a courageous young man shocked and upset and we need to find the offender, so I would urge anyone who has information to come forward".
His attacker, who walked off, was described as black or Asian, average height and wearing a dark hooded top.
