However, a Facebook page set up as part of efforts to find him, said he had been found on Saturday.
Mr Stewart had been working on a contract in Bhogpur in India before his disappearance.
His family and friends had made contact with the Foreign Office after becoming increasingly concerned when he failed to make contact by his  birthday on Thursday.
