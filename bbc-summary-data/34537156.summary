Work has started on dismantling the remains of two of Glasgow's Red Road flats after they failed to fall in last weekend's massive demolition explosion.

A controlled explosion was intended to bring down six tower blocks, but substantial parts of two of the buildings remained in place.
High-reach machinery is now being used to bring down the top storeys.
Some local residents had voiced their concern over the safety of the operation ahead of Sunday's demolition.
Glasgow Housing Associaiton (GHA) said the blowdown "'didn't go completely to plan".
Contractor Safedem started dismantling 123 Petershill Court, with the work involving weakening the steel frame enough to enable it to be brought down to ground level under controlled conditions.
A exclusion zone within the site has been set up so that parts of the structure can be dismantled safely.
A GHA spokesman said: "Although two of the blocks did not fall exactly as predicted on Sunday, all blocks are now at a height that the demolition can be completed as planned.
"The contractor has now begun work on dismantling the remaining floors of the blocks. This work will be carried out under strict health and safety conditions and with minimum disruption to residents."
