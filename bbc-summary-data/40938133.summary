Super 8s: Hull FC 18-46 Huddersfield Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Challenge Cup finalists Hull FC fell to a heavy home defeat by Huddersfield Giants.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors led at the break after two tries from Darnell McIntosh and efforts from Lee Gaskell and Alex Mellor, while retiring back-rower Gareth Ellis and Jake Connor went over for the hosts.
Tyler Dickinson and Gaskell extended Huddersfield's lead.
Josh Griffin reduced the arrears but Kruise Leeming and Gaskell scored his hat-trick.
It was a hugely disappointing night for the Airlie Birds, who take on Wigan in the Wembley final on Saturday, 26 August.
They twice took the lead, first through Ellis, who was making his 450th Super League appearance and first since announcing he was retiring at the end of the season, and then through Connor but they never recovered after going into the break 10 points down.
The hosts struggled in defence all night and Gaskell's third summed up their night as he touched down after Mahe Fonua spilled a kick in the in-goal area.
Victory for Huddersfield means they are now just three points outside the play-off places with four games to play, while the Black and Whites remain third.
Hull head coach Lee Radford:
"It has made my job [picking a team for the Challenge Cup final] super easy for one or two. This was down to attitude, real plain and simple.
"It took Danny Brough 46 minutes to kick from his own end which tells its own story.
"Huddersfield ran harder than we hit. And it is a really simple game when you break it down like that."
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone:
"A few weeks ago we played Hull here in a bit of a knock them down, drag them out affair.
"We learned a bit from that game and tried to play through them a bit more. We got some good results with that and the boys stayed at the plan which was nice.
"Our ball control was better and the result showed in the end."
