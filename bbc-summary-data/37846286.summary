A photographer's work has captured the decline of Glasgow's tower blocks from their heyday at the forefront of modernist architecture.
Chris Leslie spoke to former residents while documenting this part of the city's social history.
High rise flats were built across the city, following the clearance of slum areas in the post-war period.
As the continues its latest phase of redevelopment, the effect on communities in Dalmarnock, Gallowgate, Oatlands, Plean Street, the Red Road and Sighthill has been photographed.
