Birmingham pub bombing victims inquest call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The families of three people killed in the 1970s IRA pub bombings in Birmingham have called for their inquests to be resumed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Relatives of Maxine Hambleton, Trevor Thrupp and James Craig have made an application to the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull.
Coroner Louise Hunt will hear submissions on 12 February before making a decision on 24 February.
Twenty-one people died and 182 were hurt in the blast on 21 November 1974.
An inquest was opened days after the attack but closed without hearing evidence in 1975 after guilty verdicts saw six men jailed.
Their convictions were quashed in 1991 and the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Barbara Mills, placed a 75-year embargo on files relating to a Devon and Cornwall Police inquiry into the West Midlands Police investigation.
It means those files are not due to be released until 2069.
In March 2015, Justice 4 the 21 campaign group met Home Secretary Theresa May and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers to lobby for an inquest. An application for a fresh inquest was also lodged with the Attorney General.
Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was the youngest of those who died, said they want justice for their loved ones.
"All we want is one thing - justice. No more, no less," she said.
"We don't want money, we don't want an apology. All we want is justice.
"We are not political, but they've made it political because they have the key to the door."
