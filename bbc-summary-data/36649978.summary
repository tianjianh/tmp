McAree took up the post last October following the departure of Darren Murphy, having previously served as first team coach.
The former Swifts midfielder led the club to a seventh-placed finish in the Irish Premiership last season.
"It gives me confidence to know that the board have faith in what I'm doing," stated McAree.
"Now it is my job to do my best for the club as we try to improve and target a major trophy."
McAree has already secured the signatures of local players Christopher Hegarty and Seanan Clucas, both of whom came through the Dungannon United Youth set-up before going on to play cross-channel football.
