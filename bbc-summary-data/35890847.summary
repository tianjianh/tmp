Aberdeen: McInnes will not face touchline ban after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has been successful in his appeal against a one-match touchline ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McInnes was offered a one-match touchline ban after he was sent to the stand during Aberdeen's victory at Dundee United earlier this month.
The punishment has been reduced on appeal to a one-match suspended ban until the end of the season.
McInnes will now be free to take his place in the dugout for Aberdeen's next match at home to Hamilton on 3 April.
