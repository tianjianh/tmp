There are more than 1,000 Amazon Lockers in locations such as shopping centres, convenience stores, airports, train stations, and universities.
They enable customers who are unable to wait at home for orders to collect them from a location of their choice.
Amazon customers receive a unique barcode, which they enter or scan to retrieve their product at the locker.
Trevor Strain, chief financial officer of Morrisons, said he believed the option to pick items up "from one of our hundreds of conveniently located supermarkets will be attractive".
Meanwhile Amazon said the supermarkets were in "ideal locations" for customers to collect their items.
