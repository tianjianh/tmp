One-Day Cup: Middlesex denied by rain after making total against Sussex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Higgins' 48 off 23 balls propelled Middlesex to their joint third highest List A score of 341-5 but persistent rain saw their One-Day Cup match against Sussex abandoned.

Higgins shared a 78-run sixth-wicket stand with John Simpson (82 not out) as the hosts bludgeoned 119 runs off the final 10 overs at Lord's.
Sussex captain Luke Wright was then caught behind off paceman Tom Helm.
But rain forced the players off after only four overs of Sussex's innings.
Middlesex's attacking intent was highlighted by opener Paul Stirling (71) hitting the second ball of the match for six.
Wicketkeeper Simpson shared a fifth-wicket stand of 177 with James Franklin (69) reignited their innings before the latter was bowled by Ajmal Shahzad (2-88).
Although Simpson was the set batsman, 22-year-old Higgins executed his shots brilliantly - hitting 24 off the final over - as he smashed Shahzad for two huge maximums.
With Sussex needing to make a fast start, Helm - tipped to be a future England talent - got the ball to nip back in to dismiss Wright but the weather denied Middlesex victory for the second time in four days, after their Championship game with Essex was drawn.
