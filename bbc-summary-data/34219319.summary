The education department said previously French was taught from year five and above, but it will now start in year three.
In the department's annual report, Education Director Justin Donavan said the goal was for children to learn French from year one to year 11.
He said this would still happen in the future when resources were available.
French has been taught from a younger age in a select number of primary schools in the past, but only where they have French language speakers available.
Mr Donovan said they were also investigating the opening of a French language secondary school in Jersey.
A department spokesman said: "Education, Sport and Culture is committed to improving the teaching of French in States of Jersey schools.
"From September 2015 the provision of French teaching in Primary school is extended to at least four year groups.
"The longer term ambition is to teach French from Years 1 to 6 in Primary, and Years 7-11 in Secondary education."
English and French are both official languages in Jersey with prayers in parliament said in French.
