Steven Davies: Wicketkeeper-batsman to leave Surrey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wicketkeeper-batsman Steven Davies will leave Surrey at the end of the season after turning down a new two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old England international has scored 10,635 runs in all formats of the game for The Oval side
Davies, who joined Surrey from Worcestershire in 2009, has also taken 322 catches and made 36 stumpings.
Ben Foakes has been first-choice keeper this season and Surrey say Davies has decided he would be "afforded greater opportunities" elsewhere.
Davies played eight one-day internationals and five Twenty20 matches for England between March 2009 and February 2011.
He has been an ever-present for Surrey in the One-Day Cup this season, scoring 373 runs at an average of 41.44 to help the club reach Saturday's final against Warwickshire.
Surrey already have ready-made batting replacements for Davies, having agreed contracts with Durham's Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick.
