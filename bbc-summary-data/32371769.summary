Weston-super-Mare's new beach huts go up for auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first batch of soon-to-be installed Weston-super-Mare beach huts have gone on sale via an online auction site.

One-year leases on 24 unfurnished huts - all in pastel shades of blue, green and lilac - on the promenade at Royal Sands are available.
North Somerset Council has permission to put up more than 100 huts along the seafront, each with no fixed price.
However, some residents are concerned they will be too expensive and could ruin the views along the promenade.
One woman, who did not want to be named, told the BBC: "In Eastbourne, Brighton, and places like that, they've got different ones and I just think it ruins it.
"Because they're all different colours and some people look after them, some don't. Some are quite an eyesore."
North Somerset Council said the first auction would take place between 20 and 25 April.
Other leases will be auctioned off every day from 27 April.
The council said it was hoping to install the huts in the first week of May.
Nick Yates, from the local authority, said the huts would "add something extra" to Weston, whilst raising money for the council and enhancing the seafront.
"We've had over 800 expressions of interest [so far]," he added.
"We think that by having this licensing agreement for a year and doing it on an online auction, it gives the greatest number of people the best chance of having one."
Mr Yates said renting the huts on a day-by-day basis to individuals, like some other seaside resorts, would be "too costly" and "personnel intensive."
The first auction sale began on Monday evening and is due to end on Saturday.
