The owners of a mill in Cheshire where four works died in an explosion have been branded disrespectful for building a new silo without planning permission.

The blast at Wood Flour Mills last July killed Derek Moore, Dorothy Bailey, William Barks and Jason Shingler.
David Rutley MP said Wood Treatments Limited had "ridden roughshod over the feelings" of the families.
The firm has refused to comment, but council bosses said planning permission had been sought retrospectively.
Jim Randall, Mr Moore's brother-in-law was unhappy the silo had gone up without permission, calling it "very unfair".
"We were told that things would be done properly from now on and clearly they are still not being done right are they?" he said.
Linda Cooper-Whyte, whose house overlooks the new silo, said it "speaks volumes about the Bodens Group", which owns Wood Treatments Limited.
She said they "must have known from the height and the size of it" that it needed permission and "they have a blatant disregard for all the rules and regulations".
Cheshire East Council confirmed it had received a retrospective planning application.
A month after the explosion 20 staff were made redundant by the mills owners, a move that was condemned by the then leader of Cheshire East Council Michael Jones.
Temperatures reached 1,000C in the the fire that followed blast, which was described by rescuers as the "worst incident of its kind" in a decade.
A four-storey building at the site was completely destroyed in the explosion.
