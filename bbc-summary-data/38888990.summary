[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marnick Vermijl is a doubt with a hernia problem, while Alex Baptiste remains out with his knee injury.
Birmingham are without midfielder David Davis, who is suspended after his 10th booking of the season in Friday night's 3-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday.
Clayton Donaldson (ankle), Michael Morrison (groin), Ryan Shotton (groin) and Jacques Maghoma (knee) are all out.
But Robert Tesche is likely to be available again, after missing Friday's defeat with a sore ankle.
