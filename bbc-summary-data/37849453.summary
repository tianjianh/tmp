[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal Clarence Hotel, which dates back to 1769, was destroyed in a major blaze, but the shell of the building had remained in place.
Structural engineers have been assessing the site since Sunday and after discussions with the fire service, demolition team and insurers, the demolition started at 15:30 GMT.
An area around the hotel in the city centre has been fenced off.

The fire started at about 05:30 BST last Friday, above the Castle Fine Art gallery where renovation work was under way.
It then spread to the Well House Tavern, a cafe, and the Royal Clarence.
The exterior walls of the hotel were all that was left. They have been monitored by lasers to detect any movement over the past few days.
Nearly six days after the start of the fire, crowds were still gathering around the site on Cathedral Green.
