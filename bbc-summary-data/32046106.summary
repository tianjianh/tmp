Nigeria striker Oshoala was lively before meeting a Gemma Bonner cross to volley home just before the break.
Oshoala cut the ball back for Fara Williams to make it 2-0 before Aoife Mannion gave Birmingham late hope.
Liverpool's first win of 2015 was overshadowed as Kate Longhurst went off on a stretcher with concussion.
The forward received lengthy treatment on the pitch following a clash of heads with Remi Allen.
Defeat for Birmingham leaves them winless in the league, although they have already ended Liverpool's FA Cup hopes with a 3-1 fifth-round win at Damson Park.
Liverpool striker Asisat Oshoala:
"I feel very happy and excited about the goal and the victory for the team.
"It's very nice for me hearing them singing my name. It's a crazy atmosphere. I have never seen supporters like this and I have been playing football for quite a long time now. The supporters here are awesome, they are great people.
"It's been a difficult start to the season but I believed we would bounce back. We showed the spirit here is very high, and we are really giving everything."
Birmingham City boss David Parker:

"The first goal is always crucial and giving them the goal at such a crucial time was poor game management.
"We should never have allowed them that opportunity. We should have gone into half-time at 0-0 and taken it from there.
"It's the things we absolutely preach to the players, and that's what makes it most frustrating. They are our basics as a football club, we play in a certain way, and the players have done the opposite to that at times and got themselves into trouble as a result."
