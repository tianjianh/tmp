[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robert Thornton boosted his Premier League survival chances by taking three points from his two matches in Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Playing twice having missed an earlier round through illness, the Scot beat Michael Smith and then drew with group leader Michael van Gerwen.
Those results put Thornton one point ahead of Smith and Dave Chisnall.
Two of that trio will exit the competition when the 10-man field is cut to eight in Cardiff on 31 March.
Van Gerwen, Phil Taylor and Gary Anderson are in a three-way tie at the top of the table after Taylor drew with Peter Wright and Anderson defeated Chisnall.
Adrian Lewis occupies fourth spot following his win over Raymond van Barneveld.
Michael Smith 5-7 Robert Thornton
Gary Anderson 7-4 Dave Chisnall
Adrian Lewis 7-5 Raymond van Barneveld
Phil Taylor 6-6 Peter Wright
Michael van Gerwen 6-6 Robert Thornton
