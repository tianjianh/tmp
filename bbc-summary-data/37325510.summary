[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Eaves' second-half goal proved enough to hand Yeovil Town their first win in six League Two matches as they claimed maximum points at Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Glovers broke the deadlock when Otis Khan took a short corner and - with the O's defence slow to react - the ball reached the unmarked Eaves who was left to head home from close range.
The opening half got off to a slow start with little to show for it from either side.
Nathan Smith enjoyed the best opportunity for the visitors when his angled effort was collected by Alex Cisak at the near post, whilst at the opposite end, Liam Kelly's powerful drive from 20 yards went narrowly over the crossbar.
The game improved after the break as a spectacle with the visitors growing in confidence against a lacklustre Orient before Eaves gave headed home to claim them the three points after 76 minutes.
O's only came to life with the introduction of last season's leading striker Jay Simpson, who had missed the past few matches through injury, and he came closest to salvaging a point only for his effort to be cleared off the line on the dying minutes.
Orient left the field to boos with a section of the crowd venting their anger against club owner Francesco Becchetti.
