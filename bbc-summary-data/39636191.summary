The five-time world champion accused World Snooker of bullying after his first-round win at the World Championship on Sunday.
World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn has said the claims are "unfounded".
In a statement released on Tuesday, 41-year-old O'Sullivan said his legal team would address the issues at the end of the tournament at Sheffield's Crucible.
He also said he would make no further comment on the matter during the event, but would focus instead on winning a sixth world title.
"There has been some speculation and commentary around the answers I gave when questioned by the media at my press conference on Sunday.
"Any outstanding issues with the snooker authorities will be addressed by my legal team following the conclusion of this great event, when I hope a sensible resolution can be reached.
"I will not be making any further comment about this during the World Championships. I request the press and media respect this position in all further interviews.
"I wish to focus all my energies on performing to the very best of my ability for the fans in my quest for a sixth world title."
