Neighbours were alerted to the incident at Moylena Grove by smoke alarms at about 04:55 BST. They knocked the door but were unable to contact the woman.
Police arrived and forced their way into the house. They tried to rescue the woman, who could be heard calling for help but were driven back by smoke.
Firefighters using breathing apparatus then entered the house and rescued her.
An ambulance was already at the scene and took the woman, who was seriously ill from smoke inhalation, to hospital.
Fire Service group commander David Heyburn said they had since been told she was in a stable condition.
