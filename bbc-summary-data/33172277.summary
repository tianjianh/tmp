Betsi Cadwaladr health board could be out of special measures in four months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Wales health board could be out of special measures within four months if it shows "a measurable improvement".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deputy health minster Vaughan Gething told The Wales Report programme Betsi Cadwaladr health board must listen to public feedback.
Special measures were imposed earlier this month following a scandal about the treatment of mental health patients on its Tawel Fan ward.
Mr Gething said the board's progress will be reviewed in October.
He said: "If it is going to come out of special measures in four months, then we will have to explain why and what evidence allows us to make that judgement.
"There will be no soft-soaping either. If the board hasn't made the required progress, we won't simply say that everything is fine now, go away."
