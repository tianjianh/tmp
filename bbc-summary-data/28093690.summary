Driver admits causing biker Christopher Davies's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who lost control of his car on a bend and ploughed into a motorcyclist has accepted he was responsible for the fatal crash, Mold Crown Court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Davies, 52, from Holywell in Flintshire died in hospital last August following the collision at nearby Carmel.
On Monday, Gareth Ifan Ritchie pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving during the hearing.
Ritchie will be sentenced in July. He was given an interim driving ban.
The court was told that he was travelling at speeds of between 52 and 63 mph on a 60 mph stretch of the A5026 at Carmel.
As he negotiated a bend, the car drifted across the carriageway into Mr Davies.
The motorcyclist was taken to Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, but died from multiple injuries.
Ritchie, from Caerwys, told police he did not have any memory of the accident, except that the motorcyclist was travelling at speed.
But prosecutor David Mainstone told the court that the speed of the biker was irrelevant.
"The fact is that the defendant lost control of his car and strayed into the opposite lane," he said.
"That is the cause of the accident, not the speed the deceased was travelling at."
Describing the defendant as a man of good character with a clean driving record, his barrister Daniel Oscroft said: "He does not remember the accident at all.
"He knows that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary he must accept the prosecution case."
Sentencing was adjourned until 23 July.
