Coach Alan Curtis says the 2-1 win at Arsenal has given Swansea a selection headache for the visit of Norwich City.

Boss Francesco Guidolin has picked the team to face the Canaries, despite missing Saturday's game as he recovers from a chest infection in hospital.
Curtis, who led the side at Arsenal in Guidolin's absence, revealed there will be changes to the Swans' starting team.
"Francesco has picked the team but once the game starts I have the power to change things," Curtis explained.
"The substitutions certainly will be my responsibility.
"He (Guidolin) is staying (in hospital) over the weekend and I think he may be out on Monday.
Curtis, who said he will speak to Guidolin before Saturday's match, admitted difficult decisions had to be made about selection after six changes were previously made for the win at Arsenal.
"Everybody performed exceptionally well, especially in the second half (at Arsenal)," Curtis added to BBC Wales Sport.
"It's a great problem for us to have and that has been reflected in tomorrow's selection as well.
"There will obviously be changes. The most important thing is we win the game."
Following the win over the Gunners, Swansea face three crucial matches in their battle against relegation from the Premier League, all against teams in the bottom six.
After hosting Norwich, the Swans face Bournemouth away and then bottom club Aston Villa at home.
Wednesday's victory moved Swansea six points above the relegation zone in 16th place.
"We've got a little bit of a gap and breathing space (from the relegation zone) but that could be closed quickly if results go against us," Curtis continued.
"We're concentrating on picking up the three points and steadily getting away from the crowd at the bottom."
