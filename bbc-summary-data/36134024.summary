Major Peake is currently on a six-month tour in space as a crewman on the ISS.
The spaceman said the Scottish capital looked like it was enjoying some good weather - but some people replied that it was a bit cold on the ground.
Major Peake's wife Rebecca grew up in Comrie, Perthshire. His shot of Edinburgh comes the day after he ran a space marathon.
Major Peake ran the distance of the London race on a treadmill on the ISS - in three hours and 35 minutes.
