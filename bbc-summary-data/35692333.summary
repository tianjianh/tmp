Besic, 23, has not been a regular for Everton, making 29 Premier League appearances since joining from Ferencvaros for Â£4.8m in 2014.
Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri has recently bought a 49.9% stake in Everton and promised investment.
Bryan Oviedo signed a new contract this month while Everton are also hopeful of giving Ross Barkley an improved deal.
"When I first arrived here it was difficult for me but now I feel at home," said Besic.
"The supporters, as well as the manager, the staff and my team-mates, have all made me welcome at the club and I feel really happy."
