Heavy rains have been battering Assam and Meghalaya states since Monday, with floods damaging bridges and sweeping away roads and houses.
At least 10 people have died in Meghalaya state.
Earlier this month, more than 270 people were killed by monsoon rains in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Local media reports put the number killed in Meghalaya since Monday at 25, as people were swept away or buried in the debris in North Garo Hills and West Garo Hills district.
The reports said the army had been deployed in the North Garo Hills district, where at least 100 villages have been submerged, and hundreds of villagers had taken shelter in schools and churches located on high ground.
In neighbouring Assam state, troops and federal personnel have rescued scores of people trapped by floodwaters in Goalpara district, local official Pritam Saikia told the Associated Press news agency.
Two days of incessant rains have also led to massive flooding in the state capital, Guwahati - many neighbourhoods are under water and schools and colleges are shut.
The Bharalu river, which runs through Guwahati, is also threatening to breach its banks, as more rains are forecast in the region over the next two days.
In July 2012, floods in Assam killed more than 100 people and forced over five million people to leave their homes.
