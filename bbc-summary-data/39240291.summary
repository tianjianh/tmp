[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead boosted their play-off hopes as they came from behind to score a last-minute winner in a dramatic victory against relegation-threatened Woking.

The Cards took a lead their early dominance deserved when Terell Thomas headed in Fabio Saraiva's 21st-minute corner, with the ball taking a deflection on its way into the net.
The visitors could have extended their lead as they carved out three chances in the space of five minutes, Nathan Ralph firing an effort just wide of the post and then James Montgomery on his toes to keep out shots from Gozie Ugwu and Jamie Lucas, signed on loan from Bristol Rovers on Friday.
Gateshead made a bright start to the second half and equalised in the 52nd minute when Danny Johnson showed great strength to head a bouncing ball into the back of the net.
And with time running out, Wes York converted from close range a cross from substitute Mitch Brundle to ensure the Heed remain unbeaten in eight matches.
