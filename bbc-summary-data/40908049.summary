[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 1-0 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Porter's second-half strike earned Crewe their first win of the campaign as they overcame Barnet at the Alexandra Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Porter made the most of substitute Zoumana Bakayogo's driven cross to poke home in the 75th minute and break the resistance of Bees keeper Jamie Stephens.
In the first half, Stephens was brought into action when he palmed away Porter's header and he also did well to keep out George Cooper's curling effort and Brad Walker's fierce drive from range.
Both sides deployed three at the back and cancelled each other out for long spells, but the match livened up after the break when David Tutonda forced a save from Alex goalkeeper Ben Garratt while Mauro Vilhete's free kick hit a post.
Chris Dagnall was denied on two occasions by Stephens as Crewe looked to extend their lead but the Barnet keeper was finally beaten from close range by Porter, who netted his fourth goal in four games for the hosts.
