Alun Wyn Jones' return to fitness boosts Wales, says Dan Lydiate

Wales will have Alun Wyn Jones back to "where he wants to be" when they face England at Twickenham on Sunday.

The 30-year-old British and Irish Lion has not played since Wales' defeat to Eddie Jones' side in March.
Jones had a heel injury which affected his performances during the Six Nations tournament, and flanker Dan Lydiate is glad to have him back.
"You miss him bossing everyone because he is the yardstick. It's good to have him back," he said.
"He is a machine and plays week in, week out. That was probably his downfall going into the Six Nations, because he never pulls out of a session. He will just keep going.
"He wears his heart on his sleeve and he will never take a step back. He will always get up and give you more, even if he has got nothing left."
Jones will play his 99th game for Wales if selected - and his 104th Test match when you add his five Lions appearances.
The game is a tour warm up for both England and Wales - with Eddie Jones' team taking on Australia next month while Wales have three tests against World Champions New Zealand.
Jones is likely to be named captain at Twickenham in the absence of Sam Warburton who is recovering from a shoulder injury.
Then he will be set to make his 100th appearance for his country at Eden Park on 11 June.
Hooker Scott Baldwin - like Lydiate an Ospreys team-mate of Jones - says the lock has had a big influence in training.
"He's ready to go. Obviously he's back where he wants to be," said Baldwin.
"Seeing him the past couple of weeks he looks fresh, he looks hungry and I think we're going to see 'Big Al' back this weekend.
"He makes a big difference. He's a big character and a big leader in the squad he drives standards; demands high standards.
"If you're not up with him you'll be left behind. So he's a big leader for us."
