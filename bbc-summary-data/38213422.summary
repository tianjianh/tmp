The 21-year-old made his Premier League debut against Burnley in October.
He made his first Saints start against Inter Milan at the San Siro in the Europa League four days later and has now agreed new terms until 2021.
"The last couple of months have been amazing for me and this new contract really just rounds that off," said McQueen.
Southampton's executive director of football Les Reed said: "Having come through the club's academy alongside James Ward-Prowse and Harrison Reed, Sam is yet another example of our philosophy to bring players through from the academy and into the first team."
