Kyle Bartley bundled home a corner as the home side took the lead against the run of play in the first half.
Pablo Hernandez shot wide for the home side from the edge of the box before doubling the lead as he calmly slotted home after a long ball.
Barnsley pulled one back as Leeds defender Charlie Taylor turned Cole Kpekawa's cross into his own net.

Both clubs played for the first time since Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright and Leeds owner Massimo Cellino were named in the Daily Telegraph's investigation into alleged corruption in football.
Wright was sacked on Thursday over claims he took cash for trying to engineer certain transfers - a claim he "categorically denied".
Cellino, meanwhile, was filmed offering undercover reporters, posing as an investment firm, a way to get around FA and Fifa third-party ownership rules. Leeds said the claims were a "non story".
On the field, neither side made the goalkeepers work hard until Bartley got away from Sam Winnall and on to the end of Hernandez's corner.
Hernandez should have doubled the lead early in the second half when he shot just wide from the edge of the area after a defensive mix-up, but made amends four minutes later when he finished well after Eunan O'Kane's long ball.
Chris Wood spurned two great chances to put the game beyond doubt before Taylor's own goal set up a tense finale as Barnsley looked for a winner.
The Tykes stay 10th in the division while Leeds move up to 11th, behind their opponents on goal difference.
Leeds United manager Garry Monk:
"The way we started the second half - that first 20 minutes - was some of the best football we've played. We looked so aggressive and threatening all the time.
"We got the second goal and at that point you can sense blood. We should have got the third that would have killed the game but for one moment we switched off.
"Overall we're very pleased with the result and with the way this period of games has gone.
"It's a shame the international break has come. The last one we went in with a loss and felt it had come at the right time, but now we want the games to keep coming."
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom:
"It's not been a nice week.
"We just got on with it and tried to win, but it's not been nice.
"It was never in doubt that the players would give me application, effort and keep on doing what we do. That's what's brought us success and that's what we'll keep relying on.
"But there's definitely more positives than negatives from that performance."
