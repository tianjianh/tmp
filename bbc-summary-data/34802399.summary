Brian Irvine is among eight winners who have each picked up Â£50,000 from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.
A musician, composer and conductor, Mr Irvine was named as music laureate for Belfast in December 2014.
He is one of three composers from the UK to receive an award in 2015, while the other five recipients are visual artists.
Earlier this year, his opera 'LovegolfLove', written with playwright Owen McCafferty, was performed in Newcastle during the Irish Open.
A former associate composer with the Ulster Orchestra, his work has been performed at festivals across the globe.
He has worked with a number of local organisations, as well as with prisoners, schoolchildren and marching bands, and was responsible for the Northern Ireland concert as part of the cultural Olympiad which accompanied the 2012 Olympic Games.
His forthcoming compositions include No Comply, a musical installation involving skateboarders which is due to be unveiled in March 2016.
Mr Irvine said the award would allow him to work harder and develop more projects.
"It equips me with an opportunity and a financial infrastructure that quadruples my ambition and desire to make the most exciting, engaging, confusing, connecting, ridiculous and beautiful work I can imagine," he added.
The Hamlyn Foundation Award provides financial assistance for artists and composers to develop their careers.
The award winners were announced in London on Thursday, at an event which included a speech by novelist Jeanette Winterson.
