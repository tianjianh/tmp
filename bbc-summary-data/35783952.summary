Lawyers for a second gang member, plumber Hugh Doyle, 49, have already said he will seek to appeal against his conviction for concealing, converting or transferring criminal property. He was jailed for 21 months, suspended for two years.
The ringleaders jailed for seven years each for conspiracy to commit burglary after pleading guilty last year were:
The man described as the mastermind behind the raid, Brian Reader, was too ill to attend the sentencing hearing after a second stroke and will be sentenced later.
Another man, William Lincoln, 60, of Bethnal Green, east was jailed for seven years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
Sentencing the men, Judge Christopher Kinch QC said he did not know if it could be proved as had been claimed in court that it was the "biggest burglary in English history".
But he said: "It is clear that the burglary at the heart of this case stands in a class of its own in the scale of the ambition, the detail of the planning, the level of preparation and the organisation of the team carrying it out, and in terms of the value of the property stolen."
