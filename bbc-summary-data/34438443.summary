Electricity row halts Saltdean Lido restoration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Restoration of a Grade II* listed lido has been put on hold in a row over who will fund an electricity sub-station to power the pool.

Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company (CIC) wants Brighton and Hove City Council to lend it £70,000 to install the sub-station.
It says it cannot allow contractors on to the site next week if it does not have the money
The council said it had offered a top-up loan of £10,000.
The CIC has raised £8m to restore the Lido, which includes more than £4.7m from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Chair Rebecca Crook said that if it had to raise another £70,000 the project would be delayed and the 1930s art deco structure would deteriorate further.
"Until the £70,000 is found to fund the sub-station this remains a building site and doesn't open next summer, so its devastating to the residents and tourists to the city," she said.
"The council aren't necessarily obligated to help us but I think, morally, the tender documents that we read implied that there is power to the site and it has always operated as a swimming pool."
The council's bid information pack states the site has a sub-station. It is unclear when it was removed or by whom.
The CIC halted the project following a meeting with council officials on Friday.
The authority said in a statement: "We have been working in the spirit of partnership with the Saltdean Lido CIC to help progress the work.
"We offered a top-up loan of £10,000 following a meeting with the CIC and ward councillors.
"We don't believe there is any need to loan any more funds.
"We have to be particularly careful about funding as we face a further £68m of government cuts over the next four years."
