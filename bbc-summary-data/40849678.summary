Martyn Waghorn: Ipswich Town sign Rangers striker on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town have signed striker Martyn Waghorn from Rangers on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Waghorn, 27, could make his debut for his new club on Tuesday against Luton Town in the Carabao Cup first round.
After starting his career at Sunderland, he moved to Leicester City before joining Wigan in January 2014.
He then joined Rangers in July 2015, scoring 44 goals in all competitions, including helping the Gers to the Scottish Championship title in 2016.
Waghorn fell out of favour after Pedro Caixinha took over as Rangers manager from Mark Warburton in March.
He made 20 starts last season, scoring seven goals, as the Glasgow outfit finished third in the Premiership.
Waghorn follows former Ibrox team-mate Joe Garner to Portman Road, his fellow forward having scored the only goal as he made his competitive debut in Saturday's opening English Championship win over Birmingham City.
