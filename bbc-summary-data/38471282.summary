The singer, who achieved 11 number one singles and nine top albums as a solo artist and with Wham!, is back posthumously at number eight with greatest hits album Ladies & Gentlemen.
Little Mix's album Glory Days ends the year as the number one album.
Clean Bandit's Rockabye remains at number one in the singles charts for an eighth week.
Michael died aged 53 at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire and police have said that a post-mortem examination into the cause of his death was "inconclusive".
His retrospective album, which topped the chart for eight weeks upon its release in 1998, sees a 5625% surge on sales and streams from last week.
It was already one of the 60 best-selling UK albums of all time and now re-enters the album chart top 10 for the first time in 17 years.
Michael's last album with Wham!, The Final, is at 40, while Twenty Five, Faith, Symphonica and Older have all returned to the top 100.
Four of his singles, including 1987's Faith also return to the top 100 singles chart.
Last Christmas has returned to the top 10 for the first time in 31 years and is the second most-streamed track of the week with 3.6m streams.
Official Charts Company boss Martin Talbot said: "The sudden and terribly sad death of George Michael has naturally prompted his fans to re-explore his rich catalogue again, paying tribute to his incredible talent, both as a solo artist and founder of Wham!.
"Quite appropriately, given the season, it is Last Christmas which makes the biggest impact."
Little Mix's Glory Days, which includes the hit single Shout Out To My Ex, reaches number one for a third time.
Last month it became the fastest-selling album by a British girl group since The Spice Girls' Spiceworld in 1997.
Clean Bandit's Rockabye is the biggest selling single of the week in the UK, with 44,000 downloads and 3.4 million streams. It is also the second-longest running number one of the year behind Drake's One Dance, which claimed the top spot for 15 weeks.
Swedish pop sensation Zara Larsson claims her biggest hit yet as I Would Like rises to number two, beating her previous best effort Lush Life, which reached number three.
