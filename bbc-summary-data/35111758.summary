Car insurance fraud case against Newport woman 'weak'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The case against a woman accused of involvement in a car insurance fraud ring is "weak", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people deny conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth Â£144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011.
Bethan Palmer, 26, of Newport, allegedly helped fake an accident as a passenger in one of two cars.
On Wednesday, her barrister said there is "no direct evidence" the crash did not occur.
Ms Palmer is accused of being involved in faking an accident between a Vauxhall Astra and a Volkswagen Polo.
Her barrister told the jury the "case against her is so weak, that there is nothing to explain".
Ms Palmer has chosen not to give evidence in court and jurors were reminded she was under no obligation to do so.
The court heard she had previously been convicted of drink driving, but before that she "was a young woman of entirely good character".
The case continues.
