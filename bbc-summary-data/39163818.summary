Ademola Lookman is set to return for Everton after being dropped for the defeat at Tottenham, while Enner Valencia is also pressing to start after scoring in that match.

Winger Dominic Calvert-Lewin is back in contention for the Blues after nine weeks out with an ankle injury.
West Brom will again be without winger Matt Phillips due to an ongoing hamstring problem.
The Baggies have no other injury concerns, according to Tony Pulis.
Martin Fisher: "Last week's defeat at Spurs may have ended Everton's nine-game unbeaten run but it hasn't dampened their genuine belief they can grab a top-six spot.
"At home they have been excellent, winning their last four at Goodison, scoring an astonishing 15 goals along the way, with the unstoppable Romelu Lukaku finding the net in each victory.
"The Belgian is well known to Baggies fans after his loan spell there four seasons ago, and the Albion defence will have to be at its miserly best again.
"With his annual target of 40 points safely secured, Tony Pulis now has an additional 10 in his sights as West Brom look to break the 50-point barrier for the first time in their Premier League history."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "I still believe in when we win the next two games at home that still something is possible above us in the table.
"Arsenal are normally strong and have good players, so it will be really tough to catch them. But maybe after six points then we come closer and then maybe something is possible.
"It starts always by yourself, don't look too much to other teams. If you win we come closer and that is the most important."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis on Everton striker Romelu Lukaku: "Everton have spent a lot of money this year and will probably do the same again.
"They've a centre forward who scores most weeks and is one of the best in the Premier League.
"He's (Lukaku) got everything: power and pace, and can cause problems in all areas. He can run at you, can score from crosses and is instinctive as well."
West Brom did not get going against Crystal Palace last weekend and I would expect a response to that defeat from Tony Pulis's side.
