Kuldip Sahota, who has led the Labour-led authority since 2011, said it is the right time to hand over to a new leader amid a "challenging climate".
He said the council had achieved a lot with the town's Southwater shopping development and helping secure a Â£90m army logistics base in Donnington.
A new leader will be elected on 26 May. Mr Sahota will remain as a councillor.

He said: "The last five years has seen this council achieve an incredible amount against a backdrop of the deepest cuts to council budgets ever and the probably the toughest financial outlook this council has ever faced.
"I joined this council aged 50 and next month I mark my 65th birthday.
"I feel it is the right time to hand the reins on to a new leader who can continue to move this council forward in a very challenging climate."
Telford & Wrekin Council leader Kuldip Sahota has announced he is to step down from his position next month.
