[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United 0-0 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-threatened Torquay held promotion chasers Tranmere to a goalless draw at Plainmoor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers predictably had the best of the contest but could not make the most of what was a game in hand over their rivals at the top of the National League.
Jay Harris and Michael Ihiekwe each had an early chance for Tranmere before, midway through the first half, a mix-up between Gulls keeper Brendan Moore and team-mate Myles Anderson almost led to an own goal.
Similarly, shortly before the break, a goalmouth scramble after Moore failed to clear a free-kick nearly saw the visitors go ahead.
Rovers dominated again after the break although Torquay's Damon Lathrope hit the top of the bar with a 25-yard volley.
