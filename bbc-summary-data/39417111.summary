She was struck by the grey Volkswagen Golf as the man tried to make off from the scene in Leigh-on-Sea on Monday.
Officers found the woman, aged in her 30s, with head and facial injuries at The Turnpike shop at about 17:00 BST.
She was taken to hospital where she was also found to have internal injuries. Her baby is thought to be unharmed.
A 25-year-old man was arrested in London on suspicion of dangerous driving and assault.
He is also suspected of fraud by false representation and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.
Essex Police said he was being kept in custody at Southend where he was being questioned and that a car had now been recovered.
Det Insp Stuart Truss said the force was appealing for witnesses.
"The shop was very busy at that time of day and there were also a lot of people in the area who may have seen what happened."
