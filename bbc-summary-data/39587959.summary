It is hoped the redevelopment will attract an extra 28,000 visitors a year to the museum at Stirling Castle.
Yorkshire-based consultants PLB have been appointed exhibition designers for the project.
Prince William launched the Thin Red Line Appeal to secure the museum's future last October.
The Museum Trust said the aim of the project is to "reinterpret the regimental museum for the current era".
The museum, which attracts about 185,000 visitors every year, is based in the A-listed 15th Century Royal Palace known as The King's Old Buildings.
The Trust said the redeveloped museum would place "one of Scotland's greatest regiments more firmly in the context of the nation's story."
The construction work is expected to be completed in early 2019.
PLB's creative designer Jamie McCall, said: "This commission challenges us to explore the history of the regiment and present their story through an interactive and thought-provoking museum, one which attracts audiences of all ages from all nations.
"Our plans include utilising the original architecture, whilst revisiting the spatial layout and working with the museum and Stirling Castle to create a really unique visitor offer."
Project director Col AK Miller said: "PLB understood our desire to tell the Argylls' story in the wider context of Scotland and the UK - from the Highland Clearances, through the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of Empire, to the World Wars and post-colonial era."
