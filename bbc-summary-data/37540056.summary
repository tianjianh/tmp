Grant McCann: Peterborough United too 'individual' going forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough United played too much like individuals when going forward at Southend, said boss Grant McCann.

Posh needed an injury-time equaliser from Marcus Maddison to earn a point, their fifth draw in six league games.
"If I'm honest, I thought we were a bit individualised up there. There was no combination," said McCann.
"I think once (Paul) Taylor played Marcus in and we nearly scored. We're never going to be perfect at this stage but we'll continue to work hard."
Neither of McCann's preferred forward pairing of Tom Nichols and Paul Taylor have scored since 20 August.
Maddison scored his fifth goal of the campaign, but McCann said it only made up for his error which allowed Southend's Anthony Wordsworth to score the opener at Roots Hall.
"It was a great finish, he had to do that to be fair because he lost his runner for the goal," McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"He's held his hands up in the changing room because that's the sort of person he is and he's produced a great strike. He can produce that on any given day with the talent he's got."
