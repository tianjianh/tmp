The Consumer Electronics Show - known as CES - will start on Thursday and finish on Sunday.
At the show, companies will show off some of their latest exciting gadgets.
It is extra special as it's the event's 50th anniversary this year.
The first ever CES was originally held in New York back in 1967 and more than 17,000 people attended.
CES fact
People come to CES from around four in every five of the world's countries
According to the Consumer Technology Association, there will be 1,745 companies from the UK going along to the show this year and around 177,000 people are expected to head to the show.
Here's some of the bits of technology to look out for at this year's event...
One gadget being shown at CES is an interactive speaker called Lunii, which lets you make up your own bedtime stories.
The user chooses where the story takes place, who's in it and what they do - and then the speaker reads the story out.
VR headsets are still hugely popular and lots of new ones are currently being developed and shown off at CES.
One company called Fove has made a headset which allows you to control a game using just your eyes, as it can track where you are looking.
CES fact
One month after CES 1969, the first man walked on the moon, meaning more people became interested in science and technology
There's lots of new tech at CES which use voice and movement control instead of pressing buttons.
A French company called Bixi will be showing off a device that lets a person control their tablet or smartphone by waving their hand.
For example, you could use it to change the volume of your music by waving your hand down.
Many people like to use technology to help them to stay healthy and lots of these gadgets are expected to be on show at CES.
One company from Israel will be displaying its device called the TytoHome which works a bit like Baymax from Big Hero 6.
This gadget allows families to take health measurements, like heart rate and breathing patterns, and send the information to the doctors.
The idea is that it could mean fewer people would need to make the trip to see the doctor in person.
One company from London will be launching a robot called Olly, who you can talk to and ask questions.
The interesting thing about it is it behaves differently depending on who it's with!
This is just some of the technology that will be on display at CES.
We'll have more updates on what other exciting gadgets will be at the show later this week.
