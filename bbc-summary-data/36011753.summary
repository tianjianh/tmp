Irishman Lowry was first with an eight-iron, before Love followed suit with a seven-iron.
Oosthuizen then holed his tee shot via a deflection off playing partner JB Holmes's ball.
Lowry's was the first hole-in-one at the Masters since Welshman Jamie Donaldson aced the sixth hole in 2013.
The hole-in-one took Lowry to 10 over par for the tournament, while Love moved to 11 over and Oosthuizen to four over.
