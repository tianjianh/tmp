South Korea's Soomin Lee claimed his first European Tour title at China's weather-delayed Shenzhen International.

Lee, 22, moved into the top 10 of the Race to Dubai after his Monday win at Genzon Golf Club, which was hit by rain and electrical storms during the event.
Lee finished on 16-under, two shots clear of South Africa's Brandon Stone and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands.
Overnight co-leaders Lee Slattery of England and France's Alexander Levy finished three shots behind Lee.
Just one shot separated the top six going into Monday morning - which was itself delayed by fog - when 23 players returned to complete their rounds after Sunday's play was stopped due to bad light.
Lee made the decisive move when he birdied the 16th and then eagled the 17th to secure victory in just his sixth European Tour start.
Lee was glad to banish the memory of his near miss at the Maybank Championship Malaysia in February, when he double-bogeyed two of the last three holes to finish two shots behind Marcus Fraser.
"Yesterday I was really, really nervous. But we have a lot of break time and then this morning I felt really comfortable," he said.
Slattery, from Liverpool, bogeyed the 15th and could not pick up any shots on the closing three holes - unlike American Bubba Watson, who made three birdies in the last four holes to sign for a 66 and finish tied eighth.
