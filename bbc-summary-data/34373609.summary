Scottish Water said the issue in Uig, North and South Lochs and Achmore was resolved .
It followed reports of an "unusual microbiology result".
A spokesman for Scottish Water said: "We want to thank the affected customers for their patience and understanding over the past few days."
He added: "Public health is of paramount importance and that is why we have such robust procedures to monitor and analyse water quality.
"Our staff on the Isle of Lewis have worked round the clock to make sure this problem has been resolved as quickly as possible."
The advice to boil water was issued on Saturday and taken following consultation between the company and NHS Western Isles.
Customers had been advised to boil water for drinking, preparing food, babies' feeds and disinfecting feeding equipment, cleaning teeth, pet food and drink, and washing open wounds.
