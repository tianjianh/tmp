Fast bowler Katherine Brunt will miss the rest of England women's tour of South Africa after injuring her back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brunt, 30, suffered a back spasm during Friday's one-day international defeat and is out of Sunday's series decider and the following three Twenty20 games.
She is expected to be available for selection for the ICC Women's World Twenty20 in India next month.
Kent left-arm seamer Natasha Farrant will replace Brunt, arriving in time for the first T20 match on 18 February.
Yorkshire bowler Brunt only managed five overs in Friday's five-wicket defeat which levelled the series at 1-1 after England won the first match.
She failed to take a wicket in either game and is stranded on 99 one-day wickets.
