Leaderflush Shapland, which has sites in Langley Mill in Derbyshire and Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, sent out redundancy notices on New Year's Eve.
Amber Valley Conservative MP Nigel Mills said the closure was "the worst possible news for those affected".
Administrators Deloitte said the firm had been under financial pressure for "some time".
One employee, Colin Meakin, from Belper in Derbyshire, said: "It is just going to be hard and I am not confident I will be able to get a job.

"We knew it was coming but it is hard to be upbeat.
"It has still not sunk in - it is really depressing and I feel really let down."
The firm, which is a division of Laidlaw Interiors Group, will also close its office in Barnstaple.
The other six divisions of the group have either been sold or are being put on the market.
Mr Mills added: "It must have come as a surprise to a lot of employees, but over the past few weeks, it has become obvious the business was struggling for profit and for cash flow and clearly the worst has happened.
"But there are many successful companies around here so we will doing all we can to get them down here and try to get them jobs as soon as we can."
A Deloitte spokesman said: "Leaderflush Shapland has suffered significant on-going losses making trading unsustainable."
There were almost 300 job losses in Langley Mill and 77 in Mansfield, with 32 employees being retained to help wind up the operations.
