[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a Canadian woman found in a Los Angeles hotel cistern has been ruled an accident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elise Lam, 21, of Vancouver drowned in the water tank atop the Cecil Hotel.
Her body was found in February after guests complained of low water pressure. The coroner found no signs of trauma nor anything in toxicology tests that contributed to her death.
But the Los Angeles coroner's office said bipolar disorder was considered a "significant condition" in Lam's death.
She was travelling alone, arriving on 26 January. Hotel workers last remembered seeing her five days later.
Hotel security footage showed her behaving erratically, pushing buttons in the lift, and leaning through the doors and looking both ways.
Guests at the Cecil Hotel said they had bathed in and drunk water from the tank while her body remained in it.
Los Angeles health officials said at the time tests of the water showed it to be safe - from a "microbiological standpoint".
Two hotel guests have sued the Cecil for providing water "not fit for human ingestion".
And American actor Robert Conrad gave a British couple that had stayed at the Cecil during the time Lam's body was inside the cistern $500 (Â£320), after hearing their story on the radio.
