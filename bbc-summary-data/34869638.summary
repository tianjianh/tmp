Reading council working with residents to fight 'massive' rat problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents whose homes are being plagued by a "massive" infestation of rats have been asked to help tackle the problem by their local council.

The rodents have been spotted in streets and back gardens, as well as nesting in the engines of parked cars.
People from the Anstey Road, Baker Street and Howard Street areas of Reading have handed a petition to the local council calling for action.
It said "responsible waste disposal" was key to tackling the problem.
Reading Borough Council said homeowners also needed to ensure rats cannot get into their properties, and advised them to remove food sources such bird feed at night.
It said it was working with Thames Water to solve the problem, which was largely caused by rats leaving the sewers through drains.
Baker Street Area Neighbourhood Association chair Karen Rowland submitted the petition calling on the council to tackle the "massive rat issue".
She said there had been one instance of a car failing its MOT because a rat had chewed through its brake cables.
In her response to the petition the borough council's lead member for neighbourhoods Liz Terry said the local authority "cannot work in isolation".
She said: "We have asked for residents help, to provide additional support and to encourage responsible waste disposal."
Ms Terry added that an event was being set up where people would be provided with information and advise about the rats.
Council officers are also working with Thames Water to carry out a sewer baiting programme.
Ms Rowland said: "None of us can do this alone. The council, Thames Water and the residents all need to work together."
