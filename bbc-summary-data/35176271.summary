South West Trains said the 10:20 GMT service from London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids struck a tree blocking the line near Basingstoke.
The operator said lumberjacks had since cleared the tree and all lines had reopened.
Delays of 40 minutes continued into the afternoon. Passengers were able to use tickets on alternative services.
Helena Blackman, runner-up in the BBC's How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria in 2006, posted on Twitter:  "Currently sat on a train in Farnborough...waiting for a tree to be cleared off the track!"
South West Trains posted: "Lines are now open between Farnborough and Basingstoke. The lumberjacks now have some nice log burner wood for Christmas."
Passengers are able to use tickets on alternative services.
