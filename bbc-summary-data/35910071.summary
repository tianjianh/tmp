Ian Poulter third at Puerto Rico Open, behind Finau & Marino

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Poulter failed to convert his overnight lead into victory at the Puerto Rico Open, finishing tied third behind Tony Finau and Steve Marino.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Englishman, who has not won a PGA Tour title since 2012, carded a level-par 72 in the final round.
That left him one off the leaders, who were separated by a play-off - American Finau beating his compatriot Marino with three successive birdies.
"It's slightly disappointing," said Poulter, 40.
"I'm continuing to work on the game to try and improve and I know if I rectify a couple of poor shots then my game will improve.
"Obviously, hitting shots slightly too far right at certain times is costly."
