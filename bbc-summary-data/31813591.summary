Deputy operations manager Safeena Bibi, 26, of Plantation Side, Nottingham, has been charged with Health and Safety at Work Act offences.
All four are due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 14 April.
The company secretary of Sherwood Rise Ltd will also be summonsed to attend.
Five other people who were bailed in connection with the death have been released with without charge.
