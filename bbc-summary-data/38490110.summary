Motorists were advised to keep their distance and slow down, especially on the A26 approaching the Dunsilly Roundabout and Antrim and Seven Towers Roundabout.
Part of the A26 was closed because of a collision between the turnoff for Kells and Antrim.
A spokesperson for the PSNI said there were no reports of serious injuries.
