Hannah dreamt of having a horse but when her parents said no, she moooo'ved onto the next best thing and jumped on a cow instead!
Hannah lives on a dairy farm in New Zealand and became friends with Lilac the cow.
The unusual pair have become a common sight in the local town as they go about their daily rides.
