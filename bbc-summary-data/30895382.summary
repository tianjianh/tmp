[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP have chosen the leader of the Highland Council as their candidate to stand against Lib Dem Danny Alexander in the general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Drew Hendry was one of four candidates vying to contest the Inverness Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency.
At the last election Mr Alexander increased his 9,000 majority while Labour, who came second, saw their share of the vote fall.
The SNP made the biggest gains but finished in third place.
Mr Alexander has been chief secretary to the Treasury for most of the period since the Lib Dems joined the Conservatives to form a coalition government at Westminster in 2010.
The SNP are hoping that his association with Tory chancellor George Osborne's economic programme will allow them to win his seat.
