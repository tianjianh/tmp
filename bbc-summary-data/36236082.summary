Crutches shortage leads to Cumbria hospital return plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hospital staff dealing with a shortage of crutches are reminding patients to return them if they are no longer need.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A larger than normal number of people have visited Furness General Hospital's accident and emergency department with injuries that require them.
The hospital is asking patients to give crutches back to avoid having to pay to replace them.
Chief operating officer Foluke Ajayi said "people perhaps don't realise" they should return them once well.
"It's also really important that people realise that, by returning their crutches, this means that money can be saved for spending on other vital equipment and services around Furness General Hospital," she said.
