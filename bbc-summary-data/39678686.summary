[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Darren Stevens took his third five-wicket haul of the season for Kent before Derbyshire's bowlers hit back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 238-8, Kent were all out for 259, but Stevens (6-47) helped limit Derbyshire to 159 in reply.
Only five of the visitors' batsmen reached double figures, with Wayne Madsen top scoring with 56.
The hosts fell to 51-5 to start their second innings, but Stevens (53 not out) helped see them to 142-7 when bad light stopped play, a lead of 242 runs.
Stevens, only a week away from his 41st birthday, had taken only 12 five-wicket hauls in his career before this season, but he has taken one in each of Kent's opening three games.
He also maintained his impressive form with the bat, with his unbeaten half-century the fourth time he has gone past 50 this season.
