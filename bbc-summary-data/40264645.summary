Scobbie, 29, has signed a two-year deal with the Championship outfit after five years in Perth.
"I am excited to join United. It is a great club with fantastic support," Scobbie told United's official website.
"When I spoke to the manager [Ray McKinnon], I knew this was where I wanted to sign and I am delighted to have my future secured."
Scobbie is United's third summer signing, following the arrivals of James Keatings and Billy King on pre-contracts agreements.
"Thomas is an excellent defender who can play both left-back and central, and he will enhance our defensive options," said the United boss.
"As important, he is also a great organiser, a real leader with plenty of experience and these are vital characteristics for me.
"We need to add more players, and I expect to further add to the squad before pre-season begins."
