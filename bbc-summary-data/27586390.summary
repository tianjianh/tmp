[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bosses at the National Library of Wales have abandoned plans to give two of its executive team responsibility allowances equal to a 10% payment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An e-mail sent to staff by the chief executive said they had to concentrate on pay and staffing across the library.
It comes after staff at the Aberystwyth library threatened to pass a motion of no confidence in  management.
One of the unions at the institution welcomed the decision.
Unions are unhappy that more than 200 members have not had a consolidated pay rise since 2009.
Members of Prospect Cymru and the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) also claim some lower paid staff employed by the institution do not earn a living wage.
The library is currently preparing for consultation on restructuring which will take place over a six week period,
An email to staff on Friday from librarian and chief executive Aled Gruffydd Jones said the institution needed to "concentrate on the key matters of pay and staffing across the library".
It added: "It has been decided not to proceed at this time with the temporary acting-up allowances for two members of the executive team.
"The additional responsibilities allocated to them have also been withdrawn, pending further discussions on how best to deliver the Strategic Plan."
A Prospect Cymru spokesman said its 170 or so members welcomed the decision to withdraw the allowances.
He added: "The trade unions now look forward to working with the library to address issues raised by staff."
In December, Mr Jones appealed for money from the public to dampen the effect of a cut to its grant from the Welsh government.
He said the library faced a Â£1.2m reduction in income over two years.
The library and unions are set to hold meetings in June.
