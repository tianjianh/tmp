US luxury retailer Neiman Marcus has announced plans to float in New York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The department store operator filed plans for an IPO with US regulators and said it would use the $100m raised to repay some of its $4.7bn in debt.
After announcing plans to go public in 2013, it was bought by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $6bn.
The two investment firms will retain majority control of the 100-year old company after the listing.
Known for its wealthy clientele, Dallas-based Neiman Marcus owns 41 stores as well as Bergdorf Goodman on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and 42 Last Call outlets.
In the filing, the company said that nearly 40% of its customers have a median household income of more than $200,000.
Neiman Marcus revenues rose 5% to $1.2bn in the three months to 2 May compared with the same period a year ago.
It swung to a profit of $19.8m after posting a loss of $8m for the quarter last year.
