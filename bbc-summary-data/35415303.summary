Republic fans now have a total ticket allocation of 32,502 for their games against Sweden, Italy and Belgium.
A further 3,087 tickets have been made available for the Sweden game, raising their allocation to more than 16,000.
More than 1,000 extra Irish fans can go to the Belgium game, with a further 2,320 able to watch the Italy match.
In all, 7,095 Republic fans will now have tickets for the Belgium contest in Bordeaux on 18 June with 9,320 supporters able to attend the Italy match in Lille four days later.
The Republic will open their Group E challenge against Sweden at the Stade de France in Paris on Monday, 13 June.
In total, Republic fans applied for more than 275,000 tickets and their increased allocation is still massively shy of the demand.
However, FAI chief executive John Delaney said that he was "very happy" at Tuesday's news.
"These tickets will go some way to satisfying the huge demand for Ireland matches at Euro 2016," said the FAI chief.
Uefa intends to contact each successful applicant by the end of February to tell them when payments for tickets will be taken.
All applicants will be told whether they have been successful by 29 February.
