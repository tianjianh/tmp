[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged fellow African leaders to stop receiving foreign aid, saying it is not an acceptable basis for prosperity.

"Dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end," he said in a tweet ahead of this weekend's African Union summit in South Africa.
The BBC's Robert Kiptoo in Kenya says it is not a government policy but a rallying cry for African leaders.
Aid is believed to account for 5-6% of Kenya's total income.
Mr Kenyatta said that foreign aid "often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress".
"It is time to give it up," he wrote.
