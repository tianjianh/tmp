Derby bin changes ready to start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby City Council are changing bin collection days and times from 6 June.

The city is being divided into four areas, each being serviced on a separate day with no collections on a Monday.
The changes will save up to Â£500,000 a year with the bin lorry fleet reduced by five to 21, the council said.
No staff will be lost as fewer agency staff will be hired. Households have been sent information packs about the changes to the collections.
Residents have been asked to check their packs to find out their new bin day and which bin is due to be emptied.
Councillor Chris Poulter said: "Anyone not yet sure of the day or which bins to put out, should check their information pack, which gives full details, or they can check on the website by simply inputting their post code."
Four out of five households will see their collection day change.
The city crews collect about 114,000 bins every week.
