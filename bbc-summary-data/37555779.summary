Wilson, 26, played for Super Rugby side Highlanders earlier in 2016 and will join the Premiership club after Otago's Mitre 10 Cup competition concludes.
Born in New Zealand, he has played international rugby sevens for England and New Zealand, and joined Saracens in December 2012 from Bay of Plenty.
His Otago teammate Paul Grant also signed for Bath on 30 September.
"Jack will be a fantastic addition to the squad. He's very fit from his time with the England Sevens squad," Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder told the club website.
