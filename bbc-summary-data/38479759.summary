Dozens of elderly and disabled residents say they are "stuck in their homes" because of a broken lift.

The lift at Whiteways Court in Nottingham was damaged before Christmas when firefighters had to free several people who were trapped.
Residents said they have missed Christmas and New Year events.
Riverside, a housing charity that runs the flats, has apologised for the inconvenience but said specialist parts were "proving difficult to source".
Resident Joan Burnett said: "We were going to go to our son's for New Year but we can't get out.
"I can't walk very far - I can't get my breath to go far and it is ridiculous as they should have a back-up system of some sort.
"I was sat on the stairs and there wasn't even a chair to sit on. We feel trapped.
"If someone from head office would come and have a word with us and tell us what is going off, but they don't."
Her husband Reginald said: "If she left here I would give her 10 yards and she would have to stop to get her breath.
"The lift broke down several times before. It is all rubbish. Not good enough."
Some of the 25 residents who live on the top two floors said they were not able to get out for meals with relatives.
Sue Musgrove, daughter of two residents at the flats, said: "It's ruined our Christmas really because mum and dad should have come out with us."
A Riverside spokesman said: "We're very sorry indeed for the inconvenience that this incident has caused our residents at Whiteways Court, especially over the Christmas period.
"Our lift contractors are working as fast as they can to repair the damage, but they have needed to order a number of specialist parts which are proving difficult to source.
"The 20-25 first and second floor residents affected are being regularly visited by our scheme manager to ensure that they have everything they need and relatives and friends are also rallying round, running errands when required."
Whiteways Court is a 44-unit retirement living scheme for the over 55s.
