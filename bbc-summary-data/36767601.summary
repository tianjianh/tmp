The 30-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan to Motherwell after falling out of favour at their Scottish Premiership rivals.
He could be followed out of Hearts by fellow midfielder Billy King.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle have held talks about a potential loan deal for the 22-year-old who ended last season with Rangers in the Championship.
King made 13 appearances as the Glasgow side won the title and promotion.
But the Scotland Under-21 international could be poised for another loan spell, this time with one of Hearts' Premiership rivals.
Frenchman Gomis first arrived in Scotland to join Cowdenbeath in 2006 after spells with English lower league clubs Windsor & Eton, Dagenham & Redbridge, Barnet and Lewes.
It won him a move to the top flight with Dundee United, returning for a second spell at Tannadice after two years with Birmingham City before joining Hearts in 2014.
Gomis, who was capped twice for Senegal, made 58 appearances for Hearts and 11 on loan to Motherwell.
He will now join Kelantan as they look to improve on their eighth place in the Malaysian table, the Kota Bharu-based side having finished ninth last year.
