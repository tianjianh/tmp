Housing developer Taylor Wimpey wants to transform the Llandaff plots into housing inspired by London's Georgian squares.
The Llandaff Park plans include a range of properties from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom houses.
BBC staff are set to move to a new building in Central Square in 2018.
Proposals include 20% affordable homes on the sites that straddle either side of Llantrisant Road - Broadcasting House on the northern side and Ty Oldfield on the southern side.
Plans show a three-block, six-storey apartment development called The Crescent.
Three-storey terraced townhouses with private gardens and roof terraces would form The Square.
The Courtyard would be made up of four to six-storey apartment blocks.
The developer said it planned to create a number of additional pedestrian and cycle routes.
It said the development would "significantly" reduce traffic.
