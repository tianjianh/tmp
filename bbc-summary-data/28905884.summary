Scott McDonald converted Jack Powell's free-kick before setting up Scott Malone to double the home side's lead.
Substitute Nile Ranger finished coolly into the corner from Francois Zoko's cross to reduce the deficit.
The Seasiders could not find an equaliser, however, as first Steven Davies and then Zoko failed to beat goalkeeper David Forde.

Earlier, Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis had to punch away Lee Martin's free-kick to prevent Ricardo Fuller scoring.
The away team then had a goal ruled out when Nathan Delfouneso was adjudged to have fouled Carlos Edwards before setting up Ishmael Miller.
Powell, making his first league appearance, picked out MacDonald at the far post to fire the home side in front.
Striker McDonald turned creator for Millwall's second, setting up full-back Malone to score from close range.
Blackpool did find a way back into the game through Ranger's neat finish before the substitute set up Davies, only for him to miss the target from eight yards.
Zoko shot into the side netting and Forde did well to deny Davies' shot from the edge of the area, but Millwall hung on to record a deserved three points.
Blackpool have lost all five league matches they have played under Jose Riga, while Millwall, managed by ex-Blackpool boss Ian Holloway, move up to fifth with their third win of the season.
Millwall manager Ian Holloway:  "We got ourselves into a great situation with a brilliant goal and then we have just got to learn to manage the game.
"We conceded the most bizarre goal I have ever seen. Our centre-half came up for a throw and then we didn't aim it at him. How stupid is that?
"We ended up scrapping but I'm glad we didn't throw it away because, on the balance of play, I would have been fuming had they equalised."
Blackpool manager Jose Riga: "The efficiency of the team is very important. When you have opportunities you have to put them into the net.
"The reality stays the same but I am sure that we can solve some problems but we have to improve our efficiency.
"I saw in this game the reality that we wanted it but it is hard with these levels of confidence."
