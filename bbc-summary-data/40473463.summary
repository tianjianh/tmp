World number one Andy Murray says he will be fit to defend his Wimbledon title, despite struggling with a hip injury.

The Briton, 30, picked up the problem earlier this week and was hobbling during practice sessions at the All England Club.
Murray plays Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik in Monday's opening match on Centre Court at 13:00 BST.
"I'll be fine to play the event and play seven matches," the Scot said.
"If I feel like I am today, I'd be delighted and have no issues getting through.
"If necessary, I can take some anti-inflammatories if my hip flares up. Hopefully that's not the case."
Like Andy, I'd like to think that I'm fit enough to play seven matches, but I'm going to be taking it one at a time
Murray pulled out of two exhibition matches last week and missed three days of practice, preferring instead to rest the injury and work with his physio.
"It's been sore for a little while now and with each day that I was practising it was feeling a little bit worse," Murray told the BBC. "It was hampering my movement and therefore I wasn't getting things out of my practice session.
"Obviously I would have liked to have trained the whole week and got a couple of exhibition matches but the positive from it is that I'm fresh.
"I certainly haven't played too much tennis - but I'm certainly going to have to work my way into the tournament. I'm probably not going to come out and play great straight off the bat.
"It's just a little bit stressful. Right before the biggest tournament of the year for me as a Brit, you want to be out there practising, and I haven't been in that position before really."
Murray has visibly struggled at times between points since returning to practising at Wimbledon under the watchful eyes of coaches Ivan Lendl and Jamie Delgado.
However, the two-time Wimbledon champion believes his recent run to the semi-finals at the French Open sets an encouraging precedent.
"The last few days have been very good," Murray said.
"Practice each day has got a little bit better. It's been slightly stop-start preparations. But each day I've felt better.
"A little bit like at the French Open, where maybe I didn't come in as well-prepared, I still found a way with each match to feel a bit better, and built confidence each day.
"So, you know, I'm hoping that's the case here."
Fellow British number one Johanna Konta has also been struggling with injury after a heavy fall in Eastbourne on Friday, but was practising apparently without issues at Wimbledon on Sunday.
"I'm definitely recovering really well. I'm taking it a day at a time," said the 26-year-old, who opens her campaign against Taiwanese player Hsieh Su-wei on Court One on Monday.
"I practised today. I felt good. I'm definitely looking forward to playing my first round.
"Like Andy, I'd like to think that I'm fit enough to play seven matches, but I'm going to be taking it one at a time."
