Gareth Williams, 47, from Cardiff, was caught after South Wales Police found thousands of indecent images of children on his computer following an international investigation into child sex abuse images by police in Canada.
They discovered films he had made using hidden pinhole cameras to capture images of children in toilets, including at two houses. He will be sentenced next month.
Two decades ago, Williams was presenting the Welsh-language programme Sut a Pham (How and Why) which answered questions on science and nature asked by children.
Teacher had 16,000 indecent images
