Police said three young boys had been seen "acting suspiciously" before the infant Jesus was snatched on Monday night.
Officers said the theft happened outside St John's Kirk in St John's Place in the city before 23:30.
It is the second time the life-sized doll has been stolen from the nativity scene in the past two years.
Anne Chat, who serves as an elder at the church and also works as a volunteer, said: "Last year someone stole the doll from the display too, but it turned up again a while later.
"It just seems to be something that people do these days, it's a shame."
Mrs Chat said the nativity had been put in place by the locals on Saturday evening after a lantern procession attended by about a hundred people and a pipe band.
Local MSP Rosanna Cunningham had tweeted a picture of the Christmas scene just hours before the Jesus was taken saying: "Perth's beautiful Nativity scene outside St John's Kirk #Advent".
In a statement, Police Scotland said: "Three young boys were seen acting suspiciously in the area at the time and were last seen near St John Street, Perth.
They are described as wearing black clothing, with two of the boys carrying rucksacks.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
