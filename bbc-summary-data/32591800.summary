The 63-year-old is rarely seen in public without the 5ft sword as well as steel helmet and tartan outfit.
He is standing as an Independent candidate in the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency.
Scottish Borders Council has informed him he cannot take the sword to the count or polling places.
Mr Rae, from St Boswells, is best known for writing the hit Inside Out for Odyssey in 1982 as well as his own single, Over The Sea.
He has stood a number of times for political office and is one of seven candidates for the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency.
He is up against the SNP's Calum Kerr, Conservative John Lamont, Kenryck Lloyd-Jones of Labour, Lib Dem Michael Moore, UKIP's Peter Neilson and Green candidate Pauline Stewart.
Returning officer Tracey Logan wrote to Mr Rae: "I must ensure that people are able to vote on the day without any perceived threat or risk."
A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson confirmed: "Mr Rae will not be permitted to enter polling stations or the count centre while carrying a claymore to ensure the safety of members of the public, presiding officers, poll clerks and other staff."
Mr Rae claimed the local authority was being small-minded.
He told the BBC Scotland website: "The letter is just tae try and humiliate me and embarrass me in front o' the press and media that they know will be at the count centre."
