[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Lambeth social services carer has been jailed for 13 years for sexual offences against children in his care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Paul, 64, of Clephane Road, north London, committed the offences between 1980 and 1988 at a Lambeth children's home, where his four male victims lived.
He was convicted of a string of assaults at Blackfriars Crown Court.
Jailing him, Judge John Hillen said Paul used his position, power and charisma to groom and abuse the boys.
Paul was last month found guilty of 15 indecent assaults, one count of indecency with a child under 14, and one count of aiding and abetting indecent assault on a boy under 14.
He pleaded guilty to one count of making an indecent image of a child on or after 1 January 2005.
The court heard that one victim was subjected to "vile group sexual abuse" by Paul and other unidentified men.
The judge told him: "If you were not part of a paedophile ring, you were at least knowledgeable about and in contact with a group of paedophile men."
Paul had also been jailed for offences against children in 1994 and 2002 - and in 2002 a sentencing judge said he believed Paul had achieved rehabilitation following the historic offences.
But the most recent investigation started in October 2012 after a victim came forward with allegations against Paul.
An inquiry was launched by detectives from the Met's Operation Trinity and further victims were identified.
Det Supt Ang Scott said: "Paul was responsible for the care of his victims; the ultimate position of trust. He used that power to take advantage and commit the most serious of crimes against them."
One victim said the abuse he suffered as a teenager ruined his life.
He said: "I didn't speak about it until I was contacted by the police in 2014 as I thought nobody would believe what happened to me."
But he added: "I can finally start to move on with my life knowing that everyone now believes me."
