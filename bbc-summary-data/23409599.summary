Royal birth day: Your new babies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the news comes of the birth of a royal baby boy, other people have been celebrating new arrivals of their own.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's boy was born at 16:24 BST weighing 8lbs 6oz and is third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William.
People have been sharing their good news of babies who were born on the same day.
Little Coco arrived rather quickly in the corridor near the foyer of the Alexandra hospital in Redditch.
It gave both my partner and I a fright as well as a couple of visitors who were fantastic at raising the alarm quickly, meaning both mum and baby had a great team around them.
Laura's waters broke at 4am and she relaxed at home with a bath.
But her contractions suddenly came very quickly and we rushed to the hospital in the car.
By 5.20am, the contractions were four minutes apart but we got to hospital just in time.
My wife Francesca's due date was 21st July and her labour started on that day around 5pm.
Her waters finally broke at 6.30pm on Monday and after a successful few pushes our baby boy was born at 21:14, weighing 8lbs 5 1/2oz.
Both mum and baby are fantastic and they are now returning to our local cottage hospital.
We have no name as yet.
His brothers Samuel aged six and Joseph aged three are so excited to meet their new brother.
Big thanks to staff at John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford.
And of course congratulations to both William and Kate.
Our baby 'Samuel Giles Bestwick' was born on 22/07/2013 at 12.55pm weighing 7lbs 5oz at Jessops hospital in Sheffield.
He was six days overdue and my labour started around midnight.
It all feels very surreal.
I worked out that Kate may be due on the same day as I was, so we were keeping an eye on her progress and wondering who was going to be first.
My family had been joking from the start that he would be born on the same day as the Royal baby, we were amazed when he was!
My daughter-in-law Kate Williams has given birth to Josh at Southmead Hospital in Bristol around 10.45am.
She had a planned caesarean and the baby weighed in at 8lbs 15oz.  She also has a daughter, Maisie, who is two.
I thought it was a funny coincidence that she gave birth today because of her name - Kate Williams!
My daughter Georgina gave birth to her second daughter at 2.15pm in Portsmouth.
She is to be called Charlotte Elizabeth Rose, and she weighed just over 7lbs.
They're 100 miles away in Portsmouth but everyone is doing well.
I just hope Kate didn't have to sit around in the hospital for hours waiting for a bed with nothing more than paracetamol for pain relief!
Ida Ophelia Rose Sanders was born at 12:10 at Queen Charlottes Hospital London weighing in at 6lbs 4oz. What a day to have a baby!
Mother and baby are both doing well. It was a quick labour. Ida was six days early.
My wife Milly had a water birth with no pain relief. I was born the same year as Prince William.
It's great to have a daughter with the same birthday as the future King.
