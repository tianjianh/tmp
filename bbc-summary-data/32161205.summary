[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Construction work has begun on a new town centre in Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Building is under way on the northern quarter of Bracknell, with the first foundations due to be laid at the end of April.
A post-World War Two shopping centre has been cleared and the road network remodelled for the development, which includes a new town square.
The first steelwork will begin appearing in June, according to the town's regeneration partnership.
Other features wiped off the map for the regeneration are The Ring - the town's inner ring road - and Winchester House, a 12-storey office block, which will be replaced with a 19-storey building containing 311 homes.
The shops and restaurants in the northern quarter are due to open in Spring 2017.
A 12-screen cinema is also planned.
