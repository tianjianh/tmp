Fifa prosecutors want longer bans for Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Uefa boss Michel Platini could face longer bans from football despite being handed eight-year suspensions last month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fifa's ethics committee wanted lifetime bans and will appeal against the sentences in a bid to increase them.
The duo were found guilty of breaches surrounding a Â£1.3m ($2m) "disloyal payment" made to Platini in 2011.
Both Swiss Blatter, 79, and Frenchman Platini, 60, deny wrongdoing and have also appealed against their bans.
Fifa's appeal committee will hear all the appeals, but the cases could go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Platini had hoped to replace Blatter as Fifa president when elections take place on 26 February but says he will not stand.
