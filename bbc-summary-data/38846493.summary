The family of a teenager who was given only a 5% chance of recovery when he was horrifically injured in a fire has thanked those who saved his life.

Troy MacKinlay suffered 85% burns when a candle set fire to the house in Shildon, County Durham, in October.
The 19-year-old was taken to Newcastle's RVI, and his family was warned to expect the worst.
But he defied the odds, and his sister has described his survival as "a miracle".
Abra Wood said that when the family first saw him in hospital he was bandaged from head to toe and looked "like a mummy", with "lines and wires and pipes coming out of him all over the place".
She said: "He was on 100% oxygen, kidney dialysis because his kidneys had failed, and his lungs and liver were also failing.
"His face and head was massively swollen up and blistered to the size of a big gym ball. I was heart-broken looking at my little brother like this."
However, 15 weeks on, his recovery was "going great".
"The doctors and consultants have said that he is doing better than expected at this stage", she said.
She said she wanted to thank everyone at the RVI, and all the other people who had supported them, including Katie Piper - a former model disfigured in an acid attack who started a charity to help others recover their confidence.
Ms Wood said: "She has sent cards, letters, and has even been on the phone a few times, she's been really, really supportive."
On Sunday, Ms Woods was asked by her brother to take a picture of his injuries and post it on Facebook, along with his defiant message - "This is me, if you don't like it do one".
It has since received more than 7,000 "likes".
Ms Woods said: "There have been loads of positive comments, with people offering all sorts of support.
"He will be absolutely amazed by the response he really, really will."
Troy is expected to remain in hospital until the end of the year, and an online fundraising page has been set up for him.
