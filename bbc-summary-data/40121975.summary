One Love Manchester: 'A great service for fans'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US singer Ariana Grande is returning to Manchester to take part in a benefit concert, along with a host of singers, less than two weeks after 22 people died and 116 were injured in a suicide bombing at the end of her concert in the city in May.

Everyone who attended that concert has been invited to apply for free tickets to the event on Sunday 4 June, which will include acts such as Katy Perry, Robbie Williams, Coldplay, Little Mix and Black Eyed Peas.
Some of the concert-goers have been in touch with the BBC to share their experiences.
Joe Woolrich is looking forward to the gig, which he says will be a form of closure for him.
"It was a traumatic time for everybody involved. We were near to the explosion when it happened. My friend ran into the toilet to inform me. At first I thought it was another encore when I heard the loud boom and the screams.
"We ran from the explosion area to the other exit where there were wheelchairs at the top of the stairs and no way out. So we carried on down, and stuck around to try to help outside the arena before the emergency services arrived.
"It was absolute chaos, but everybody did what they could to help.
"The fact that Ariana is coming back so soon, has helped to reassure me we are stronger together.
"She is doing the victims, fans and the city of Manchester a great service."
Rachel Whorton's two daughters aged 10 and 18, want to attend but have so far been disappointed.
"They were at the original concert at Manchester Arena so they qualify for free tickets for the benefit concert.
"I have been on the phone to Ticketmaster since 9am this morning trying to get tickets. I didn't think they would want to go but they do and I think it will be good for them.
"I'm frustrated. All you hear is a a long automated message, and are then told that Ticketmaster is busy helping other customers before getting cut off.
"I don't understand why this process is so difficult. Surely they have records of who bought original tickets. I have even tried to contact them on social media without success."
