Wales scrum-half Gareth Davies hopes to sign a fresh Scarlets contract to keep him at the Welsh region for the foreseeable future.

Davies scored five tries in the World Cup, including a crucial touchdown in their dramatic 28-25 Pool A win over England.
He also went over in the 23-19 quarter-final defeat by South Africa.
"I'd love to stay at the Scarlets another couple of years," the 25-year-old told BBC Wales.
"Hopefully I'll sign a contract in the next couple of weeks, months or whatever and I can look forward to my future at the Scarlets."
Davies signed a contract extension with Scarlets ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, the duration of which was not specified.
Davies says moving away from Wales is something he might consider in future.
"But at the moment I'm happy playing my rugby in Parc y Scarlets," said Davies, who has won nine Wales caps.

"It's a brilliant environment to be in, with a great bunch of boys.
"The coaching staff are all good so I'm happy here, so we'll see how it goes."
Davies was "gutted" that Wales did not reach the semi-finals.
"I just think we've got to be a bit more clinical in some areas of our game, maybe," added Davies.
"I think there were a few instances against Australia where we got held up over the line three times.
"On another day maybe someone could have done an extra movement and managed to get the ball down and we could have got a try and that could have changed the game.
"We're not a million miles away. It's fine margins."
However, Davies does not subscribe to the view that the four southern hemisphere teams contesting the semi-finals - New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina - equates to a considerable gap between them and their northern hemisphere counterparts.
"People always think that gap is bigger than it actually is," said Davies.
"I think it's maybe different for New Zealand because the way they're playing at the moment they seem to be on a different level.
"But with Australia and South Africa, I think we've shown... we could have beaten South Africa and we ran Australia close as well.
"I think the gap is getting smaller and smaller, but… New Zealand seem to be on a different level at the moment."
As for the 2016 Six Nations, Davies says Wales cannot consider themselves favourites.
"I'm sure England will have something to say about that," he said.
"Ireland are a world-class team as well and France - it's a really tough tournament.
"And Scotland as well - they came really close [to beating Australia]… all the teams are going to be looking forward to the Six Nations."
Davies may return to Scarlets duty when they host Munster in the Pro12 on Friday.
