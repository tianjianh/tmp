Tatyana Lysenko: Russian Olympic champion fails doping test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olympic and double world hammer champion Tatyana Lysenko has become the latest athlete from Russia to be suspended for doping.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The IAAF, which governs athletics, said the London 2012 gold medallist had tested positive for a banned substance.
Lysenko, 32, who is now known by her married name Beloborodova, served a two-year ban for steroid use in 2007.
Russia is banned from international athletics competition after it was accused of systematic doping.
The suspension was imposed last year after a World Anti-Doping Agency report alleged systematic, state-sponsored doping had taken place.
Russia is hoping to persuade the sport's authorities it has done enough to tackle doping to have the ban lifted in time for this year's Olympic Games in Rio.
A decision is likely to be taken at an IAAF council meeting next month.
Lysenko's suspension will be provisional while further tests are carried out.
