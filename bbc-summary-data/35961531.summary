England Netball have been looking "at all parameters of the performance programme" with a view to closing the gap on Australia and New Zealand.
Full-time training will begin on 13 June in Loughborough.
"It's amazing to be able to give these girls the opportunity to have netball as their career," said England Netball chief executive officer Joanna Adams.
"It's important to make these decisions in order to accelerate the development of the England Roses' success and get even closer to the top two teams in the world."
Full details will be announced following the conclusion of the Superleague season in May.
