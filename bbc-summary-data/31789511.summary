Paloma Faith thinks she has messed up the opportunity to sing the theme tune for the next James Bond film.

The 33-year-old has made it clear in the past it was always her dream to follow on from Adele and get the gig.
She thinks her problem is that she is not cool enough.
"In the industry that I'm in, if you ask for something or you seem like you want something you don't get it," she said.
The latest 007 film, Spectre, is due to open worldwide on 6 November this year.
It will be Daniel Craig's fourth outing as Bond, but he has hinted it will be his final film in the franchise.
There is still no word on who will be the artist chosen for the theme tune, although there have been rumours.
But Paloma doesn't believe it will be her.
"You're supposed to pretend that you're really cool as a cucumber and stuff just comes to you, but I'm not really that type of person," she told reporters at a march to mark International Womens Day.
"But now I've messed it for myself because I've told everyone that I would like to do it.
"I pledge allegiance with previous great Bond theme singers like Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey and Tina Turner. I feel like I was born to do it."
Back in December, Spectre director Sam Mendes said that he already knew the identity of the artist singing the film's theme.
Sam Smith is considered the favourite to record the follow-up to Adele's Skyfall.
Ed Sheeran, Lorde and Lana Del Rey are also believed to be contenders.
Faith was recently named best British female at the 2015 Brit Awards in London.
