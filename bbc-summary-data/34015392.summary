MP plans youth fund tribute to Mo Mowlam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fund to help young people with the costs of education is being considered as a lasting tribute to former Teesside MP Mo Mowlam, who died 10 years ago.

A mosaic celebrating the life of the former Northern Ireland secretary is in place in the Redcar constituency she represented for 14 years.
But the town's sitting MP, Anna Turley, said a more practical tribute would be a "fitting legacy".
Ms Mowlam died from the effects of a brain tumour in August 2005 aged 55.
An 800-tile mosaic illustrating the Coventry-born former MP's life and passions, was unveiled next to Redcar boating lake in October 2009.
But Labour MP Ms Turley said: "A lot of people have contacted me asking for more to be done to commemorate Mo's achievements.
"We have talked about the possibility of a blue plaque outside her house.
"We also discussed a statue, but she wasn't a big fan of statues because she put them in Room 101 when she was on the TV show.
"What I would like to do, and which I think would be in keeping with her and be lasting, is something to help particularly young people in the area.
"So we've thought about some kind of fund to help young people study."
Ms Mowlam was MP for Redcar from 1987 to 2001.
She was Northern Ireland secretary in Tony Blair's first term in government and oversaw the talks that led to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Ms Turley said she would seek input from the public before any final decision was taken.
