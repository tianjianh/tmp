You don't mess with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.

You definitely don't try and remove their action figures from toy stores.
Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse, is the second Breaking Bad actor to criticise the Florida mum who petitioned Toys R Us to remove dolls of the characters from the TV series from shelves.
She argued the figurines, which came with a bag of money and methamphetamines, were a "dangerous deviation from family friendly values".
The actor, who plays Jesse Pinkman, sent a series of tweets accusing Toys R Us of being hypocritical.
He also asked his followers to sign a petition return figures to the shelves, saying it would be fun to 'show the Florida mom', signing off with Jesse's signature catchphrase.
Bryan Cranston, who plays Walter White in the award-winning drama was similarly "mad".
Earlier this week, Cranston tweeted "'Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures.' I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest."
A few days later Toys R Us stopped selling the toys, saying they were taking "an infinite sabbatical"
Breaking Bad follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, who becomes a crystal meth dealer.
