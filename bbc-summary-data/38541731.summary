Andrew Shorrock and his mother Amy, 34, were last seen in Tameside in Greater Manchester at about 12.30 GMT on Friday, police said.
Ch Insp Chris Downey appealed to Ms Shorrock to contact police, saying "yours and Andrew's welfare is our priority".
After reviewing CCTV footage, police believe they are in Blackpool.
Ms Shorrock and her son were seen on CCTV at Manchester Piccadilly railway station where they boarded the 15:47 train to Blackpool in Lancashire, police said.
They left the train at Blackpool North station at 17:07 GMT.
Ch Insp Downey said Ms Shorrock's family were "worried" and "desperate" to speak to her.
"We are extremely concerned about Amy and Andrew, and I would like to appeal directly to Amy to please get in touch with us to let us know you are both safe and well," he said.
"Amy's mother Deborah Shorrock wants to appeal directly to Amy to come home safely with Andrew as she is extremely worried about them."
Ms Shorrock is described as white, 5ft 6in tall and of medium build with long dark hair. She was last seen wearing a black hooded top and had a small, dark suitcase on wheels.
Andrew is described as white, of slim build but tall for his age, with short brown hair. He was last seen wearing a grey and burgundy fleece top and blue jeans.
Ch Insp Downey asked anybody who thinks they may have seen Ms Shorrock and her son to contact police.
