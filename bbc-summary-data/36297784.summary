He ran 13km (8m) on Sunday as the ambassador for Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey.
The Jersey-born film star is best known for his recent roles as Superman but described the run as "really, really difficult".
"I am not really built for running and with the training I've been doing, it's Superman training stuff, so it's all about size," he said.
"I enjoyed it as much as you can enjoy something like that. Hopefully next year I'll be better!"
Cavill said the park's conservation work, which includes housing critically endangered lowland gorillas, was "really important" and was teaching people "how to combat this creep towards extinction".
