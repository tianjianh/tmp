Wales and the EU Referendum: How the parties stand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In order to answer the referendum question on 23 June, Welsh and UK voters are likely to ask themselves several other questions - how would staying or leaving the EU affect me, my family, my job, my country?

Politicians are keen to remind us their votes count no more than ours.
As Prime Minister David Cameron said when announcing the date of the referendum: "The choice is in your hands".
But there's no doubt the politicians and parties will be trying to influence that choice.
So, on which side of the campaign do our representatives in Wales fall?
Despite opinion polls to date suggesting a close race in Wales, our politicians are disproportionately backing continued membership.
Leaving the EU would "be more damaging to Wales than any other part of Britain", said Lord Hain as he launched Welsh Labour's campaign to stay in the EU.
Claims that Brexit could put 200,000 Welsh jobs at risk and bring the farming industry "effectively to an end" led the then Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb to accuse Labour of making "wild, outlandish claims".
But the vast majority of party members, including all of its Welsh MPs and sole MEP, are united in supporting a 'Remain' vote.
United is not a word you would associate with the Conservatives when it comes to the EU referendum.
The party is split from bottom to top - David Cameron is campaigning for the UK to stay in the Union, but Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies wants us to leave.
Of the 11 Welsh Tory MPs, six, including Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, have said Britain should remain, four want to leave and one is undecided.
Support for the EU is as entwined in Plaid's fabric as Welsh nationalism.
The EU is a "natural home" for Wales, according to Plaid.
Launching Plaid's Wales In Europe campaign, the party's MEP Jill Evans said Wales benefits "economically, socially and culturally" from membership.
Welsh Liberal Democrats
Unapologetically pro-EU - the self-proclaimed "party of 'In"'.
They say they are the only British party that unequivocally backs remaining in the Union.
Launching their European election campaign in 2014, the Welsh Lib Dems said "it would be a disaster for our economy and for Welsh jobs if we left the EU.
The clue is in the name - campaigning for the UK's independence from the EU is the party's raison d'Ãªtre.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage says the party's rising support in recent years was responsible for forcing the referendum on to the agenda.
According to Welsh leader Nathan Gill: "Wales will vote to leave the EU".
