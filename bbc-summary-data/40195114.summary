Salford Red Devils hooker Logan Tomkins and winger Greg Johnson have both signed new undisclosed-length contracts with the Super League club.

Tomkins, 24, joined Salford on a permanent deal from Wigan in 2016 and has become their first-choice hooker.
Johnson, 27, has been at the AJ Bell Stadium since 2014 and scored 10 tries this season in 18 appearances.
"Logan is one of the hardest workers around, he does so much unseen work," head coach Ian Watson said.
"Greg is one of the best wingers in Super League when it comes to getting the team on the front foot. He's an extremely good trainer and that shows on the field," Watson added.
