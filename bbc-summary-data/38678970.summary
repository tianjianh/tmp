More than 3,000 guests have been on the show since it was first broadcast on 29 January 1942.
Presenter Kirsty Young said having Beckham choosing his favourite tracks for the anniversary show was "the perfect gift".
Beckham, 41, said music has been a "huge" part of his family's life.
He is married to former Spice Girl singer turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham and the couple's youngest son Cruz, 11, released a Christmas-themed single last month.
It is not yet known if he has picked any of his wife's hits with the pop group, or any of her solo endeavours.
What is Desert Island Discs?
Beckham said: "I'm delighted to join Desert Island Discs for its 75th anniversary celebrations.
"Music has been a huge part of my - and my family's - life and it is a real pleasure to highlight that on such an iconic programme."
Young said of her guest: "His sporting legacy is of course extraordinary. And along with his charisma, cultural impact and humanitarian work, he is a modern man of many parts.
"He'll be a fascinating guest to welcome on to my little interview island."
Desert Island Discs' anniversary will be marked with a three-hour programme on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 28 January, presented by Young, featuring some of the guests from past shows.
They include Cilla Black, talking about her early career singing with The Beatles, and Richard Dimbleby, discussing taking a cutlery set from Hitler's bunker after being one of the first correspondents to visit it after the dictator's death.
Extracts from recently rediscovered episodes that are being added to the show's online archive will also feature.
The show featuring Beckham will reintroduce the sound of the sea to the opening and closing of the programme for the first time since the 1960s.
BBC Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra controller Gwyneth Williams said: "A sure way to uncover an elusive British national identity is to listen to this programme week after week.
"The broad range of guests is a measure of contemporary talent and achievement, and the music opens up different eras and prompts emotional memory in all of us."
