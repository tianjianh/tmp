The long-awaited redevelopment of the site of a former Sunderland brewery which has lain empty for 17 years is under way.

More than 300 people lost their jobs when the Vaux Brewery closed in 1999 after 162 years.
Several proposals for the five-acre site failed to win planning permission.
But a Â£20m bid to build homes, an office and retail block and leisure complex was approved by Sunderland City Council planners in April.
Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland City Council, said: "This is a momentous day for Sunderland as work begins on this major redevelopment, on a prime site which has stood idle for far too long.
"A huge amount of work has gone into the plans and designs which will now start to see fruition."
The first phase of the revamp is expected to be completed by June 2018 in time for the Tall Ships Race.
