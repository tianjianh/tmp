Konta was beaten by German Julia Goerges in the first round of the French Open but has risen to a best-ever ranking of 18.
The 25-year-old will play either fellow Briton Freya Christie or China's Zheng Saisai in the next round.
"I am very happy to come through. She started off very well so I had to dig deep," Konta told BBC Sport.
"It was my first match on grass so I am glad to get another opportunity to play this week."
Konta is seeded second for the grass-court event, behind the Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova.
There was also some British success earlier in the day as Tara Moore booked her place in the main draw with a 6-2 6-2 qualifying win over Shuko Aoyama.
British stars Heather Watson, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady are also all in the first-round draw, as is former world number one Caroline Wozniacki.

It was the 26-year-old's first match since being knocked out of the French Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic and the world number 58 will play second seed Bernard Tomic in the next round.
