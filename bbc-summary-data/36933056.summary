In the curtain-raiser before the senior game between the counties, Cork led 0-6 to 0-1 before Jason McGee's goal cut the margin to only two points.
Cork regrouped to lead by four at half-time but Donegal hit five of the next six scores to draw level on 41 minutes.
After Cork had been reduced to 14 men, sub Shane McGrath hit Donegal's second goal with three minutes left.
Cork bossed the early stages and hit five unanswered points to move into a 0-6 to 0-1 lead by the 26th minute.
McGee's goal a minute later cut Cork's lead to two but the Rebels hit four straight points in first-half injury time before an Aidan McLaughlin score reduced the margin to 0-10 to 1-3 at the interval.
However as Donegal took control, they were on terms by the time Enda McCormack pointed in the 41st minute.
Further scores from Eoghan McGettigan and McCormack helped Donegal move into a two-point advantage and McGrath's goal rounded off their second-half comeback.
Donegal defeated Derry 2-10 to 1-11 in the Ulster Final earlier this month.
