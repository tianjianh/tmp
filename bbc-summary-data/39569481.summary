Serie A side Palermo have sacked their fourth manager of the season as Diego Lopez paid the price for winning just one of his 10 games in charge.

Lopez, appointed at the end of January, was dismissed after a 4-0 defeat at AC Milan on Sunday which left Palermo eight points adrift of safety.
President Paul Baccaglini said: "A big shake-up is needed.  I am trying everything possible to get the team to react with their heads up."
Coach Diego Bortoluzzi will take over.
Baccaglini was named as president last month, replacing Maurizio Zamparini, who oversaw nearly 40 coaching changes during his 15 turbulent years in charge.
Palermo went through five coaches in just three months last season, and former Swansea City coach Bortoluzzi is the 12th change of manager in two seasons.
They began the season under Davide Ballardini who left by mutual consent in early September.
He was replaced by Roberto de Zerbi who was sacked at the end of November and followed by Eugenio Corini, who resigned in January.
