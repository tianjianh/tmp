New Rangers arrival Ryan Jack insists he is relishing the challenge of facing former club Aberdeen next season.

The 25-year-old midfielder acknowledged a "hatred" between fans of the Premiership rivals but is not nervous about meeting his old team.
"It will probably be one of the first ones I look out for when the fixtures do come out," said Jack, who signed a three-year deal at Ibrox.
"But there is no fear or dread, it is just going to be excitement."
The former Dons skipper added: "I look forward to going back to the club that I was at since I was eight years old and the club that got me where I am today."
Jack, who lost the captaincy before last month's Scottish Cup final, was jeered by a section of Aberdeen's support once news of his imminent move was revealed in the media.
"I knew there would be a backlash and I knew that there is that hatred maybe, if you say, between Aberdeen and Rangers," he said.
"But that never affected me one bit in my decision and what I wanted to do with my career.
"When I spoke to the manager here, straight away I thought this is the right place to come and try to progress my career.
"I am not interested in what anyone says apart from my new team-mates, my family and friends and the manager."
Aberdeen finished second behind Celtic in last season's Premiership and nine points clear of Rangers.
Ibrox boss Pedro Caixinha has been busy, with five new signings already confirmed.
Meanwhile, Dons manager Derek McInnes and his assistant Tony Docherty are to hold talks with Sunderland over their managerial vacancy.
Along with Jack, Niall McGinn and Ash Taylor have left Aberdeen under freedom of contract and Dons winger Jonny Hayes has been widely linked with a move to champions Celtic.
"Everyone has their own ambitions and Derek McInnes will be no different," added Jack.
"He is a great manager and I am sure that if the right club and the right moves come up for him there is no doubt that he is going to look at it, that's the way football works.
"But whoever goes in I know for a fact that they are going to get a great group of players and a great bunch to work with because I have played with them."
