The 22-year-old centre, who is moving to Exeter from Bath this summer, is a member of the England Saxons squad currently touring South Africa.
Devoto made his England debut against Wales last month, having been an unused replacement during the Six Nations.
"He's given me a few technical points, but the main one is just the desire to play for England," he told BBC Sport.
"He's proven that he'll break the mould in terms of selection and pick new faces who have shown that they want to play for England.
"The main work for me is to just the desire to play for England and that consistent performance, so that's something I've taken on board."
Since making his Bath debut in 2012, Devoto has scored nine tries and was in the side which lost the 2015 Premiership play-off final to Saracens.
He is now working with Exeter backs coach Ali Hepher, who is currently in charge of the Saxons squad.
"Ali's had a very successful year with Exeter this year, it was an unbelievable achievement for them," he said.
"I'm really excited just to be a part of that next year.
"He's a very good coach, and having only spent a week and a half together, I'm already seeing what kind of a coach he is."
