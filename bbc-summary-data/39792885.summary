One-Day Cup: Jonny Bairstow hundred sets up Yorkshire win over Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Jonny Bairstow hammered 174 off 113 balls as Yorkshire beat Durham at Headingley to maintain their 100% start to the One-Day Cup.

Bairstow, who was dropped on 71, struck seven sixes and 16 fours in a stand of 189 in 25 overs with Joe Root (55).
His was the third century of the day as Stephen Cook (106) and Michael Richardson (100no) saw Durham to 335-5.
Bairstow and Root both fell to James Weighell (3-60), but Yorkshire reached 339-4 with 14 balls to spare.
The White Rose county, who last lifted a limited-overs trophy in 2002, have won all three games so far, while Durham have one victory from three.
Keaton Jennings set the visitors on their way with 72 before a brilliant boundary catch by Peter Handscomb brought his innings to an end.
South Africa Test opener Cook's 108-ball century was his first for Durham, while Richardson reached three figures from only 87 balls with two runs off the final delivery of their innings.
However, they were overshadowed by Bairstow, who revelled in his new role at the top of the order and raced to his hundred from 70 balls.
He was particularly punishing on the leg-side and had the chance to become only the third batsman after Surrey's Alistair Brown and Ravi Bopara of Essex to make a double century in a List A game between two first-class counties.
The 27-year-old was caught behind from the final ball of the 34th over, leaving Yorkshire to score 87 from the final 16.
England Test captain Root played on during an unproductive period when they failed to find the boundary between the end of the 33rd and middle of the 39th overs.
Skipper Gary Ballance, though, hit three successive boundaries off Paul Coughlin in the 41st over in his 29 before trod on his stumps, leaving Handscomb (47 not out) and Tim Bresnan to finish the job.
