'Deep wedge' dividing Labour, says Islwyn MP Chris Evans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is a "deep wedge" in Labour with little sign it can re-unite after the leadership election, one of the party's Welsh MPs has warned.

Islwyn MP Chris Evans, an Owen Smith supporter, said Jeremy Corbyn appeared to have no plan to bring Labour together if he survives the challenge.
He told BBC Wales the party needed to be "firmer" with new members making abusive posts online.
But Mr Corbyn's allies have complained of a "rigged purge" of his supporters.
Mr Evans told the Good Morning Wales programme: "I don't know how the two sides can come together - I think there is a deep wedge in the Labour Party now.
"If Corbyn wins the election he's being very naive if he thinks he can suddenly bring the party together.
"80% of the Parliamentary Labour Party [that] work with him day-to-day have called for him to resign - how he brings those together I don't know, there doesn't seem to be any plan whatsoever."
In June Mr Evans accused Mr Corbyn of "egotism, arrogance and narcissism".
The deadline for ballot papers in the contest to be returned is the 21 September.
The result is due to be announced at a special conference in Liverpool three days later.
