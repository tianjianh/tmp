Irish government failed most vulnerable says report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish government has been criticised for failing to adequately protect the human rights of vulnerable groups during the recession.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission said seven years of austerity resulted in the burden of the crisis falling disproportionally on those least able to bear it.
The commission was set up last year to promote and protect human rights in the state.
This is its first report.
Speaking on RTÃ‰'s Morning Ireland programme, Chief Commissioner Emily Logan said the government had failed to meet basic human rights standards required under international law - in the stark choices made during the recession.
There was an absence of any human rights or equality assessment of the "troika" (EU, IMF and European Central Bank) bail-out programme.
This meant those who were already disadvantaged were even more susceptible to unemployment, lower incomes or poorer living standards.
People with disabilities experienced the impact of austerity measures more acutely, with the rate of unemployment almost trebling among this group - from 8% to 22% during the recession.
The report, published on Thursday, comes ahead of a UN Committee in Geneva next week where Ireland will be asked to defend its record on human rights.
