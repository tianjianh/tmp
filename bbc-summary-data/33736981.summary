Cardiff bus station closes for Central Square redevelopment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff bus station will shut on Saturday night ahead of a major redevelopment of the site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The closure will allow work to start on the development of Central Square, which will include a new BBC Wales headquarters and a bus interchange.
The last buses will leave at about 23:10 BST and after that time services will run from nearby streets.
The new station will link to the neighbouring railway station and is expected to open in December 2017.
Detailed plans for the new facility are expected to be submitted later this year but it will be created on the current NCP car park site.
Foster and Partners will design the building, which will be created around a public concourse and include shops, offices and a 200-bed hotel.
