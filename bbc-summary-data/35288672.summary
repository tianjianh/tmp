Glamorgan spin bowling coach Robert Croft says the Welsh county's head coach vacancy appeals to him.

Croft, 45, who will join England's coaching staff for the one-day leg of their tour to South Africa, is viewed as a leading contender for the role.
Former Glamorgan boss Toby Radford left the job last month, a year before his contract was due to end.
"It's certainly a job that appeals to me. It's just whether it's the right time for the people here," Croft said.
"There is a process in place. Lots of people will be interested in coaching the wonderful club that we have here."
Former all-rounder Croft's playing career ended with Glamorgan in 2012.
Commenting of his new role within the England backroom team, Croft added: "It's a 12-day trip to South Africa. Nothing technical, purely tactical.
"Hopefully it will be an experience that I will gain from."
