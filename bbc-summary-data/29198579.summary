The German, 25, who has just returned after 20 months out with a knee injury, pulled up during Saturday's 2-0 win over Stuttgart.
"I will come back and carry on from where I had got back to after my long injury absence," he said.
New signing from Roma Mehdi Benatia could replace him against City.
It was initially thought Badstuber had only strained his thigh, but a test on Sunday revealed he had torn muscle tendons.
"Of course I'm very disappointed right now," said the 25-year-old on his club's website. "But I'm now used to it and I know how to deal with such situations. I will not give up."
Badstuber had been highly praised by Bayern coach Pep Guardiola for his performances this season.
