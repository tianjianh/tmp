Australia v England: Hosts team changes no distraction - Ian Bell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Ian Bell says Australia being without seven of their World Cup squad for Friday's tri-series match in Hobart will not be a distraction.

New changes for the hosts see opener David Warner rested, stand-in skipper George Bailey suspended for a slow over-rate and Shane Watson injured.
"We haven't gone into depth about the XI they'll have," Bell told BBC Sport.
"If we can concentrate on ourselves and execute our plans we'll be difficult whatever XI Australia put out."
Australia, who also continue to rest pacemen Mitchell Johnson and Josh Hazlewood, plus all-rounder Mitchell Marsh before next month's World Cup, have brought in all-rounder Moises Henriques to cover Watson, who has a tight hamstring.
Regular captain Michael Clarke carries on with his rehabilitation from hamstring trouble.
England lost the opening match of the series against the Australians by three wickets in Sydney but revived hopes of meeting them in the final on 1 February with a nine-wicket bonus point victory against India, who have lost both of their opening matches.
After Friday's game, England play India again in Perth on 30 January, which could determine who goes through to the final at the same venue.
Bell, who was out to the first ball of the series in Sydney, made an unbeaten 88 against India and said of his partnership with Moeen Ali at the top of the innings: "It's a nice blend.
"I'm trying to be as aggressive as I possibly can be, but by playing the way that suits my game."
After Andrew Flintoff trained with the team in Brisbane recently, where he was playing in the Big Bash franchise for Brisbane Heat, another all-rounder Tim Bresnan was invited to bowl in the nets during practice in Hobart.
The 29-year-old, who last played for England in March 2014 during the World Twenty20, has been in the Tasmanian capital playing for Hobart Hurricanes.
