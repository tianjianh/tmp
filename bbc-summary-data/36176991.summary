The pilot and a passenger died after the aircraft came down in a field off Mains Lane, between Whitwell-on-the-Hill and Wellburn, officers said.
Emergency services were called to the scene near Castle Howard in the Ryedale area at about 10:40 BST.
The Air Accident Investigation Branch has launched an inquiry. Police are yet to confirm the victims' identities.
Supt Mark Grange, from North Yorkshire Police, said the plane was still mostly intact when it landed more than 200m away from the nearest houses.
"It looks like it came straight down," he said.
"It looks like an aircraft, with two wings and a tail fin where it should be.
"It's in a bad way and it's obviously come down heavily. It's sat on its underside so it has not flipped.
"Whether they tried to land like that I don't know."
Eyewitness Andrew Moutrie, 54, from Hovingham, said he was on his way to a football match when he came across the crash scene near the A64.
"It looks like the aircraft attempted a crash landing. It looks like it came through the hedge towards the field," he said.
Supt Grange said the site had been declared safe by the fire service after "worries about the amount of fuel" from the plane.
"We're just preserving the scene until the air investigation branch attend. That's anticipated at about six this evening and then we'll be directed as to the next steps really around the recovery phase," he added.
A cordon has been placed around the crash site and the public has been advised to avoid the area. A number of roads have also been closed.
North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said three crews were sent to the scene - two from Malton and another from York.
A spokesman said up to 20 firefighters attended the crash site and a foam blanket had been placed around the aircraft in case it caught fire.
