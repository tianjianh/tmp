[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 3-3 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury produced an amazing comeback from three goals down at half-time to earn a point in a thriller at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walsall led on six minutes as Erhun Oztumer and Andreas Makris combined to tee up Kieron Morris to drill home from 10 yards.
The Saddlers doubled their lead after 14 minutes as Oztumer pounced on an error from Shakers defender Leon Barnett to fizz a 25-yarder into the bottom corner.
It was 3-0 on 32 minutes as Simeon Jackson stole in at the near post to poke Makris' cross past Ben Williams from close range.
Walsall could have been out of sight by the break but Williams twice foiled Jackson one-on-one - and Bury were back in it with two goals in the first five minutes of the second half.
Barnett drilled home a 47th-minute corner from 10 yards and then nodded down a high ball for new signing James Vaughan to make it 3-2 from similar range two minutes later.
Danny Mayor lashed home Bury's leveller from 15 yards on 66 minutes - and the Shakers could have won it two minutes later but Vaughan's half-volley flashed inches over.
