Man charged with attempted murder and dangerous driving

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court charged with attempted murder after a pedestrian was struck by a car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Evans, 19, appeared in private at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Thursday following an incident on Balnagask Wynd, Torry, on Tuesday.
Police said a male pedestrian was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after being hit by a car at about 15:45.
Mr Evans, from Manchester, was also charged with dangerous driving and three drug related charges.
He is further alleged to have driven while disqualified and without car insurance.
He made no plea and declaration and was remanded in custody.
John Belfield, 21, also appeared at the court in connection with the alleged drug offences.
Prosecutors claim he was involved in the supply of drugs and that he failed to give police information that could identify the driver of a car believed to be involved in an offence.
Mr Belfield, also from Manchester, made no plea or declaration and was released on bail.
Another man was also subject to a police report but did not appear in court.
Mr Evans is expected to appear in court again within the next eight days.
