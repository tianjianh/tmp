The Tyco BMW rider sat out the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT to take part in the Tour Divide cycle race.
The Lincolnshire man, who was injured in a 130mph crash at Ireland's Corner last August, has yet to indicate whether he will race again this season.
"We are hoping that Guy will be back at the Ulster once again," said Johnston.
"While he might be short on track time this season you could never bet against him at Dundrod," said Johnston of the 11-times winner.
Organisers and fans may get a clearer indication of Martin's intentions for the remainder of the season if he competes in next week's Southern 100 races on the Isle of Man.
Among the riders who will be on the grid on 10-13 August are Yorkshire's Ian Hutchinson and Ballymoney man Michael Dunlop, who dominated last month's Isle of Man TT Races.
They will come up against Kawasaki pilot Peter Hickman, the winner of a Superbike race at the 7.4-mile circuit last year, and the 2015 hat-trick hero, Fermanagh's Lee Johnston.
Other confirmed entries include William Dunlop, double North West 200 Supertwins victor Ivan Lintin, Silicone Engineering Kawasaki rider Dean Harrison, Mar-Train Yamaha pilot Dan Kneen and New Zealander Bruce Anstey.
Anstey has held the absolute lap record for Dundrod since 2010 at a speed of 133.977mph and will ride the MotoGP-based RCV Padgett's Honda that he campaigned at the TT last month.
The event has a new title sponsor for 2016 in MCE Insurance and boasts a revised practice schedule, plus a new Superpole style qualifying session.
