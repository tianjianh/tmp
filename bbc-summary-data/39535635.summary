Treadwell, who won the National in 2009 on 100-1 shot Mon Mome, will be replaced on Tenor Nivernais by Aidan Coleman.
Treadwell was taken to hospital after falling from Bright New Dawn in the Topham Chase.
"They are keeping him in overnight," said Venetia Williams, trainer of both Bright New Dawn and Tenor Nivernais.
"He says there is no way he's going to be able to ride," she added.
