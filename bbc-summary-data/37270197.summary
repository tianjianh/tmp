The married airman in his late 20s was out running in Marham on 20 July when he was ambushed by two men.
The airman, who has not been identified, said he was near RAF Marham when he was grabbed by a man who tried to drag him towards a nearby car.
He fought back, knocking one to the floor, before the pair fled.
RAF Marham is home to some of the Tornado bombers that have recently taken part in air strikes against the so-called Islamic State.
Norfolk Police will be appealing for information on the BBC's Crimewatch programme on Monday night.
"This whole event has turned my world upside down," he said. "The outcome could have been a lot more severe but it's the 'what ifs', you know, not being able to see my wife again, not being able to see my family again.
"And I knew what I had to do to get away. I was fighting for my life. I won't let this stop me from doing things I need to do, but it does affect you emotionally," he said.
Police said the first suspect was aged between 20 and 30, about 6ft, athletic but stocky, with dark hair that was long on top and a well-groomed beard. He had a dark skin tone and wore casual clothing.
The second suspect was described as between 20 and 30 but younger than the first suspect and slimmer.
He was about 5ft 10ins, clean shaven with short dark hair and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts.
Detective Superintendent Paul Durham will be speaking to Jeremy Vine on Crimewatch live from RAF Marham on Monday at 21:00 BST on BBC One.
