Glasgow janitors set for further strike over pay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Over 100 primary school janitors in Glasgow are set for another three-day strike over a pay dispute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unison union claims employers Cordia - a body of Glasgow City Council - are refusing to discuss the issues surrounding the strike.
It is over additional payments for tasks which the janitors say are "dirty, unpleasant, involve regularly working outside or heavy lifting".
Janitors first walked out in March and are set for further action on 20 April.
Cordia said they had given Unison three opportunities to outline their issues and that the matter was considered by a committee before being rejected.
A spokesman for the facilities company said: "Cordia has completely exhausted all internal processes after negotiations with Unison and is not required to convene a meeting to further negotiate when at this stage there is no possibility of a settlement."
But Unison said janitors were entitled to the Working Context and Demands Payment which ranges from about £500 to more than £1,000.
Sam Macartney, Unison branch officer, said: "We want justice for jannies in Glasgow.
"The city's parents, carers and the wider public will be rightly astonished that the employer is refusing to even meet these hard-working janitors and their trade union."
Industrial action over the payment began on 19 January when janitors began boycotting a number of duties.
Unison said Cordia were using "spurious arguments" to justify not awarding the payment.
