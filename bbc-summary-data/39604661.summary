Both defenders missed Monday's defeat at Cardiff, centre-back Mills suffering with a quad problem, while full-back Traore is nursing an ankle knock.
Reading manager Jaap Stam will wait to make a fitness decision on centre-back Paul McShane (hamstring).
Joey van den Berg (hamstring) remains out of contention for the Royals, who start the day in third place.
Reading, six points behind second-placed Newcastle United, must win to keep alive their automatic promotion hopes alive, while Forest start the day just a point clear of trouble.
They are a place above Blackburn Rovers, who face Wolves at Molineux, and two points behind 20th-placed Birmingham City, who do not play until Sunday, when Harry Redknapp takes charge of his first game against Aston Villa
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"The opponents we're facing now, they're desperate to do well against us. That goes for Forest and for Wigan next week.
"At home, Forest are going to want to get a result, we know that and we need a result as well.
"So, it's going to be an interesting game and a very sharp game as well as they need to give everything to get that result.
"But I like playing in these games as it ensures everyone needs to work very hard and everyone is willing to do that."
