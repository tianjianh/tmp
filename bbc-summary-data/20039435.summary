Preliminary autopsy results showed the Top Gun director had "therapeutic levels" of the anti-depressant Mirtazapine and the prescription sleep-aid Lunesta in his system.
It added Scott did not have any serious illnesses, including cancer.
The director jumped from Vincent Thomas Bridge in Los Angeles on 19 August.
The findings shed no light on a motive for why Scott took his own life.
It had been revealed previously that the director left notes behind in his car including messages to friends and loved ones, but did not explain his actions.
Initial reports after his death suggested Scott had been diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, but his widow Donna Wilson dismissed the rumours as "absolutely false".
A coroner's spokesman said the final report would be ready in two weeks.
The younger brother of director Ridley Scott, Tony also directed Enemy of the State, Beverly Hills Cop II and Crimson Tide.
At the time of his death, he was reported to be involved in a number of film projects including a sequel to Top Gun, where Tom Cruise was expected to reprise his role as fighter pilot Maverick.
