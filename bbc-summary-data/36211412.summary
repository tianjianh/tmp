Newport County manager Warren Feeney will tell his players next week whether they will be offered new contracts.

Goalkeeper Joe Day and strikers Lenell John-Lewis and Tom Meechan are the only players contracted beyond the end of the current campaign.
County are away to AFC Wimbledon in their final League Two game of the season on Saturday before Feeney announces who will be released.
"I think it's unfair on them at the moment," Feeney said.
"We'll get this game out of the way and worry about the rest after.
"Players will go but I want to keep the core of the players and obviously add that little bit more.
"I'm looking for a bit more quality over quantity to be honest and I want people who want to work hard and having the mentality of not getting beat."
Feeney has said previously that County may not be able to keep their key players at the club this summer.
The former Northern Ireland striker is County's third manager of the season after taking over in January from Oldham-bound John Sheridan, who had succeeded Terry Butcher in October.
County secured their Football League status with two games of the campaign remaining and Feeney has already started planning for next season.
"Our objective was to stay in the league and we've done that," Feeney added.
"We were rock bottom of the league and to get where we are has been a long, long journey.
"But it's one that certainly gives you a good backbone for next year."
Saturday's opponents AFC Wimbledon have secured their place in the League Two play-offs in their fourth season in the Football League.
Feeney cites Neil Ardley's side as an example of what Newport can achieve following their flirtation with relegation this season,
"Ards is a fantastic guy and a great man manager and he's got players playing for him," Feeney said.
