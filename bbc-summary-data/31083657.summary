The man, in his fifties, was found by members of the public in West Hendford near the town centre at 03:00 GMT.
Police said his next of kin have been informed.
He was captured on CCTV going into the alleyway between Tesco car park and the Manor Hotel at 02:00 GMT, but police want to trace his movements afterwards.
Det Con Dan King said: "He's described as white, of proportionate build, with dark hair.
"He was wearing a black padded jacket over a grey woollen jumper and had a distinctive Manchester City football scarf on with black and white writing on it.
"We also believe the man's black leather wallet may be missing so if anyone finds a wallet matching this description, please call us."
Det Con King said the man was known to have visited the Westminster pub in Westminster Street, the Liberal Club, now known as the 94 club, in Middle Street, and then the Labour Club on Central Road.
