[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lorry tests as monitors installed in Forth Road Bridge first

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten lorries have been used during tests of a new state-of-the-art structural monitoring system installed at the Forth Road Bridge for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The specialist system monitors the strain from wind, traffic and the weight of the bridge.
Specialists were brought in to install the monitors which will feed data back to the control room.
The bridge was closed to all traffic on 4 December after a crack was discovered in a truss under the carriageway.
Engineers hope to have it repaired and open to traffic again by 4 January.
An inquiry will begin after that, with MSPs agreeing that the "immediate" priority should be to get the bridge reopened.
The lorries were sent over the bridge in different patterns over five hours of tests on Saturday.
An inquiry will focus primarily on the structural defect, and an independent technical adviser will be asked to take part.
The inquiry aims to call officials from bridge operator Amey, its predecessor the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, Transport Scotland staff and Transport Secretary Derek Mackay.
