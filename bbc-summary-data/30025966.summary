It found that 690,000 people travelled to the city to attend the games. Hotel occupancy in Glasgow reached 95%.
Other parts of Scotland were also said to have benefited, with visitors spending an average of five days in the country.
Leader of Glasgow City Council Gordon Matheson said the event had been "the best games ever".
Games minister Shona Robison commented: "We were determined from the beginning that these Games would leave a positive lasting impact across Scotland and to know that so many visitors have been to Scotland and left with good memories leaves us with much to be proud of.
"The Games, plus the successful Ryder Cup and the many Homecoming events of 2014, have helped create a very successful sustainable tourism legacy for years to come.
"It is this legacy combined with the boost received by businesses in Scotland from the Games that gives us much to build on for the future."
The Games Visitor Impact Study was carried out on behalf of Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Marketing Bureau.
Councillor Matheson added: "The Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games was of course the greatest ever, and one of the key legacies it leaves behind is an even higher profile for Glasgow internationally.
"In the city during August, the average hotel occupancy rate was over 95 per cent, with this exceeding 99 per cent on five nights that month.
"These fantastic figures reflect Glasgow's ever-growing reputation as a visitor destination and the pulling power of the city's events programme."
