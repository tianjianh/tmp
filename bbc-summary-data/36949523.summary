Lincoln City 6-1 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Rhead's second brace in as many games inspired Lincoln to a 6-1 victory at home to North Ferriby in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It did not take long for him to break the deadlock, meeting Sam Habergham's cross with an excellent header after just two minutes.
A 25-yard strike from Nathan Arnold made it two just three minutes later, Arnold meeting a sublime cross-field pass from Lee Beevers.
Arnold then turned provider for Luke Waterfall who headed his corner in on 16 minutes, before Ben Middleton saw red for conceding a penalty and Rhead got his second from the spot on 24 minutes.
Curtis Bateson pulled one back five minutes later from United's first attack, but after the break Johnny Margetts and Bradley Wood completed the rout by the 66th minute - the latter with an excellent solo effort.
