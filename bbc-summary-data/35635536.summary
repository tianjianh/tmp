[SN]TITLE[SN]
Met officers to be investigated over Hackney moped death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Met officers pursuing a teenager who was killed when his scooter hit a van in Hackney could face a criminal investigation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Johnson, 18, died after his white Vespa scooter collided with a vehicle in Clapton Common on 9 February.
The constable and a sergeant, who were in separate cars, have both been served with a gross misconduct notice and told they will be investigated.
The IPCC said it would look at the "standard of their driving".
Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said "sufficient evidence" had been gathered "to determine that criminal offences may have been committed".
However, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the launch of the investigation "does not not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow".
A 19-year-old passenger was injured but has been discharged from hospital.
