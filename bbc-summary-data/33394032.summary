Northern Powergrid, the company responsible for the distribution of electricity, said engineers were dealing with the situation in Wetherby.
Powergrid manager Mick Hickling said the storm began at about 03:00 BST.
He said: "It has been quite a dramatic night, it got really intense about 04:30."
The company said the cut had been caused by power lines being struck by lightning.
