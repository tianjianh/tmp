Repairs have started to sea defences in North East Lincolnshire damaged in the east coast tidal surge 16 months ago.

Cleethorpes and Humberston Fitties were among many places damaged in December 2013.
North East Lincolnshire Council is paying Â£220,000 for the reinforcements, including replacing 90m (295ft) of reinforced wall.
The Environment Agency said the tidal surge in December 2013 was the worst recorded for 60 years.
The sea walls at North Promenade and Kingsway will be repaired, and track and hard standing along the sand dune defences will be removed, the council said.
North East Lincolnshire Council claimed severe weather recovery funds from the Environment Agency to cover the cost of the repairs.
Councillor David Watson said the area was "vulnerable" to flooding, but that the damage in December 2013 "could have been much worse".
"We need to make sure our defences are up to the job and these essential works will help protect our communities from the future threat of flooding," he said.
Thousands of people had to evacuate their homes when a severe storm which accompanied the tidal surge battered large parts of the UK.
The tidal surge damaged about 400 homes and businesses on both banks of the Humber Estuary.
A man had to be rescued from flood waters in Scarborough while trying to save his vehicle from being swept away.
In Norfolk, three cliff-top homes fell into the sea at Hemsby and four more were "seriously undermined".
The council said the repairs would take two weeks to complete.
