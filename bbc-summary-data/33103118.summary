[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The attack, in December 1971, was carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). One man was convicted of all 15 murders in 1978.
Police are treating the attack on the memorial as a hate crime.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor JJ Magee said it was "disgusting" and "an insult to all those who were killed and injured" in the bombing.
SDLP North Belfast assembly member Alban Maginness described it as "deplorable".
"I am disgusted and appalled at this deplorable attack on the McGurk's Bar memorial," he said.
Ulster Unionist Andy Allen said: "Those responsible for this attack really need to consider their actions, their impact on north Belfast and to desist from such activities immediately."
