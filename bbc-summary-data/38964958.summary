[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
U's winger Brennan Dickenson drilled wide early on before the hosts took a 13th-minute lead when George Elokobi picked up possession 25 yards out and curled a superb shot over stranded Wycombe goalkeeper Jamal Blackman.
Colchester keeper Sam Walker twice denied Wycombe's Paris Cowan-Hall while Alex Jakubiak's low cross-shot flashed across the six-yard box as the Chairboys pushed for an equaliser.
Wycombe striker Adebayo Akinfenwa blasted over at the second attempt from close range just before half-time after his first effort was blocked.
Walker saved Akinfenwa's weak close-range header just after half-time and Elokobi made an acrobatic goal-line clearance to deny Cowan-Hall while at the other end, Blackman pushed Kurtis Guthrie's low attempt around the post midway through the second half.
Michael Harriman nodded Guthrie's header off the line and Wycombe defender Joe Jacobson was sent off with two minutes remaining after being shown a second yellow card as Colchester claimed victory.
