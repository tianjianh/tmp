Officers are investigating reports of deer poaching in and around Dunnikier Park Golf Course in Kirkcaldy.
The incidents were reported after parts from three deer carcasses were found in the area on Wednesday.
Pc Lindsay Kerr, of Police Scotland, said: "Deer are a protected species and the methods used by poachers can cause significant suffering.
"These remains were very disturbing for the people who discovered them and we're urging anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area recently to come forward."
He said methods used by poachers include snares and crossbows.
