Ireland battle to draw with Zimbabwe A in four-day game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland warmed up for their forthcoming Intercontinental Cup game against Namibia by securing a draw in their four-day match against Zimbabwe A.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zimbabwe A batted on for four overs on Tuesday to add 26 runs and set Ireland a target of 386 in 84 overs in Harare.
With Ireland struggling at 141-5 and almost 40 overs remaining, John Mooney and Kevin O'Brien showed all their experience to add an unbroken 130.
Mooney ended 65 not out and O'Brien was unbeaten on 56 to ensure a draw.
Paul Stirling was rested from the final day, nursing a slight leg strain, so it was Niall O'Brien who opened the innings with Stuart Poynter.
Poynter was first to go, unable to follow up his first innings century, edging Vitori to depart for seven.
Andrew Balbirnie made 17, while O'Brien struck four boundaries in a fluent 39 before being trapped lbw by Vitori.
Gary Wilson and Stuart Thompson both made 25, before Mooney and Kevin O'Brien steered Ireland safely home.
Mooney struck 11 boundaries and O'Brien found the boundary rope nine times in their sixth-wicket partnership.
Ireland now fly to Windhoek where their Intercontinental Cup game with Namibia gets underway on Saturday.
