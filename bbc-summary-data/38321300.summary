The 28-year-old has played eight Tests, 31 one-day internationals and 19 Twenty20 matches for the national side since his debut in 2013.
Jordan previously signed a deal until the end of 2017 in March.
"I've gone from strength to strength and it's a club that really feels like home," Jordan said.
"We're in a little bit of a transitional period, but the philosophy that the club has and the plans [head coach] Mark Davis and the team are implementing are moving us in the right direction."
Jordan, who joined Sussex from Surrey ahead of the 2013 campaign, is currently in Australia preparing to play in the Big Bash League for Adelaide Strikers.
The Barbados-born player featured five times in the County Championship for Sussex last season, and appeared 10 times in the T20 Blast and seven times in the One-Day Cup.
Meanwhile, Charlotte Burton has left her post as head coach of Sussex Women for personal reasons and club chairman Jim May will stand down from his role in March next year.
