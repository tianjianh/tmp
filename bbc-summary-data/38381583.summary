[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset have signed South Africa opener Dean Elgar as their overseas player for 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old left-hander, who has previously played for Surrey, has hit six centuries in 32 Test matches and a total of 28 in first-class cricket.
His arrival is set to fill the gap in Somerset's batting line-up vacated by the retirement of former captain Chris Rogers at the end of the 2016 season.
He will be available for all formats, around his international commitments.
Elgar joins a Somerset top order that includes new club captain Tom Abell and former England opener Marcus Trescothick, who signed a new deal for 2017 in August.
The Taunton-based side finished second in the County Championship in 2016, narrowly missing out on a maiden title as Middlesex triumphed on the final day of the season.
As a slow left-arm bowler, Elgar has also taken 13 Test wickets.
He first played for Somerset in 2013 on a short-term contract, when he provided cover for Alviro Petersen.
