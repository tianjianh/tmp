Free events are being held in leisure centres, parks and beaches across the country from 27-29 August.
GB Beach volleyballer Jake Sheaf said: "The Go Spike Big Weekend is a fantastic opportunity for people of all ages and levels to get involved in this exhilarating sport!
"Take your friends, family or just yourself to one of the events and I guarantee you'll have a great time."
The sessions are open, flexible and friendly, providing an opportunity for people of different ages, gender and sporting ability to participate in beach volleyball.
The first Go Spike Big Weekend took place back in May and Belper Hammers Volleyball Club was one of the groups that ran a 'come-and-try session' with over 20 people attending.
Will Hughes, club secretary, player and coach said: "The Go Spike Big Weekend events have become a staple part of the Belper Hammers Volleyball Club calendar.
"We were able to showcase volleyball and give some people in our community the opportunity to engage with a sport that they would never imagine they would be able to play."
Rachel Laybourne, who competed for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics said: "I know I am a little biased, but I find volleyball incredibly fun and exciting for loads of different reasons.
"To start with it is a fantastic team sport that the whole family can play regardless of age or ability.
"It is also incredibly versatile so you can pop up and play in the local park, on the beach or in a community hall, where you can find some space.
"The other great fact is that is a fun way to get fit and burn calories, without purposely trying you get a great full body workout.
"So if you want to have a great time with your friends or family give volleyball a go over the Bank Holiday weekend at your nearest Go Spike Big Weekend Event!"
A number of locations will also be hosting sitting volleyball, an inclusive version of the sport open to able bodied and disabled players.
Martine Wright was part of the 2012 London Paralympics sitting volleyball team after losing both legs in the 7/7 bombings and later received the BBC Helen Rollason award in 2012.
"Sitting Volleyball is a great activity for people of all ages and abilities, it's social, fun and a good workout," says Martine.
"Sitting Volleyball is a great sport - we'd love to see you play soon."
