The Kiwi captain top-scored as his side looked to be heading for a win before play was halted in the second innings.
Australia were 53-3 after nine overs, chasing a revised target of 235 from 33 overs, when rain intervened.
The two teams pick up a point each as England top the group after Thursday's win over Bangladesh.
Australia needed to bat for at least 20 overs for a result to be declared through the Duckworth-Lewis method.
New Zealand opener Luke Ronchi got his side off to a flying start, showcasing a repertoire of shots with an aggressive approach.
The Australian bowlers struggled to find their line and length as a long rain delay in the morning reduced the number of overs to 46.
Ronchi raced to his half-century from just 34 balls before he was caught by Glen Maxwell off the bowling of John Hastings for 65, handing the reins over to his skipper Williamson.
Williamson batted superbly, starting with a patient approach. Accompanied by Ross Taylor, who scored 46, he kept the scoreboard ticking along between some high-scoring shots.
He registered his ninth one-day-international century in a knock that included eight fours and two sixes, before being run out on 100.

Australian seamer Josh Hazlewood registered career-best ODI figures, taking six wickets for 52 runs, as New Zealand's middle and lower order collapsed soon after their captain's dismissal.
New Zealand stuttered as they lost their last seven wickets for just 37 runs.
Hazlewood ensured the opposition didn't see see out their allotted overs, mopping up the tail with three wickets in four balls,

Another rain delay at the midway point set Australia their revised target.
David Warner and Aaron Finch did not get off to the most convincing start, with both openers dismissed in the space of eight balls.
New Zealand's Adam Milne struck again to leave their opponents reeling, before play was called off.
The result is reminiscent of the last time the sides met at Edgbaston, which was also rained off in the second innings.
Ex-New Zealand batsman Jeremy Corney on Test Match Special: "Kane Williamson has such good hands, plays the ball very late and is able to see the length and line at the last moment.
"It's very hard to keep him scoring just down to singles, he keeps on scoring.  At his best I think he is one of the top four players in the world. "
Ex-England batsman James Taylor on TMS: "The partnership between Williamson and Taylor laid the perfect platform for New Zealand but the crescendo never came.
"If they are to win the tournament, they can't afford to collapse like they did."
Australia captain Steve Smith: "I thought it was probably one of the worst bowling displays that we've put on for a very long time. We bowled both sides of wicket.
"We gave them a lot of freebies. And it was pretty ordinary, to be honest with you. Let's hope it's rust and let's hope it's gone."
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: "We were playing some good cricket. Would have been nice to see how the game would unfold if we were able to get out and finish it. But it is a funny game, cricket.
"And when there's rain around, the Duckworth-Lewis does tend to help the side batting second; but, like I say, the guys who were going well with the ball in hand, and it would have been interesting to see how it unfolded."
