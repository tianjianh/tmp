What questions do you have about Aleppo?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Syrian civil war has taken its toll on the entire country, but since 2012 Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, has become a key battleground. Do you have unanswered questions about Aleppo?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We have reported on the conflict in Syria since the civil war began in 2011. We have covered issues from air strikes, sanctions and international relations to daily life for residents of the city. But what issues do you want us to report on? What questions about Aleppo do you want answered?
Do you want to know about the politics of the city? Are you interested in Russian involvement? Or air strikes and ceasefires? Or do you want us to take a look at daily life for the residents of Aleppo?
We'll use your questions to help direct our coverage, and we'll let you select one question about the city that we'll answer.
