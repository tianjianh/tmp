[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 2-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil tested Carlisle's resilience with a second-half comeback as the Cumbrians held out to claim seventh successive home victory in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Brisley's first of the season and a Charlie Wyke header gave Carlisle a comfortable half-time advantage before Nathan Smith's goal set up an exciting finish in which both sides had chances.
Carlisle goalkeeper Mark Gillespie was brought into action early on, when he was forced to dive to his left to parry a 20-yard shot from Tahvon Campbell.
However the home side went in front in spectacular fashion in the 10th minute when Brisley seized on a clearance 25 yards from goal and sent a first-time volley dipping over Artur Krysiak's head and just under the bar.
Shaun Miller came within a fraction of adding to the lead when his delicate chip beat the goalkeeper and rebounded off the bar. Nicky Adams failed to keep his follow-up effort down, lofting the ball over the top from inside the area.
The Yeovil defence was struggling to cope with Carlisle's bright movement up front and Wyke made it 2-0 in the 36th minute with a bullet header at the near post from Adams's right-wing corner, the striker's 14th goal of the season.
The Glovers got back into the game just three minutes after the break when central defender Smith got up well to meet Matt Butcher's corner from the right and direct a firm header past Gillespie.
Yeovil spent long periods in the Carlisle half and Smith again went close from an inswinging corner, but twice Jabo Ibehre missed out with clear chances on the break for the Cumbrians.
