Officers were called to Springfield Drive just after midnight after the woman's body was found in a bedroom.
The death is being treated as suspicious as officers work to establish her identity and the cause of death.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed that a man had been detained in connection with the incident.
Local area commander Ch Insp Mandy Paterson said: "Our inquiries into how the woman died are ongoing, and detectives and forensic officers are carrying out a thorough investigation at the scene.
"For this particularly quiet area within the community this will be an unsettling time, however, I can confirm that we currently have a man in police custody.
"I would ask residents to be patient with us while we carry out the necessary door-to-door inquiries and we are committed to returning the area to normality as soon as possible."
