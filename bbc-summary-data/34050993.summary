The 24-year-old centre-back has joined from MK Dons after impressing for the Brewers in pre-season games against Leicester City and Derby County.
He said: "The training facilities at St George's Park are out of this world.
"The whole atmosphere at the club and the way the boys play football here all made sense as well. It was a real-no brainer moving here."
Flanagan added: "It's a fresh start with a new team who are already doing pretty well. Hopefully I can help take the club to where it wants to be, which is the next level."
