No support for Christmas market in Londonderry, say council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There will be no Christmas market in Londonderry this year because of a lack of public support.

Derry City and Strabane District council told members that analysis of the market revealed little appetite for it to return.
Some £120,000 has been set aside for marketing Christmas in the area, but there are now no plans for a market.
There are proposals for other celebrations, including a lights carnival.
In 2014. the market was moved from its traditional home at Guildhall Square to Ebrington Square.
SDLP councillor John Boyle, who is a member of the business and culture committee, said the latest news was regrettable.
"We were told that, in effect, there was no budget or no funding set aside for a Christmas market this year and the particular reason for that was that the analysis and evaluation has suggested that there wasn't sufficient public support for it," he said.
"This will be disappointing for some people, maybe less so for others."
Mr Boyle said the market's business performance left it vulnerable.
"The stalls just didn't seem to attract the sort of attention we would hope for.
"The council has set aside £120,000 for full marketing of the Christmas offering throughout the city and district.
"Around about £50,000 is for marketing and £70,000 will be for elements of programming which obviously includes Christmas lights switch on etc."
A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said one proposal was to replace the Christmas market with a revised schedule of events, including a Christmas lights carnival.
