The man was assaulted in Cumbrae Crescent at about 04:00 and was taken to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he is in a stable condition.
Police Scotland appealed for witness to the attack which detectives believe took place in a property.
They are keen to hear from anyone who heard a disturbance or saw someone making off from Cumbrae Crescent.
Det Sgt Fiona MacArthur said: "This was a serious assault which has left a man requiring hospital treatment for lacerations and puncture wounds after being assaulted with a knife.
"Violence will not be tolerated in our community and we are seeking the assistance of the public to identify the person responsible.
"We understand that the attack took place within a property and common close on Cumbrae Crescent. It is possible that you may have heard the disturbance or seen someone making off from Cumbrae Crescent after the assault.
"I would ask anyone with information to contact police officers at Clydebank."
