Online help tool made available to Scotland's teachers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An online education resource showcasing the best way to increase attainment in Scotland's schools has been launched by the country's education secretary.

John Swinney said the tool would help "all of our children to succeed".
The resource details examples from around Scotland which have improved the wellbeing and learning of children in the classroom.
Approaches include parent questionnaires, a family breakfast club and a walk-to-school programme.
Mr Swinney said: The information now available gives teachers and school leaders access to effective interventions based on practice examples from around Scotland.
"This suite of materials will be developed further in the coming weeks and months to include successful approaches based on the best available international evidence as we work with the Education Endowment Foundation to develop a Scottish specific version of their highly-regarded Teaching and Learning toolkit."
The online resource will be added to in the coming weeks.
Bill Maxwell, chief executive of Education Scotland, hoped the tool would help schools make decisions about closing the attainment gap between their "most and least disadvantaged children".
He added: "The interventions highlighted in this resource represent the wide range of different approaches which have been developed in Scotland, and which have proved to be effective.
"Education Scotland has a key role in ensuring that schools have easy access to evidence about 'what works' as they plan to address the priorities of the Scottish Attainment Challenge and the National Improvement Framework."
