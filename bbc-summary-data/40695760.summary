The Marvel panel at Comic-Con is traditionally one of the biggest events of the convention and this year was no exception.

Despite a lot of news coming out of Disney's D23 last week, the studio still saved some the big guns for San Diego.
Fans were sent into meltdown as they were bombarded with announcements and sneak peeks during the 90-minute session, as stars across the Marvel universe attended to support their films.
Here's everything that was revealed.

After fans at D23 were given the chance to see the first footage from the highly anticipated film which sees every Marvel superhero unite on screen, 6,000 Comic-Con fans were given the same luxury.
Unfortunately Marvel are still keeping it a closely guarded secret so it hasn't been put online anywhere yet - much to the annoyance of fans not in San Diego. But the reaction from the crowd suggests something close to Beatlemania.
It's likely we'll have to wait until November when Thor: Ragnarok is released before the rest of the world will see it.
