[SN]TITLE[SN]
Major disruption for Manchester Metrolink services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Services on Greater Manchester's Metrolink tram system are facing disruption this summer after major construction work began on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No tram services are running through St Peter's Square, while a bigger tram stop is built.
Major track renewal on the Eccles line also means no trams on the line to MediaCityUK until early August and to Eccles until the end of that month.
Replacement bus services are running on the affected routes.
The work in St Peters Square involves building two new platforms for the two new sets of track running through it.
Transport for Greater Manchester said the Eccles line, which opened in 2000, is showing signs of "wear".
