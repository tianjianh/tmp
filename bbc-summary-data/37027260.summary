Ex-Catholic priest admits seven charges of child sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former children's home worker and Catholic priest has pleaded guilty to a string of historical child sex abuse charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Temple, 66, admitted seven charges committed in the 1970s when he appeared at Woolwich Crown Court.
He pleaded to 20 similar charges and two of perjury at Croydon Crown Court in April.
In all, he admitted abusing 12 boys and one girl while working in south London care homes and a north London church.
He also admitted lying on oath in the 1990s when he was cleared of child sex abuse charges following accusations by a teenage boy from his church.
A spokesperson for the Catholic Church in England and Wales said that when concerns were raised it was limited in the measures it could take because as a monk he was answerable to the head of his order in Italy rather than the archdiocese here.
But the church said it believes he worked in Christ the King parish between 1999 and 2002 while the commission of inquiry was ongoing, meaning he would have had continued access to children.
The BBC has been told that in recent years Temple spent time at monasteries in Italy and France.
Raymond Stephenson of the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association said: "If Temple had been caught at Shirley Oaks he would not have been able to abuse anyone else."
The BBC is still awaiting comment from Lambeth Council which had responsibility for Shirley Oaks.
The BBC understands the Temple case will now be investigated by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, currently without a chair after the resignation of Dame Lowell Goddard.
