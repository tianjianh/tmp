She was attacked at the back of the local bowling club between 13:30 and 13:45 on 3 June.
A dedicated team of detectives is continuing to progress inquiries into the incident.
High-visibility police patrols have been carried out in South Queensferry in the past week after the attack.
During that time officers have spoken to a number of local residents, dog walkers and other members of the public to gather information and try to identify the suspect.
Police said they had been "encouraged by the level of response" but urged anyone with more information to come forward.
The attacker has been described as white, of high school age with hazel brown hair that was swept forward.
He was wearing dark bottoms, a blue round neck T-shirt with white lettering and had a temporary tattoo on one of his hands.
He also had a black and blue rucksack.
Det Insp Julie Marshall said: "It is now one week since a young girl was subjected to an indecent assault in a wooded area of South Queensferry and I would firstly like to thank the public for their incredible support and assistance with our inquiries.
"Several members of the local community have already come forward to provide information that continues to be progressed as part of our efforts to trace the suspect."
She urged people to contact them with any further information.
Ch Insp James Jones added: "We will continue to maintain a visible presence within the area to speak with local residents and gather any information that may be relevant to this investigation.
"I remain confident that someone within the community knows the suspect or can help us find him.
"If this is the case, then please contact police immediately."
