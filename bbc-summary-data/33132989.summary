A total of 18 people were on board when the Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh.
Solicitors Digby Brown said the claim against operator CHC was being raised due to the physical, emotional and financial losses.
CHC said it wanted to resolve claims as quickly as possible.
A hearing is due to call at the Court of Session in Edinburgh before the end of the month.
In a statement, CHC said it "deeply regrets the loss of life that occurred in the Sumburgh accident.
"As the second anniversary approaches, the AAIB investigation into the cause of the Sumburgh accident continues and its findings are still awaited. Based on the ultimate findings, the company is committed to taking appropriate actions to ensure its passengers and employees continue to fly safely."
The statement continued: "Throughout the period of investigation, there has been much work undertaken to provide financial assistance to the families impacted by the accident.
"For those that have brought claims, the process of assessing and quantifying them has been a difficult one for all involved, but considerable progress has been made and a large number of claims have already been resolved.
"Regrettably, a few claims remain unresolved as the insurer awaits the results of professional assessments, such as medical exams. Whilst this is disappointing, CHC and its insurers are keen to receive these assessments so the process can move forward and these few outstanding claims can be resolved."
Chris Gordon, a partner with Thompsons who is acting on behalf of three of the families, said "Although significant interim payments have already been secured to assist the families with their financial position, the claims are not yet settled and were raised by us in the Court of Session, Edinburgh, in March."
Helicopter passengers Sarah Darnley, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, from Winchester, lost their lives in the crash.
