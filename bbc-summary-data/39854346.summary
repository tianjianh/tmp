A three-bedroom house which has been "swallowed" by plants in south-east London has sold at auction for £554,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The end terrace property in Blackheath has been engulfed by ivy so only the front door and one window can be seen from the street.
A neighbour said the flora was planted "quite a few years ago" and the home had been empty for several months.
The estate agents had warned it requires "complete modernisation".
The property, which had a guide price of £450,000, includes a reception room, kitchen, bathroom, garage and a garden.
A neighbour who lives opposite the house said it had been swallowed by plant life "for a long time".
"It was a lovely little house... it is a wonder the neighbours didn't kick off about it though," she said.
But Alice Mennie, who also lives in the street, said she thought the greenery gave the house "character".
"It looks lovely. I'd love my house to look like that," she said.
