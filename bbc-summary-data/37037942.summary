Inspector Andy Storey said: "All motorists should avoid the area, use alternative routes and await further updates before attempting to travel on this route.
"We appreciate motorists' patience while we deal with this incident."
The fatal crash took place at 17.10 BST, and there are currently six-mile tailbacks on the northbound carriage.
The southbound carriageway was closed to allow the air ambulance to land, but has since reopened.
