Police said that a number of vehicles were trapped about five miles south of Fort William from about 10:10.
Engineers from Bear Scotland and the Forestry Commission have cleared that blockage but are working to clear other debris from the carriageway.
The road is expected to be closed overnight for assessment.
No-one was injured but vehicles were unable to get out of the area.
The A82 is closed between Fort William and Ballachulish, with diversions in place.
Insp Donald Campbell said: "Firstly, I would like to thank the members of the public who were stuck between the blockages for their good spirit and patience whilst we dealt with the incident.
"The road is expected to be closed overnight as engineers will be working to assess the area."
A spokesman for BEAR Scotland said "We are dealing with a variety of flooding related incidents across the north west area of Scotland.
"Our main concerns currently relate to the A82 between Fort William and Ballachulish where several flood events have caused the road to be blocked.
"These have included trees and debris washed from the forestry areas above the road. We are currently working with the Forestry Commision to remove approximately 30 large trees from the carriageway using specialist plant."
The Met Office issued an amber "be prepared" warning for the Highlands.
It said prolonged and heavy rain was forecast during Sunday and Monday.
It has also issued yellow "be aware" warnings for Strathclyde, Central, Tayside and Fife, where rain and gales are predicted with gusts of up to 70mph possible in exposed areas.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has put in place 11 flood warnings in the Highlands and Tayside, with further flood alerts throughout the country.
The Tay, Skye and Dornoch bridges have been affected by high winds while CalMac ferry services on the west coast have been disrupted or cancelled.
Transport Scotland is monitoring the situation with Sepa, local authorities and Police Scotland.
