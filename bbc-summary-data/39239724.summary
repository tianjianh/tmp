[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bright Osayi-Samuel's curling effort put the visitors ahead, and they had chances to extend their lead as Mark Cullen hit the bar and post.
Cullen scored with a penalty, before Alex Samuel bundled in to give Newport hope.
Osayi-Samuel broke to score a late third for Blackpool.
He scored after home keeper Joe Day had gone up for a corner.
Despite a first loss of caretaker manager Mike Flynn's reign, Newport stay second from bottom and seven points adrift of safety.
Newport County caretaker manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales: "I can't fault the boys' effort again. We gave away a poor first goal and I don't think it was a penalty.
"Their keeper made a great save at 2-1 that would have made it 2-2. I just think we needed to be on the move a little bit more in the box and anticipating more instead of reacting.
"We went for the equaliser an wanted to salvage something and they went and nicked the third."
