Ed Sheeran and Radiohead just found out who they'll be sharing a campsite with in June - after Glastonbury revealed 88 of the acts playing this year's event.

Pop star Katy Perry will make her debut at the festival, following a clutch of politically-charged performances at this year's Grammys and Brit Awards.
Grime will feature prominently, with Stormzy, Kano and Wiley all playing.
And Barry Gibb follows in the footsteps of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers by taking Sunday evening's "legend slot".
The Bee Gees star appeared at the festival last year, duetting with Chris Martin on Stayin' Alive and To Love Somebody during Coldplay's headline set.
Tickets for the festival, which takes place from 21 - 25 June in Somerset, have already sold out.
It will be the last Glastonbury until 2019, with the festival taking a fallow year to allow Worthy Farm's cows (and Glastonbury's villagers) some time off.
Among the acts announced today are:
Krautrock pioneers The Can Project - featuring original Can members Irmin Schmidt and Malcolm Mooney, alongside Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and other guests - have also been added to the line-up.
Organiser Emily Eavis said "even more" bands would be announced soon.
The headliners had already been announced, with Radiohead leading the charge on the Pyramid Stage on Friday, 23 June.
Foo Fighters take the Saturday night slot, making up for 2015 - when they were forced to cancel after Dave Grohl broke his leg falling off a stage in Sweden. Ed Sheeran will close the festival on Sunday, just six years after his first appearance, on the BBC Introducing stage, in 2011.
Prior to today, country legend Kris Kristofferson was the only other performer confirmed - although Laura Marling, Wiley and The Avalanches all let the cat out of the bag.
Organisers say "twice as many" bands will play the festival this year; alongside the usual complement of film, comedy and performance art.
The BBC will feature 120 acts across six stages exclusively live on the BBC Glastonbury website. And you can see live pictures from the farm 365 days of the year on the Glastonbury webcam.
