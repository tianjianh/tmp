The Met Office said over the four-hour period from midnight to 04:00 there was a "notable" amount of lightning.
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service reported strikes at eight properties, and a BT box on a telegraph pole was destroyed.
Cornwall's fire service reported "properties and businesses" had been struck.
The events were caught on camera by members of the public across the region.
The Met Office said it was most likely the storm began to form over northern Spain before moving north over to Devon and Cornwall.
A spokesperson said: "Yesterday's high temperatures in the region, coupled with the approach of a weather front made a good recipe for the stormy conditions."
They added the "high-based clouds" produced a "noteworthy amount of lightning" and intense localised rainfall.
Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said it began receiving calls "shortly after midnight" to properties which had been "struck by lightning, activating alarms and on some occasions causing small fires".
