[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 0-1 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln are top of the National League after a win ended Tranmere's 100% record at Prenton Park this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was a cagey affair, with top spot on the line for both sides after Forest Green's earlier defeat at Dover.
Tranmere goalkeeper Scott Davies had to be alert to keep Macauley Bonne's header out early on, while Luke Waterfall went close with a free-kick in the 25th minute, but the hosts also threatened through James Norwood.
Bonne, on loan at Lincoln from Colchester, got the crucial breakthrough in the 67th minute when he smashed into the roof of the net from Terry Hawkridge's cross.
Tranmere have now lost back-to-back games after starting the season with a seven-match unbeaten run.
