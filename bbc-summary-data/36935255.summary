Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino scored second-half goals in California on Saturday, but Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana missed chances.
Belgium international Origi had another ruled out after the break for the Reds, who lost 1-0 to Chelsea on Wednesday.
"I'm pleased with our performance - especially the first half," said Klopp.
"We passed and we passed and we passed until we were through. We created chances and we didn't score - of course we need to finish."
James Milner featured at left-back for Klopp's side at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, with new signing Sadio Mane also involved.
It was 21-year-old Origi who broke the deadlock in the 59th minute, showing good footwork before cutting inside and shooting into the far corner.
Brazilian Firmino doubled Liverpool's lead two minutes later, sliding in at the far post to tap in a deflected cross from substitute Sheyi Ojo.
Liverpool play Barcelona at Wembley on Saturday, before opening their Premier League campaign at Arsenal on 14 August.
