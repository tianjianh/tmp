The 26-year-old former York and Macclesfield man made 32 appearances for the Welsh side last term.
Moke won promotion out of non-league's top flight with York in 2012, but revealed that he later struggled with depression after Halifax decided not to offer him a new deal in 2013.
"He's a great talent and I like the way he plays," said Wood boss Luke Garrard.
"He's spent most of his life up north but with his mother now living in north London that has helped us enormously to secure his signature and I look forward to working with him."
