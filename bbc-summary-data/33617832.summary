Hampshire draw with Durham despite Chris Rushworth hat-trick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Rushworth became only the second Durham bowler to take a Championship hat-trick, but Hampshire hung on for a draw on a rain-interrupted final day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After taking two in two balls to end Hampshire's first innings, Rushworth had Michael Carberry caught behind with his opening delivery in their second.
Durham had declared 304 ahead on 190-4, with spinner Mason Crane taking 4-72.
And Crane was there at the end to see Hampshire to 179-9, surviving 5.2 overs with Lewis McManus (53 not out).
The result did neither side any favours with the home side 18 points adrift at the foot of the Division One table, and although Durham moved up one place to third with their first draw of the season, they are 38 points behind leaders Yorkshire, who also have a game in hand.
Resuming on 61-1, the north-east county's initial task was to put enough runs on the board quickly to allow their bowlers time to win the match.
Mark Stoneman (88) and Scott Borthwick (39) added 71 before both fell to the promising Crane and Paul Collingwood weighed in with an unbeaten 29 off 22 balls before he decided it was time to call a halt.
Following the shock of losing Carberry, Hampshire slumped to 39-5, with James Vince and Will Smith also departing for ducks.
Joe Gatting made 32 before he was leg-before to off-spinner Ryan Pringle (5-63), but Gareth Berg (36) and McManus put on 53 for the seventh wicket.
Hampshire were 142-7 with 24 overs remaining when a rain shower took nine overs out of the game and although Pringle had Jackson Bird lbw at the resumption for his first five-wicket haul in county cricket, Durham could not separate Hampshire's youthful last-wicket pair.
Three additional overs were bowled as Durham had completed the scheduled number before 18:00 BST, and after Collingwood dropped Crane at slip, 20-year-old McManus hit the final ball for four to reach his maiden fifty and secure a dramatic draw.
Durham captain Paul Collingwood:
"We played some really good cricket this week and I was disappointed not to get that last wicket.
"We've lost about 30 overs in the match, which is pretty crucial.
"We can take a lot out of this match, we've done really well, but it's a shame not to have won the game."
Hampshire wicket-keeper Lewis McManus:
"It got a bit tight at the end. We lost a few wickets which put the game back into their hands slightly but I had faith in Mason and myself at the end.
"We have a big four games coming up and if we do the basics well then we are pretty confident."
