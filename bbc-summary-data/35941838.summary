£2m road and safety upgrades in Pembrokeshire agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Road improvement projects have been given the green light in Pembrokeshire after £2m in funding was secured.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Local schools are also set to benefit from new 20mph speed limits with safer walking and cycling routes.
Pembrokeshire council said it was committed to improving links and safety.
A total of £780,000 is being spent on Glasfryn Road, St Davids, regarded as a sub-standard link between the Haverfordwest and Fishguard A487 roads.
The improvements involve widening the road and installing a roundabout at its southern end.
In Fishguard, money is being spent to prepare for a new link road between High Street and West Street, while junction improvements are being made to the A478 Narberth Road in Tenby.
Milford Haven Secondary School will have improved walking and cycling routes and pedestrian crossings.
Meanwhile 20mph speed limits are being introduced at Ysgol Bro Dewi, St Davids, Fenton CP School, Haverfordwest, Wiston Primary School and Coastlands Primary School, St Ishmaels.
The projects have been funded by the Welsh Government's Local Transport Fund, Road Safety Grant and Safe Routes in Communities.
