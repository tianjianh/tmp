Lisandro Ezequiel Lopez: Swansea City target Benfica defender for loan deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City are interested in signing Benfica and Argentina defender Lisandro Ezequiel Lopez to bolster their Premier League survival chances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lopez, 27, is wanted on loan by Swans boss Paul Clement, who has prioritised the recruitment of a central defender.
There is also a possibility that Wales international left-back Neil Taylor could leave Swansea before Tuesday evening's transfer window deadline.
Taylor, also 27, is a reported target for Championship club Aston Villa.
Lopez has struggled to secure a place in Benfica's side this season, having made only five league appearances, but could bolster a Swans defence which has conceded 51 Premier League goals this this term - the worst record in the top flight.
Meanwhile it is believed Villa have inquired about Taylor, who has competed for the left-back berth with Scottish youngster Stephen Kingsley for most of the season. but is currently sidelined with a cheek injury.
Competition for that place has increased as Clement recently signed Norwich left-back Martin Olsson for a fee of around Â£4m, and the Sweden international made his debut in the Swans' stunning 3-2 win at Liverpool in their last Premier League game.
St Asaph-born Taylor is a Wales regular and scored against Russia as Chris Coleman's squad reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals.
He joined Swansea in 2010 from Wrexham, who would receive a sell-on fee for Taylor under the terms of that deal.
Swansea City host Southampton in the Premier League on Tuesday with the January transfer deadline window closing for top-flight and Football League clubs at 23:00 GMT.
