Ms Rollins took gold while teammates Nia Ali clinched silver and Kristi Castlin captured bronze in the event.
The clean sweep was the first by any country in the 100m hurdles and the first by US women in any Olympic event.
Ms Rollins, 25, finished with 12.48 seconds while the two other medals came down to hundredths of seconds.
"I tried to feed off all the positive energy from Team USA," Ms Rollins said. "I'm just happy to share the moment with Kristi and Nia."
The Florida native celebrated her 25th birthday just hours after the win.
The US women's team have historically been the strongest in the world in short hurdles, but have fallen short of victory in recent years.
Last year, six of the 10 fastest run times in the world belonged to Americans, but the team failed to medal at the world championships.
Ms Ali, who was away from the track for more than a year to care for her 15-month-old son, Titus Tinsley, finished with 12.59 seconds.
"He won't remember this but he will see photos and see that you can do anything you put your mind to," the 27-year-old said while holding her son, who watched from the stands.
Ms Castlin, 28, leaned in at the finish to best Great Britain's Cindy Ofili, finishing just .02 seconds ahead of her at 12.61 for the bronze.
"We're from all different states and universities. It feels good to come out and do a great job," she said.
The US women's victory comes a day after the US men failed to medal in the 110m hurdles for the first time in a non-boycotted Olympics.
