Women further ahead in university places

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of women gaining places at university is rising twice as quickly as that for men, the latest figures show.

The admissions service, Ucas, has released data five days after A-level results, showing more than 463,000 places have been confirmed.
This is a 3% increase on the same point last year - with a 4% increase among women and 2% increase among men.
So far this year, 57,000 more women than men have gained university places.
These updated figures show the level of university admissions, including almost 35,000 students allocated places through the clearing process, up 6% on the same point last year.
In addition to those who have accepted places, a further 63,000 are holding offers. There are another 144,000 applicants who have still to get a place.
The trend is heading towards a record number of students beginning full-time undergraduate courses this autumn.
The admissions figures also show the gender gap will be wider than ever.
Among UK 18-year-olds, 25.1% of men and 34% of women have taken university places.
Compared with this point four years ago, there are almost 6,000 more male students taking up places. But among female students, the number has risen by more than 13,000.
Within the current total of more than 463,000 accepted places, less than a quarter will be for 18-year-old UK men.
As well as 18-year-old women, the remainder of places will be filled by those going after gap years, mature students and international students.
Within the UK, Northern Ireland has the highest levels of 18-year-olds going to university - and women in Northern Ireland are the group most likely to get a place.
Among that age group, 36.9% of women in Northern Ireland have gained university places. This compares with 22% of 18-year-old men in Wales who have so far been accepted.
