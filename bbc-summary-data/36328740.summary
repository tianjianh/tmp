[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens full-back Alex Goode won the Premiership player of the season after four tries in 15 games helped his side to the top of the table.

The 28-year-old beat team-mate Maro Itoje, Wasps' Charles Piutau and George Smith and Exeter duo Gareth Steenson and Don Armand to the award.
Saracens' Mark McCall was named director of rugby of the year, while Itoje completed a treble for the club as the best under-23 player.
Saracens play Leicester on Saturday.
Should they win that play-off semi-final, the London side will be within one match of defending their Premiership title and becoming the first side since Wasps in 2004 to complete a European-domestic double.
