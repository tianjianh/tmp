Middlesbrough's strikers are making a positive contribution to their Premier League promotion bid despite a recent lack of goals, says boss Aitor Karanka.

Scotland striker Jordan Rhodes has not scored in his last three games, while fellow forward David Nugent is without a goal in four.
Their mini-droughts have had little effect on results, with the Teesiders recording five successive victories.
"They're doing amazing work for the team," Karanka told BBC Tees.
"We are in this position because we don't depend on just one striker, one defender or the keeper."
Goals have been shared throughout the team throughout the season, with no single player having so far reached double figures.
Wingers Albert Adomah, Adam Forshaw and Gaston Ramirez have scored in recent games, as have skipper Grant Leadbitter plus defenders Emilio Nsue and Ben Gibson.
And Karanka says there is a confidence throughout the side that they all have the ability to score.
"When the keeper is not good, the defenders are not good, the midfielders are not good, the strikers not good, the team is always behind each other," the 42-year-old added.
"We are creating chances every single game so with the players that we have, I think we are going to score most of the time."
