Artists playing include ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker, Roxy Music's Phil Manzanera, Joss Stone and Nitin Sawhney, who will be musical director.
It will take place at London's Roundhouse on 24 October - the first anniversary of his death.
Proceeds will go to East Anglia's Children's Hospices (Each).
Mr Bruce, who lived near Sudbury in Suffolk and was 71 when he died, had regularly raised money for the charity's three hospices in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.
Aruba Red, Mr Bruce's daughter, said: "We wanted a special night celebrating his life and knew the money raised should go to Each because it's what my dad would have wanted.
"When I was looking after my father with my sister and mum for the last days of his life, I realised how terribly hard it is supporting people towards the end, and it broke my heart to think of the families caring for little children with terminal illnesses."
Margrit Bruce, Jack's widow, said: "It's really great all these musicians are supporting us and we will be adding more to the bill."
Sawhney said: "Jack Bruce was one of my biggest heroes when I was growing up - a consummate musician, composer and all round rock genius with a killer voice and one of the most creative and versatile musical minds of his generation."
Other artists committed to appearing include Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson and Level 42's Mark King.
