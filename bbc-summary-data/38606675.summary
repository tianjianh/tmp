The snow, a shooting in west Belfast and sinister threats against DUP leader Arlene Foster are among the headlines in Friday's newspapers.

The Irish News front page has a photograph of the scene following the gun attack at a house in Norglen Parade in the Turf Lodge area on Thursday evening.
The Belfast Telegraph says the couple are in a stable condition in hospital after two men forced their way into the property and shot them in the legs.
Its main story is a report that the PSNI have launched an investigation after Arlene Foster said she had received several threats against her life on social media.
Mrs Foster said the threats included one that "wanted to see me beheaded".
In The Irish News, Sinn Fein dismisses as "too little, too late" Communities Minister Paul Givan's revelation that an Irish language bursary scheme could have its funding restored.
Mr Givan said he made the U-turn on the Líofa Gaeltacht Bursary Scheme to prevent Sinn Féin from using it as a "political weapon".
The newspaper also reports on the protest outside the headquarters of the Department for Communities demanding an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland.
The News Letter has its own take on the subject, with a Fermanagh Church of Ireland cleric, Rev Alan Irwin, claiming Irish speakers he knows in the Republic of Ireland cannot understand Sinn Féin members when they use the language.  However, Linda Ervine believes "gaelic is a language of the British Isles that unites us".
Its front page focuses on a fraudster from Toome in County Antrim who has been jailed for a year for selling fake fire safety glass that was later installed at schools, universities and hospitals.
Seamus James Laverty, 58, sold ordinary glass as fire safety glass between 2010 and 2013 when he worked on the factory floor of Glassworks Ireland.
A judge said it was "by the grace of God" that the fake glass had not been put to the test.
The Daily Mirror's front page reports on a five-year-old boy being taken to hospital after he was knocked down by a car in the County Down village of Magheralin on Thursday.
The boy is said to be in a "critical but stable" condition. Meanwhile, a nine-year-old-boy is said to be in intensive care in hospital after he was hit by a car near Ballymoney, County Antrim, on Tuesday.
There are plenty of pictures of snow in the newspapers and on a warmer note, the Mirror also carries the story of the diner who surprised staff at an Indian restaurant in Portadown by leaving a £1,000 tip on a £79 bill.
