Political satire pokes fun at India's 'bizarre democracy'

At a nightclub in Gurgaon, an upscale suburb of the Indian capital Delhi, about 100 people are watching the popular political satire show, Aisi Taisi Democracy, which translates from the Hindi as Democracy Be Damned.

"Swachh Bharat is an oxymoron," says stand-up comedian Sanjay Rajoura, referring to PM Narendra Modi's Clean India campaign. "Just like good Taliban. Just like intelligent Rahul Gandhi. Just like happy marriage."
The audience applauds with loud cheers and clapping.
Besides Rajoura, Aisi Taisi Democracy comprises writer-lyricist Varun Grover and singer-musician Rahul Ram.
The men say their 90-minute show - a mix of stand-up comedy, storytelling and songs parodying popular Bollywood numbers - reflects the "bizarre experience" of Indian life and offers a "nuanced critique" of its democracy.
The group, which debuted last year, has just kicked off its second season with a show in Gurgaon and performances planned for Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) and Delhi over the next month.
There are no holy cows for the performers - they make fun of the recent ban on porn sites, health food fads and fashionable diets, the craze for selfies and Mr Modi's controversial monogrammed suit.
"We are a bizarre country with a million prejudices - a country that would be really sad if it was not this funny," says Grover, adding that their intent is to "expose our darkest secrets as a nation" through irreverent political humour and songs.
"We do lots of political content in this atmosphere where people are always ready to take offence, so it's really encouraging to see people applaud," he adds.
"It's a very political show," says Ram. "We get inspired by events taking place around us all the time in this amazing democracy."
As he breaks into song on what is sometimes described as the schizophrenic India-Pakistan relationship, many in the audience join in, clapping and singing.
"They say the enemy lives across the border, but when I look closely, he looks just like me," the lyrics say.
Political satire has been growing more popular in recent years, with UnRealTimes, FakingNews and spoofs on elections trying to tickle India's funny bones. However, most stand-up comedy shows stick to poking fun at regional differences, accents, marital issues and families.
"Comedy that relies on ethnic differences is limited and limiting. It's true that politics is a minefield but it's a never-ending source of inspiration. So I don't think we would ever run out of inspiration," says Ram.
Grover says the group comments on people's choices, "rather than what they are born with, like their caste, colour or religion".
"We talk about the choices they have been making and these choices make them vulnerable to comedy."
