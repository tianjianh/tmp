[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Corne got the hosts up and running with a piercing strike into the top corner midway through the first half, but it proved a false dawn.
Delano Sam-Yorke replied within two minutes, converting from close range after Kane Ferdinand's effort was parried by Ben McNamara.
The striker's second bordered on the sublime. He beat two Braintree defenders and found the top corner with aplomb.
In the second half, Garry Hill's visitors sealed it when Gozie Ugwu squared for Keiran Murtagh to side-foot in and give his side an unassailable two-goal lead.
