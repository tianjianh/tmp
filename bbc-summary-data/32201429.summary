Ms Wood told BBC Breakfast she spoke fairly regularly to the Scottish first minister adding: "We're in touch via messaging as well, online."
The pair had not discussed potential future prime ministers, she said.
"It's not about personalities. It's about politics and policies," Ms Wood told the programme.
If the smaller parties hold the balance of power, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens would work to "present the alternative to austerity regardless as to who are the key people involved".
