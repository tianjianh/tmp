Chelsea wing-back Victor Moses has praised manager Antonio Conte for resurrecting his career and giving him the "confidence to enjoy his football".

Moses, 26, joined the Blues from Wigan for Â£9m in 2012 but was sent out on loan to Liverpool, Stoke and West Ham by former boss Jose Mourinho.
But he played 34 times this term as Chelsea claimed the Premier League title with a record 30 wins.
"I am more focused now than ever. I am enjoying my football again," he said.
The Nigeria international played 43 games in his first season with the Blues, scoring 10 goals, and was part of the 2013 Europa League-winning squad under interim manager Rafael Benitez.
But he failed to play under Mourinho in the Portuguese manager's second spell at Stamford Bridge, being given temporary moves to three top-flight clubs.
This season, the forward was handed a new defensive role as he rejuvenated his Chelsea career and played an integral role in Italian boss Conte's first season in charge.

"We have got a new manager here who is willing to give everyone an opportunity," said Moses. "He gave me that opportunity and I didn't look back after that.
"I am very pleased with that and I just want to keep improving in every game I play. It is a new role for me and I am still getting used to it."
Moses could add an FA Cup winners' medal on Saturday when Chelsea take on London rivals Arsenal in the final at Wembley.
He added: "That would be a great achievement for me. We don't feel any pressure, we are just taking this game as it comes.
"We have got the league title and they are going to want to win because they missed out on top four. We are going to try and stop them because we want the Double."
