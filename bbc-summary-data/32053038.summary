[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kathy Shannon, 29, from Mount Eden, Limavady, County Londonderry, admitted the offences.
Police were called to a report of a woman assaulting door staff at a pub on 3 April 2014.
When they arrived they saw Shannon struggling with the door staff.
When police approached she lunged at a police officer and then stubbed a lit cigarette on an officer's collar.
She was arrested but while she was in the police vehicle officers were called to another incident and Shannon then climbed out and ran down the street.
She continued to spit and kicked one officer.
CCTV showed Shannon struggling with door staff and in the course of the police investigation they were approached by another woman who said she had her hair pulled inside the bar.
The CCTV also showed Shannon breaking a pub window.
Defence counsel Ms Nicola Rountree said her client had "a chaotic life and a history of anti-social lifestyle".
She said before this incident Shannon had not taken alcohol for six months and then took "a significant amount".
The barrister said that Shannon would admit she was "an embarrassment with alcohol".
