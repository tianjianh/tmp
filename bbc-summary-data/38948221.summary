Pictures of the incident, in Aberystwyth last August, were published before Saturday's Wales v England match by the Sun newspaper.
They appear to show Mr Davies holding a shoe and chasing a man during the late-night incident.
The player apologised, saying he "reacted wrongly to the situation".
Dyfed-Powys Police said no further action was taken at the time due to insufficient evidence, but "as a result of new video evidence" the force was reviewing the incident.
Mr Davies is said to have reacted after a woman was allegedly pushed to the floor
A woman is heard in the footage saying: "Gareth please, you will lose your job for this."
He apologised after Wales' 16-21 Six Nations defeat at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, the Sunday Times website reported.
"I reacted wrongly to the situation and have learnt from it and understand that I have a responsibility to the game at all times," he said.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said the matter had been dealt with internally.
A spokesman said: "As with all players, Gareth has been reminded of his responsibility as an international rugby player."
