New South Wales state police are investigating alleged match-fixing in Australia's National Rugby League.

Players and officials are among dozens of people expected to be interviewed in the coming months.
The NRL said it would support the probe and a "life ban from any involvement in rugby league" would be handed to anyone convicted of match-fixing.
Two matches from the 2015 NRL season are already being investigated, both involving Manly.
In August, media reported a seventh-round match this season between Manly and Parramatta was being investigated for suspicious betting activity.
Parramatta scored three tries in the final 12 minutes to win 22-10.
In 2011, Ryan Tandy was banned for life after being convicted of match-fixing while playing for Canterbury Bulldogs against North Queensland in 2010.
Tandy lost an appeal in 2014 and died in the same year, aged 32.
