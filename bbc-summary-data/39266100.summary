Londoner Okolie, 24, was the first member of Great Britain's 2016 Olympic boxing squad to turn professional.
Henshaw is from east Midlands and has seven wins from 10 fights.
"I want to dominate the division. I'm not afraid to let the other cruiserweights know that I'm here and I am coming for them," said Okolie.
The pair will fight on the undercard of Anthony Crolla's rematch with WBA lightweight world champion Jorge Linares and will take place at Manchester Arena.
