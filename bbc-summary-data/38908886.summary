The 34-year-old Argentine has compressed nerves in his back and needs to see a specialist.
Interim head coach Aaron Mauger said: "It's precautionary trying to make sure we don't aggravate it and will probably be 10-12 weeks to get him back."
Meanwhile, centre Matt Toomua could return before the end of the season following his knee injury.
Mauger said the 34 year-old had "progressed very well".
"Matt is a couple of weeks ahead of where we thought he would be," Toomua added. "Hopefully he will play some rugby in April."
