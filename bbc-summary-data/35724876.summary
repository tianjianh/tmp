Warrington half-back Chris Sandow put in a "world-class" kicking performance after his late drop-goal beat Salford, says Wolves head coach Tony Smith.

The Australian half-back, 27, secured the win with the last kick of the game at the AJ Bell Stadium to win 31-30.
It completed a remarkable comeback from Wire after trailing 30-12 at half-time to the Red Devils.
"That was probably as convincing a kicking game I've seen since Sean Long was in his pomp," Smith said.
"It was not just his field goal but some of his tactical kicks in the second half were world class.
"To come up with a field goal like that, you've got to pinch yourself sometimes. It was a phenomenal kick in those conditions and under that pressure."
Warrington have won all four of their Super League games so far this season and sit top of the table.
But Smith also confirmed that centre Gary Wheeler was taken off with a suspected Achilles injury that could keep him out for five months.
"I've got to say I'm very, very proud of my boys to dig their way out of an uncomfortable hole," Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside about his side's performance.
"We talked about it at half-time and we felt if we just dug ourselves in for that first 20 minutes of the second half we might come home with some points.
"It wasn't a plan to do it that way but we just felt that we could come home strong as long as we could stop leaking soft tries."
