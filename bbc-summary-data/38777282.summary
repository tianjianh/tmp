The Ogston Music School at St Edward's School includes a 120-capacity hall that will showcase touring musicians and community performances.
The development has 20 practice rooms, seven ensemble rooms, a recording studio and a music library.
Warden Stephen Jones said it had the potential to strongly impact the area.
He added: "With The North Wall Arts Centre just across the road from the new Ogston Music School, we have in South Parade the makings of North Oxford's own cultural quarter."
More than 450 lessons are expected to take place at the new facility each week.
It takes the place of the Ferguson Music School, which opened in 1962.
Alex Tester, director of music, said: "Music at St Edward's has always been at a high level, but the new Ogston Music School gives us the chance to scale even greater heights.
"We now have a real opportunity to gain a national reputation for music."
Upper sixth pupil and cellist Aaron Gruen said having the "fantastic, large new recital room is such a plus".
"The spacious practice rooms also add to the experience because, as a musician, you need space to think and you need the sound you produce to really resonate," he added.
St Edward's School was founded in 1863 and has about 700 pupils.
The school's musical alumni includes indie band Glass Animals.
