More than 80% of staff at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust "feel frustrated" about the job they do, according to a new survey.

Two thousand members of staff completed the "pulse check" survey as part of the trust's strategy to engage staff.
In February the trust ranked in the lowest 20% in England in a national NHS staff survey.
The trust emailed the latest figures to staff, stating that "it is time for a change".
In an email to staff the trust gave a "preview of the three worst scores" from the survey, which included more than 80% of staff felt "disconnected from the decisions being made" at the hospital.
Earlier NHS campaigners including staff demonstrated outside the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro about expected announcements over privatisation of services.
Speaking last month the trust's chief executive, Bill Shields, said: "I don't think we've listened enough; I think we've done far too much of telling the organisation what we think they need to know.
"What we now need to do is listen to staff concerns. We probably need to look at the decisions we made in the past and if they're not good decisions, then look at if we can change them."
The trust declared a "black alert" twice this year due to "extreme" pressure on its services, and the BBC revealed that sick pay costs for cleaners at three Cornwall hospitals had reached more than Â£1m since the private firm Mitie took over.
Lynn Batson, senior officer for the Royal College of Nursing in Cornwall, said: "I think it is disappointing and these results are serious, but we are pleased that the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust are taking it seriously.
"I do believe there is a genuine want from senior management to try and improve the situation there."
