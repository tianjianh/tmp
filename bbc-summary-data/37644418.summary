The world number two won 6-1 6-3 in one hour 17 minutes to set up a last-eight tie with either Gael Monfils of France or Belgium's David Goffin.
Murray played aggressively, though he will want to improve on a 46% first-serve percentage.
"I was able to dictate a lot of points. It was a good match," said Murray.
The world number two began superbly, breaking his 22-year-old opponent in the second and fourth games, and concluded an impressive first set in 39 minutes with the Frenchman making 13 unforced errors.
"Those first two games were important," said the Scot.
"They were 17 minutes long - he had a chance in the first game, and in the second game I had a few break points before I got it.
"Once I got ahead I did feel like I played a good match. I felt I was able to dictate a lot of the points."
Thirteenth seed Pouille was broken immediately at the start of the second set and although he managed to hold his serve three times thereafter, he was unable to stop Murray from breaking again to seal victory.
Murray admitted he did not serve at his best, but still won 95% of points on his first serve.
"The second serve has improved a lot this year and that allows me to go for more on the first serves," said the 29-year-old Wimbledon champion.
World number one Novak Djokovic also progressed, but had to work for his 6-4 6-4 win over Canada's Vasek Pospisil.
The top seed will next play Germany's Mischa Zverev, who beat Spain's Marcel Granollers 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-1.
French ninth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga saw off Alexander Zverev of Germany 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 7-5 and will play Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the last eight.
