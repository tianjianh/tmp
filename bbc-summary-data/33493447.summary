It took place at the Irish National War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge.
Dublin Lord Mayor Críona Ní Dhálaigh laid a laurel wreath in tribute to the dead of Word War One and World War Two.
Her Sinn Féin colleagues, Lord Mayor of Belfast Arder Carson and Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly Mitchel McLaughlin, also attended the ceremony.
The annual commemoration at Islandbridge, in the Dublin suburb of Kilmainham, is hosted by the Royal British Legion Republic of Ireland.
Ms Ní Dhálaigh, who was elected to the new post last month, accepted an invitation to lay a wreath on behalf of the people of Dublin.
Speaking after the commemoration, she said: "Today, we remember the many thousands of Irish people who died during these conflicts, including those from this city.
"Sinn Féin has engaged with the Royal British Legion for many years now and as first citizen of the city of Dublin, I am here representing the whole city.
"One of my key priorities as mayor was to incorporate the principle of inclusivity and my attendance here today, along with my Sinn Féin colleagues, speaks to this ideal."
