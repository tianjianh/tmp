The duo were the only entrants to the competition after rivals Matty Lee and James Denny pulled out following a power-cut at the venue in Southend.
Daley, 21, competed alongside now-retired Pete Waterfield at London 2012.
"We'll try and qualify for the Olympics and then, anything can happen," said Daley.
He and Goodfellow, 19, will reach the 2016 Games if they can place in the top-four of nations who have not already qualified at the Rio World Cup next month.
Tonia Couch claimed her third individual 10m National Cup title with a narrow victory over fellow Olympian Sarah Barrow as defending champion and European Games gold medallist Lois Toulson came third.
Couch finished second in the synchronised 10m event alongside Toulson on Friday, with her regular partner Barrow dropped from the line-up following a series of shin injuries.
Despite her lack of training, Barrow performed five strong routines and hopes her performances will be enough to restore her to the synchronised line-up for the World Cup.
"I did feel like I had something to prove and hopefully I've done that," she said.
2015 World Championship bronze medallist Daley last competed in a synchronised 10m platform competition at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, where he finished second alongside James Denny.
Daley originally stated he would only compete in the synchronised event again if there was a chance of winning an Olympic medal.
"There are lots of reasons to compete in it again and if we make it to the Olympics there's only eight teams and three will come away with a medal," he said.
Goodfellow, who trains at Daley's old pool in Plymouth, has missed much of the last two seasons with an elbow injury.
"I have been thrown in at the deep end competing with Tom, but I've learnt two new dives and it's certainly helping me improve," he told BBC Sport.
"The power-cut just before the competition was a bit weird, but it was my first event back after injury and I know we can both be better in the future."
English Commonwealth champions Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg comfortably won the women's synchronised 3m title.
They will attempt to qualify GB a berth for the event in Rio next month, while Blagg will also target an individual place with Gallantree having secured one through the 2015 World Championships.
