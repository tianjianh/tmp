[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guiseley looked to have secured a draw when Jake Lawler scored in the 84th minute.
But Rutherford's driving run and right-foot finish dashed their hopes.
Earlier Wrexham had responded to Michael Rankine's 11th-minute free-kick with a penalty by John Rooney and sub Gerry McDonagh's headed goal.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills said: "I'm so pleased for Ruthers, not just his goal but his workrate up and down that touchline all game. Absolutely magnificent.
"If I wanted anybody to get the winner it was Ruthers and to go and score it as good as that - what a goal!"
