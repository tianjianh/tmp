[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning permission is being sought for a leisure scheme at a Gwynedd business park that has been empty for more than 10 years, Economy Secretary Ken Skates has said.

Developer Liberty Properties blamed Brexit for "very frustrating" delays.
It said it remained committed to building a "high-quality family leisure park" at Bangor's Parc Bryn Cegin.
Gwynedd council said it had received contact from a developer regarding the site.
Arfon MP Hywel Williams called for assurances progress was being made.
In 2005, the 90-acre Parc Bryn Cegin received £3.5m of European funding and investment from the former Welsh Development Agency (WDA) of £4.9m.
At the time, officials said the park would attract up to 1,600 jobs, £18m of additional investment and provide more than 70,000 sq metres of floor space for businesses.
The Welsh Government claimed the park would create a more "prosperous local economy", but it has been empty ever since.
In December 2015, Liberty Properties announced proposals to develop a cinema complex, restaurant and tourism hub on the site, with the creation of up to 400 jobs.
It said staff were now in detailed negotiations with a national cinema operator.
Liberty development director Emyr Williams said: "We recognise that there has been delay in delivering this scheme.
"However, occupiers were reluctant to invest in capital projects during the Brexit referendum campaign and, unfortunately, there was a delay after the result as businesses reviewed their expansion programme and capital projects, following the result.
"This has been outside our control and very frustrating.
"Please be assured we are doing everything we can to bring this significant inward investment forward."
Mr Williams and Sian Gwenllian AM said more needed to be done to attract investment to the 67 acres (27 hectares) that would remain following the leisure development.
Mr Williams said: "It's almost a year since we read with enthusiasm that a leisure developer was interested in transforming part of the empty Parc Bryn Cegin business park into a cinema and restaurant complex after a hard fought local campaign to bring much-needed investment to the site.
"With no firm proposals submitted and ambiguous answers from the Welsh Government, local people want assurances that progress is being made."
Mr Skates said: "We have entered into agreement with Liberty Properties over the delivery of a leisure scheme at Bryn Cegin and they are currently in the process of seeking planning permission and negotiating with potential tenants."
Mr Skates said he expected the development to act as a "catalyst for other projects", and the serviced and developed units were "ideally placed" to capitalise on demand created by the construction of Anglesey's planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station.
A new agent for the business park should be in place by January, he added.
A Gwynedd council spokesman said contact had been made by a developer regarding Bryn Cegin, but no planning application had been submitted.
He added: "Due to the likely scale of a proposed development at Bryn Cegin, it is expected that any planning application will follow a submission for formal pre-application advice in accordance with new statutory planning requirements."
