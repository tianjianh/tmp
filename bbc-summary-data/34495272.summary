Renovation work at Concordia Leisure Centre in Cramlington includes the modernisation of the gym, new soft play facilities and a bowling alley.
The project, funded by Northumberland County Council and Active Northumberland, is part of plans to improve leisure facilities in the town.
Councillor Kathy Graham said it was an "important investment" for the town's residents and visitors.
The plans also include the development of a new spinning and fitness studio, a revamped cafe and the relocation of Cramlington Library into the town centre.
Work is expected to be completed by June 2016.
