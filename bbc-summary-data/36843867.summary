The 28-year-old replaces Colin Doyle, who joined Bradford for just Â£1 on 12 July after they met a release clause.
Ex-Scunthorpe keeper Slocombe has the option of a second year with the League Two club in his contract.
"He's been promoted with Scunthorpe United and Oxford United and is another strong addition to the squad," said Blackpool boss Gary Bowyer.
Slocombe added: "The project that the gaffer is putting together here seems quite appealing and we have a really good opportunity this season to give it a right good go."
