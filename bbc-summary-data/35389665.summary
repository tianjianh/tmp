On-loan striker Holman opened his account on his home debut with a fine half-volley before doubling his tally with a 12-yard finish.
Danny Wright then matched Holman's feat, heading home from James Rowe's corner before striking from six yards for a second-half double of his own.
Alex Wall snatched a consolation goal but the Robins secured their seventh win in eight in the National League.
Cheltenham remain second in the table, one point behind Forest Green Rovers, while Bromley slip to 14th having won just once in their last 11 games.
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"It's the best we've played for a little while. We've still been getting the results, but I enjoyed the way we played today - we created lots of chances.
"I was really pleased with our performance and hopefully our supporters can go home nice and happy.
"Our passing had a bit of an end product to it without going long. All in all the boys have put it together."
