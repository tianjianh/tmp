UKIP 'fails dismally' in Tandridge election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has "failed dismally" in the local election in Tandridge, according to the Lib Dems on the district council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Keymer, Conservative leader of the council, said UKIP had failed to make an impact.
The Conservatives comfortably held on to power in most of the councils to hold elections.
As well as Tandridge, the party also held Elmbridge, Runnymede, Reigate and Banstead and Woking, but Mole Valley stayed under no overall control.
Kelvin MacKenzie, the former editor of The Sun, narrowly failed to win a seat on Elmbridge Borough Council, where he stood as an independent in the St George's Hill ward in Weybridge.
UKIP did win a seat on Reigate and Banstead council and another in Mole Valley.
Helena Windsor, a UKIP councillor on the county council, said her party was making "serious progress".
She said UKIP had come second in 10 out of 14 seats in Tandridge.
"We were very close in Godstone," she said.
Simon Charles Morrow, a Lib Dem councillor who kept his seat, said: "We haven't lost any seats. My majority went up from 74 to 222.
"UKIP have dismally failed."
Runnymede was held by the Conservatives, who have 35 of the 42 seats on the council.
The Conservatives held Reigate and Banstead, with 37 seats. The Residents Association followed, with seven seats.
UKIP won the Horley Central seat from the Tories, the party's first gain in the county.
The Conservatives gained two seats to win 19 in Mole Valley, and the Liberal Democrats lost three seats, ending with 14. But that was not enough to give the Tories overall control.
UKIP won a first seat on the authority.
Woking also stayed under Conservative control.
The Tories gained two seats to win 23, and the Lib Dems lost three seats, ending with 11 councillors.
Labour won its first seat in years, and an independent candidate won one seat.
The South East region has also voted for 10 MEPs in the European election, with the results being announced late on Sunday.
