[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shivnarine Chanderpaul hit a ton to help Lancashire fight back in the Roses match with Yorkshire at Old Trafford.

The Tykes began the day 421-7, and Jack Brooks soon scored the six singles he needed to complete his maiden first-class ton before ending unbeaten on 109 as Yorkshire declared at 448-8.
Ryan Sidebottom (2-41) then struck twice as Lancashire slipped to 68-4.
But Chanderpaul (106) and Ryan McLaren (63 not out) helped Lancashire reach 264-6 at stumps, 184 runs behind.
However, the dismissal of Chanderpaul by Ben Coad with fewer than five overs left in the day will reignite Yorkshire's hopes of forcing victory if they can clean up the tail on the fourth morning.
It is also not yet certain whether James Anderson will bat, the 34-year-old England fast bowler having had to leave the field of play on day one with a tight groin.
Chanderpaul's knock, the 75th first-class century of his career and his fourth for Lancashire, came off 199 balls, including 11 fours and one six.
He and McLaren shared 112 for the sixth wicket as the Red Rose endeavoured to frustrate the visiting bowlers.
Earlier in the day, 32-year-old seamer Brooks reached three figures for the first time in his career, having passed his previous best score of 53 the previous day.
Lancashire's Shiv Chanderpaul told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was hard work out there. We lost some early wickets and someone had to dig in and lay the foundation. Ryan batted really well, as did Dane Vilas.
"Hopefully Ryan can push on and get us beyond the 300-mark and put some more bonus points on the board for us. If we get to 300, we are in a good position to not have to bat again in this match.
"I couldn't believe that I missed that ball and got out. I was really looking forward to batting on tomorrow. I was looking at the scoreboard to see how many overs were left and trying to see out the evening. But that's the way cricket goes."
Yorkshire's Jack Brooks told BBC Radio Leeds:
"It's surreal. It hasn't really sunk in. I never expected to get a hundred in my career, although I did say to the lads the other day that I've got one in me, but that was more in jest than anything.
"I didn't need Jack Leaning getting out straightaway. Ben Coad is the most nervous man in the world and was panicking more than anyone.
"We need to go bang, bang, bang, bang in the morning before they get to the follow-on. We've got a new ball in our hands, the bowlers will be fresher in the morning and we've opened up an end."
