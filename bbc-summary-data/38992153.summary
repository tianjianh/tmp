On the restaurant's TripAdvisor page, one reviewer posted: "During our meal the restaurant advised us they had to close due to an incident.
"We've later discovered they were served a prohibition order due to cockroaches."
The restaurant owners have a few weeks to make improvements before a new inspection.
A note has been posted on the restaurant door which reads: "We are taking this opportunity to refurbish and update our equipment... to ensure that we provide the best possible environment for our valued guests."
The German cockroach, which can be found around the world, is the most common type of cockroach in the UK.
