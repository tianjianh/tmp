Mum Claire was desperate to be at her daughter's career-defining moment but needed a little help from friends - and a crowd-funding page.
"My mum is a single mum and, ever since I was young, we've been putting everything into my swimming," the British 200m breaststroke record-holder said.
"Coming into Rio, the expenses are really expensive so me and my mum have been setting up meetings so I can have my photo taken with people, signing autographs.
"It's really sweet because the little kids love it. It's completely out of my comfort zone but I need to get used to it.
"We've been baking cakes and selling cakes and all sorts. I'm so grateful for everyone who's helped my mum. It means a lot to me, I'm glad she'll be there."
The 20-year-old's mum was able to successfully raise the amount required - Â£3,714 to be exact - and join her daughter in Brazil as the world number five will mix it with the best.
Tutton, who starts her campaign in Rio with the 200m breaststroke heats on 10 August, is the new kid on the block in British swimming.
She shot to prominence in April as she won gold in the British Championship to secure her Olympic qualification.
A month later, the Ystrad Rhondda swimmer helped Great Britain win 4x100m medley relay gold at the European Championships, having claimed an individual bronze in the 100m breaststroke.
Having turned 20 in July, Tutton travels to Rio with Olympic silver medallist Sharron Davies among those excited by her potential.
Tutton's selection caps a rapid rise from relative obscurity at the start of 2016.
However, she was earmarked for stardom early having developed a passion for swimming as a child and being pinpointed by renowned Cardiff swimming club coach Dave Haller, who coached David Wilkie and Duncan Goodhew to Olympic titles.

"I started swimming when I was about three," she recalled. "On holiday I used to love getting in the water so my mum took me to Ystrad Swimming Pool for some lessons.
"At the age of 12, Dave Haller asked me to join Cardiff and, from there, my swimming just took off. It started off as a hobby and then it turned into more of a career."
Tutton is one of 24 Welsh athletes at the Olympics and joins fellow Welsh swimmers Jazz Carlin, the European and Commonwealth champion, Georgia Davies and Ieuan Lloyd in Rio.
"It's a complete dream for me. I'm on cloud nine right now and enjoying every moment," Tutton added.
"I love that there are four of us from the Welsh team on the British team. We'll be doing our country proud."
