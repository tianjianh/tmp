A fire has broken out at several car repair units in Wolverhampton, prompting fears gas cylinders inside the premises could explode.

More than 60 firefighters have been tackling the blaze in Hickman Avenue, near East Park, since about 14:30 BST.
A man was taken to hospital for a minor burn after trying to put the fire out, West Midlands Fire Service said.
A working men's club and nearby buildings were evacuated until fire crews moved the cylinders to safety.
Three car repair units and two tyre storage units have been affected by the severe fire which is now under control, the spokesman said.
Fire crews said they managed to save two coaches inside one of the buildings and part of a gym, but the roof of the tyre unit was destroyed.
It is thought the fire started inside one of the repair garages, the spokesman said.
Twelve fire engines were sent to the scene as police closed nearby roads and dealt with subsequent traffic problems.
Nearby residents were urged to keep their windows shut due to the large quantities of smoke.
