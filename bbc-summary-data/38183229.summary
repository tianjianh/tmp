Pro12: Leinster 28-15 Dragons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster moved level on points with Pro12 leaders Munster as their pace, power and off-loading game proved too much for the Dragons at the RDS.

Once again, Joey Carbery excelled for Leinster with his try early in the second half clinching the bonus point.
That followed first-half tries from Peter Dooley, Ross Molony and Jack Conan as the home side dominated.
Pat Howard and Sarel Pretorius notched second-half Dragons tries as a series of changes took the edge off Leinster.
The Dragons were the last team to inflict a home defeat on Leinster in the Pro12 in February 2015 but the home side's fast start meant there was never going to be another surprise in Saturday's game.
Young fly-half Carbery's by now trademark lightning break helped set up Dooley's opening try in the 12th minute with the prop breaking through some weak Dragons tackling to score.
Within three minutes, Leinster were 14-0 up after Luke McGrath's initial dart was successfully recycled by Rhys Ruddock before Noel Reid's pass set up lock Molony for a close-range finish.
Following Angus O'Brien's penalty reply for the Dragons, Leinster resumed their domination and after young wing Adam Byrne had been denied, Conan ran in the home team's third try on 31 minutes as he took a flat pass from McGrath on the burst.
A forward pass by Byrne saw centre Rory O'Loughlin having a touchdown ruled out before the break but the inevitable bonus point did come within five minutes of the restart as O'Loughlin's run and perfectly delivered pass set by Carbery to score under the posts.
Carbery was immediately taken off with Leinster coach Leo Cullen clearly looking towards next Friday's European Champions Cup game against Northampton, given the ongoing fitness concerns over Johnny Sexton.
With Leinster making several other changes, their performance began somewhat ragged and Howard's 54th-minute score was followed by a 70th-minute try from replacement Pretorius as the Dragons produced a series of attacks.
The result means the Dragons have lost all their five Pro12 matches on the road this season.
