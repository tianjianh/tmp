Rye Hunt was last seen at a Copacabana apartment on 21 May.
According to Brazilian police, Mr Hunt took recreational drugs before he disappeared.
Fishermen reportedly saw a man matching his description on Cotunduba Island at the weekend.
"We are seeing the same reports in the media that Rye has been found. We have no confirmation of this," the family's statement said.
"We are hopeful but understandably cautious of these reports.
"This information has not come via our official channels. We await news from Australian authorities."
Mr Hunt had been travelling with his friend Mitchell Sheppard, 22, since early April, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
The pair were last together at Rio International Airport before Mr Hunt left in a taxi.
"We remain hopeful that Mr Hunt will be found safe and well, but continue to hold concerns for his safety," Australia's foreign affairs department said.
