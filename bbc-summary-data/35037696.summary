The show, which took place at a derelict seafront lido in Weston-super-Mare, attracted huge interest when it ran for five weeks in the summer.
North Somerset District Council confirmed that Banksy had left behind a giant pin wheel from the attraction.
It said it would be stored safely until it was decided what part it would play in any revamp of the Tropicana site.
The outdoor pool and leisure facility closed in 2000 due to falling visitor numbers.
Since then, there have been various attempts to re-open or demolish the structure.
Banksy, who is thought to hail from Bristol, said he had been motivated to work on the site because he "loved" the Tropicana as a child.
