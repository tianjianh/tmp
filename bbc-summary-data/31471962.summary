She's one of only five X Factor winners to have a debut UK number one album and single, but Sam Bailey has been dropped by Syco Records.

Despite only winning the show 14 months ago, the singer will not have her contract renewed.
Sam confirmed the news on Twitter.
She reassured her fans, telling them not to worry about her because she's "happy" and has "lots of exciting things happening".
The singer is the third former X Factor act to leave Simon Cowell's label in the last 12 months.
In June last year, Leona Lewis left the label after seven years - having signed a deal with Island Record.
A week later, 2012 winner James Arthur announced he was no longer with the label having denied rumours he had been dropped.
Sam Bailey won in the tenth series of the competition in 2013 and went on to continue the talent show's tradition of claiming the Christmas number one with her debut single Skyscraper.
Four months later her debut album, The Power of Love, went straight the top of the UK chart.
The achievement makes her the only third female winner to see their debut single and album go to number one.
That's something only Alexndra Burke and Leona Lewis have done before.
Sam Bailey is currently at the tail-end of a UK tour and recently released her first autobiography.
