A Dangerous Building Notice has been served on the owner of the fire-hit Broadford Works site in Aberdeen, with the council seeking 24-hour security.

Firefighters were called to a major blaze at the disused textile mill just over a week ago. There have been several fires in recent years.
Aberdeen City Council wants round-the-clock patrols.
There have already been calls for owner Ian Suttie to progress development plans for the site more quickly.
Planning development management committee convener Ramsay Milne said: "We said last week that we had concerns about health and safety at the Broadford Works site and the deterioration of the buildings.
"The terms of the Dangerous Buildings Notice should ensure that steps are taken as quickly as possible to make this site secure.
"There has been and continues to be a significant risk of serious injury and we want to do all we can to improve public safety.
"We are pleased that the site owner agreed to meet our building standards team today and is now co-operating fully with our requests to ensure the security of the perimeter of the site and the improvements required for public safety."
The council said the 24-hour site security had to be in place by 9 June.
Other measures, including the blocking of open lift shafts, and warning signs being erected, have to be completed by 29 June.
Police have been called to Broadford Works 27 times since the start of the year.
The figure was revealed in a letter from the force to Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart.
