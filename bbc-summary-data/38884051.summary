Wales face the Silver Ferns on Tuesday and Wednesday at Ice Arena Wales in front of the hosts' largest ever crowd.
The two-match series marks 20 years since the visitors last played the host nation on Welsh soil and head coach, Trish Wilcox, is relishing the meetings.
"The excitement has been building for this test series," said Wilcox.
Wales will be led by  Suzy Drane, while under-21 player Chloe James joins the senior line-up for the first time and Nia Jones makes the cut despite previously prioritising football over netball.
Wilcox said spirits were high in the camp for what promise to be two stern tests.
"We have had a really productive camp this weekend and all players have pushed for a place in the final 12," she said.
"The players are relishing the opportunity to benchmark themselves against world-class players."
New Zealand arrive in Wales having finished second in the Quad series behind winners Australia, and above hosts England in third and last-placed South Africa.
Wales squad: Sara Bell, Fern Davies, Suzy Drane (capt), Bethan Dyke, Chloe James, Kyra Jones, Nia Jones, Lateisha Kidner, Chelsea Lewis, Kelly Morgan (vice-capt), Georgia Rowe, Amanda Varey.
