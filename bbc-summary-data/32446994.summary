[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Anderson, 46 and from Castletown, faces at least 15 years for killing Neil Roberts, 60, in December 2013.
Deemster Alistair Montgomerie said he hoped the sentence would offer Mr Roberts' family "some comfort".
He said: "You have conducted yourselves with dignity throughout and words can not express how difficult it must have been for you."
