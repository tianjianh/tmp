[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government early green light for promised road and rail projects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new government isn't wasting time. Less than a month after winning the election, it's keen to show that it's sticking to its manifesto promises.

In the course of just a couple of hours this week, it made two important infrastructure announcements for the region. It published the shortlist for running the Greater Anglia Rail Franchise and it gave the a long-awaited go ahead for a controversial new road around Norwich.
The existing operator Abellio will compete with First and National Express to run services from Norwich and Cambridge to Liverpool Street as well as the Stansted Express and the Ipswich to Peterborough service.
The companies have until the end of the year to submit detailed plans to run the service, with the new franchise starting in October 2016. One of the key requirements will be a promise to make immediate improvements to the ageing rolling stock.
Rail Minister Claire Perry said: "This announcement marks another key milestone in the rail franchising programme and is the next step in delivering real change to the passengers in the East Anglia region."
The go ahead to the Northern Distributor Road, which will make the building of 10,000 new homes possible, will divide opinion around Norwich.
The head of the local Chamber of Commerce, Caroline Williams, said: "This is another positive step towards getting the improvements to Norfolk's infrastructure, which the business community has been calling for. The NDR is not just a piece of road but the opportunity to unlock jobs and new homes."
But one of the main opponents, Andrew Boswell, of the Green Party, predicted that the road would open up "urban sprawl". He added: "Generations to come will question why this government promoted such irreversible destruction in Norfolk for a mirage of short term but undeliverable material gain."
Both these announcements were expected around around now but the fact that they came out on the same day and so soon after the election shows that the Government means business.
As we've reported before, the promise to improve infrastructure in the region was a key part of the Conservative offer for the East. Minister after minister followed David Cameron's lead by repeating the pledge to improve road and rail services across the eastern counties.
Norwich in 90 (minutes), Ipswich in 60 was one of the headline promises, so too was improving the A47 (which will connect to the NDR) and building more homes.  Expect news soon on two of the other main promises; new river crossings for Ipswich and Lowestoft.
There is another reason all this is happening so quickly. Ministers know that infrastructure takes time to build and they will be judged at the next election by whether they've kept their promises.
MPs privately admit that with so much costly work to be done, Norwich in 90 is unlikely to be achievable by 2020 and there'll have been little improvement to the A47. But if there have already been some small improvements then they will be able to point at progress.
So, the starting gun has been fired, now the clock is ticking.
