Sam Winnall headed narrowly wide for the Tykes early on, before Thorsten Stuckmann saved well from Adam Hammill as Barnsley pressed for an opener.
Doncaster struggled to create chances, while Winnall and Conor Hourihane both drew further stops from Stuckmann.
But the German keeper was unable to hold on to another Hourihane shot, and Fletcher tapped in to grab the points.
The victory, Barnsley's eighth in nine league games, put them 10th in the table, seven points outside the play-off places, with Doncaster still 17th.
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Christian Dibble has left Oakwell to join National League South club Chelmsford City.
