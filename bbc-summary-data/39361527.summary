Lloyd's first-half header was the only goal of the first leg in a game City were unlucky not to win by more.
The USA midfielder rose unmarked to meet a Jane Ross cross on 30 minutes.
Lucy Bronze was denied in either half with a volley off the crossbar and a header just wide in the closing stages.
City are appearing in the last eight of the competition for the first time.
The two sides will meet in the return leg at Manchester's Academy Stadium on 30 March.
The winners will face one of last year's finalists - Wolfsburg or holders Lyon - in the semi-finals in April.
