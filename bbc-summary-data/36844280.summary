Oxford United manager Michael Appleton is continuing to search for new players with less than three weeks to go until they start their League One campaign.

The U's have brought in 10 players this summer, but have seen midfielders Kemar Roofe and Callum O'Dowda leave.
"I'll be disappointed if we don't get at least two or three more in the next week," Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford.
"We're two to three players short of making sure we can be as competitive as we can in this division."
He continued: "I think it will happen. We just have to be patient as these things take time."
Oxford played Premier League champions Leicester City in front of a crowd of more than 10,000 at the Kassam Stadium on Tuesday.
Chris Maguire's free-kick gave them an unexpected lead before goals from Demarai Gray and Jeff Schlupp secured a 2-1 victory for Claudio Ranieri's side.
Appleton said facing a side including Riyad Mahrez, Wes Morgan, Danny Drinkwater and Kasper Schmeichel had been an ideal pre-season test.
"We're grateful for Leicester for coming here and for giving us the game they did," he added.
"It will do the players the world of good later in the season."
