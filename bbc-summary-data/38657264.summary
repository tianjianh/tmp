The Football Association of Wales has launched its Become a Champion campaign to find people to help with transport, marketing, ticketing and VIP services.
Another 500 people could perform in a pre-match ceremony at the Principality Stadium - which will be called the National Stadium of Wales for the game.
The volunteers are wanted in the days before and on the final on 3 June.
They are also needed to help with the Women's Champions League final at the Cardiff City Stadium on 1 June.
FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford said: "The Uefa Champions League final and Uefa Women's Champions League final represent the pinnacle of European club football.
"Our aim is that everyone in Wales also has an opportunity to experience unforgettable moments when these iconic events come to Cardiff."
Officials said recruitment credentials would not only be based on professional qualifications.
They will also look at volunteers' "motivation, availability and team spirit".
