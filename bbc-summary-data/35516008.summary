An inquiry is under way after a man's body was pulled from the River Avon in the centre of Bristol, police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of the man, who was in his 20s, was recovered by police divers near Welsh Back on Saturday.
Police said a member of the public reported seeing the man in the water at 12.30 GMT and went into the river to try to rescue him.
They have asked anyone who saw the man go into the river to contact them. The body has not been formally identified.
Insp Shaun Finn said: "The water at this time of year can be icy cold and can be very dangerous to even the young and fit.
"The cold water can really shock the body in a matter of seconds making it extremely difficult to swim or stay afloat.
"While trips and falls might happen, we'd strongly advise anyone against deliberately going in the water as what might seem like a harmless dip can go horribly wrong very quickly."
