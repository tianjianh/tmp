Leinster second row Mike McCarthy has been forced to retire because of an elbow injury.

The lock, 35, was supposed to join Narbonne in France in the summer, ending a four-year stint with Leinster.
He picked up a season-ending injury in a Pro12 match against the Scarlets in March, but the problem turned out to be more serious than first thought.
"It's just sad because I played my last game without knowing it, that decision was taken away from me," he said.
London-born McCarthy had two spells with Connacht before joining Leinster in 2013.
He made his international debut in 2011 and earned 19 caps for Ireland.
McCarthy said: "Unfortunately I had been ruled out for the season anyway with a back and an elbow issue, but there was also an elbow injury in training, and that injury has left the elbow in a pretty bad way.
"I was massively excited to go [Narbonne]. It's a beautiful part of France to live, down by the south coast, and and I was looking forward to contributing on the field over the next two seasons.
"But you have to listen to the medics, you have to back their advice."
