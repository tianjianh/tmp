Migration to East bringing skills but pressure on public services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Migration was said to be one of the big issues at the general election.

Now we know that net migration to the UK is at an all time high and in the East of England it's growing faster than almost anywhere else in the country.
Although the numbers aren't huge, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics, net migration to the east of England has increased by 70% in the past year.
Its figures for long term international migration between the middle of 2013 and the middle of 2014 record that 46,900 people came to the BBC East region from abroad and just 21,200 left.
That's a net migration figure of 25,700, up from 15,000 the year before and after the South East (which is up by 34,000), it's the highest figure for an English region outside London.
Net Migration appears to be highest in Hertfordshire at 5,612, followed by Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire. Suffolk has the lowest figure at 3,035.
•Hertfordshire           5,612
•Northamptonshire   3,835
•Cambridgeshire       3,715
•Essex                        3,285
•Norfolk                    3,259
The CBI was quick to point out that many of those who come to work from abroad bring vital skills which are valued in the region's science and research parks while farmers and food producers in the East rely heavily on migrant labour.
But migration also brings with it pressures on public services, like schools and allegations of wage deflation, so politicians are keen to address people's concerns.
Despite the increase in migration, non-Britons only make up 7.2% of BBC East's population, a figure which has edged up from 4% 10 years ago.
Slowly the make-up of the region is changing and moving more in line with the rest of the UK, which could influence the political map here in the future.
At present the East is a UKIP stronghold but research shows that areas with smaller ethnic minority populations are more likely to support Farage's party - if the East changes, that might too.
