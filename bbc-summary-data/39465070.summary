Documents released by the White House have revealed millions of dollars in assets held by its senior staff.

President Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have assets valued between $240m and $740m (Â£191m- Â£590m).
That includes a stake in Trump International Hotel, which earned Ms Trump between $1m and $5m last year.
The financial disclosure documents also detail salaries of several other high-profile figures in the administration.
Ethics regulations require such financial disclosures for staff working in the White House. The documents show income and assets at the time they started working for the US government - before any assets were sold or disposed of.
Neither President Donald Trump or Vice-President Mike Pence were part of the disclosure release, which came late on Friday.
The documents, which US media have uploaded online, list asset values within a range, rather than giving precise figures.
Among the revelations are:
In a briefing before the release, White House officials stressed that "these are not the current holdings that everyone has today.  These are the holdings that everybody had at the time when they came into office".
Potential conflicts of interest may have already been eliminated.
"These are incredibly successful individuals, very high net worth, very sophisticated, complex asset structures, numerous sub-LLCs [limited liability companies], trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through," the White House official said, adding that every staff member had a "sit-down" about their assets.
Reuters news agency quoted a White House official as saying about 25% of Mr Trump's White House were classified as having "extremely complex" filings, indicating they were very wealthy.
They appeared much wealthier than officials in previous administrations, including Barack Obama's White House, US media reported.
Bloomberg estimates that Mr Trump's cabinet and senior staff are worth some $12bn.
Since his election in November, the president's own business empire has been scrutinised by ethics experts - who say it poses major conflicts of interest.
Fears have been raised that interest groups or foreign governments might stay at the luxury Trump hotel in Washington in a bid to win the administration's favour.
Mr Trump's two oldest sons now control his extensive assets, but watchdogs have complained that the arrangements are insufficient to avoid conflicts.
The Office of Government Ethics has urged the president either to divest fully, or to set up a blind trust for his assets.
Mr Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, breaking with a long-held tradition.
