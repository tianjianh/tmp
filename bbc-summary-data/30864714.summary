Mountain rescue teams gathered in Cumbria earlier to practise working with new search and rescue helicopters.

The old RAF Sea King helicopters are being phased out after private company the Bristow Group won the contract to run the service from April.
Services will be provided by 22 new helicopters, operating from 10 Coastguard bases.
Rescue volunteers took part in a training exercise near Keswick with the one of the new Sikorsky S92s.
The aircraft is larger than the Sea King, so those on the ground need to get used to the downdraft while co-ordinating winching operations.
