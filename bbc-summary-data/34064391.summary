[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners hope a petition calling for greater legal protection for pet rabbits will get a second hearing in Holyrood next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rabbits Require Rights Scotland's 2,044-name petition was first discussed by MSPs earlier this year.
It calls for rabbits to be given the same protection as cats and dogs as well as regulations on breeding and the minimum size of housing.
Earlier this month, it emerged hundreds of pet rabbits have been abandoned.
The Scottish SPCA said it rescued 728 rabbits in 2014 and had taken 550 into care so far this year.
Rabbits Require Rights Scotland described rabbits as the "UK's most neglected pet".
A spokeswoman said: "As the law currently stands there are no enforceable welfare protection available to rabbits.
"They are too easily sold and too easily discarded. For want of a better word, they are sold like sweeties."
The spokeswoman added: "We will return to parliament for the second hearing of our petition sometime in September or October when the new session dates are announced.
"We've had some good feedback from other welfare bodies in support of our aims, so it is hoped that some level of the improvements we have called for will be addressed."
