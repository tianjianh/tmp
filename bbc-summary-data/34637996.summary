James Ferran, 50, assaulted 51-year-old Lyn McRavey outside a post office in Millerston, Glasgow, in March.
He hit Ms McRavey after an accomplice, who was wearing a Royal Mail outfit, tried to wrestle the cash from her.
Ferran was caught after his DNA was found in a getaway car. He admitted a charge of assault and robbery.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bannatyne told Ferran: "This was a well-planned robbery involving a very nasty assault.
"You were the person who used a baseball bat to assault this woman.
"This assault and robbery continues to have a significant effect on her."
Following his conviction, it emerged that Ferran had other convictions for similar crimes.
