[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted decapitating his wife at their home in west London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Naveed Ahmed, 41, pleaded guilty to the murder of mother-of-two Tahira Ahmed, 38, at the Old Bailey.
Ms Ahmed was found by police at the property in Merton Avenue, in Northolt, on 27 May after neighbours heard an argument.
A post-mortem examination found both her arms had been broken and she had been stabbed and decapitated. Ahmed is due to be sentenced on 28 January.
He was remanded in custody.
Judge Christopher Moss QC warned him he would face a life sentence for the murder.
Ahmed initially denied the murder of Ms Ahmed during a hearing at the Old Bailey in October.
His lawyer Mark Kelly QC told the court the issue at the previous hearing had been determining Ahmed's state of mind at the time of the killing.
