Mahesh Sharma said "a list of dos and don'ts" given to tourists at airports also advised them not to venture out alone at night in small towns.
He later clarified that he was speaking "in the context of religious places", and that he spoke out of "concern".
Mr Sharma has also been criticised in the past for controversial comments.
He's often made provocative statements blaming "westernisation" for India's ills and last year, he said "nights out for girls was not part of Indian culture".
