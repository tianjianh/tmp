Tensions between North and South Korea will not jeopardise the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, say organisers.

The situation between the two countries has become more strained amid concerns North Korea could be planning further missile or nuclear tests.
But Games officials have said they would welcome a team from North Korea if they become accredited by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It will be the first Winter Olympic Games to be held in South Korea.
The president of the Korea Tourism Organisation, Chang Soo Jung, said the situation between the two countries "looks a little severe", but believes that the tension "will come down in the near future".
The vice president of the local organising committee, Hyungkoo Yeo added: "Many people are worried about the Korean situation but we have successfully completed the test event.
"We have had 28 test event games without any problem.
"The North Korean female ice hockey team participated in the test event, so I'd like to stress that it has been a peaceful and successful case of harmony between North Korea and South Korea," he told BBC Sport's Alex Capstick.
The United Nations Security Council convenes for a ministerial-level meeting in North Korea on Friday, to be chaired by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.
The 2018 Games will be held between 9 and 25 February and it is the third time Asia has held a Winter Olympics after Japan hosted both the 1972 Games in Sapporo and Nagano in 1998.
Pyeongchang will be split between the coast and the mountains, similarly to Sochi [2014 Winter Olympics host]. The coastal cluster will host curling, ice hockey, figure skating, short track and speed skating, while the mountain area will host skiing, snowboarding, bobsleigh, skeleton and luge.
The winter Paralympics will run from 9 to 18 March.
