Chelsea defender Tomas Kalas says staying with Fulham would be the "perfect scenario" for him.

Kalas, 23, has been a mainstay on loan with the Whites this season, making 37 appearances in all competitions.
The central defender signed for Chelsea in 2010, but has been sent away on five separate loan deals, and has played just two games for the Blues.
"We're in touch with Fulham and Chelsea and we're sorting out my situation for next season," he told BBC Radio London.
"Getting promoted would help, but anyway, everyone knows that I'd like to stay, not because I wouldn't like to play anywhere else but because I'm playing every game and that's all I need.
"I'm living in an area I know, so right now it's perfect scenario for me to stay."
Kalas spent time on loan in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Germany and with Middlesbrough, as well as Fulham, since signing for Chelsea from Czech side Sigma Olomouc.
The Czech international says that while he would be more than happy to stay with Fulham, who are sixth in the Championship ahead of Saturday's game against Brentford, he still has ambitions to break into the Premier League leaders' team.
"Obviously I'd love to play for Chelsea, but we know how difficult it is to get there," he said.
"But I prefer to prove myself, and prove to everyone, that I can play at a good level for a certain amount of games to go higher and get into Chelsea's team."
