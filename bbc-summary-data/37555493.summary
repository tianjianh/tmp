Paramedic David Lee denies indecent behaviour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paramedic accused of indecent behaviour towards colleagues has denied acting inappropriately.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lee gave evidence during his trial Aberdeen Sheriff Court after the jury heard allegations that he exposed himself to ambulance co-workers.
He denies 15 charges said to have taken place between 2013 and 2015, involving five alleged victims.
The married father-of-one told the jury that he had slept with two of his co-workers who gave evidence against him.
He said his relationship with one of the women developed into "play fights and tickling" but he denied propositioning her for sex.
Mr Lee, 31, who is currently suspended from duty, has lodged a special defence claiming all activity was consensual.
Earlier the jury heard from a female ambulance technician who was mentored by Mr Lee in summer 2015.
The 26-year-old witness told the court that his behaviour changed after a couple of shifts together and he became "a bit sleazier and flirtatious".
"He was like a puppy that always needed attention," she said.
"He got some gloves down my top and asked if he could help get them back.
"I was exhausted. He said to me 'this is what you do to me' and pointed down at his crotch.
"He had an erection in the ambulance while he was driving. He just kept asking if I would touch it - saying that if I did then he'd leave me alone."
She said he then exposed himself.
During the same call-out to a patient's house in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, the witness said Lee attacked her in the back of the ambulance while she went to get her kit bag.
During cross examination, defence advocate David Moggach accused the witness of engaging in "flirtatious behaviour" with Mr Lee.
He said the sexual elements of her story "simply didn't happen" and that was why she had not reported the claims to managers until someone else voiced similar allegations about Lee's behaviour.
The woman replied: "That's a complete lie. I felt too intimated to come forward."
Mr Lee is alleged to have acted in a culpable and reckless manner towards women when they were behind the wheel of an ambulance.
The trial, before Sheriff Graeme Napier, continues.
