Per Mertesacker and Olivier Giroud missed the game in Shanghai, which Arsenal won 3-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in normal time.
New signing Sead Kolasinac, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott played but struggled with illness.
"The doctor thinks it is food poisoning. I don't know what they may have eaten," said boss Arsene Wenger.
"We have a little virus in the camp."
Robert Lewandowski put Bayern ahead after eight minutes, before Alex Iwobi scored a 93rd-minute equaliser.
The game was played in temperatures of 36C and Wenger said the conditions had been "a bit of a shock", after arriving from Australia where it was "freezing".
Elsewhere, Leicester beat West Brom 7-6 on penalties in the Premier League Asia Trophy in Hong Kong after the game finished 1-1 in normal time.
Jay Rodriguez, who joined West Brom from Southampton for Â£12m, marked his Baggies debut with a stunning strike in the ninth minute, before Riyad Mahrez equalised.
