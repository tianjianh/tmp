Lostprophets Ian Watkins: Police face misconduct action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three South Wales Police officers will face disciplinary action for failures over child sexual abuse claims against Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins.

The frontman, from Pontypridd, was given a 35-year sentence in 2013 after admitting a string of offences.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said a detective sergeant and two detective constables should face misconduct proceedings.
South Wales Police said it accepted the findings of the IPCC report.
The watchdog examined how the force responded to reports and intelligence about the singer dating back to December 2008.
It found a detective sergeant "did not take sufficient action to progress enquiries" and contributed to allegations from a main witness being treated as unfounded.
The IPCC recommended the individual has a case to answer for gross misconduct.
The two detective constables "did not undertake all reasonable and practicable lines of enquiry" and also had a case to answer for misconduct, the IPCC found.
It was also recommended the same detective sergeant in the Watkins case should face gross misconduct action in response to an allegation against a different suspect that a 15-year-old girl had been raped.
"This has been a complex process," said the IPCC's commissioner in Wales, Jan Williams.
"We probed a substantial number of reports and allegations relating to Ian Watkins made over a four year period to establish exactly who knew what and when, and how police officers responded.
"We aim to issue our fuller findings, including our examination of the wider organisational response of South Wales Police, following the conclusion of the misconduct proceedings currently being arranged by the force."
The investigations were prompted by an internal review by South Wales Police who referred themselves to the IPCC.
"We accept these recommendations and will respond promptly to the investigation and its findings. This will include the progression of misconduct proceedings, to take place in the autumn," said South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Jon Drake.
"Our primary objective as an organisation remains the safeguarding of vulnerable people and children. We now have dedicated staff dealing with child protection issues and working closely with our partner agencies."
An ex-girlfriend of Watkins who repeatedly warned police about Watkins said she felt vindicated by the IPCC inquiry.
Joanne Mjadzelics told the BBC that she still felt traumatised by the ordeal and was frustrated that the most that could happen would be for an officer to be sacked.
She was cleared last year of possessing child abuse images, which her trial heard were part of a bid to unmask his paedophile activities.
"I feel I'm being vindicated with every little thing that is being revealed," she said.
The children's charity NSPCC Cymru said it was a "grave concern" that the IPCC believed claims of abuse were not properly investigated.
"It's an incredibly difficult step to report child abuse so it's imperative that when people do speak out, they have the upmost confidence that what they are reporting will be acted upon immediately," said a spokesperson.
A further investigation by the IPCC into how South Yorkshire Police handled the Watkins case is also due to be published in the near future, examining allegations made to the force in 2012.
