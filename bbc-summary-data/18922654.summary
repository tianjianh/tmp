A senior Leicestershire Police officer and his wife have appeared in court charged with perverting the course of justice over a speeding incident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assistant Chief Constable Gordon Fraser, 48, and his wife Teresa, 42, also a serving officer, appeared at St Albans Magistrates' Court.
They are accused of falsely claiming she was the driver of a speeding car in Scotland in September, when it is alleged her husband was at the wheel.
Both were bailed until 22 October.
The speeding is alleged to have happened in Strathclyde, but the couple live in Ansley in Warwickshire.
Mrs Fraser works for West Midlands Police but has been suspended from duty.
Mr Fraser worked for West Midlands Police for 22 years before moving to Leicestershire in 2010.
Leicestershire Police said he had been suspended from duty over a separate matter.
The couple were asked to stand outside the dock at the court as the charge was read out.
Neither of them spoke during the hearing.
The next hearing will be at St Albans Crown Court.
