Victims of Ivory Coast's post-election conflict will start receiving payouts in July, authorities say.

Some 74,000 registered victims are eligible for compensation from a fund worth 10bn CFA francs ($17mn; Â£11mn).
The move comes ahead of elections in October, with incumbent President Alassane Ouattara the clear favourite.
More than 3,000 people died in the violence in 2010-2011, after ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in presidential elections.

Mr Gbagbo is now awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity.
The vice-president of the country's National Commission for the Reconciliation and Compensation of Victims (Conariv) said the payouts were a positive development for the country.
"Victims no longer believed that they would be compensated, so this will really help the reconciliation process", said Desire Amon Tanoe, according to AFP news agency.
There will now be a one month grace period for any remaining victims to come forward and register for the scheme, Mr Tanoe added.
President Ouattara announced the compensation scheme in December.
