A trailer for Danny Boyle's new film about Steve Jobs has offered a first glimpse of actor Michael Fassbender in character as the late Apple co-founder.

The 12 Years a Slave star is seen wearing Jobs' trademark glasses and black polar neck in scenes recreating one of his famous product launches.
The film, called Steve Jobs, reportedly uses three such launches to probe Jobs' life and relationships with colleagues.
Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen also appear in the biopic, out on 13 November.
The former plays former Macintosh marketing chief Joanna Hoffman, while the latter plays Steve Wozniak, another Apple co-founder.
"The musicians play the instruments. I play the orchestra," Fassbender is heard saying cryptically in the minute-long promo.
"I sat in a garage and invented the future... because artists lead, and hacks ask for a show of hands."
"No one sees the world the same way you do," actor Jeff Daniels is also heard saying in his role as John Sculley, Apple's former CEO.
Jobs co-founded Apple in the late 1970s but was driven out of the firm in a boardroom coup in the 1980s.
He was later bought back and spearheaded the production of the highly successful iPod and iPhone, before dying of pancreatic cancer in 2011.
Written by Aaron Sorkin of The Social Network and The West Wing fame, Steve Jobs is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late entrepreneur.
An earlier film about Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher in the title role and Matthew Modine as Sculley, met with a tepid response in 2013.
