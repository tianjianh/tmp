Berg, released by Middlesex at the end of last season following persistent shoulder injuries, scored 674 runs and took 43 wickets in first-class cricket.
"From not playing anything last year to having a decent year this season, it's fantastic," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Michael Carberry and Fidel Edwards claimed the county's batsman and bowler of the year awards respectively.
Berg, 34, made a valuable first-innings 72 against Nottinghamshire in Hampshire's final match of the season as they guaranteed their Division One status in the County Championship.
"It's a very humbling experience for me," he said. "I've got to give a lot of credit to the backroom staff, the physios and strength and conditioning team here to get me to where I am this year.
"I surprised myself in terms of lasting a whole season and more so in terms of the wickets and runs. To have a season completely out of the game and then take more than 40 wickets and score more than 600 runs is a fantastic achievement."
Teenage leg-spinner Mason Crane was named the county's breakthrough player of the year, with Sean Ervine collecting the clubman of the year for his work with charity Hampshire Cricket in the Community.
