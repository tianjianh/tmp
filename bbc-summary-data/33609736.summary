Moorland memorials under scrutiny by Bradford Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rules over memorial benches and trees in country parks in a part of West Yorkshire are being considered by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradford Council fears there is an increasing number of memorials on moors, including Ilkley Moor, Baildon Moor and Penistone Hill at Haworth.
Officials said in some cases memorials were "too numerous" and detracted from the "naturalness" of the settings.
Councillor Val Slater said a balance had to be achieved.
Senior councillors in Bradford were told by officials that most requests were accommodated, with the agreement that the family pay for the memorial to be installed by the council.
But a report points out: "It is not always clear who will maintain the memorial long-term or if it will be replaced or repaired if it gets damaged.
"Also, some popular sites, such as Ilkley Moor, Baildon Moor and Penistone Hill at Haworth have almost reached capacity in terms of how many more memorials they can accommodate.
"Another concern people have expressed is the number of "unauthorised" memorials, such as bunches of flowers, planting of flowers and shrubs and benches, without any prior contact with the council.
"Some of the flowers and shrubs planted can affect the existing vegetation on sites, while bunches of flowers can become untidy when they die."
Ms Slater said: "We do understand that many people want to leave a special tribute to a loved one, perhaps in a favourite place, and want to support them doing this.
"But we also have to balance this with the need to protect our countryside, parks and woodland for future generations."
