A man who murdered his neighbour in a sexually motivated attack had been sacked from his job after allegations of sexual assault, a health board has revealed.

Kris Wade, 37, is serving at least 21 years after admitting killing Christine James, 65, at her Cardiff Bay flat.
Allegations were made by patients with learning disabilities in 2012 and 2013.
Police investigated the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg (ABMU) Health Board support worker but found insufficient evidence.
In a statement, ABMU - which runs Rowan House in Ely, Cardiff, where he worked - said it was "shocked" and "sickened" to hear the details of Mrs James' murder.
Wade was employed at the assessment and treatment unit for people with learning disabilities from 2005, when a criminal record check showed nothing of concern.
In January 2012, he was given special leave while a sexual assault allegation was investigated by the health board and South Wales Police.
However, both found there was insufficient evidence to proceed, the health board said.
While he returned to work at another location for the health board, further complaints of sexual assault were made in October 2012 and 2013 and he was suspended again.
Further investigations were carried out, with police again deciding to take no further action, the health board said.
However, Wade remained suspended by ABMU until its internal disciplinary procedure resulted in him being sacked for gross misconduct earlier this year.
The statement added: "We have offered our profound apologies to the patients involved, and the distress his actions undoubtedly caused."
It will now review its processes to see if there are lessons to be learned.
A South Wales Police spokesman confirmed three allegations of patients in Cardiff being sexually assaulted by a member of staff between 2012 and 2013 were investigated.
He added: "As part of those investigations, a man who was in his 30s at the time, was voluntarily questioned by officers.
"In each case no further action could be taken following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service."
