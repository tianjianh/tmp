[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Roberts, 33, and Anthony "Charlie" Munkley, 55, deny killing 25-year-old Sion Davies.
Mold Crown Court heard Mr Davies was shot with a crossbow before falling from a three-storey balcony at Caia Park estate, Wrexham, in October 2014.
Mr Roberts said he was concerned for his own mental health 10 days before Mr Davies' death, the court heard.
Consultant psychiatrist Dr Lucie Klenka said she had a consultation with Mr Roberts on 14 September.
"He did not trust himself with people and that was what he wanted help with," she said.
Film footage taken from the victim's phone showing some of the attack has been played to the jury.
The trial continues.
