'Minimise' institutional abuse risk, says ombudsman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reforms are needed to "minimise the risk of institutional abuse ever occurring", the public services ombudsman for Wales has said.

Nick Bennett's comments follow a report that found such abuse of patients at Tawel Fan mental health ward in Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire.
A newly-published separate review described the local health board as having a "bullying culture".
The Betsi Cadwaladr board was placed under special measures on Monday.
Mr Bennett told BBC Wales' Y Sgwrs programme on S4C changes are needed to the current system so his office can launch investigations without having to wait for a complaint to be made first.
"I think it's really important, and a test of a mature democracy, that you have independent institutions that are capable of scrutinising public institutions in Wales to make sure that this type of abuse doesn't occur again", he said.
"I think there are a number of reforms that could be put in place including 'own initiative' powers for my own office", Mr Bennett added.
More details have also emerged of the crisis at Betsi Cadwaladr health board, that led up to the decision to put it under more direct Welsh government control.
A newly published review by former head of the Welsh NHS Ann Lloyd says the health board's chair described it as having a "bureaucratic and bullying culture".
The report also raises financial concerns and warns a "mammoth effort" was needed to make the changes needed.
In the document, summing up the view of the board's chair Peter Higson, Ms Lloyd says: "He is very concerned about the lack of creativity within the organisation and considers that the organisation has a rigid, overly bureaucratic and bullying culture."
Describing a series of clinical, organisational, managerial and financial problems, she observes: "It will take a mammoth effort on behalf of the whole of the executive team to enable the organisation to improve."
In the report, Ms Lloyd says "there is a great deal of work needed to bring the (mental health) services up to the standard required".
She also highlights the findings of a review by the Good Governance Institute last year.
It concluded members of the Local Health Board were "not seen as adding value to the organisation", there was "no clear direction/strategy or corporate objectives" and departments were "setting their own objectives and timescales".
On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford announced the deputy chief executive of the Welsh NHS Simon Dean  was to take charge of the board after its chief executive was suspended.
