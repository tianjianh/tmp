World Rally Championship: Elfyn Evans hopeful over new contract

Welsh World Rally driver Elfyn Evans hopes he has done enough at the season-ending Wales Rally GB to secure a new contract with M-Sport.

Evans, 26, finished sixth in the race and ended the season seventh overall.
His current deal will soon expire and M-Sport boss Malcolm Wilson has yet to make a decision on next year's line-up.
"We've learnt a lot during the course of this year," Evans said. "It would be a shame not to put all that learning into use next year."
World champion Sebastien Ogier won the Wales Rally GB for a third successive year, 26 seconds ahead of Northern Ireland's Kris Meeke.
Evans, with co-driver Daniel Barritt, had finished a career-best second in his Ford Fiesta in the French round in October. That was his second podium of the season after a third place in Argentina.
The Dolgellau-born driver had targeted a podium in Wales but a puncture on day one affected his chances and he finished out of contention in sixth place.
"I think, overall, it was a strong result but it was a shame for the puncture on Friday or else it would have been a comfortable fourth," Evans added.
"But we all know rallying is a game of ifs and buts.  It's been on okay weekend for us."
