In London, the Duchess of Cambridge sipped a pint of Guinness after watching a parade of the Irish Guards with Prince William.
Many landmarks around the world were illuminated with green lighting overnight, as part of Tourism Ireland's global greening project.
In Northern Ireland, Darth Vader showed up to join in the fun in Belfast, but the weather was the real villain, with many spectators and participants soaking up the rain as well as the atmosphere.
St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, is believed to have been buried in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland and a religious procession and vigil was held in the County Down town on Friday.
Northern Ireland Secretary of State James Brokenshire laid a wreath at St Patrick's grave outside Down Cathedral before the town's celebrations got under way.
Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny is visiting the United States for St Patrick's Day and is attending New York City's parade.
At a White House reception on Thursday, Mr Kenny presented US President Donald Trump a bowl of shamrocks, a tradition that dates back to the 1950s.
In Dublin, thousands of locals and tourists braved the cold, wet weather to line the route of the city's parade which was led by Olympic silver medal winner Annalise Murphy.
Some smaller parades had to be cancelled because of poor weather conditions across the Republic of Ireland, including parts of County Donegal and Connemara on the west coast.
In Limerick, an estimated 50,000 people watched the parade led by a 14-year-old cyberbullying campaigner Luke Culhane - who was recently named the city's Person of the Year.
