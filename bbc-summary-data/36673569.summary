A shopping area called The Restoration Yard will open on 25 July alongside a new adventure playground named Fort Douglas at Dalkeith Country Park.
The park's walking and cycling routes have also been upgraded.
The 1,000-acre park will have a new nature trail through its 700-year-old oak woodland along with relaid paths for walkers, cyclists and buggies.
There are also more than 100 signs and nature interpretation boards.
Lord Damian Scott, who is leading the project on behalf of the Buccleuch family, said: "The stunning natural surroundings of Dalkeith Country Park are readily accessible on the edge of Edinburgh and provide a wonderful backdrop for this new offering.
"Our vision was to create a first-class destination for visitors while sensitively restoring the Category A listed buildings which are steeped in history.
"We are extremely hopeful that the combination of a gorgeous new store, cafe and wellbeing space within The Restoration Yard, alongside the dramatic riverside adventure park Fort Douglas, will draw visitors from far and near for many years to come."
The Duke of Gloucester unveiled a plaque at the park on Wednesday.
