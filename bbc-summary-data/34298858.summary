England coach Stuart Lancaster said it was a "massive relief" to secure a bonus-point victory over Fiji in the opening World Cup match.

Billy Vunipola muscled over for a late try to give England a 35-11 win in a disjointed display at Twickenham.
"It was a big occasion and there were a few nerves. We got a good lead but didn't put the nail in the coffin," Lancaster told BBC Radio 5 live.
"We had to work hard and that last try late in the game was a massive relief."

Two tries from full-back Mike Brown and the impact of a superior set of replacements saw Lancaster's men home.
However, had Fiji been more clinical with their kicking the scoreline would have been closer.
England face Wales in their next Pool A match at Twickenham on 26 September and, after his substitutions worked so effectively, Lancaster hinted at changes to the starting XV.
"We didn't get our game plan into action," he said. "We have to be more direct; we were a little bit lateral. Our bench made us much quicker.
"Overall it was a big game to play and if you'd have offered me a four-try bonus I'd have taken it.
"We definitely have some decisions to make - we have two days to dwell on that. We'll watch the game again, meet on Sunday and narrow down our selection next week."

Captain Chris Robshaw told Radio 5 live: "With the emotion of the opening ceremony there were nerves, but now we're into it.
"The opening game can be edgy and you have to give a lot of credit to Fiji.
"We knew it was going to be tough. We knew it would come down to the last five or 10 minutes because Fiji were hard to break down.
"The bonus point might be hugely important."
