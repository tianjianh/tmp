Resuming on 297-5, Liam Norwell claimed the crucial wickets of Ben Cox (69) and Joe Clarke (135) as Worcestershire were bowled out for 411, a lead of 31.
Dent hit 10 fours to help the hosts reach 204-4 with six overs remaining.
But Henry bowled George Hawkins and Kieran Noema-Barnett as Gloucestershire closed on 217-6, a lead of 186 runs.
The Kiwi bowler enjoyed a fruitful day with the bat and ball as his 3-60 followed an entertaining 42 off 40 balls which gave Worcestershire their slender first-innings lead.
