Senior Conservatives battle over Manston Airport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A row has broken out between two senior Conservative politicians in Kent over the future of Manston Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Thanet MP, Sir Roger Gale, who is campaigning to save the airport, said fellow Tory and Kent County Council leader Paul Carter should resign.
Mr Carter has refused to back calls for the compulsory purchase of the site and said his views were shared by the "vast majority" of Conservatives.
Sir Roger said the council leader's position was "untenable".
The airport closed in May 2014 and several months later a majority stake was sold to Chris Musgrave and Trevor Carter for redevelopment.
Sir Roger said: "I think that unless he is prepared to come onside and march with everybody else in east Kent and in government then his position is completely untenable.
"We've got to the stage now where the leader of Kent County Council seems to be at odds with the vote taken by his own council, at odds with the two MPs for east Kent, at odds with Thanet District Council and at odds with government.
"Under those circumstances, can he stay in office?"
Plans to keep the airport open were unsuccessful, with the most public attempt being led by US company Riveroak.
Speaking last month Paul Carter said: "We've asked for a viable business plan from Riveroak but have received absolutely nothing."
In a letter he rebutted Sir Roger's opinion and claimed his views were shared by the vast majority of Conservative colleagues at county hall.
He said the new owners have a "robust plan" for the site and it was vital differing views are heard in an "open and transparent way".
