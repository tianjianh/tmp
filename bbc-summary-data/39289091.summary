The four board members stood down ahead of a review of services at Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, which is due to be published next week.
The trust came under fire after Connor Sparrowhawk drowned at its Slade House facility in Oxford.
Its boss Katrina Percy resigned in October amid public pressure.
Previous interim chairman Tim Smart also stood down after he was criticised for creating a new job for Ms Percy.
Current interim chairman Alan Yates, said: "The trust leadership will need to look quite different if it is to meet the needs of patients and service users, as well as its stakeholders.
"Four non-executive directors have this week jointly offered their resignation from their posts so that the governors can, with my help, recruit to the need for all five new non-executive directors."
Mr Yates, previously the trust's improvement director, said the trust would also need to find a new chairman before he leaves in July.
The review looks at the trust's mental health, learning disability, and community physical health services.
"The board has identified the benefits of much greater inclusion of service users and carers in the organisation as well as the delivery of its services," Mr Yates said.
