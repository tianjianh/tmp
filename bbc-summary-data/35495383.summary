Derren Tomlinson, 44, also admitted sexual assault when he appeared at Shrewsbury Crown Court. He was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 21.
He was suspended from West Mercia Police in November 2014.
A 40-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting rape and bestiality was released with no further action, the force said.
Chf Supt Charles Hill said: "These abhorrent acts have understandably caused a huge amount of shock and distress.
"As soon as information regarding these offences came to light, Derren Tomlinson was arrested and a comprehensive investigation was launched in order to bring him to justice."
