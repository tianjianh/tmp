Former RAF Neatishead base relisted on eBay

A former RAF airbase has been relisted on internet auction site eBay for £2.5m after its first sale was withdrawn.

The base at Neatishead, Norfolk, was put up for auction last week and received one anonymous bid.
The offer was cancelled two hours before the sale ended after agent Nick Barlow said he "wasn't satisfied with the individual's funding".
However, he said he was optimistic the former World War II radar monitoring station would sell this time around.
The sale deadline has been extended until 18:00 GMT on 18 February.
The 25.5 acre (10.3 hectare) site, which opened in 1941, was decommissioned in 2005 and bought by Birmingham-based Stylespace a year later for a reported £4m, but it has proved unsuitable for their plans.
While the £2.5m price tag is described as a "substantial" reduction from its previous value, Mr Barlow, from Barlow Associates, stressed that serious bids would be needed.
There are 16 buildings on the site, including former radar rooms, tennis and squash courts, station headquarters and the old officers' mess.
