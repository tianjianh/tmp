Alex Farmer volunteered at a veterinary practice alongside her day job before starting the Whitby Wildlife Sanctuary.
The herring gull is the most common bird the sanctuary rescues, with vets often treating shot or poisoned birds.
Ms Farmer will receive her Animal Action Award from broadcaster Bill Oddie at the House of Lords on Tuesday.
The sanctuary cares for more than 300 animals and receives food donations from Whitby Fish Market and local shops.
The International Fund for Wildlife Rescue said the gull was a "much-maligned species which is often the target of cruelty".
Ms Farmer, 27, said: "The end goal for me is always to have a successful rehabilitation and release back into the wild.
"People often say don't you get sad to see them go when it's time for release, but that moment is the most rewarding of all."
