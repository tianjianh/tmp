Alex Blake hit an unbeaten 66 off 62 balls as Kent overcame a mid-innings collapse to beat Surrey by one wicket in a One-Day Cup thriller at Beckenham.

Kumar Sangakkara top-scored with 58 as Surrey, who reached the final in 2015, posted a total of 255-8.
Daniel Bell-Drummond made 56 in reply, but Kent then slumped from 111-1 to 115-5 in the space of four overs.
Sam Northeast helped add 72 with Blake, who hit the penultimate ball of the game for six to see Kent home.
The result was in the balance when James Tredwell was run out from the fourth ball of the final over, bowled by Tom Curran.
But Blake, who recently ended a Championship game with three successive sixes, kept his nerve to clear the rope again and seal victory.
It was rough luck on Sangakkara who, as well as his half-century, also took three crucial catches during Kent's innings, including both Joe Denly (38) and Bell-Drummond following a stand of 95.
Blake, however, had other ideas as the game followed the trend of the last three limited-overs meetings between Kent and Surrey, when the side which won the toss went on to lose.
Surrey head coach Michael di Venuto told BBC Radio London:
"I think the bowlers did a good job, especially when they were one for 100, to peg it back and give us a sniff, but a couple of guys played well at the end to get them over the line.
"We were short with the bat, there's no doubt about that. Guys looked good, but unfortunately didn't kick on.
"To play poorly and get 255 is an encouraging sign, but we should have been 280, 300 easily on that wicket."
