A small group with at least six cubs were discovered in the jungle.
They were filmed by conservationists using special camera traps, which are triggered using motion sensors.
Poaching and the loss of habitat has reduced the global population of this rare species to under 250.
Conservationists said the success was due to an increase in anti-poaching efforts in Thailand.
John Goodrich, tiger programme director at wild cat conservation group, Panthera, said, "The extraordinary rebound of eastern Thailand's tigers is nothing short of miraculous."
