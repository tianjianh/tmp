The smart tank has a camera that detects the fish's movements and makes it travel in the direction the fish is swimming.
Thomas De Wolf from Studio Diip, the company that invented it, says he wanted to bring fun back to technology.
The company are working on this version of the tank to protect the fish from becoming stressed if they go too fast.
