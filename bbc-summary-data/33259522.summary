Understanding Obamacare at the Supreme Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Don't have time to keep track of the Affordable Care Act lawsuit now at the Supreme Court? We break it down to the basics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, and ever since has been the subject of legal and legislative battles.
Now, the Supreme Court is set to decide on King v Burwell, a case that could put the law - also known as Obamacare - into a "death spiral" in much of the country.
It's complicated - and it's just one part of an even more complicated law. But to understand the basics, here are seven key points.
Yes. In 2012, justices ruled that the law, which requires that all Americans have health care, was constitutional. Many people thought that was that. They were wrong.
It's about four words in a 900-page law.
The ACA provides subsidies for those who can't afford to buy their own insurance but aren't poor enough to qualify for government care.
States were encouraged to set up online marketplaces, or exchanges, so residents could shop around for the best price. But lots of states who opposed the law didn't do that, so there's also a federal exchange, healthcare.gov.
The text of the law states that subsidies are available for anyone who gets care via exchanges "established by the State."
The people who wrote the law say this was just a case of sloppy language. They intended for anyone buying through an exchange - be it state or federal - to have access to subsidies.
But King, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case says, hey, the law is the law. And the way the law is written means people on the federal exchange aren't eligible for subsidies.
If the court rules for King, 6.4 million people on the federal exchange who can't afford their care will stop receiving subsidies to pay their monthly bills. This could happen as early as August. Those most likely to be affected are white, college-educated, employed southerners.
Without that subsidy - the average is more than $270 (Â£172) a month - most of those people are expected to drop their insurance coverage. But people who are really sick will probably keep it, because expensive insurance is still cheaper than the cost of medical care.
So the insurance companies will be paying for lots of expensive care without getting payments from healthy people who use very little care.
They would have to raise the cost of insurance to make ends meet - causing even more people to drop their coverage, until only the very sickest remain. That's the so-called death spiral.
'Death spiral' refers to the viability of the law and the economics of healthcare under it. It's not literal - hospitals will not start turning away people who show up with broken arms, or turning off life support for people who lose their insurance. They will, however, charge these people full price - which is a lot. Medical debt it the number one cause of bankruptcy in the US.
Legally, hospitals have to treat anyone who needs care. But people without insurance are going to be a lot less likely to seek out that care knowing they'll end up with a huge bill. They'll also skip check-ups, stop getting prescriptions filled and other smaller acts that can lead to bigger medical crises later on.
The loss of subsidies would be a huge mess - insurance companies and hospitals would find themselves in financial trouble, and millions of Americans would be without insurance.
The government dedicated a lot of money to helping states set up exchanges, but all that had to be awarded by the end of last year.
So low-income residents of states without exchanges (or who haven't started the process) will basically be excluded from a big part of Obamacare - while still having to pay taxes that go towards the law.
But the 2012 court decision determined that the ACA is the law of the land. So even if it's a mess, it's still legally binding until it's repealed by Congress and signed off by Obama. Not only is that practically impossible, it would mean kicking even more people off insurance, and reintroducing some conditions that voters hate - like keeping people with pre-existing conditions from purchasing insurance. It's political poison.
Actually, they're terrified. If King wins, the Obama administration has no recourse. It's up to Congress to fix the law.
Congressional Republicans don't like the ACA. Still, they don't want millions to lose insurance on their watch. But they don't have a cohesive plan in place should the subsidies disappear.
The easiest fix is just passing a bill to amend the language. But the ACA is so politically contentious that it probably won't happen.
Yes, and for the sake of the insurers, the patients, and the taxpayers, it will have to be.
July will be a mad scramble in Washington to get something done - which, judging by the Congressional track record, won't be easy.
