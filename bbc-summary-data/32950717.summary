Josh, who retired from the Beaufort Hunt earlier this year, was discovered on Saturday trapped in a thicket on a steep bank.
The 17.2-hand (1.7m)-high horse was rescued after sounds were heard coming from the bushes.
He was checked over and was "relatively unscathed", despite a few scratches.
The dark bay gelding's owners called police after he went missing from a field in Sherston, near Malmesbury, fearing he had been stolen.
Despite an intensive search and campaign on social media and in local newspapers Josh was nowhere to be seen.
Hayley Godwin, who had been helping the search, was called on Saturday morning with a possible lead.
She said to her "amazement and utter relief" she saw the old horse trapped in the thicket and unable to find his way out.
Following some "heavy work" by farmers Antony Tuck and Guy Bostock, the area was cleared and Josh was led out to safety.
Owner Lottie Bostock said: "It just goes to show you that not matter how hard and how long you look for there is always a possibility that what you are looking for is potentially right under your nose."
