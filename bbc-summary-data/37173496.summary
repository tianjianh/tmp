A former councillor from Pembrokeshire has been jailed for sending obscene text messages to a teenage girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Evans, 57, who was elected to Haverfordwest council in 2010, sent the girl messages without revealing his identity.
He admitted two offences of inciting a child to engage in sexual activities.
On Wednesday, Evans, of Haverfordwest, was jailed for 16 months at Swansea Crown Court.
The court heard two of the messages were sent before the girl's 16th birthday, with the victim discovering Evans' identity after researching his telephone number.
Robin Rouch, prosecuting, said the messages had upset the victim so much she failed to achieve the exam grades she had expected.
Jim Davis, representing Evans, said he had suffered extreme shame and embarrassment.
Judge Peter Heywood said he would be failing in his public duty if he did not send Evans to jail immediately.
"You blighted her life in what was an important school year," he said.
Evans was ordered to register as a sex offender for 10 years and, on his release from prison, he will be banned from working with children.
He was also made the subject of a restraining order banning him from contacting the girl.
