Walkers are being warned about a large crack which has appeared in cliffs near Weymouth on the Dorset coast.

Weymouth Coastguard said the fissure opened near Bowleaze Cove and Redcliff Point on Sunday afternoon.
The drop in the cracked section is just over 1m (3ft) but rock was still falling and could continue slipping, the coastguard said.
Coastguard officers are monitoring the area and have urged the public to heed any warning signs.
Robert Sansom, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: "The gap when it first opened up was a couple of inches but is now up to 3ft wide.
"Just because it has fallen away, it doesn't mean it's stable. It could continue slipping.
"Once every couple of years you get a large crack like this which opens up and is a real indicator of how easily our cliff lines erode away."
Geologists and Dorset County Council's rights of way officers are expected to assess the cliff later.
