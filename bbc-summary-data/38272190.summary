[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 2-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Ollie Watkins secured Exeter's first League Two home win of the season as they beat Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter took a deserved lead in the 19th minute when Lee Holmes got free down the left and pulled the ball back to Watkins, who guided the ball past Scott Shearer from 10 yards.
Holmes drilled a shot into the side netting as Exeter continued to create all the chances and the winger then curled another effort narrowly past the far post.
Mansfield boss Steve Evans was clearly unimpressed by his side's first-half performance and made a double change at the break.
Christy Pym made a brave stop to deny excellent substitute Darius Henderson, who was the catalyst for a vastly improved second-half performance from the Stags, while Jake Taylor dragged a shot wide for Exeter after an incisive counter-attack.
However, the Grecians ensured an end to their long wait for a win in the last minute when Watkins ran clear and fended off two defenders before sliding the ball past Shearer.
Mansfield's misery was compounded in stoppage time when Malvind Benning was sent off for a second yellow card.
