Hundreds of people have attended a memorial service in Hull for more than 6,000 trawlermen from the city who have been lost at sea.

The 24th annual Lost Trawlermen's Day service was held in a marquee close to the River Humber.
It is always held in January or February, when most trawlers were lost.
The loss of the Ross Cleveland, St Romanus and Kingston Peridot trawlers in just one month in 1968 were among incidents remembered at the event.
Supt Tracey Stephens, of the Fishermen's Mission charity, said it was important that families had somewhere to go to remember lost loved ones.
She said: "I am one of those family members who comes just in order to remember my uncle. We have nowhere to remember him and as we look out to sea we think of him."
Karl Turner, Labour MP for Hull East, said: "It's very important for people to get together and remember the fishermen of this city.
"We lost thousands of people in the fishing industry from going out to sea in shocking conditions."
The event, at the St Andrews Quay retail park near the Sailmakers' Arms, was designed to maintain Hull's fishing port heritage and remember the men who worked in such a dangerous occupation.
