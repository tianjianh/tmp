Wing George North says he is glad to have the "monkey off his back" as he returned in Wales' win over Ireland after five months out with concussion.

The 23-year-old Northampton player scored three tries in Wales' 61-20 win over Italy in the Six Nations in March.
And North is hoping he can repeat his form when Wales play their final World Cup warm-up game on Saturday.
"I can never score enough tries and if I can get one or two more that's brilliant," he said.
"It's my job to score tries and if I don't I get the finger pointed."
"This close to the World Cup you just want to concentrate on your job and that's my job. Touch wood it's going well and fingers crossed, it will carry on."
North earned his 50th Welsh cap in Dublin and is one of 10 players retained for the starting XV against Italy.
The Ireland match was his first for club or country since suffering concussion playing for Northampton Saints against Wasps on 27 March.
That incident was the fourth blow to the head the player had received in a five-month period.
He says the experience will not affect his approach to Saturday's game or the World Cup.
"After playing a full 80 minutes it was a monkey off my back, so to speak," he added.
"I knew everything I'd done properly, I'd ticked all the right boxes and I was fit and well and I know I can go out there and give it my all.
"And obviously I was delighted to be back playing on Saturday and get a good win out there as well."
North believes winning in Dublin was a huge boost for the Wales squad, but expects Italy to present a different challenge in Cardiff.
"Italy are coming off the back of a loss against Scotland, but from our point of view it's another match we've got to win," said North.
"The game plan was let's get it and play and hopefully that's what we'll do this weekend."
