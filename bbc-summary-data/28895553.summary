The internet trend involves people posting videos online of them having water poured over them. The aim is to raise money and awareness for charity.
McAvoy challenged both Mr Darling and First Minister Alex Salmond to take part.
Mr Salmond has confirmed he will do it, with a time and place to be confirmed.
In his online video, X-Men star McAvoy said football manager Jose Mourinho nominated him.
He said: "As it is the year of the Scottish referendum, I'd like to nominate our political champions Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond to do their very worst".
As the iced water poured over him, he said: "Alex/Alistair - you have got 24 hours".
On Friday afternoon Mr Darling tweeted: "Just took the #IceBucketChallenge for http://gordonsfightback.com . Video coming soon... Thanks James McAvoy."
Mr Salmond said: "I'm always up for any challenge, and I'm game for this one.
"It will invigorate me for the next month of campaigning - but the Scottish media should be careful what they wish for, as I get to nominate who's next for the ice bucket!"
The ice bucket challenge began in the US as a way of raising money for, and awareness of, ALS, a neurodegenerative disease.
In the UK people have been donating to a number of different charities including MacMillan Cancer Support.
Former US President George W Bush has taken the ice bucket challenge.
Many celebrities including David and Victoria Beckham, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have also been getting wet in aid of charity.
McAvoy, who is from Drumchapel in Glasgow, has previously said he knows how he will vote in the independence referendum but that he will not be revealing his decision.
In a BBC interview earlier this year, he said: "Whatever way my country votes I will be so happy to support that."
