The Raiders offensive lineman, 26, handed over the cheque, worth around Â£12,000 after tax, to Ava Urrea's father following the game.
The youngster suffers from hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
The Raiders won the game 26-24 to deny the Bills a play-off place.
The Touchdown Dreams programme, which helps ill children, arranged for Urrea to lead the Raiders team as captain for a day.
She received a signed helmet and autographed footballs from players as well as the cheque from Watson.
Watson was brought up in the Longsight area of Manchester before moving to the United States in 2009.
The former basketball player was drafted by the Raiders from Florida State University in April 2013.
