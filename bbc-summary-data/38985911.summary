The bodies, recovered on Tuesday near a creek in the US state of Indiana, were of Liberty German and Abigail Williams, post-mortem examinations confirmed.
The girls were reported missing when they failed to show up to a meeting point after a hike.
Police have yet to release a cause of death, citing an ongoing investigation.
The girls' bodies were discovered along the edge of Deer Creek, about a mile east of Delphi, Indiana.
They were found not far from an abandoned rail bridge where they had been dropped off to go hiking on Monday.
The pair were reported missing hours later, when they did not show at a predetermined meeting point.
Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby urged anyone with information to come forward.
"It is disturbing. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're confident of that," Mr Leazenby said during a news conference on Wednesday.
State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said there are no suspects, but authorities have received hundreds of leads.
