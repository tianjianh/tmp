[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A weather warning attached to Storm Abigail, the first storm to be officially named by the Met Office, has been upgraded from yellow to amber.

The amber "be prepared" warning covers the Western Isles, parts of Argyll and the north west Highlands and Orkney.
The Met Office said winds could gust to up to 90mph and forecasters said large waves could affect coastal areas.
A yellow "be aware" issued on Tuesday has also been updated and extended to cover the rest of Scotland.
The yellow warning covers from 18:00 on Thursday to 14:00 Friday and the amber from 21:00 on Thursday to midday on Friday.
It warns of gusts of up to 70mph, and possibly 90mph in exposed places. Rain and lightning have also been forecast for the next two days.
Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne said all Thursday's Mallaig to Armadale sailings have been cancelled because of the expected high winds.
Earlier this year the Met Office asked the public for suggestions for names for storms.
Abigail is the first storm to be officially named by the weather forecasting organisation.
