The Welshman's third mandatory title defence will be on a bill topped by Carl Frampton's WBA world featherweight title rematch with Leo Santa Cruz.
Selby wants to emulate UK fighters Lennox Lewis, Ricky Hatton, Joe Calzaghe and Amir Khan in Las Vegas.
"I always knew that's where I wanted to fight," said the 29-year-old.
"My mandatory challenger is experienced, dangerous and I will not take him lightly.
"I've had a strong training camp and I am 100 % focused on putting on a show for the American fans and the travelling fans."
Selby, from Barry in south Wales, is being lined-up to fight the winner of Frampton v Santa Cruz in 2017.
Northern Irishman Frampton claimed a points win over Santa Cruz of Mexico in July.
Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin defends his WBC lightweight title against Mikey Garcia of the United States in the third world title fight scheduled for the bill in January.
Selby had previously told the BBC he expected his next title defence to be in the USA.
