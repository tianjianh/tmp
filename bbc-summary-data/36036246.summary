Premier League predictions: Lawro v Idris Elba

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponents for this weekend's Premier League fixtures are actors Idris Elba and Richard Madden, who feature in new film 'Bastille Day'.
Elba, also the star of TV shows Luther and The Wire, took the lead in the predictions because former Game of Thrones actor Madden says he is "more of a rugby man".

London-born Elba is an Arsenal fan who says following the Gunners this season has been like watching a snooker player who cannot put away a pot.
"Some seasons are like pool games, when they are slotting them away," he told BBC Sport. "But others are like snooker matches, where you are going 'please, just put one in'.
"I think this has been a snooker season for us. It has just been very tough."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got seven correct results from 10 matches, with two perfect scores for a total of 130 points.
He beat Grand National jockey Leighton Aspell, who got five results correct, with one perfect score, for a total of 80 points.

Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Idris Elba's prediction: "Should Wenger stay or go? That is such a tough question. I think, considering his record, he stays. We see a different Arsenal if he goes. Yes, we might see an Arsenal that wins the Premier League but we do see a different team and I would be sad to see the back of him if I am honest. As for Palace, we will do them 4-0."
Match report
Stoke lost heavily at Anfield last week after drawing 2-2 with Swansea, but there is no way their manager Mark Hughes will just let things fizzle out after another really good season.
I still fancy Tottenham to win here, though. I was really impressed with them against Manchester United, not simply the fact they won 3-0 but because United looked bright and sharp early on yet never looked like scoring.

It was hard to see Spurs getting a grip on the game, so they were relying on their defence, but then it just happened for them at the other end.
That is why they are such a good side - they have players who can turn games around in a second.
Any other year, we would be saying they are the best team in the league, but Leicester look like beating them to the title.
Analysis: Why Tottenham title bid is just the start
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Idris Elba's prediction: "How would I feel if Tottenham win the title? I would be physically ill. Literally, I would be throwing up. Against Stoke, Spurs will have them, but I think it will be a good game." 3-2
