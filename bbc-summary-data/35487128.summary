New order could be final stop for Ballymena-built bus in London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The iconic London bus has become one of Northern Ireland's most famous products, but a new order could be the last.

Finance now approved, Boris Johnson is set to buy another 195 Routemaster double-deckers from Wrightbus.
It will mean the County Antrim firm will have supplied 1,000 of the vehicles, fulfilling the terms of a contract won in 2009.
At a cost of up to Â£350k per bus, it was a lucrative deal.
The out-going mayor had wanted 2,000 of the hybrid vehicles by 2020.
However, a new mayor, to be elected in May, could have different ideas.
Labour candidate Sadiq Khan recently called for a freeze on new orders.
His Liberal Democrat opponent, Caroline Pidgeon, claims, among other things, that the buses are too expensive.
As for Conservative Zac Goldsmith, his intentions have not been made public.
So expect the bus, which was used to launch the DUP's last Westminster election campaign, to become an election issue in itself.
Battery problems, for example, have undermined its green credentials.
Even if the project were to continue, Wrightbus would have to re-tender for another contract, in competition with other firms.
Scottish firm Alexander Dennis recently unveiled a model which mimics the Routemaster.
However, it is worth pointing out that Routemasters only represent a small part of the overall, profitable Wrightbus business.
So whatever the outcome, it is unlikely to signify another horror story in terms of Ballymena employment figures.
But while celebrating a new order, Northern Ireland could easily be giving a farewell toast to what has become the symbol of its manufacturing sector.
