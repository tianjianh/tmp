Real Madrid: Champions League glory for Gareth Bale would boost Welsh Euro 2016 bid

Wales have no concerns about Gareth Bale possibly playing in the Champions League final ahead of Euro 2016, says assistant manager Osian Roberts.

Bale's Real Madrid host Manchester City in the second leg of their semi-final on Wednesday, with the final on 28 May.
Wales have a training camp in Portugal in May and a friendly in Sweden on 5 June before their Euro 2016 opener against Slovakia on 11 June.
"We would rather Gareth gets to the final and wins it again," said Roberts.
"It would be a great achievement for him at such a massive club, and then he comes in and joins in with us and is raring to go for the Euros. That's the ideal situation."
Bale, 26, scored in Real's 2014 Champions League final win against Atletico Madrid to clinch the club's 10th European Cup.
This season has been his most productive for Real, scoring 19 La Liga goals for the Spanish giants, including four in his last three league games.
"Gareth has played a pivotal part for a few years now and, when he's had to step up in the last few weeks, he's certainly done that," Roberts told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"That's what great players do. I think he's having a great season."
Bale was an integral part of Wales' successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, scoring seven of their 11 goals in 10 matches.
He missed Wales' last three games - friendlies against the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and Ukraine - and Chris Coleman's side failed to win any of those fixtures.
Asked if he was worried Bale could get injured before the end of the season, Roberts said: "They are uncontrollables. We can't control them so there's no point worrying about them.
"He's in great form, a key player for Real Madrid. As far as Gareth is concerned, we wish him all the best.
"It's great for Welsh football we've got someone playing at that level and achieving at that level."
