Leone Nakarawa's try and three Ben Volavola penalties in Nuku'alofa saw Fiji confirmed as the top Oceania qualifier.

The last remaining spot will be taken by the winner of the Americas 2 qualifier between Canada and Uruguay.
It will be the fourth successive World Cup that Wales have faced Fiji in the group stage.
