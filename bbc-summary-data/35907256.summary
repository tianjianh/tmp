Hadley won 15 caps for Canada between 1987 and 1994 and played at the 1991 World Cup, helping his country to their best-ever finish as they reached the quarter-finals.
Hadley captained the national side and played for Bedford and the Barbarians.
"Big Norm was a giant," said Al Charron, a former Canada team-mate. "He was a presence on and off the field."
"Norm was one of the funniest and smartest guys I have had the pleasure of  playing rugby with," he added.
