[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A violent paedophile who made a "hidey hole" in his home to conceal a girl he was abusing has been convicted of a string of sex crimes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Dunn, from Redcar, knocked through the wall behind his fridge to create a cavity to hide the runaway girl from police.
Teesside Crown Court heard the 57-year-old had raped and abused four girls over a period of several years.
He was convicted of 10 rapes, false imprisonment and indecent assault.
The court was told Dunn was "paranoid, controlling and short tempered".
Prosecutor Richard Bennett said if any of his victims challenged him "they suffered physically" and "he had sex when he wanted".
They "were in his thrall and felt almost powerless" against their "paranoid and short-tempered" abuser.
He said: "Michael Dunn is a violent, controlling and sexually abusive man."
The court heard Dunn would use a bag of dust and a panel to camouflage the hole where one girl was kept, concealing her from police on eight or nine occasions.
The girl had already been the victim of sexual abuse, having been raped and beaten by another man.
The jury was told he imprisoned a second female victim, subjecting her to repeated violence, and filled his house with cameras, locks and alarms.
He also groomed and sexually assaulted another vulnerable under-age girl, giving her alcohol and cigarettes, and raped another pre-teenage girl.
Dunn was also convicted of three charges of false imprisonment and three charges of indecent assault.
He was cleared of one charge of rape, one of making a threat to kill and one of grievous bodily harm.
After the hearing, Det Sgt Dave Pettrick of Cleveland Police, said: "This was an extremely complex and difficult inquiry which spanned many years.
"Essentially Dunn groomed several women and young girls, in some cases making them completely dependent on him, and carrying out sexual offences against all of them.
"Some of the victims were kept in line through Dunn's extreme violence or even through the fear of violence and he had complete and absolute control over their lives."
He will be sentenced at a later date.
