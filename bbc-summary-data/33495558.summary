Greece debt crisis: Difficult times on Syriza's doorstep

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Greece's economy has declined, drug use and prostitution has become a common sight around Omonia Square in downtown Athens.

It is not where you would expect to find the main offices of a country's ruling political party.
But left-wing Syriza still has its headquarters nearby, in a show of solidarity with the poor and the vulnerable that it pledged to protect when it came to power.
The sun is beating down, and as eurozone finance ministers discuss the Greek government proposals in Brussels, people here seem to be feeling the heat.
Vasilis Papadopoulos, 24, backed Syriza in Sunday's referendum and voted "No".
But with further austerity measures lined up in the government's latest offer, he has decided it is time to leave his country.
The 24-year-old accountant has applied for a university course in the UK because "I have the feeling that nothing is changing here".
He says he does not regret voting "No", but that he now has to "live with the consequences".
And the consequences so far seem to be a different package of spending cuts and tax hikes.
"I read the terms," he says. "They are really harsh."
The proposals got the backing of the Greek parliament in the early hours of Saturday, although some Syriza members voted against the plan or abstained.
Experts say this left Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras under pressure over his parliamentary majority, and a government reshuffle is likely on Monday.
Isabella Drakopoulou, a waitress who lives in Omonia, says she hopes Greece will get a better deal after Sunday's referendum result, but she is not convinced these proposals will deliver it.
"I think everyone is expecting it to be hard," she says.
"Maybe if all the hard things come now, after 10 years it will get better here."
But so far Isabella, 24, has only seen things getting worse in this area, amid crumbling public healthcare and social services.
"The drug abuse here is getting out control," she says.
"Living in Athens, it makes me sad to see people in such terrible situations."
Whatever the outcome in Brussels, Syriza will have to bring the result back here to Athens.
And then the politicians will have to deal with the destitution on their doorstep.
