Mersey Ferries played a key role in the World War One action - the original Daffodil and Iris ferries acted as landing crafts and tug boats.
Both ferries came under heavy fire but they returned to Merseyside battered yet still intact.
A service was held at Seacombe Ferry Terminal and onboard the Royal Daffodil.
The ferries were awarded the title Royal by King George as a result of their role.
Neil Scales, chief executive of Merseytravel, said: "We should never forget those who lost their lives at Zeebrugge nor the bravery of the crews of our own ferries who took part.
"It was an action that saw vicious hand to hand fighting, incredible heroism and the award of 200 medals for gallantry, including eight Victoria Crosses.
"The Mersey Ferries and the Royal Marines forged an historic link at Zeebrugge that should never be forgotten."
Former Royal Marines who died in the past year were also remembered during the service. Floral tributes and the ashes of those who had died were cast into the Mersey.
