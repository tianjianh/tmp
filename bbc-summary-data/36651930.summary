Dickinson, 29, was Vale's captain and made 143 appearances during a three-year spell at the club.
He links up again with former Vale team-mate Richard Duffy, who joined Notts earlier this week from Eastleigh.
"I'm really looking forward to it and can't wait to get going," Dickinson told the Magpies' website.
"I'm a leader. I like to be loud in the dressing room and get the lads going.
"I'm hardworking, wear my heart on my sleeve and give everything, day in, day out."
Dickinson has also had spells at Watford and Stoke City during his career.
He was one of 13 out-of-contact players offered a pay cut by Vale, with several opting to move on.
