[SN]TITLE[SN]
Marine House in Rosemarkie to close in May

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A struggling care home in Rosemarkie is to shut at the end of May, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Serious failings were identified by the Care Inspectorate at Marine House in November 2013.
An improvement notice was lifted earlier this year, but the inspectorate said they were continuing to work with the operators RDS Healthcare.
The firm has now given formal written confirmation giving 13 weeks notice that the home will be closing.
There are 16 people at the home and NHS Highland said it was trying to accommodate them elsewhere.
In 2013, inspectors said residents were not being assessed properly to see if they were suffering from malnutrition and dehydration.
They also said there were not enough qualified staff on duty.
