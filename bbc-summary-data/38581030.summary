The FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up 15.02 points, or 0.21%, at 7,290.49.
Mining giant Anglo American led the list of gainers, rising 3.8%, while retailer Dixons Carphone gained 3.6%.
Supermarket chain Sainsbury's added 1% after a positive update on its Christmas trading, but its rivals fared less well, with Morrisons falling 2.6%.
"The real positive [for Sainsbury's] comes from Argos, which delivered a show-stopping 4.1% leap in like-for-like sales, confirming just what an important strategic acquisition this was for the supermarket," said Neil Wilson from ETX Capital.
The FTSE 100's latest closing record high has extended what was already the longest such streak in history.
In other company news, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey reported a 4% jump in home completions last year, to 13,881. It said customers continued to "benefit from a wide range of mortgage products and low interest rates with customer confidence remaining robust".
Its shares were down by 2.5%.
On the currency markets, the pound slipped 0.44% against the dollar to $1.2125 and against the euro it was little changed at â‚¬1.1540.
