More than 1,000 London bus drivers and engineers are set to strike in a row over rosters, with disruption expected to hit Notting Hill Carnival.

Unite members from Tower Transit will stage two, 24-hour strikes on Friday and Bank Holiday Monday.
The strike is expected to affect 28 routes in the east and west of the capital, including those around the annual carnival.
Transport for London said it hoped the dispute would be resolved quickly.
The strikes will begin at 00:01 and end at 23:59 on both days, hitting both day and night bus services.
The union said the second strike, scheduled for Bank Holiday Monday, would be "disrupting Notting Hill carnivalgoers planning to travel by bus".
Unite's regional officer Simon McCartney said the action was being brought over late changes to the rosters which had left its members "out of pocket and rearranging their family life" and incorrect rest day payments.
He added: "Tower Transit bus workers have reached breaking point over an increasingly belligerent management who have turned their back on constructive consultation and dialogue."
Transport for London said Tower Transit operated less than 5% of the bus network
Mike Weston, its director of buses, said: "I'm sorry that some of our customers may face disruption to their usual routes.
"We're also encouraging Tower Transit and Unite to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible to avoid disruption to passengers' journeys."
He advised passengers to check its website for updates.
