They used a ladder and net to catch the animal which was unable to swim to safety due to fast flowing water north of Edzell.
A concerned member of the public had contacted the Scottish SPCA after spotting it on the river.
The ferret is currently being cared for at the charity's rescue and rehoming centre at Petterden.
Animal Rescue Officer Coreen Hill said: "The ferret had been seen for three days prior to us being called out on 1 September.
"At that time the ferret had been sun bathing and the area had a slight rock formation where he had been sleeping and looked to be under no stress.
"Since they can swim I decided to check back in the morning and assess the situation.
When Coreen returned on 2 September the rock was surrounded by very fast flowing water.
She then asked colleague Ben Soutar to help her rescue the ferret.
She added: "By the time I returned with Ben the ferret had woken up and was furiously trying to escape from the rock, but was unable to do so due to the fast flowing water.
"We placed a ladder over the rocks and my colleague stretched over to try and encourage the ferret to pop into the net.
"After much persuasion the ferret hopped into the net and was moved to safety. He was very happy to be rescued and taken to our centre in Petterden for much needed food and sleep.
"We will look after him until we can discover his original owner or find him a loving new home."
