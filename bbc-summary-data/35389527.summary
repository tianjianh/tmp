Williamson capitalised on Frazer Shaw's tame back pass to round O's keeper Alex Cisak and slot the ball home.
The visitors struck again through Williamson's low drive before Orient pulled one back through substitute Armand Gnanduillet's neat finish.
Jimmy Spencer buried Williamson's cross on his debut to seal victory for the U's, who climb to 11th in League Two.
Nolan had started with two victories for the O's after being appointed on 21 January. His side drop three places back to ninth, two points above Cambridge.
Leyton Orient player-manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London:

"We were very sloppy. You don't want to gift a side who've come to your turf a goal and that's what we did.
"I've said to the lads, when you're playing at this level you can't afford to make mistake after mistake after mistake because if you do that you're going to get punished and we did.
"I don't think it was through Cambridge's great play, I think it was through us not doing what we've done over the last two games."
