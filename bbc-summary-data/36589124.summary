Blaine Hudson: Chester sign defender following Wrexham release

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester manager Jon McCarthy has made his first signing by bringing in central defender Blaine Hudson, following his release by Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hudson's arrival on a one-year contract can help counter balance the potential loss of Ian Sharps and Ben Heneghan.
Hudson, 24, was released after helping Wrexham finish eighth in the National League, nine places above Chester.
Chester have also confirmed that former Wrexham left-back Johnny Hunt, 25, has agreed a new one-year deal.
Hunt follows the lead of Luke George, Kane Richards,James Alabi and Jordan Chapell in signing new contracts.
Chester suffered a blow earlier this month when John Rooney, brother of England captain Wayne Rooney, turned down the offer of a new contract to move the other way across the Welsh border and join Wrexham.
New manager Jon McCarthy, who was appointed as Steve Burr's successor in May, has also lost 22-goal top scorer Ross Hannah to Barrow,
But two more signings are expected to be announced at Bumpers Lane in the next week.
Former Cambridge United and Welling United player Hudson scored seven times in 69 games in his two seasons at the Racecourse Ground.
Veteran centre-half Sharps, who has been appointed as McCarthy's number two, will retain his playing registration, but only for emergencies.
