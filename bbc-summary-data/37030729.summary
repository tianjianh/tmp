There was initial alarm when it was thought the damage was caused by gunfire.
A few of the dozen people on board suffered minor cuts.
The bus was travelling between the Deodoro hockey venue and the main press centre at Barra da Tijuca.
"There was a popping, cracking noise," said a photographer from the UK's Press Association.
"The bus didn't come to a stop but paused. Everyone was on the floor so I got on the floor as well."
A police escort quickly arrived and accompanied the bus back to the press centre.
"The two windows did not shatter immediately but one of them shattered as we drove along the motorway," the photographer added.
It is unknown who threw the stones at the bus.
