Buckfast monks make record £8.8m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monks who make Buckfast tonic wine linked to violent crime in Scotland raked in a record £8.8m in a year.

Sales of the caffeine-fuelled wine made at Buckfast Abbey in Devon make up most of the income to its charitable trust.
A Scottish sheriff said last week there was a "very definite association between Buckfast and violence".
The abbey said it was "saddened" by the "judge's opinion" that a "small number of people in Scotland are not enjoying Buckfast in a responsible way".
Figures from the Charity Commission showed Buckfast Abbey Trust's income was £8.8m in 2014-15, the latest year for which figures are available.
More on the 'violent wine', and other news
The caffeinated wine, sometimes known as Bucky, has been made at the Benedictine abbey since the 1920s.
The abbey trust is a shareholder in the wine's distributor and seller, J Chandler, based in Hampshire, and gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold.
The monks have invested millions of pounds in the restoration of the abbey and visitor facilities and have also earmarked £3m for updating its 33-bedroom hotel and its conference centre.
The abbey declined to give figures for income directly from wine sales, saying it was "commercially sensitive" and said the hotel and conference centre "also contributed to the increase in income".
It also said the trust "strives to work with J Chandler and Co to ensure that the tonic wine is marketed and distributed responsibly".
"The majority of people who drink the tonic wine do so responsibly," it said, adding that it supported charities such as Drinkaware.
Last week Dundee Sheriff Court heard about an attack on a boy by a teenager who had downed two-and-a-half bottles of the caffeinated tonic wine.
Sheriff Alastair Brown told the court: "Someone who drinks two-and-a-half bottles of Buckfast is drinking something which is often seen as a feature of cases involving violence.
"I'm aware that the monks of Buckfast Abbey advertise this as something to be taken in moderation.
"The fact is that some people drink far too much of it and get violent."
Between 2010 and 2012, Strathclyde Police said Buckfast was mentioned in almost 6,500 crime reports.
Alcohol Focus Scotland, the national charity on preventing alcohol-related harm, said consumption of Buckfast was "very small" compared with overall alcohol consumption in Scotland.
But there was "increasing international evidence about the specific risks associated with caffeinated alcoholic drinks", said chief executive Alison Douglas.
"We know from police figures that Buckfast is mentioned in thousands of anti-social behaviour and crime reports in certain parts of the country," she said.
Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (SHAAP) said it was concerned a focus on caffeinated alcoholic drinks, and specifically Buckfast, "might encourage complacency about other products".
Eric Carlin, SHAAP director, said there was a "need for changes in drinking behaviours of many people across all of our communities".
Police declined to comment further.
