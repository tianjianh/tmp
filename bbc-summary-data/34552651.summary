[SN]TITLE[SN]
ITV2 to pay £4m damages to Andre producer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
ITV2 has been ordered by the High Court to pay more than £4m damages in a case involving Peter Andre's reality show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ruling followed the court's rejection last week of Mr Andre's claims of death threats from Neville Hendricks, producer of his TV show.
ITV cut ties with Mr Hendricks for breach of contract as a result.
But, calling Mr Andre an "extremely unsatisfactory witness", the court said  ITV2 would have to pay "substantial" damages to Mr Hendricks' company.
Mr Hendricks was seeking damages for lost profits of up to £7m.
His company, Mr H TV, produced Mr Andre's The Next Chapter series and Here To Help, along with Kerry Katona's reality projects, working closely with the singers' manager Claire Powell, head of CAN Associates.
Ms Powell and Mr Hendricks' had what was described as an on-off relationship, sharing a son together, before an acrimonious split in 2011.
Ms Powell's relationship with Kerry Katona also broke down, amid false rumours she was having an affair with Mr Hendricks. He believed the rumours were being spread by Ms Powell.
Around the same time, Mr Hendricks set up a Twitter account from which he tweeted or engaged in conversations giving intimate details of Mr Andre and Ms Powell's private lives "in the most scurrilous and vitriolic terms," said the judge.
Mr Andre's solicitors wrote to Mr H TV, saying he "wanted no further dealings" with the company.
The judge said the letter was "almost certainly" responsible for ITV2 terminating its agreement with the production company.
ITV2 also wanted to terminate its contract over a proposal that Kerry Katona would appear on Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5, claiming it breached an exclusivity clause.
Mr Justice Flaux called Mr Hendricks "an honest witness" and a respected producer of a "particular genre of television, which in a very real sense, he had devised".
He also dismissed Mr Andre's accusations that the tweets constituted a real threat, although they were "offensive and expressed in foul language".
