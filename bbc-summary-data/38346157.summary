Cardiff and Vale University Health Board confirmed it had shut the mental health wards to prevent further spread of the virus.
The health board said a number of cases had been confirmed in the community, including in care homes.
Dr Tom Porter urged anyone eligible to get a free flu vaccine to reduce risk.
He said: "Every year flu causes thousands of deaths across the UK and vaccination is a quick and effective way of reducing your risk."
The dominant strain circulating in the community is influenza A (H3), which particularly affects the elderly.
