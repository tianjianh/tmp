When Miss World contestants are asked what they would like to do, they often say help with world peace.

Now Miss Israel has updated this idea with a selfie.
Doron Matalon grabbed a photo with Miss Lebanon and posted it on Instagram and on the face of it, everyone seemed happy to be there.
Miss Lebanon, Saly Greige, was not impressed though and said she'd been photobombed.
The two countries, represented by Saly and Doron, have been technically at war for years.
Miss Lebanon took to Instagram to distance herself from the photo.
She posted her own version of the picture minus her fellow contestant.
Saly Greige said: "I was having a photo with Miss Japan, Miss Slovenia, suddenly Miss Israel jumped in and took a selfie, and uploaded it on her social media.
"This is what happened and I hope to have your full support in the Miss Universe contest."
Doron Matalon used Instagram to make her point of view clear.
"Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game, only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighbouring country."
A simple selfie has come to sum up years of conflict and unease between the two countries.
So why is Miss Lebanon so unhappy having her photo being taken with her Israeli competitor?
The two countries are in a state of heightened tension or "cold war," and it's been like that for a long time.
"Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to expel Palestinian militants who were based there, and only withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000," says Alison Baily, who's a Middle East expert for the researchers Oxford Analytica.
She adds: "It's a very live issue, because of that history, and because of the ongoing conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. That's key to the story really.
"Lebanon is home to Hezbollah - a militant group which backs the Palestinians and that threatens Israel.
"Both countries feel threatened by each other. The Lebanese feel threatened because of the war between Lebanon and Israel.
"Israel feels threatened by Hezbollah who pride themselves on being a credible and real threat to Israel."
Alison told Newsbeat that there's a lot of sensitivity.
"It's about patriotism. The risk of conflict is ever present and that means there is always tension between Lebanon and Israel."
It's been a big story in both contestant's home countries.
The Lebanese paper the Daily Star reported that some "some Lebanese asked that Greige be stripped of her title for mingling with the citizen of an enemy state".
The story is making headlines in Israel too. The Jerusalem Post said there had been "a harsh backlash against Greige".
What may have started as a picture on social media has snowballed into something much bigger.
So has a simple selfie summed up the Middle East?
On the face of it a picture of four Miss World competitors can't really do that.
There's been decades of division and it's far too complicated.
However, all the confusion and anger provoked by the image certainly reflects the tension in the region.
