Devon & Cornwall and Cumbria police criticised on shared intelligence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Devon and Cornwall Police and Cumbria Police have been criticised over sharing intelligence on organised crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inspectors found the two forces had not integrated into Regional Organised Crime Units (Rocu).
Rocu were created in 2010 to tackle serious crime such as drugs trafficking.
Devon and Cornwall Police said it had concerns about the south west Rocu but it would be joining up in the new year.
The HMIC said after an inspection this year that lack of integration by the forces meant ability to "provide a comprehensive, single intelligence picture for their respective regions is impaired".
It added the forces were "unable to benefit fully from the regional intelligence capability which is available".
Ch Supt John Vellacott of Devon and Cornwall Police's major crime team said: "The purpose of intelligence is to keep people safe and the idea is that we get that intelligence speedily so we are able to respond to it effectively.
"We were concerned that we wouldn't get the intelligence as speedily as we would like.
"We have negotiated with the regional unit and we are now in a position where we can say we will be joining the Rocu intelligence function in the new year."
Please see our below response for detective superintendent Andrew Slattery:
Det Supt Andrew Slattery, director of intelligence at Cumbria Constabulary, said the force "actively participates in the funding and management" of the North West Rocu and "confidential intelligence handling processes between Cumbria Constabulary and Rocu are currently being reviewed in light of the HMIC report".
