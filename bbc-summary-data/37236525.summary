Colclough, 21, joined the Latics from Crewe in January and scored two goals in 10 appearances to help them win promotion to the Championship.
He joins on a season-long loan while defender Hendry, also 21, has signed until January 2017.
Hendry joined Wigan in September 2015 and had a loan spell at Shrewsbury Town last season.
"Ryan's somebody who I tried to sign last season and has been one of our main targets for six months," Dons boss Karl Robinson told the club website.
Latics manager Gary Caldwell told his club's website: "I know our players will be looked after at a good club with a good manager and we will be keeping tabs on both [of them]."
