Magic Light Pictures, the producers behind The Gruffalo, will adapt the stories.
The collection of six rhymes, which retell classic fairytales with different twists and endings, were written by Dahl in 1982.
David Walliams, Tamsin Greig, Dominic West and Rob Brydon will voice characters in the programmes.
Revolting Rhymes will be shown as two half-hour films that weave together five of Dahl's rhymes - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Three Little Pigs, Jack and the Beanstalk and Cinderella.
Walliams and Brydon will voice the Ugly Sisters as well as Jack's mother and the King respectively, while Gemma Chan will voice Snow White and Dominic West will play the Wolf.
In a statement, West said: "The incredible poems written by Roald Dahl have been beautifully brought to life by the production team and I was delighted to take part in the project. I look forward to enjoying them with the family this Christmas."
Walliams added: "I absolutely loved working on these films. I'm a massive fan of Dahl's work and to be able to voice his characters was a real treat".
The voice cast also features Bertie Carvel, Bel Powley and Isaac Hempstead Wright, while Rose Leslie will voice Red Riding Hood.
