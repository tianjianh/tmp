[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the world's best known steam locomotives - the Flying Scotsman - is making a tour to the south coast.

The special train's run saw it steam through the Thames Valley, arriving in Salisbury shortly before midday.
It made a round-trip via Southampton back to Salisbury, where it was expected to leave just before 18:30 BST to head back to London via Basingstoke.
British Transport Police (BTP) have urged the public to stay back from the railway.
The locomotive was expected back at London Paddington shortly before 21:40.
Earlier this year, dozens of other services were delayed by people encroaching on the track when the famous engine travelled from London to York.
The tour to the south coast was in doubt after the locomotive developed a mechanical problem with its injectors.
It was unable to travel from York to London on Thursday, with the run made with a diesel engine instead.
Built in Doncaster in 1923, Flying Scotsman pulled the first train to break the 100mph barrier in 1934.
The National Railway Museum in York bought the locomotive for Â£2.3m in 2004 before work got under way on its decade-long, Â£4m restoration.
