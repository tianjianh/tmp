Two men have been convicted of drugs offences as part of an inquiry into the death of a 28-year-old man who took steroids at a gym in Buckinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Cleathero died in October 2012 at the Apollo Gym in High Wycombe after taking dinitrophenol (DNP).
Peter Purkins, 48, of Hazelmere and Jason King, 43, of Great Missenden, were found guilty of conspiracy to produce and supply class C steroids.
The are due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in London on 24 July.
King was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice following the month-long trial.
DNP is an industrial chemical not suitable for human consumption, but it is sometimes used as a fat-burning substance, the court heard.
Following the verdict, Mr Cleathero's mother Sharon Ayres said she took "some comfort" with the convictions.
"I hope this highlights the dangers and deters other people from supplying class C anabolic steroids and also DNP," she said.
Det Sgt Paul Quinton, from Thames Valley Police, said: "I hope this [conviction] will act as a deterrent to those who may consider supplying similar substances and they understand there can be very serious consequences for all those involved.
"I hope similar tragedies can be avoided in the future."
Purkins and King were cleared of the manslaughter of Mr Cleathero at a trial in 2014.
Two other defendants were sentenced in connection with the case last year at the Old Bailey.
Jamie Chivers, 35, of Spring Gardens Road in High Wycombe, was also found not guilty of manslaughter in 2014, but sentenced to three years in jail after admitting to perverting the course of justice and production and supply of class C drugs.
Laura Hague, 24, of Gerrards Cross, was jailed for two years after being found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to supply class C drugs.
