[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Centuries from Paul Stirling and England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan guided Middlesex to a six-wicket One-Day Cup win against Kent.

Stirling (112) and Morgan (103 not out) added 214 for the third wicket as Middlesex chased down 239 with ease.
Kent's under par 238-7 owed much to Sean Dickson (99) and Darren Stevens (61) sharing 135 for the third wicket.
Dickson agonisingly fell one short of a century on his List A debut as he chopped on a delivery from Steven Finn.
Kent were in trouble early on at 12-2 with Finn, omitted from England's side for the second Test against Pakistan, taking a spectacular return catch to dismiss captain Sam Northeast.
Once Dickson and Stevens were separated, the visitors struggled to get on top of Middlesex's bowlers as Finn (2-31) and Tim Murtagh (2-28) led from the front.
In reply, Middlesex were reduced to 16-2 when Ryan Higgins and Nick Gubbins fell cheaply, but Kent were forced to wait another 39 overs before making another breakthrough.
Morgan and Stirling reached three figures in almost identical time. Ireland international Stirling got there first in 118 balls before Morgan followed off 116 balls.
Stirling and George Bailey were both dismissed late on, but Middlesex's third win in five games came with 31 balls to spare.
Middlesex all-rounder Paul Stirling told BBC Radio London:
"It was nice to build a partnership and once we got in, we just went on and kept going and the landmarks kept coming up.
"I've felt in pretty good nick most of the year and I'm just happy to go on and get some runs.
"I've had a lot of starts, it's something I've always tried to work on and thankfully it came off today. I'm happy with where my game is at the minute."
England one-day captain Eoin Morgan:
"Kent managed to get the ball moving around a bit, so it was a bit tricky to begin with.
"The way Paul plays his innings, he always manages to apply pressure regardless of what the ball's doing.
"To get such a substantial partnership when only chasing 238 really knocks the game on the head."
