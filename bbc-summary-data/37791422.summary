Shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz joked that cries of "Don't panic! Don't panic!" were being heard around 10 Downing Street as the government tries to organise its policies on Brexit.
Commons Leader David Lidington speculated that his Labour opposition "don't like it up 'em'".
Mr Perry, who also created sitcom Hi-de-Hi, died on Sunday aged 93.
During the business statement, Ms Vaz said she grew up watching Dad's Army, adding: "It struck me that you could hear those catchphrases ringing around Number 10, so we hear the cry of 'Don't panic! Don't panic!'
"Or as the Prime Minister slaps down her recalcitrant and wayward colleagues you can hear her muttering 'stupid boys'.
"When you ask their position on Brexit, the infamous 'don't tell 'em Pike!'."
Mr Perry worked with the late producer David Croft and the pair were also responsible for It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord?
Commons Leader David Lidington also paid tribute to Mr Perry, who often wrote the theme tunes to his shows.
He said: "I thought it was a wonderful gesture when outside Buckingham Palace earlier this week the military band in the changing of the guards ceremony played the theme tune to Dad's Army as a tribute.
"But I do think when I look across at the Opposition, in particular when I look at their faces during Prime Minister's Questions, the phrase that comes into my mind is 'they don't like it up 'em'."
The SNP's Commons leader Pete Wishart also chipped in, saying: "I would hate to say that we are all doomed but perhaps we are under this particular Government."
TV references also came up in the Commons on Wednesday at Prime Minister's Questions when Jeremy Corbyn likened Theresa May's plan for the UK leaving the UK as one of Baldrick's "cunning plans" from the Blackadder series.
