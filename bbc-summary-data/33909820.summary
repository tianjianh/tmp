The 24-year-old right-back, who has 16 caps for the Black Stars, has signed a three-year contract with Augsburg.
Augsburg managing director Stefan Reuter told the club's website: "Daniel is a young, talented player who has already gained match practice at various clubs in Europe.
"But we are sure that his development is not yet complete."
Opare said: "I look forward to the challenge of playing with the FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga. I only heard good things from Baba Rahman."
However Opare may not get the chance to play his club football alongside fellow Ghanaian Rahman, who is a target for English Premier League club Chelsea.
