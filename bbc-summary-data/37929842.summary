The 34-year-old centre-back rejoined the Gunners from Lincoln Ladies in January 2014, having previously played for Arsenal between 1999 and 2002.
She helped the north London side win the FA Women's Cup in 2014 and 2016, and the Continental Cup in 2015.
Stoney scored one goal in 18 appearances in Women's Super League One this year.
Arsenal finished third in the table after winning 5-3 at Liverpool on Sunday.
"I'm sorry I never got the chance to say goodbye" tweeted Stoney, who was appointed an MBE in 2015. "But I would like to say a big thank you to my team-mates and all the amazing fans for all your support.
"Looking forward to my next chapter."
