The music producer told a Los Angeles judge that he is not getting proper medical treatment while in custody.
The 49-year-old appeared in court early on Monday and was taken to a hospital the same morning.
Marion "Suge" Knight has pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges after it's claimed he hit two men with his truck, killing one, on 29 January.
He's being held without bail.
David Kenner has been representing Knight since the case was first filed, but the founder of Death Row Records told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Brandlin that he has "fired" the lawyers.
Knight faces life in prison if convicted of killing Terry Carter, 55, during an row at a Compton burger stand in late January.
Kenner has claimed Knight was ambushed, but that hasn't been said in court yet.
Knight claims he is blind in one eye and has about 15% vision in the other.
This is the third time that he has been taken to hospital from court since he was charged with murder in early February.
Last year he says he was shot six times and has a blood clot in his lungs along with other medical complications.
He also told the judge that he lost weight as a result of his injuries.
Brandlin transferred Knight's case to another judge but he left for medical care before his case could be called in Judge Ronald Coen's courtroom.
Kenner told the judge that Knight has been jailed for too long and there should be a hearing to set bail as soon as possible.
Knight's next hearing will be on 9 March, although a bail hearing may not happen until 20 March.
