[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The daughter of a man whose disappearance in 1992 is being treated as murder has appealed for information.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Schallamach disappeared from Southampton, and police took the step this week of naming two convicted killers as murder suspects.
The 53-year-old's daughter Karen asked for help to enable the family to "bring him home and lay him to rest".
Kenneth Regan and William Horncy, who killed a family-of-five, are suspected of killing him.
Ms Schallamach said: "Whoever was responsible for his disappearance tried to cover up for their crime to create the impression he had just left us but we knew that wasn't the case, he would never have done that.
"He loved us and doted on his grandchildren who were forced to grow up without their grandfather around.
"We need to know what happened to him and where he is, so if it is possible, we can bring him home and lay him rest."
Hampshire Constabulary has said the disappearance of Mr Schallamach bears striking similarities to the murder of five members of the Chohan family, which Regan and Horncy were convicted of in 2005 and ordered to serve whole-life terms.
Mr Schallamach's wife Yvonne, received a letter from someone who claimed she had run off with the grandfather of two, which police regard as similar to a letter to business partners and family of Mr Chohan that suggested the family had fled back to India.
The last person to see Mr Schallamach alive, "by his own admission", was Kenneth Regan, police said.
Regan and Horncy murdered Armajit Chohan, his 25-year-old wife Nancy, their two young sons - 18-month-old Devinder and two-month-old Ravinder - and Mrs Chohan's 51-year-old mother Charanjit Kaur in a bid to steal his freight business and use it as a front for importing drugs.
