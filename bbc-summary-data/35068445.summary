Suzette Jordan, a single mother of two girls, was picked up from the busy Park Street as she came out of a night club.
She died in March this year from a deadly form of meningitis.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had called her a liar.
Ms Banerjee's comments that Jordan was trying to make the government look bad had outraged both Kolkata residents and the media.
The three men have the right to appeal the sentence in a higher court.
Two other accused are still on the run, though Interpol red corner notices have been issued for them, writes BBC Bengali's Amitabha Bhattasali in Kolkata.
Jordan was picked up on 6 February by the rapists who offered her a lift home as she came out of a night club.
For the next several hours, she was gang-raped inside the moving car and was thrown out during the early hours of the morning.
The case is widely known as the Park Street rape case.
Initially, the police were reluctant to accept the complaint, but when the media started reporting the incident, an inquiry was initiated.
Though India's laws prohibit the disclosure of the identity of a rape victim and those guilty of doing so can be sent to prison for up to two years and fined, Jordan came out in the open a year after the incident.
"I am a victim, I have been raped. Why should I hide my face? The rapists should hide their face instead," she told the BBC in an interview..
She also counselled other sexual harassment victims and later took up a project to sensitise school children, parents and teachers about sexual harassment.
