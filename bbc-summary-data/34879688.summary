Bath back Anthony Watson believes his side can win the European Champions Cup this season.

They take on Leinster on Saturday in what is their first pool game following last Sunday's postponement in Toulon following the Paris attacks.
"I'd be lying if I said we didn't think we could win it," Watson told BBC Radio Bristol. "We've got everything we need to be able to do it.
"It's about us showing European rugby what we can do."
Watson, 21, has returned to the Bath set up after being involved in England's doomed World Cup campaign.
The hosts failed to make it out of the pool stages of the competitions and Watson admitted he was still hurting after the tournament.
"It's massively disappointing," he added. "I feel like we let the country down."
"To come so close against Wales and then lose so soundly to Australia was massively disappointing. We've got to collectively learn from it."
And he admitted with a new head coach in place, following the appointment of Eddie Jones, he already had one eye on next year's Six Nations Championship.
"Our only option is to build on it and go forward as a country and hopefully we'll get to do the nation proud at the Six Nations," he said.
"It's massively important for us to right some wrongs and put on some good performances to reward the fans for their continued support."
