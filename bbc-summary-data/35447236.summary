[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough 1-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Nugent's late header saw second-placed Middlesbrough draw with Blackburn to go level on points with Championship leaders Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordi Gomez had put Rovers in front on his debut with 18 minutes to go with a sublime 20-yard strike.
But after Boro debutant Jordan Rhodes was introduced to face the club he left in a £9m move, Nugent levelled matters by nodding in Emilio Nsue's cross.
Hope Akpan had a clear chance to win the game for Rovers but he fired wide.
Rovers boss Paul Lambert saw his side having the better of the chances until Boro introduced new signing Rhodes, who arrived on transfer deadline day.
Blackburn's Elliott Ward had a goal ruled out for offside and Tony Watt fired wide, while Grant Leadbitter and Kike Sola went close for the hosts, who saw Daniel Ayala forced off with an ankle injury after seeing his header saved by Jason Steele.
The visitors looked the more threatening side after the restart with Darragh Lenihan going close with a couple of attempts.
And after Ben Gibson fired over, Rovers took the lead when Gomez, another deadline day signing, struck at goal from 20 yards before Nugent headed in and the former England international went close again soon after, shooting wide from distance.
Akpan should have made it 2-1 to Rovers before Rhodes tested his former team-mate Steele late on, but Blackburn held on for a deserved point.
Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: "The first 70 minutes we didn't play with the intensity that we needed to, especially after our last two defeats.
"I thought the reaction today was going to be better, but the last 20 minutes is the only time we wanted to win or draw the game when we had a few chances.
"I know the concern, now we try to motivate them as we were two or three weeks ago. So now we try to work more and try to pick the right players."
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert: "I thought we were the better team and we should have won it, with the chances we had.
"Performance-wise I thought we were outstanding. To come here against a team trying to get out of the league is tough but we were very good.
"We coped really well, we dominated the middle of the pitch. They're a good side and they're up there on merit, but we put a lot of pressure on them."
