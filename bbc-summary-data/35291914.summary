Junior doctors' strike: Why is there no Wales dispute?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hospitals in England are facing major disruption as junior doctors have gone on strike for a second time in a dispute with the UK government over a new contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Why are junior doctors not on strike in Wales?
Because the NHS in Wales is devolved. Since 1999,  the Welsh government has been in charge of running the health service.
Ministers in Cardiff are responsible for negotiating the specific terms and conditions for doctors working in the Welsh NHS.
For the time being the Welsh government, like the Scottish government says it intends to stick with the junior doctors contract already in force.
Hence junior doctors in Wales are again working as normal today.
So will what's happening in England have no bearing at all on what happens in Wales?
The dispute between the junior doctors, the NHS in England and the UK government is extremely complex.
But generally speaking, it centres around introducing new working conditions including changing the way junior doctors are paid for working on weekends.
The UK government insists the new contract means the NHS in England will be better placed to provide better care seven days a week. But the BMA insists it will increase the pressure on junior doctors and result in a less safe care for patients.
While there are moves to improve access to care at weekends elsewhere in the UK, the plans are not on the scale of what the government in England is trying to achieve.
For example, in Wales the focus has been on more weekend access to diagnostic tests, pharmacies and therapies rather than creating more seven-day working across the whole system.
But that's not to stay if big changes eventually occur in terms and conditions in England that the Welsh government won't have to consider the implications carefully.
It would be very difficult for the NHS on both sides of the border with radically different contracts for staff doing similar jobs.
That's why until now the Welsh health minister has, in my view, been cautious not to try to make too much political capital out of the dispute in England.
Mark Drakeford is perhaps aware difficult negotiations, such as those that have occurred previously on GP and consultant contracts, may have to eventually take place here.
However the Welsh government insists any negotiations it takes part in will be undertaken spirit of "partnership".
And last November, Mr Drakeford encouraged junior doctors and medical professionals to consider working in Wales if unhappy in England.
Are any patients living in Wales affected by the action over the border?
Most patients living in Wales won't be affected.
But those patients from Wales who were scheduled today perhaps to get specialist treatment in England may have faced disruption.
Similarly individuals - for example people living near the border in Monmouthshire and Powys who for reasons of geography generally get seen at hospitals in England - may have seen their appointments postponed.
However junior doctors in England will provide emergency care during the strike -  so any emergency cases shouldn't in theory be affected.
So to what extent do junior doctors in Wales back the position of the BMA in England?
Generally, junior doctors in Wales support their colleagues in England.
BMA Wales said: ""We continue to lend our full support to colleagues in England. We are one profession, and we stand together. Across the UK, the BMA wants a contract that is fair for doctors, safe for patients and safeguards the future of the NHS everywhere. The approach taken by the Government in England is an attack on us all."
There has been support for the action from Welsh rugby star Jamie Roberts. He is a qualified doctor, although has never worked as one. He's currently playing for Harlequins and  studying for a MPhil at Cambridge.
He tweeted during the first strike: "The #juniordoctors have my full support today."
However not everyone agrees, the BMA's former Welsh council chairman, former surgeon, Russell Hopkins wrote to the Daily Telegraph saying the organisation has "morphed" into a left-wing political body, giving "little thought to patient care".
The former surgeon and manager of the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff also says he intends to hand back his fellowship of the organisation.
The BMA responded: "Everyone is entitled to their view and junior doctors certainly do not take the decision to take industrial action lightly".
What does the Welsh government say?
Ministers are said to be monitoring developments in England carefully.
"We believe in proceeding through negotiation and partnership," said a spokesman.
"There is the potential for the industrial action in England to have an impact on Welsh patients who receive treatment in England and on the NHS in Wales. We have therefore asked health boards and NHS trusts to put in place contingency plans."
The spokesman added: "Wales has a strong tradition of working in partnership with our staff and their representatives. Junior doctors from any part of the UK interested in working in Wales will find a very warm welcome here."
