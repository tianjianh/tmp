Scottish League One: Alloa narrow gap at top, Brechin overtake Queen's Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alloa Athletic moved to within six points of Scottish League One leaders Livingston as East Fife and Queen's Park's promotion hopes stuttered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fourth-placed Fifers were beaten 3-0 by Alloa as the Spiders dropped to sixth after losing 3-1 away to Brechin City, who moved up to fifth.
Livi do, however, have two games in hand over the Wasps.
Third-placed Airdrieonians, as well as East Fife, Brechin and Queen's Park, each have one game in hand.
Greig Spence's header and Kevin Cawley's strike put Alloa in command against the Fifers before Jamie Longworth nodded the hosts' third.
Queen's Park went ahead early on against Brechin through Bryan Wharton's free-kick, but Ally Love quickly levelled - also from a set play.
Dougie Hill headed City in front before the break and Andy Jackson struck their third in stoppage time.
