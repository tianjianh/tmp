Finn, 26, impressed in last week's final warm-up game against Pakistan A in Sharjah when he took four wickets.
Captain Alastair Cook announced he will open the batting with Moeen Ali, spinner Adil Rashid makes his Test debut and James Anderson returns.
The first Test in Abu Dhabi begins on Tuesday at 07:00 BST.

Cook said on Finn's injury: "It's a bitter blow for him, he's had a huge 12 months. Hopefully he'll be right for the second Test."
Asked whether he was in contention for a spot in the team, the skipper added: "Absolutely, he was. His performance in that warm-up game was good.
"After the warm-up game, he complained of a pain in his foot. Yesterday he bowled pretty well in the nets, and got through. But obviously it's got worse."
Rashid has also been in good form while in the United Arab Emirates. The 27-year-old Yorkshire bowler scored 51 with the bat in the first warm-up match against Pakistan A and took 3-53 in the second.
"He can bowl some absolute jaffers and is a wicket-taking threat," Cook said of the leg spinner.

Meanwhile, Pakistan have doubts over leg spinner Yasir Shah, who limped away from practice on Monday.
Shah, who is the fastest Pakistan bowler to reach 50 Test wickets, suffered a suspected back injury in the nets.
"Back spasm I think so," said captain Misbah-ul-Haq. "He tried to bowl a delivery and his spikes stuck. He felt something in his back. Let's see how he feels tomorrow.
"That could be a big blow for us. He's the key player for us so we are really concerned about him."
Pakistan have called up left-arm spinner Zafar Gohar, who played for Pakistan A in both warm-up matches in Sharjah last week, as cover.
