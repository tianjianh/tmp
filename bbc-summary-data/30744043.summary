The blogging site says that The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies has been the most popular with more than 500,000 downloads since being uploaded 24 hours ago.
Other films which have appeared online include American Sniper and Selma.
The site said, according to its sources, the high-quality 'screeners' seemed to come from three sources.
Some of the films have yet to be released in both the UK and US.
Big Eyes, Into The Woods and Unbroken are also believed to have been leaked online.
Nominated in the best film category for this year's Bafta awards, The Imitation Game and Birdman are also thought to have been hacked.
Oscar nominations are announced next week (15 January), with the actual awards ceremony taking place on 22 February.
