Clarke, who quit after last summer's Ashes, will play for Sydney grade team Western Suburbs on February 20-21.
"I've realised the game of cricket is in my blood," said 34-year-old Clarke.
"I'll start with this grade game and see if I miss it as much as I feel like I'm going to. If I do, the option is there to train the entire winter and then we'll see what happens."
Western Suburbs, the club Clarke played for as a youngster, face Randwick Petersham in a two-day first grade match at Pratten Park starting on February 20.
Clarke played 115 Tests and 245 one-day internationals for Australia, but struggled with back injuries throughout his career.
He said his comeback will primarily focus on limited-overs cricket.
"My focus is definitely the shorter format of the game," said Clarke, who added that he would "love to be a part" of Australia's Big Bash League, the Indian Premier League and English county cricket.
"There's possibly even Sheffield Shield cricket for New South Wales," he said.
"All I know is, I'll never say never to anything. I'll start with Western Suburbs and we will see where it takes me."
