Consultation over £12.5m Headington roads plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £12.5m scheme aimed at cutting congestion in Oxford have been put out to consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxfordshire County Council wants to widen roads, upgrade paths and cycle lanes and install traffic lights at the John Radcliffe Hospital junction.
Headington residents are concerned the work will cause disruption.
Councillor David Nimmo Smith said it was "time to deal" with the area's traffic problems.
Drop in sessions for people to view the plans will take place this week.
Work is expected to start next summer with completion in spring 2018.
Meanwhile work at the busy Cutteslowe and Wolvercote roundabouts is due to start this month and will take about 16 months.
The council has warned of "major" travel delays.
