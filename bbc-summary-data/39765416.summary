The 21-year-old was injured during a police raid at a house in Willesden.
After being discharged on Sunday, she was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Detectives have been granted more time to question six other people who were also arrested during the raid.
The operation took place at a house in Harlesden Road, which had been under observation by police.
One of those arrested at the address was 21-year-old Mohamed Amoudi.
It was revealed on Saturday that he had previously been quizzed by British authorities under suspicion of trying to travel to Syria to join so-called Islamic State.
The other people taken into custody alongside Mr Amoudi were a 20-year-old woman, a 16-year-old boy, and a man and woman both aged 28. Another woman, aged 43, was arrested from a property in Kent.
All of them were detained over the same suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts.
The maximum terror suspects can be held for with judicial approval is 14 days.
On Saturday Met Police were given court authorisation to detain the suspects at a south London police station until after the bank holiday weekend.
Separately police have also been given more time by the courts to question a terror suspect arrested on the same day in Whitehall.
Khalid Mohammed Omar Ali, 27, was arrested near Parliament Square in a counter-terrorism operation unrelated to the events in Willesden.
Mr Ali was found carrying knives near the Houses of Parliament and was detained by armed police.
He is a British national who is believed to have gone to school in Tottenham, north London, but was not born in the UK.
The courts granted a warrant of further detention so police can keep him in custody until Thursday.
He had been on the force's radar for some time and it is thought officers acted after a concerned family member contacted them.
It also emerged on Saturday that he had spent time in Afghanistan, returning to the UK at the end of last year.
Neil Basu, deputy assistant commissioner, said that in both unrelated cases he believed the force "contained the threats that they pose".
