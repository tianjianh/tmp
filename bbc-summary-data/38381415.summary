[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old, who is currently sidelined with a serious knee injury, will remain with the west London club until the summer of 2019.
Injuries have restricted the Scot to just 14 appearances since he arrived from Rangers in January 2015.
"Prior to his injury he was beginning to show the undoubted potential he possesses," head coach Dean Smith said.
