The body was discovered in the Limehurst Way area of Lisburn on Monday afternoon.
The victim has been named locally as Gerry Mulligan.
A post-mortem examination will take place to determine the cause of death, which is being treated as suspicious. Police do not believe there is any paramilitary involvement.
Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery said police received the report of the discovered body shortly after 16:20 BST.
DUP Councillor Jonathan Craig said the killing of a man well-known in the local business community had deeply shocked residents of a quiet area.
"People cannot get over it," he said.
