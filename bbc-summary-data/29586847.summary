EastEnders bosses have confirmed Martin Fowler is returning to Albert Square.

But he might be different to how you remember him.
Not because its been years since he stepped foot in the Queen Vic or got his clothes washed at the launderette, but because he'll be played by a new actor.
James Bye is taking over the role.
Who?
The actor has previously appeared in The Great Train Robbery and The Hooligan Factor.
He tweeted: "So proud to be part of the Fowler clan. A massive opportunity."
The role of Martin Fowler has previously been played by Jon Peyton Price and James Alexandrou.
Last month bosses on the BBC One soap reintroduced Ben Mitchell's character using a different actor.
That role has been played by five actors in total, with Harry Reid the latest.
Executive Producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins told soapsquark.co.uk:  "We have recast everyman Martin Fowler after extensive auditions.
"Martin is an EastEnders original - the first baby born on the Square and part of the show's roots - and, as we celebrate 30 years on Albert Square, it's important to look backwards as we move forwards."
No doubt Martin will be trying to sort his marriage with Sonia, played by Natalie Cassidy, when he returns.
She recently returned to the square herself when the couple's relationship hit tough times.
