Police are treated the incident, in a flat in Renfrew, as attempted murder.
Officers were called to the flat in Houston Street at about 19:20 on Wednesday.
Both suspects were white with one taller than 6ft and thin and the other of average height and build. They may have been in the company of a woman, also white, and aged between 25 and 30.
Det Insp Alexander Nelson, of Police Scotland, said: "Whilst we don't know the motive for the attack we do not believe it to be random.
"We are gathering CCTV images to review in the hope that it provides us with further details on the suspects.
"I am appealing to people in the local area to think about whether they saw or heard something - did you see the two men, did you see the woman?
"Any small piece of information could prove vital in helping us locate the people responsible for this attack."
