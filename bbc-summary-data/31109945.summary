[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coast to coast across the US

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When photographer Charles Fox unexpectedly found himself heading to the US with his original plans in tatters, he decided to make the most of the opportunity and set out to travel coast to coast in that time honoured tradition of the photographic road trip.

Starting on the west coast, he spent five weeks making the journey. Sometimes he would linger in a particular state, at other times just pass through, the landscape little more than a blur through the window as he laid down the miles.
"It was an experience of freedom but also isolation," he says.  "The road in winter is a lonely place and interactions were fleeting."
His route developed as he drove, changing plans to stay south of the cold weather, interacting with those he met along the way and eventually passing through 19 states.
Of course, like many of us, he grew up with an idea of America shaped by film and television, and you can't embark on a trip like this without reference to those who have passed that way before.
It is 60 years since Robert Frank set out on his 10,000-mile road trip around America and produced what is arguably the greatest photographic study of all time.
Treading in those footsteps is no easy thing, yet one or two frames have hints of Fox's homage to Frank.
Here is a selection of the work.
