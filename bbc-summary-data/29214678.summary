Allen, Amber Hill and Sarah Gray won GB's first women's skeet team gold with their combined qualifying scores.
Allen progressed to the individual gold medal match where she lost to Brandy Drozd of the USA by a single score.
The Newport-based shooter's silver guarantees another place for Team GB at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
"I'm ever so pleased to get the silver - I did not want another bronze medal," Allen, who won bronze in Lima in 2013, told BBC Sport.
"And getting the quota place for the Olympics is fantastic."
Allen's qualifying total of 73 - dropping just two clays over three rounds - was good enough for direct entry to the semi-final.
Once there, she came through a shoot-off to guarantee a place in the gold/silver match, where she shot 13 of 16 clays - one fewer than her American opponent.
She added: "It's been tough, during training it gets extremely stressful as the competition nears but I'm so pleased with how I handled the pressure today."
Hill, 17, scored 72 in qualifying but fell at the semi-final shoot-off stage, while Gray's 68 was a new personal best.
Crucially, hers and Allan's final qualifying round perfect scores of 25 sealed the team gold after GB and Slovakia both ended on combined totals of 213.
"To come away with a team gold for Great Britain is absolutely incredible - it's the first time it's ever been done," said Hill.
Allen's individual success brings the number of Olympic spots secured by Team GB in Granada to two after Ed Ling's silver medal in the men's trap.
The GB medal total at the championships, which runs until 20 September, now stands at four with Steve Scott also winning a bronze in the double trap.
