Arlene Arkinson inquest: 'New evidence' delays case investigating death of Castlederg teenager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inquest into the death of Arlene Arkinson has been further delayed due to new evidence that has only just come to light, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arlene, from Castlederg, was 15 when she disappeared in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland.
Convicted child killer Robert Howard, who died in prison last year, was the main suspect in her disappearance.
On Friday, a barrister for the police said he had consulted with a witness who had been due to give evidence.
The inquest heard that some of the information in the witness's journal, which was produced late on Thursday night, may be subject to protection and could be withheld under Public Interest Immunity or under Article 2 (Right to Life) in the European Convention on Human Rights.
The court also heard that most of the "lengthy" journal is "hard to decipher".
The coroner accepted that the decision to delay the inquest further was "disappointing" for Kathleen Arkinson, Arlene's sister, who has been present in court throughout the hearing.
However, he said it is "better to do things correctly than artificially quickly".
The inquest will reconvene next week for a "review", which will "take stock" and set a timetable for the "end phase of evidence to be given to the inquest".
