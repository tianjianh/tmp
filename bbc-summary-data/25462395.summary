James Reekie, 28, from Glenrothes, was caught after police seized a computer he used to download indecent images of children.
The sex attack on the baby took place while she was alone and was downloaded onto his phone.
Reekie was a guest of the child's parents at the time of the attack.
At the High Court in Glasgow judge Lord Pentland ordered Reekie to be monitored in the community for five years after his release from prison.
Lord Pentland told Reekie: "You have a deviant interest in young children."
He added: "You progressed to sexually abusing an 11-month-old girl in a depraved and revolting manner.
"The child was alone in a room of the house where you were a guest. This was a grievous breach of trust and shows a degree of deviousness and planning by you."
Defence solicitor advocate Chris Fyffe said: "Mr Reekie wishes to extend apologies to al those affected. He is angry at himself. He is deeply ashamed.
"This is an individual who accepts that he needs help and he needs to change."
The police traced the baby from the one-minute, four-second film and told her family. She was taken to hospital but found to be uninjured.
Reekie admitted sexually assaulting the baby, an offence which counts as attempted rape under new laws.
The 28-year-old also pled guilty to making indecent images of children. The computer in Reekie's bedroom contained 215 indecent photos and 138 videos of children.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard said the images were found after police were tipped off that someone from the home Reekie shared with his parents was looking at indecent images.
Reekie, who worked as a cleaner at a high school in Fife, was placed on the sex offenders' register.
