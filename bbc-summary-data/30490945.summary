The deaths of Peaches Geldof, Robin Williams and Rik Mayall also featured in the top 10 trending search list.
Flappy Bird, the Grand National and Jennifer Lawrence appeared in the top searches as well.
Ebola was the top news story of the year, followed by ALS - inspired by the ice bucket challenge which aimed to promote awareness of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - and Malaysia Airlines, which lost two passenger planes in separate incidents during 2014.
