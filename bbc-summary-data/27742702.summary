Celtic's Lewis Kidd makes Queen of the South switch permanent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen of the South have signed Lewis Kidd after the 19-year-old defender was released by Celtic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kidd, who spent three months on loan at Palmerston Park last season, has signed a one-year contract, with Queens saying he had "interest elsewhere".
The defender told the Dumfries club's website: "I enjoyed my time here last season and I just can`t wait to get started in pre-season again.
"It will be a great league to be involved in this season."
Kidd made six appearances during April and May for the side whose season ended in a promotion play-off defeat by Falkirk in the Scottish Championship.
