The show - which is presented by Chris Evans and originally ran in the 1990s - was briefly resurrected last year for a short series.
A spokesperson for Channel 4 said: "TFI was never commissioned as a long-running series so there are no plans for it to return."
Evans had previously suggested further series could be produced without him.
Speaking on the show in 2015, he endorsed Nick Grimshaw as a possible new presenter.
He told viewers: "I think Nick is the future of the show. I think this is good fun for us oldies, but if this show comes back he is the guy, he is the guy."
Evans would have been unlikely to front the show himself in the long term because of other presenting commitments such as Top Gear and BBC Radio 2's breakfast show.
Earlier this week, the Evans announced he would be leaving Top Gear, having presented it for one series after the departure of Jeremy Clarkson.
Writing on Twitter, the presenter said: "I feel like my standing aside is the single best thing I can now do to help the cause."
