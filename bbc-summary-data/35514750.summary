The 23-year-old Portaferry athlete broke Sinead Delahunty's 16-year-old Irish record of 4:11.06, posted in New York back in January 2000.
Mageean finished behind winner Axumawit Embaye of Ethiopia(4:08.22) and Germany's Konstanze Klosterhalfen.
Mageean beat her indoor personal best set five years ago by nine seconds.
She has now secured qualification for next month's World Indoor Championships in Portland, Oregon.
The UCD student had already qualified the Olympic Games 1500m, having run 4:06.49 in Italy last year.
