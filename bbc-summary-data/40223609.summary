Blackburn Rovers head coach Tony Mowbray has signed a new two-year contract with the League One club.

Mowbray joined Rovers on an 18-month contract on 22 February, succeeding Owen Coyle at Ewood Park.
He won five and drew seven of his 15 games in charge, but Blackburn were relegated from the Championship.
Mowbray, 53, held discussions with club owners Venky's in India last month and has agreed a new deal, which contains the option of a further 12 months.
He told the club website: "The job is to bounce back straight away.
"I needed some reassurances that we wouldn't be selling all of our players and that we had some budget to try to strengthen the team if we could, having lost 12 players through either loans going back or people out of contract."
Rovers released eight players, including captain Jason Lowe, following their relegation from the second tier on goal difference.
However, former West Bromwich Albion, Celtic and Middlesbrough manager Mowbray has insisted the club do not need to sell players and he is focused on player recruitment.
"There has to be some restructuring internally, because we're now in League One," he said.
"But ultimately the aim is to build the departments up as I like them to work, to focus on the recruitment of players that can push the club to where we want to be."
