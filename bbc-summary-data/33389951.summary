Lorna Carty, who was in her 50s and from County Meath, was on holiday with her husband Declan when the attack happened on 26 June.
The mother-of-two was among 38 people murdered at the beach resort of Sousse.
Fr Noel Horneck said the community was in shock.
"Friends, neighbours, colleagues, and the local GAA club here in Dunderry to which she was so committed, so often giving her nursing aid to players when injured - she was a club nurse - that's probably the best way of describing Lorna's involvement," he told the congregation at the Church of the Assumption in Robinstown.
"Her goodness and kindness will always be remembered and appreciated and spoken of."
Members of the Meath Senior GAA team and her local club formed a guard of honour as her remains were brought into the church.
Fr Horneck told her family: "Our mourning as friends, neighbours, colleagues, club and parish is nothing compared to your loss."
Laurence (Larry) and Martina Hayes from County Westmeath were also killed in the attack.
Their funerals were held in Athlone on Friday, the same day as their only daughter Sinead's 30th birthday.
Thirty Britons were murdered in the attack, and a minute's silence was held across the UK on Friday to remember the victims.
The final five bodies of British victims killed in the Tunisia beach attack were being flown back to the UK on Saturday.
Other victims included two Germans, one Belgian, one Portuguese and one Russian national.
