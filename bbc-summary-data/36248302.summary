[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire maintained their grip on Glamorgan on a weather-curtailed day in Cardiff, declaring on 456-6 before reducing their hosts to 42-4.

Just days after his first Championship century, Brett D'Oliveira reached his first double, reaching 202 not out.
Following his dad Damian and grandad Basil, the D'Oliveiras are now the first grandfather, father and son to score first-class double centuries.
Worcestershire then claimed four wickets before the early close.
Bad light and heavy showers caused the loss of the entire final session after Glamorgan's new-look top order had failed to solve their batting problems.
Visiting seamers Joe Leach and Ed Barnard made early inroads, taking three wickets between them in the space of seven balls.
Skipper Jacques Rudolph then ran himself out thanks to a sharp piece of work from New Zealand international Mitchell Santner, and only Chris Cooke, on 27, has so far reached double figures.
Earlier, Worcestershire's England Lions batsman Joe Clarke had added a further 28 to extend his score to 133 - just two short of the new career-best he posted against Gloucestershire at Bristol two weeks ago.
Glamorgan batsman Chris Cooke told BBC Wales Sport:
"Our backs are against the wall, but we're still in the game fighting and there's a big two days to go.
"Scoreboard pressure is there but we've all been in that situation. We are professional players. It shouldn't really affect us that much, but they bowled really well and took advantage of some good bowling conditions.
"There's never a good time for a run-out. Jacques had a bit of a slip and it was a good piece of fielding, so that's unfortunate.
"If the weather comes in it comes in, but we need to be prepared to bat for a couple of sessions. We need to stick together as a group and put in a good batting performance."
