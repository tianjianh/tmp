[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lionel Messi celebrated the birth of his second son with a winning goal as Barcelona went top of La Liga with a 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid.

Messi, who had not scored in Barca's first two league games, started on the bench after missing training on Friday to be with his new baby boy Mateo.
Atletico went ahead six minutes after the break when Fernando Torres rolled in a shot, but Neymar equalised.
Messi then grabbed the winner after being set up by Luis Suarez.
It was the Argentina international's 287th La Liga goal for Barcelona, extending his lead as the competition's all-time top scorer.
His goal came on the day that Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo became his club's record league scorer - and moved up to fourth in the overall standings with 230 goals - by scoring five in a 6-0 win at Espanyol.
Messi had scored in Argentina's 2-2 midweek draw with Mexico but was seeking his first La Liga goal of the season before Saturday's game.
He saw Suarez hit the bar in a poor first half, before Atletico took the lead early in the second when Torres finished off a fine counter-attack.
That lead lasted only four minutes, though, as Neymar curled in a stunning free-kick from 20 yards.
Barcelona had a penalty appeal rejected when Atletico defender Diego Godin appeared to handle the ball, but Messi won the match with a stylish, low finish.
