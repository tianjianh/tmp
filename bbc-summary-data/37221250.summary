Southern Health NHS Trust boss Katrina Percy resigns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of a troubled NHS trust has quit over "media attention".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Katrina Percy said "the effect ongoing personal media attention has had on staff and patients" had made her position as boss of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust untenable.
Ms Percy had faced calls to quit after the trust was criticised over the way it investigated patient deaths.
An NHS England-commissioned probe found 272 of the 722 deaths over the last four years were dealt with properly.

Ms Percy, who was chief executive for nine years, said she "firmly believed" it was her responsibility to stay on to "oversee improvements".
She said she understood why "many will say I should have stepped down sooner given the very public concerns which have been raised in the past months".
Ms Percy said she was taking on a new role with Southern Health providing "strategic advice to local GP leaders".
A spokeswoman for the trust said Ms Percy's salary - which is quoted in the trust's annual report as between £180,000 and £190,000 - would remain the same when she moved to the advisory role.
In June, Southern Health accepted responsibility for the death of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath at one of its facilities -  Slade House in Oxford.
The trust admitted it caused the death of Connor, who had suffered an epileptic seizure before he died in July 2013, and offered his family £80,000 compensation.
A report published in December said the deaths of hundreds of mental health and learning-disability patients over four years were not properly examined, and blamed a "failure of leadership".
Following a six-week review, interim chair Tim Smart said it was clear the executive team had been "too stretched to guarantee high quality services".
He recommended the trust should "transform the way in which it delivers services, and makes changes to the structure and strength of its leadership team".
Connor's mother Sara Ryan said Ms Percy's resignation was "long overdue" and that the former CEO was still not taking responsibility for the trust's failings.
"This whole sorry episode has shone an important light on peculiar workings at senior NHS levels around regulation, accountability and enforcement," she said.
"It also demonstrates that candour and transparency remain woefully lacking in 2016."
Ms Ryan added that is was "totally scandalous and shameful" that she would keep the same salary in her new role.

Mr Smart said Ms Percy's new role was "vital work that needs to be done for which she is ideally suited".
"Katrina has shown great resilience, devoting herself to the patients and staff of Southern Health since it was created in 2011," he added.
Julie Dawes, who joined the trust in May as director of nursing and quality, has been named as the interim chief executive officer.
In July, a BBC investigation found Southern Health had paid millions of pounds to companies owned by previous associates of Ms Percy.
One firm received more than £5m despite winning a contract valued at less than £300,000, while another was paid more than £500,000 without bidding at all. The trust said it took its financial responsibilities "very seriously".
Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust covers Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
