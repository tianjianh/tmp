Sinead Higgins, 37, and son Oisin O'Driscoll were found after police forced their way into the house in The Fairway, Ruislip, west London on Wednesday.
Police responded to concerns for the pair's welfare at about 10:50 GMT.
A Met Police spokeswoman said detectives do not believe a third party was involved in the deaths.
Det Insp Dave Bolton said: "Inquiries so far lead us to believe there is a likelihood that the tragic events that led to the deaths do not involve a third party."
A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Friday.
Next of kin have been informed.
