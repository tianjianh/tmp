A series of clean-up operations has begun on a storm-hit nature reserve in East Yorkshire.

Spurn Point peninsula, a Yorkshire Wildlife Trust (YWT) reserve, was hit by the North Sea tidal surge on 5 December.
High tides washed litter and debris from the Humber Estuary and North Sea across the land.
Harry Watkins from YWT said the response from people wanting to help clear up was "overwhelming".
The surge punched holes in the sea defences and washed away the road and large parts of land on the 3.5 mile (6km)-long stretch.
Mr Watkins said contractors repairing the road, unpredictable tides and a lack of parking made it unsafe for the public to visit.
However, the wetlands and the pub are open at the top end of the reserve, he said.
It is hoped that the whole peninsula will reopen to the public in spring.
"Vegetation starts to grow then - sand dune plants will re-establish and we will have a clearer picture of Spurn Point's future," Mr Watkins said.
