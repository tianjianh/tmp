The 25-year-old has been released to train with his club for their home Premiership match against Bristol.
He will return to the Wales squad on the following Monday to prepare for the Test match against South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday, 26 November.
Faletau suffered his knee injury on his Premiership debut for Bath on 3 September.
"Taulupe has progressed excellently with his recovery," said Wales coach Rob Howley. "We have a good working relationship with Bath."
Faletau, who has 61 caps for Wales, was included in the squad for the autumn internationals despite being expected to miss the majority of the campaign.
The British and Irish Lions player was one of three wildcard picks under the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, along with backs George North and Jamie Roberts.
The rule - also known as 'Gatland's Law' - meant only three of Faletau, North, Roberts and Rhys Priestland could be picked as wildcards.
Japan-based lock Dominic Day, Gloucester prop Nicky Thomas - now at Scarlets - and Bristol scrum-half Rhodri Williams are the other players affected by the rule.
