A trampoline park is investigating claims four people were "seriously injured" on an attraction in one month.

Sarah McManus, 29, is said to be among those hurt on the "tower jump" at the Flip Out Park in Chester.
The personal assistant, from Oswestry, Shropshire, said she fractured her spine jumping into a foam pit from a 13ft (4m) high platform in January.
A spokesman for Cheshire trampoline park said the tower jump has been replaced by another attraction.
Miss McManus, who is taking legal action against the park, said: "I followed the instructions on the sign and landed in the seated position as suggested, but when I hit the foam I heard a crack in my back and felt like I'd been winded.
"I was barely able to breathe and couldn't shout for help, so I had to throw some of the foam sponges in the air to get attention."
She added: "I was eventually fitted with a back brace that I wear daily and only remove to shower and sleep."
Following her injury, three other people all reportedly suffered back injuries on the same attraction.
One was student George Magraw, 21, from Ellesmere Port, who fractured his spine at the park in February.
Cheshire West and Chester Council has launched an investigation into the park.
The council said two other people were injured on the same day as Mr Magraw.
A spokesman for Flip Out Chester said: "Since opening in December, more than 200,000 people have visited Flip Out Chester and we have an excellent safety record.
"Safety is our number one priority and we strive to ensure that everyone who visits can enjoy all of the activities in a safe environment.
"We are investigating these claims to establish exactly what happened."
