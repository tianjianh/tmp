Cyclists ride from Yorkshire to London for Jo Cox charities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of cyclists are riding from Yorkshire to London to raise money for charities supported by Labour MP Jo Cox.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Cox, 41, died after being attacked in Birstall, West Yorkshire in June. A man has been charged with her murder.
Seen off by Ms Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, the cyclists will pedal from her constituency to Parliament.
They will visit community groups supported by Ms Cox's charities along the 260-mile (418 km) route.
The event's organiser Sarfraz Mian, said he hoped local people would join the riders on each of the five days.
"I didn't know Jo, but I was struck by her principles and beliefs and the fact that communities are always stronger when working together," he said.
"Jo worked all her life to make a difference in the world and, at the time of her death, people were pitched against one another in political arguments where our sense of humanity seemed in peril."
