Rushden Lakes shopping development 'threatens town centre trade'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a Â£50m out-of-town shopping development in Rushden would threaten town centre trade, opponents of the scheme have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rushden Lakes shopping centre, set for land off the A45, has been advertised as a scheme that would create jobs and complement local retail.
But Simon Russian, behind the redevelopment of Northampton's Grosvenor Centre, said Rushden Lakes would take its trade.
He said "We are very concerned."
Mr Russian, head of retail for the Grosvenor Centre, said that while Rushden Lakes was a threat, it would not prevent plans for the Grosvenor Centre from going ahead.
Northamptonshire Borough Council has also opposed the plans, while many councillors in East Northamptonshire have shown support for it.
Steven North, leader of East Northamptonshire Council, said of the scheme: "We need more developments in this area, we need people coming to the place, and we need the jobs."
Gavin Stollar, on behalf of Rushden Lakes' developers, said: "As we have said all along, Rushden Lakes has the potential to create new local jobs, provide a new high quality leisure and tourism destination whilst also complementing Rushden's existing local retail offer."
