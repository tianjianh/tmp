Jonathan Mitchell: Luton goalkeeper recalled by Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County have recalled goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell from Luton Town with immediate effect.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitchell will replace the Rams' second-choice keeper Lee Grant who requires a minor groin operation.
The 21-year-old will go straight into the squad for Derby's fixture against Hull on Tuesday.
Mitchell made five appearances for the Hatters this season after joining the club on an emergency loan at the beginning of March.
Eighteen-year-old goalkeeper Craig King, who has yet to make a senior appearance for the Luton, has subsequently been recalled from his loan spell at Bishop's Stortford.
