Cardiff City: Paul Trollope unlikely to stay with Wales after Euros, says Coleman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Cardiff City boss Paul Trollope is unlikely to continue as a Wales coach after the Euro 2016 Championships, according to manager Chris Coleman.

Trollope was made head coach at Cardiff on 18 May having previously being part of Russell Slade's coaching team.
The 43-year-old has also been part of the national set-up, but Coleman does not expect that to continue.
"Let's be honest, we are probably going to lose Paul Trollope," he said after agreeing a new two-year contract.
"He's not said anything yet, but he can't manage Cardiff and be with us. I would not expect him to.
"He's got a tough job there now. It would be no surprise to me if there is a knock on the door.
"He's very good, we want him in France. But it's a fantastic opportunity for him at Cardiff City, he's a great coach, so it is unfortunate we are going to lose him."
Cardiff City hinted Trollope could continue working on Coleman's backroom staff after Euro 2016.
And Trollope himself said there was no clash between his Wales duties in France and preparing Cardiff for next season's Championship campaign, but stopped short of saying he would stay on after the summer.
"I don't see it as any sort of hindrance for preparation for the new season [with Cardiff]," he said.
"I will discuss the viability of continuing with Wales after the Euros."
