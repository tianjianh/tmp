It happened outside a supermarket at Coleraine Road in Portstewart on Wednesday afternoon.
Her mother's car keys had fallen inside the vehicle, and when the door was closed, the security system activated the locks.
The fire crew managed to gain entry to the car and bring the baby out.
Mark Smith of the Fire and Rescue Service said: "We were able to release the door - and we're delighted to have been able to reunite the baby with her mother."
