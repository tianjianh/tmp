A rescue team has had its busiest ever start to the year, responding to 43 calls in three months.

Central Beacons Mountain Rescue said 2016 was its busiest year in its 54-year history, as it responded to 124 incidents.
But the amount of incidents it has already attended in 2017, despite no extreme weather, points to "another very busy year", the team said.
It said the increase could be linked with more people using the outdoors.
The team said some of its calls were to support neighbouring rescue teams including Brecon, Longtown and Western Beacons.
A spokesman said nearly half the incidents were to help police in searches for missing people and to carry out animal rescues.
