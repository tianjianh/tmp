Joey Barton has had his club suspension extended for another week by Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old midfielder was due to return to Ibrox on Monday from a month-long absence following a dressing-room disagreement.
But Rangers said: "Joey Barton has been informed that his suspension by the club has been extended by one week.
"This is part of a formal disciplinary procedure and Joey has been instructed not return to Ibrox or Auchenhowie until further notice."
Barton, who joined Rangers on a two-year contract this summer after helping Burnley win the Championship in England, was initially told to stay away from the club's stadium and training ground last month.
It followed a training-ground altercation with fellow midfielder Andy Halliday after Rangers' 5-1 defeat by Celtic and a disagreement with manager Mark Warburton.
A three-week club suspension followed and he was due to report back to the Scottish Premiership club this week.
However, in the meantime, Barton has been charged by the Scottish FA with breaking rules relating to gambling on football matches.
The Englishman has until Wednesday to respond to the charge, with a hearing date set for 27 October.
Meanwhile, Rangers said on their website that, following Sunday's statement: "Neither party (the club and player) will make any further statement or comment."
