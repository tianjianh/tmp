Jobs lost as East Kilbride windows supplier goes bust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An East Kilbride-based windows supplier has gone bust, with the loss of 63 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
TFD (Scotland) Ltd, which traded as Trade Frames Direct and Dalmatian Windows, had been in business for more than 13 years.
The company supplied double glazed windows to the housebuilding sector.
Provisional liquidator Donald McNaught, from Johnston Carmichael, said TFD had been hit by "customer difficulties".
They included the loss of a major deal following the insolvency of Muirfield Contracts in March 2015.
The liquidators are working with organisations, including Skills Development Scotland, to help the employees affected find new jobs.
Mr McNaught said: "Unfortunately the business has been unable to ensure sufficient cash flow to remain viable, despite repeated efforts by the directors to improve its position and protect jobs.
"We are now actively seeking buyers interested in the company's remaining stock, premises, plant and equipment."
