[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derwent Pulse photographs go on display in Bakewell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition featuring photographs of hundreds of multi-coloured lights floating down a Derbyshire river has opened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundreds of people from Derbyshire helped to guide the lights along the river for a project called Derwent Pulse in October.
Photographs taken along the route can be seen at the free exhibition at Bakewell Old Market Hall.
The Derwent runs through the Peak District, Chatsworth Park and Derby.
The project, which was commissioned by Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, was designed to recognise the river's importance during the Industrial Revolution.
Charles Monkhouse, who previously lit up the nearby Cromford Canal in a project for the Cultural Olympiad, was behind the artwork, which saw up to 1,000 pulsating lights cascade down the river navigated by GPS.
Don Symonds, from Bakewell Visitor Centre, said the images show the Peak District "from a completely different angle".
The exhibition runs until 12 May.
