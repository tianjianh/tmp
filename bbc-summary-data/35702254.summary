Neil Hudgell: Hull KR chairman confident of 'top line' coach appointment for 2017

Hull KR will name a short-term head coach for the rest of 2016, with a view to confirming a "top line" boss for next year, says chairman Neil Hudgell.

The Robins hope to make a long-term appointment for 2017, with ex-England boss Steve McNamara and former Leigh coach Paul Rowley among those linked.
Chris Chester left Rovers after February's defeat by Wakefield, with Willie Poching in temporary charge.
"We have a stand-out candidate," Hudgell told BBC Look North.
"We are expecting the appointment to be a top line coach with experience and a finer understanding of the game."
Hudgell is close friends with former England and Bradford coach McNamara, himself a Hull native, but would not discuss speculation surrounding the identity of the candidate.
He did confirm there had been "huge interest" in the post, but that no formal job offer had been extended at this stage.
McNamara is currently employed as assistant coach at NRL side Sydney Roosters under their head coach Trent Robinson.

"The person we've identified as the coach we want to take us forward in the long-term isn't in a position to take up a position at this stage," Hudgell continued.
"We've been in talks and will make an announcement when we're in a position to."
Poching will take charge of Friday's game at Widnes Vikings, hoping to build on the defeat by St Helens in his first Super League game in charge.
"Willie's in the box seat [for the short-term role], he knows the players, has been at the club a period of time, so he knows the systems," Hudgell added.
"He's put his hand up and wants the gig full-time, he's ambitious, been assistant to some of the best coaches in the game and has 'wool on his back'.
"As a board we need to look at how he fits into our longer term future."
