A pilot of a microlight aircraft was forced to spend 12 hours up the tree he crashed into after rescuers said they would have to wait until daylight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pilot had crash-landed into the tree, about 30km (19 miles) east of Stuttgart in southern Germany, on Monday night.
Rescuers feared the plane might fall to the ground if they tried to rescue him overnight.
The 59-year-old pilot was eventually brought to safety on Tuesday.
Police in the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg have not named the pilot.
The aircraft was lodged in the tree about 30m (98ft) above ground near Degenfeld and the rescuers had to abandon initial attempts to bring him down as night fell.
