Liza Jones, 26, from Wrexham had been using the 4m (13ft) high "tower jump" at Flip Out, in Chester.
She was injured on the same day George Magraw was left with a fractured spine after using the same jump.
Cheshire West and Chester Council is investigating the park, which has voluntarily closed the tower.
Ms Jones, who suffered a back fracture and burst vertebrae when she visited on 1 February, underwent surgery to have metal plates and screws inserted in her back.
She said: "The pain is worse at night and I can hardly move in the mornings.
"I can't lean forwards or bend to pick things up and I can't lift things.
"It just feels like a massive ache sometimes and it's difficult because I'm used to doing such an active job."
Flip Out confirmed they had "three incidents" on 1 February.
A spokesman added: "We have replaced the Tower Jump with a new Battle Beam attraction."
Following the incidents the company uploaded a safety video on YouTube.
Michael Hardacre, the public liability lawyer representing Ms Jones, said: "Liza says she followed the health and safety instructions on landing, but clearly this wasn't enough to prevent a serious injury, which could have been much worse."
