A mother whose daughter's organs saved a nine-year-old girl's life has said it is a "wonderful feeling" to have been able to help other families.

Organs belonging to Jessica Adderson, 17, from Matlock, Derbyshire, were donated after she was killed in a road accident in 2008.
On Tuesday, her mother Lindsey met, for the first time, Ella Noon, from Wales, who received Jessica's liver.
Mrs Adderson said she was glad the grief she suffered had been prevented.
She said she had discussed organ donation with her daughter only weeks before she died, seven years ago.
Jessica's liver, stem cells, kidneys and lungs were donated, helping to save five lives.
"I received a letter from her mum [Andrea] thanking me for donating Jessica's organs to Ella," said Mrs Adderson.
"I used to keep the letter in my handbag and never responded. I thought about her continuously and had the letter with me for a long time.
"I received that in the same year we donated the organs but never felt I could respond back because of my own grief at that point.
"Jessica made everybody smile; she gave so much love."
Mrs Adderson, 47, Ella and her mother Andrea, 40, met on Tuesday.
Mrs Noon said: "She's here now whereas before she was very poorly, she's [now] a normal girl."
