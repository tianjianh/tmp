[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high school has had to close after a 60ft (18m) monkey puzzle tree fell on to part of the building and cut off electricity supplies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Alban's RC School in Pontypool, Torfaen may have to remain shut on Monday after the tree fell overnight.
Head teacher Michael Coady said the canteen and large parts of the school were "out of action".
Torfaen Council's property services team are at the scene removing the evergreen tree and clearing up.
The council said it hoped the school would reopen on Monday but it depended on how long the clear-up took.
