Oumar Niasse: Hull City striker has three-match ban overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City forward Oumar Niasse has had a three-match ban overturned after his red card against Watford was rescinded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old Senegal international was shown a straight red card for a tackle on M'Baye Niang during Hull's 2-0 win over the Hornets on Saturday.
However, Hull, who are two points above the relegation zone with four games to play, made a successful appeal to the Football Association.
It means Niasse will be available for Hull's trip to Southampton on Saturday.
