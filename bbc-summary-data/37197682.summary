Martin Paterson: Port Vale sign ex-Stoke City and Northern Ireland striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have signed much-travelled former Stoke City, Burnley and Northern Ireland international Martin Paterson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paterson, 29, who has a career tally of 65 goals, spent last term at Blackpool, who were relegated to League Two.
He was also at Huddersfield and Scunthorpe, as well as having loans at Grimsby, Fleetwood and Bristol City.
Vale boss Bruno Ribeiro's 16th signing of the summer comes after Vale allowed fellow striker JJ Hooper to return on loan to Rob Page's Northampton Town.
Tunstall-born Paterson began his career at Stoke, eventually becoming a Â£1m player after Burnley signed him in 2008, when his 19 goals helped the Clarets reach the Premier League for the first time.
Paterson, whose length of stay in Burslem has not yet been disclosed, also briefly played Major League Soccer in the United States with Orlando City.
