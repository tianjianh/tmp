The Belgian father-of-three, 56, was travelling to Cairo for a business meeting, media in Belgium reported.
The head of a logistics company, Mr Supre came from the village of Watervliet in eastern Flanders, close to the Dutch border.
Mr Osman, a 40-year-old geologist and father of two, grew up in Carmarthen in South Wales but is thought to have recently moved to Jersey.
He was the eldest son of the late Dr Mohamed Fekry Ali Osman and wife Anne.
His father had moved to South Wales from his native Egypt to work as a consultant in ear, nose and throat surgery.
Richard Osman was an executive for Jersey-based mining company Centamin and had previously worked in Australia and Egypt.
Canadian media said one of the victims was Ms Hamdy, an executive with IBM originally from Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan, but who had relocated to Cairo.
A family friend told the National Post that Ms Hamdy, a mother of three boys aged between 11 and 16, had been visiting family in Paris.
"I asked her son: 'How do you want people to remember her?'" the family friend, Haleh Banani, told the National Post. "He said, 'As a kind, loving woman, who helped a lot of people.'"
EgyptAir had initially said only one Canadian was on board, but Canada's Foreign Minister Stephane Dion said there were two.
Multiple reports identified the Chadian citizen on board as Mr Mahamat.
A spokesman for Chad's embassy in France, Muhammed Allamine, told the BBC, without confirming his name, that he had just lost his mother.
"He was going to Chad to mourn his mother. He [was] going to give condolences to his family."
Mr Allamine added that the man had been a student at France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr.
Egyptian media identified the couple as being from the city of Mahalla, in northern Egypt. They were reportedly in France where Ms Mossad had sought cancer treatment.
They were returning to Egypt after a month in the French capital, the reports said. They had three young children, who had remained in Egypt.
The mother and son had gone to France for a wedding, friends said.
Mr Shabana, in his 20s, had recently got engaged and his wedding was due later in the year.
The company Procter and Gamble said Mr Helal had managed one of its plants in Amiens, France, and was on board the flight.
He joined the company in 2000 in his native Egypt, it said. He earned a mechanical engineering degree from The American University in Cairo in 1999, the Associated Press news agency reports, quoting his LinkedIn profile.
Media in Normandy, France, said Mr Hess, 51, almost missed the flight after losing his passport days earlier. It was later found in the street in the town of Evreux, where he lived, a community website said (in French).
A minute's silence was held on Friday to remember Mr Hess, a freelance rock photographer, the website said

A spokesman with Algeria's foreign ministry said an Algerian-born woman, Nouha Saoudi, her husband Faycal, daughter Joumana and son Mohammed had been on board.
He said Nouha Saoudi had been naturalised as a French citizen in the western city of Nantes.
Separately, media in France say an unnamed couple in their 40s from Angers, close to Nantes, as well as their two children, were passengers. It is unclear if they are referring to the Bettiche family.
EgyptAir had said on Thursday there were only three children on board.
Reports said the couple from Angers owned a market stall, and that one of their children was a baby.
In an interview late on Thursday, Angers mayor Christophe Bechu said: "They were lovely people, with whom no-one had any problems at all, who'd been here in Angers for some time."

Portuguese media quoted the government as saying the 62-year-old civil engineer was the only Portuguese passenger on the flight.
He was due to travel from Cairo to Accra in Ghana for a conference, the Correio da Manha newspaper reported (in Portuguese).
Egypt's al-Ahram newspaper and AP reported that Ms al-Khawaga, a Saudi national who worked at her country's embassy in Cairo, was one of the victims.
She had worked in Cairo for 13 years, AP said, and had been following up on her daughter's medical treatment in Paris.
The Cairo-based Lebanese film director Osman Abu Laban wrote on his Facebook page that he had lost four members of his family in the crash - his uncle and aunt, as well as his cousin and his cousin's wife.
