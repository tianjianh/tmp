The US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS) has targeted 12 oil refineries in Syria on a third night of air strikes against the militants.

Raids carried out by US, Saudi and UAE aircraft killed 14 of the group's fighters and five civilians in eastern Syria, activists said.
According to the Pentagon, the refineries generated up to $2m (Â£1.2m) per day in revenue for the militants.
In northern Syria, Kurdish forces say they have pushed back an IS advance.
US President Barack Obama has vowed to dismantle the IS "network of death".

IS has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq in recent months and controls several oilfields. Sales of smuggled crude oil have helped finance its offensive in both countries.
The US has launched nearly 200 air strikes against the militants in Iraq since August and expanded the operation against IS to Syria on Monday.
In other developments:
Ten fighters from the UAE and Saudi Arabia joined six US jets to carry out Wednesday night's strikes, the Pentagon said.
The strikes hit "small-scale" refineries that were producing "between 300-500 barrels of refined petroleum per day".
"We are still assessing the outcome of the attack on the refineries, but have initial indications that the strikes were successful," the US Central Command said in a statement.
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm John Kirby said the purpose of the strikes was "not necessarily to kill militants" but to destroy the facilities, which were funding IS through the black market.
He said the Pentagon was looking into reports that civilians had been killed in coalition air strikes.
Planes came "with a terrifying sound and red lights before the explosions", said one activist quoted by AP news agency.
The strikes killed 14 IS fighters in Deir al-Zour and five civilians in Hassakeh, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that monitors the Syrian conflict.
Kurdish forces said they had pushed back IS fighters near the Syrian town of Kobane, close to the border with Turkey.
There are reports of heavy gunfire outside the town, and Kurdish commanders have again called for coalition air strikes on IS positions in the area.
IS had besieged Kobane for several days, taking control of the surrounding villages and forcing more than 140,000 Syrian Kurds to flee into Turkey.
The BBC's Mark Lowen, who is on the Syria-Turkey border, says some of those Kurds are now trying to return to Kobane to fight with the Kurdish militia.
Turkey has been overwhelmed by an estimated 1.5 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees since the conflict in Syria between opposition forces and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began three years ago.
On Wednesday, the UN Security Council adopted a binding resolution compelling states to prevent their nationals joining jihadists in Iraq and Syria.
The US says more than 40 countries have offered to join the anti-IS coalition.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said the British military is ready to "play its part" in the fight against IS and the UK Parliament has been recalled to discuss plans for air strikes.
