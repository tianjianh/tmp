Jobs lost at Aberdeen engineering firm Enterprise Engineering Service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 50 jobs have been lost at a 50-year-old Aberdeen engineering firm - with dozens more at risk - after administrators were called in due to the effects of the low oil price.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 54 people have been made redundant at Enterprise Engineering Services, with four more in Caithness.
A further 49 employees - 46 in Aberdeen and three in Caithness - have been sent home pending clarification.
The remaining eight in Aberdeen have been retained to assist administrators.
KPMG has been appointed to EESL - which has a total of 115 employees - as well as Craigshaw Holdings, the holding company.
EESL, which has been trading since 1966, offers engineering services including design, fabrication, assembly, installation and inspection.
KPMG said that orders had dropped due to the "sustained drop in the price of oil".
Blair Nimmo, of KPMG, said: "Enterprise Engineering Services Limited has a long history of servicing the energy industry across the UK but, like many businesses in the sector, it has been negatively impacted by the low oil price and the consequent reduction in upstream activity.
"However, the company has a strong reputation in its markets, together with an asset base which will be of interest to other operators, principally comprising its forward order book, two property facilities, and a variety of machinery in addition to Intellectual Property.
"We are currently working with retained staff to realise all assets, and will provide all employees affected by redundancies with appropriate guidance and support.
"We will do everything we can to seek a buyer who may be able to protect the company and would encourage any party who has an interest in acquiring the company's business and its assets to contact us as soon as possible."
