Dover immigration centre to be closed and detainees moved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The immigration removal centre in Dover is to close with detainees being transferred to other centres around the UK, the Home Office has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre, which holds about 600 people, will close by 1 November.
A Home Office spokesman said centres needed to be "modern, secure" and with "easy access to the airports from which removals take place".
It is not known what will happen to the jobs of the 200 people employed at the centre.
The spokesman added: "We keep our detention estate under constant review and have decided the site at Dover should no longer be used as an immigration removal centre.
"All detainees will be transferred to other immigration removal centres."
Dover is run by the Prison Service and holds appellant and failed asylum seekers.
