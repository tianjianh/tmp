[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stranoch wind farm public inquiry starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public inquiry is set to get under way into plans for a 24-turbine wind farm in south west Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council has already lodged a formal objection to Wind Prospect's plans on moorland at Stranoch, near New Luce.
Developers say it could produce enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 40,000 homes.
The council has expressed its concerns about the cumulative impact of the scheme on the area.
The public inquiry, at the North West Castle Hotel in Stranraer, is expected to last three days.
It will be conducted by a reporter appointed by the Scottish government.
