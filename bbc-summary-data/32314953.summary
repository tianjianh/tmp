The shop chain, which also owns footwear specialist Size? and outdoor specialists Blacks and Millets, said pre-tax profit rose 18% to Â£90.5m.
Premium-branded footwear and clothing sales made up for a weaker performance in its outdoor shops, which had been hurt by the mild winter, it said.
"An outstanding performance" in sports fashion drove the results, it added.
It said demand for branded footwear was "buoyant" across Western Europe, with exclusive sports deals helping to "enthuse and excite" customers.
The business, whose main rival is Sports Direct in the UK, had 660 sports fashion stores at the end of the financial year, including 351 JD Sports outlets in the UK and Ireland and 70 shops in Europe. It also owns 184 outdoor stores,
JD Sports also revealed it had made a Â£6.3m loss on its Bank fashion chain, which it sold to restructuring firm Hilco Capital in November. The chain went into administration two months later.
