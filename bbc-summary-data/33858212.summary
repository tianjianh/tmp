[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 1-1 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richard Brodie scored on his full debut as Aldershot drew against Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward, who failed to net in his first two appearances since joining from Southport, met Jim Stevenson's pinpoint pass before slotting home.
Dover had taken the lead after just seven minutes as Stefan Payne found space on the edge of the box, turned his marker, and found the corner.
Payne's 25-yard strike was tipped over by keeper Paul Smith late on, as both sides settled for a point apiece.
Aldershot Town manager Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"I think we were disappointed with our first-half performance, but credit to the boys for coming out in the second half, playing a much higher tempo and creating chances.
"We didn't start sharp enough and allowed them to dictate the play and we should be doing it to them at home.
"It's a great finish (from Brodie) and that's why we've brought him here - to score goals."
