The actress's father was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.
Smith had been due to perform songs from Funny Girl, the musical she recently starred in, at the event at the Hammersmith Apollo on 6 December.
A representative for the actress said: "Sheridan's much-loved father sadly passed away this week."
She asked for privacy for Smith and her family "at this difficult time".
Smith pulled out of several performances of Funny Girl in March when she learned of her father's illness.
She later took a break citing stress and exhaustion, but returned in July and is scheduled to go on tour with the musical from February.
Colin Smith was with his daughter at the 2011 Olivier awards when she won best actress in a musical for her appearance in Legally Blonde.
In an interview the previous year, the actress revealed her parents performed as a country and western duo called The Daltons.
"They used to perform seven nights a week, and when I was four I joined them on stage doing little dance routines," she told the Telegraph.
"They don't often have gigs at weekends now, but if they do I'll be there joining in."
