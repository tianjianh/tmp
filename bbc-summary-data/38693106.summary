[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury asked for a "leniency" for a 17-year-old boy they convicted of stabbing an ex-friend to death in east London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of the murder of Charlie Kutyauripo, 16, following a retrial.
In a rare move, the jury sent a note to "recommend the defendant leniency" to the judge, before delivering its unanimous verdict.
The trial was adjourned until sentencing on Wednesday.
The court had heard Charlie collapsed and died shortly after he was attacked outside a sports centre in Woodford on 9 January 2016.
The incident was captured on CCTV and witnessed by several people who had been attending an invite-only birthday party, which was a no-alcohol policy and parents manning the doors.
Charlie was taken to Whipps Cross Hospital where died shortly afterwards.
A post-mortem examination showed he had been stabbed twice, including a fatal wound to the heart.
The court heard the two boys had been friends but fell out in a row over a tracksuit the defendant had not given back to Charlie.
The youth claimed his actions were in self-defence, saying Charlie was a member of the Hainault gang.
Giving evidence, the defendant claimed threats against him had been placed on social media before the party.
The defendant said he armed himself because he was expecting gang members who had attacked him twice before, due to a previous relationship with a girl, to be at the party.
Judge Rebecca Poulet QC thanked the jury for the care they had taken in what she described as a very "sad" case.
