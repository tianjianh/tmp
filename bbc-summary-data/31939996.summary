Bristol City and Rovers fans unite to help Oskar Pycroft walk

Football fans from both Bristol clubs have set off on a sponsored walk to Wembley in aid of a Whitchurch boy with cerebral palsy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bristol City and Rovers supporters are helping to raise Â£70,000 to pay for surgery to help Oskar Pycroft to walk.
Surgery which would reduce the pain in six-year-old Oskar's legs is unavailable on the NHS.
He is due to lead City out at Wembley for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final against Walsall on Sunday.
The surgery, called selective dorsal rhyzotomy (SDR), involves locating malfunctioning nerves and cutting them. It would also reduce bone deformations which occur as he grows.
The surgery would be carried out in hospital in the US.
