Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale announces new frontbench team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has made just one change to the party's frontbench team at Holyrood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugh Henry has stood down as justice spokesman and has been replaced by Graeme Pearson.
Ms Dugdale revealed the line-up in Edinburgh, just days after she secured the leadership of the party.
Her rival for the top post, Ken Macintosh, has been given the community spokesman role, covering housing, local government and planning.
She has also maintained a gender-balanced team, with five women joining her, alongside six men.
Ms Dugdale said: "I am excited about the future. We all know the big task that faces Scottish Labour in the months and years ahead, but we're up for it. My new team has a good mix of experience and vision to start the task of renewing Scottish Labour.
"The most important goal of any party must be to ensure that the life chances of our young people are determined by their potential, work rate and ambition, not by their background. These values will drive my team in every portfolio."
Ms Dugdale succeeded former MP Jim Murphy, who resigned in June after Labour lost 40 of its 41 Scottish seats at Westminster.
If Labour's new team looks a lot like the old team assembled by Jim Murphy, when he was leader, then that's because it is.
The names and faces are mostly the same.
One exception is that Hugh Henry has stood down as justice spokesman, to be replaced by former police chief, Graeme Pearson.
Mr Pearson supported Ken Macintosh for the leadership but that has not prevented either of them making the frontbench.
Kezia Dugdale says she doesn't bear grudges.
She has retained Jenny Marra, Iain Gray and Jackie Baillie in the key roles of health, education and finance.
However, their remits have been expanded and their job titles rebranded to reflect Labour values - equality, opportunity, public services.
The new leader wants her team to champion what the party stands for in the run up to next year's Holyrrood elections while also holding SNP ministers to account.
