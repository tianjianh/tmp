The 32-year-old, who has scored 4,492 runs and taken 285 wickets in 277 career Twenty20 appearances, will be available to play throughout June.
He joins Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara, who will feature in all three forms of the game for the county.
"Dwayne is one of the top all-rounders in world T20 cricket," Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart said.
"He's played with great success wherever he's been, so to secure his services is a great coup for us," the former England wicketkeeper added.
Bravo has played 40 Tests, 164 one-day internationals and 55 Twenty20 internationals for the West Indies.
The Trinidad-born right-hander has recently been playing for Melbourne Renegades in Australia's Big Bash and will represent the Rajkot franchise in the upcoming Indian Premier League.
