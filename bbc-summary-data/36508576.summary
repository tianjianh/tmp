The 22-year-old looked in distress, clutching her right shoulder area, as she failed her first two attempts to snatch 92kg in the 63kg category.
British Weightlifing will assess the extent of the injury before deciding on Rio, with the team named in early July.
Rebekah Tiler set a new record GB total of 227kg to win the 69kg title.
Smith, who won a bronze medal in April at the European Championships, has already secured the Olympic qualifying standard and is the leading British women's candidate for selection.
Tiler, 17, has also attained the qualifying standard and took three bronzes at the European Championships.
British Weightlifting chief executive Ashley Metcalf said: "We will have the time to assess the extent of Zoe's injury before any decisions regarding Olympic selection can be made.
"Our aim is to take the strongest team possible to Rio. The selection meeting for both the men's and women's places is on Tuesday 21st June before the final team announcement to follow in early July."
In the men's 94kg event Sonny Webster outlifted Owen Boxall to take the title and put himself in contention for selection with a total of 346kg to Boxall's 343kg.
