The 27-year-old came through the youth ranks at Sixways and has made 173 first-team appearances.
"I have witnessed a lot of change but, under the current regime, we're in the perfect place to become the best we've ever been," Arr told the club website.
"I want to continue to be a part of developing Warriors into a successful top-tier side."
Arr, who has been with the club since he was 10 years old, made his first-team debut in 2007 and also helped England's Under-20 side win the Six Nations Grand Slam in 2008.
"Jonny epitomises everything we are trying to achieve at this club," added Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan.
"He recognises the importance of competition for places to make a strong squad and continues to raise his game.
"His commitment, professionalism and experience are key attributes and he is a great role model for our younger players."
The length of his new contract has not been disclosed by the club.
