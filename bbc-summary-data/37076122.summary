About 385 children and adults gathered at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday to raise awareness of bereavement charity 2 Wish Upon A Star.
Founder Rhian Burke thanked those who took part, saying their effort would "never be forgotten".
The record was confirmed by Guinness World Records.
Mrs Burke set up the charity following the sudden deaths of her son George and husband Paul in 2012.
She said they chose the elephant mascot because child bereavement was often like the "elephant in the room" and was something people were often afraid to discuss.
2 Wish Upon A Star works with 14 of the 15 emergency units across Wales and has supported over 50 families in the last 12 months.
