Second-placed Arbroath were winners away to Edinburgh City while Elgin City, who are third, triumphed at Montrose.
Clyde dropped out of the top four after losing away to Stirling Albion and Berwick Rangers moved off bottom place and sent opponents Cowdenbeath to the foot of the table.
At Galabank, Annan went ahead with Max Wright winning and converting a penalty but Jim Lister headed Forfar level before the break and Callum Home's own goal gave the Loons a 2-1 victory.
A trialist gave Arbroath an early lead against Edinburgh and Omar Kader's strike ensured a 2-0 win for the visitors.
Shane Sutherland struck either side of half-time to complete a 3-0 win for Elgin at Links Park, Chris Dodd having given City the lead.
Though Annan lost, they moved above Clyde into third on goal difference after the Bully Wee suffered a 3-0 loss at Forthbank Stadium.
Ross Kavanagh headed Stirling ahead in the first half and Dylan Nguene Bikey struck twice after the break.
It was goalless at Central Park until the 84th minute, when Steven Thomson headed Berwick ahead to allow them to leapfrog both Cowdenbeath and Montrose.
