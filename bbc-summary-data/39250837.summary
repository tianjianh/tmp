[SN]TITLE[SN]
Referendum to be held over Irish presidential election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish government is to hold a referendum to allow Irish citizens living outside of the Republic of Ireland, including in Northern Ireland, the right to vote in Irish presidential elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny told a gathering in Philadelphia on Sunday that the decision had been taken at a cabinet meeting last week.
He said it was a "clear recognition of the importance that Ireland attached to her citizens wherever they were".
The move was recommended by a Constitutional Convention in 2013.
Last July, the Diaspora Minister Joe McHugh said there was a commitment to hold a referendum.
An options paper will be published later this month outlining arrangements on how to register citizens abroad, and how to facilitate voting outside of the Republic of Ireland.
This will then be discussed during the Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin in May.
The referendum is unlikely to be held this year, and if it passes, would come into effect for the presidential election after the one set for 2018.
During his visit to Philadelphia, at the beginning of the taoiseach's annual St Patrick's Day trip, Mr Kenny told a separate gathering that the "plight" of thousands of illegal Irish immigrants living in the United States would be an "absolute priority" during his visit.
He has vowed to raise the issue with President Donald Trump and said that undocumented Irish immigrants wanted to remain and contribute in the US.
