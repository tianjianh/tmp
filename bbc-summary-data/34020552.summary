Andrew Wilsea, 41, died following a crash with a Rover 45 at about 18:40 BST on Tuesday near to a waste management site on Gelderd Road, Leeds.
Detectives have released an image of two cars whose drivers they want to speak to in relation to the incident.
A 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has been released on police bail.
Det Sgt Carole Greaves said: "From studying footage we believe that the blue vehicle was travelling behind the Rover 45 prior to it losing control and the black vehicle was heading towards it.
"I believe that the drivers of both vehicles will have key information to assist me with my investigation."
