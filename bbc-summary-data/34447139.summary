They also claimed the season's single highest attendance with 3,180 supporters at the Academy Stadium on Sunday, as City beat Notts County on the final day of the 2015 WSL 1 campaign.
England's success at this summer's World Cup appears to have had a major impact on women's football, with attendances up by 29% compared to matches before the tournament.
FA director of football participation and development Kelly Simmons said: "The sheer increase in attendances we've seen this season shows just what appetite there is for the women's game in this country.
"2015 has been a landmark year for women's football, with the success of the England team at the World Cup and the first-ever SSE Women's FA Cup Final at Wembley, and this is another marker of just how far the game has come."
