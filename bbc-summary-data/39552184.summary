Cardiff City captain Sean Morrison is hoping midfielder Peter Whittingham will stay at the Championship club beyond the end of the season.

Whittingham, Cardiff's longest serving player having joined in 2007, has been asked to take a pay cut to remain at the club.
Morrison said the 32-year-old had not indicated whether he would sign a new contract to remain with the Bluebirds.
"It would be fantastic for Whitts to stay," Morrison said.
"He's been a great servant to the club and he's still a fantastic player. He loves the club."
The former England Under-21 international's half volley secured a 2-1 victory for Cardiff against Brentford after defender Morrison had earlier equalised for Neil Warnock's side.
Whittingham has made over 450 appearances for Cardiff, who he joined from Aston Villa in January 2007 and Morrison says he remains a key player.
"He's probably not played as much as he'd want to this year, coming into the second half of the season," Morrison added.
"But when he's come in he's been brilliant and his assists are something you can't buy in the Championship.
"He's a level above sometimes with his delivery and his passing and he calms the play down."
