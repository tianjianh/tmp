Angels help Leamington Spa shoppers avoid parking fines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flock of "parking angels" has been recruited by traders to help shoppers avoid fines while Christmas shopping.

The heavenly host of four will patrol the streets of Leamington Spa to direct motorists to spaces, help with change and even add 20p to the meter if a car is about to go over its allocated time.
Equipped with trumpets, they have said they will also blow their horns if they spot a traffic warden approaching.
The angelic duties get under way on Thursday.

The idea came from the local Business Improvement District (BID) partnership.
Organisers said the aim is "to generally add a little bit of cheer into the day of shoppers" as well as boost trade.
Matt Crooks, from BID, said: "We were thinking that parking in town at Christmas is difficult, and we were wondering what we could do to make that whole experience a little bit more fun and a little bit more festive, and therefore we came up with the idea of parking angels."
Warwickshire County Council said that while it welcomes initiatives that bring shoppers in to the town, if drivers overstay their welcome in parking bays they will get a fine.
The county council's income last year from parking penalty charge notices was Â£700,000.
