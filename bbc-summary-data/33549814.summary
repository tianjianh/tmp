Public Health England (PHE) is warning people to not eat any cold pre-cooked meats and savouries bought since 25 June from Robinsons butchers in Wingate and Billingham.
Seven confirmed cases and one suspected one have been reported in the past week in both adults and children, PHE said.
A spokesman for Robinsons said it was discarding all ready to eat food.
PHE said the precautionary advice had been issued to residents in County Durham and North Tees after an investigation began into the possible source of an outbreak of E. coli O157.
Dr Deb Wilson, chairwoman of the outbreak control team, said: "The source of this outbreak is not yet known, however, several of the affected people are known to have eaten cooked meat products bought or supplied by Robinsons' butcher shops in either Wingate or Billingham.
"The owner and staff of Robinsons butchers and caterers are co-operating fully with the investigation and have agreed to discard all ready-to-eat food from both premises while the investigation continues."
The company has agreed to carry out a deep clean of both premises and reinforce good hygiene practices, PHE said.
Anyone who has bought cooked meats or savouries since 25 June and still has them in their fridge or freezer, is advised to throw them away immediately.
E. coli is a species of bacterium which is found in the intestines of animals and humans.
Symptoms of the O157 strain can range from mild diarrhoea to haemorrhagic colitis - a combination of severe abdominal cramps and blood in the stools.
