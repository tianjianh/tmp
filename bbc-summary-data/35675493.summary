[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callum Harriott scored twice as Charlton won at Brentford to move within seven points of safety at the wrong end of the Championship table.

Harriott scored after just 19 seconds, then got his second in the 69th minute, to earn Jose Riga's Addicks their first win in six games.
In between, Brentford rarely looked like adding to centre-back Joann Barbet's debut goal in the 26th minute.
Dean Smith's side were booed off after their fifth defeat in six matches.

The day started badly for the Bees, almost straight from the kick-off, when Morgan Fox's left-wing cross was only half cleared by Harlee Dean and the ball fell kindly for midfielder Harriott to coolly side foot home from 12 yards.
Brentford's only real attacking threat came from Alan Judge, who stung Charlton keeper Nick Pope's fingertips with a dipping drive midway through the first half - and it was from the Irishman's corner that Brentford equalised midway through the first half, when Barbet headed in close range at the far post.

But Charlton were back in front when home keeper David Button dropped a speculative cross and it fell for Harriott, who fired past two defenders on the line.
Charlton might even have stretched their lead in the dying minutes as Brentford pushed forward for the equaliser, on-loan Arsenal youngster Yaya Sanogo looking a constant threat.
But the visitors saw it through for only their second win in 19 games. And they Addicks are now unbeaten in their last three visits to Griffin Park - the first time they have done that since the 1920s.
Brentford boss Dean Smith: "We tried to get one in on loan this week but got knocked back but we will keep looking to get something done in the loan market, but it is a difficult time to get things done.
"We didn't create enough but when we did we didn't finish it off. Balls were flashing into the box with no one taking responsibility to get across the keeper and get a touch.
"We had chances but Sergi Canos pulled one wide and John Swift stays on his feet when he could have gone down and that showed a little bit of naivety."
Charlton boss Jose Riga: "We were very organised defensively and in attack and we deserved the win.
"It's good to be off the bottom even though we didn't make up ground, but all we can do is our job and I saw my team, players and staff keeping the same mindset - next time other results may be in our favour."
