They beat Romania's Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau 6-2 3-6 6-4.
Nadal is also through to the semi-finals of the men's singles after beating Thomasz Bellucci of Brazil in three sets and will face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina.
Jack Sock and Steve Johnson of USA won bronze with a 6-2 6-4 win over Daniel Nestor and Vasek Popisil of Canada.
Nadal said his partner was a close friend even though they had little experience of playing together.
"It is a privilege to be able to share this moment with one of my best friends," said the 14-time Grand Slam winner.
Nadal, who won men's singles gold in Beijing in 2008, could face Britain's Andy Murray in the singles final.
The Scot faces Japan's Kei Nishikori in Saturday's other semi-final.
