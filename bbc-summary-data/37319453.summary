[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A palm print found on a van used in the murders of 10 Protestant workmen is believed to belong to a man arrested last month, an inquest has heard.

The man, who was arrested in Newry, was later released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
On Friday, police confirmed to the Kingsmills inquest that the palm print belonged to the 59-year-old.
Previously, they had said only that the arrest was "in connection" with the print.
In May, police announced they were reopening their inquiry into the Kingsmills massacre following the discovery of the palm print on a getaway van.
At the inquest on Friday, a lawyer for some of the families asked for more clarity and the police confirmed that they believe the print belongs to the man who was arrested.
The inquest was adjourned with the coroner explaining to the families of those killed that he hopes to find out soon if the man will be prosecuted and what that will mean for the inquest.
The 10 workmen were shot dead by an IRA gang after their mini-bus was stopped near the County Armagh village of Kingsmills.
Those who were killed were travelling home from work in a textile factory when they were ambushed.
An 11th man, Alan Black, survived despite being seriously injured.
A Catholic man who had been on the bus was ordered to leave before the shootings.
The investigation was reopened shortly after an inquest into the killings was launched, following a 13-year campaign by victims' relatives.
