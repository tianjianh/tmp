NI airports struggle to land Germany routes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tourism statistics reveal Germans rank high in the number of visitors to Northern Ireland, yet local airports struggle to land a direct air link.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the top 10 places of origin of overnight tourists, Germany is fifth.
Dublin currently offers 117 return flights to Germany every week, covering places like Hamburg, Munich, Cologne and Dusseldorf.
German airlines and tour operators see Dublin as serving the whole island of Ireland.
Easyjet used to have a route between Belfast and Berlin, while Aer Lingus briefly did Belfast to Munich, but that was years ago.
It was not that passenger numbers were bad, but priorities simply changed for both airlines.
Any operator in Northern Ireland already - or anyone thinking of it - would want commitments from German tour operators and travel agents to sell seats.
And that is not proving straightforward.
"They will not commit as they have Dublin an hour down the road," says one person familiar with the situation.
Alongside Canada (whose visitors incidentally rank 8th), Germany is the number one priority for the Northern Ireland Executive in terms of a new air route.
But take-off is delayed.
