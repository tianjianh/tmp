[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Homeless people in Bristol have been given clothes, food and bedding to help them cope with life on the streets.

Keep Bristol Warm has been asking people to fill a rucksack full of items and bring them to Bristol's Bearpit.
Official figures last week from the city council recorded the number of people sleeping rough in Bristol as 74.
A project called Pending Coffee was also launched on Sunday. Here customers at a number of shops can buy an extra cup for homeless people to pick up.
Organiser Gavyn Emery said he started the project last year after seeing something similar in Edinburgh.
"I saw a poor chap on the street with his dog and I thought I wanted to do something in Bristol.
"My dad said this is just a simple initiative of people giving to people."
