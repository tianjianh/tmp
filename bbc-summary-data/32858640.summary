Clare Ellarby, of Miss Elegance on Low Lane in Birstall, West Yorkshire said: "I don't know how we are going to carry on if these dresses aren't found."
The 60 dresses were stolen by the suspects, who used a black Astra, just before midnight on Thursday.
The raid has left some customers without a dress for forthcoming proms.
Ms Ellarby said she and staff would do "everything we can" to try and make sure customers get a dress to wear.
She urged anyone with information on the "devastating" raid to come forward and contact West Yorkshire Police.
Thieves smashed their way through a front door and grabbed the dresses, Mrs Ellarby added.
