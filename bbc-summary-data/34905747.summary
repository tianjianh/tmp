A number of items of gold jewellery that have been hidden for more than 2,000 years have been uncovered.

The gold torques and rings were removed from one of the largest hoards of Celtic coins ever discovered.
Experts from Jersey Heritage working at the Hogue Bie Museum discovered the gold while removing coins.
The hoard was found by metal detector enthusiasts Reg Mead and Richard Miles who had been searching for it for more than 30 years after hearing rumours.
Neil Mahrer, in charge of separating the coins for Jersey Heritage, said: "We have been removing coins from the hoard for about 15 months now and have removed 30,000 of about 70,000 coins.
"It is important for us to keep a track of where the gold is within the hoard and so we have paced ourselves in removing it, taking two large pieces out each day for a week."
He said the gold torques were the equivalent of royal jewellery to the people who left the hoard. He said they "would only have been worn by very important individuals."
When the gold has been removed fully they will take samples from their hollow centres to get organic material.
Mr Mahrer said this would tell them what was going on when they were buried.
"The gold jewellery is the most spectacular thing. We left them all on the surface until we removed the coins around them and are now slowly removing them," he said.
It will take about another year and a half to remove all the remaining coins and objects.
