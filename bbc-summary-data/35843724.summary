[SN]TITLE[SN]
PC Dave Phillips death: Teenager cleared of attempting to wound second PC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager accused of murdering a Merseyside police officer has been found not guilty of attempting to wound another officer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clayton Williams, 19, denied attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent on PC Thomas Birkett by driving a stolen truck towards him.
His colleague, PC Dave Phillips, 34, died after he was hit by the truck in Wallasey last October.
Mr Williams claims he did not intend to injure the officer and denies murder.
The jury is continuing to deliberate over the murder charge in relation to PC Phillips and will return to Manchester Crown Court on Monday.
PC Phillips and PC Birkett had been responding to reports of a burglary in Birkenhead before the collision.
They had been attempting to stop the vehicle using a tyre-puncturing "stinger" device.
Fellow officers tried to save PC Phillips' life but he died shortly after arriving at hospital.
Mr Williams has admitted the burglary in which the car was stolen and a charge of aggravated vehicle taking.
