A new advisory panel will examine ways Stormont can help deal with the high energy costs faced by manufacturing companies in Northern Ireland.

It comes after Ballymena's Michelin tyre plant announced it would close in 2018 with the loss of 860 jobs.
Michelin and other large businesses in Northern Ireland have long warned about the impact of high energy costs.
However, news of the closure was blamed on a decrease in demand for truck tyres in Europe since the financial crisis.
Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell said he wants the panel to deliver proposals by the end of next February.
But he said his response would be limited by wholesale energy costs, which are set by  global markets.
The minister recently met the Utility Regulator and System Operator Northern Ireland to discuss if "market reform" would help.
However, he said: "Taking costs off one group means increasing them for others and we currently have the highest level of fuel poverty in the UK.
"I do not want anyone to think there is a quick fix."
