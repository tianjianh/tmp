The Independent, the Guardian and  
          Daily Star
 lead with the possible hacking of Sara Payne's phone.
The  
          Guardian
 says the revelation will revive speculation about the role of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks in the affair.
And the   
          Independent calls the latest development in the continuing scandal a "sinister new twist".
A man described as a former English Defence League activist has admitted to  
          the Times
 that he could have inspired Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik.
Paul Ray, who the paper says has fled to Malta fearing arrest, says he had direct contacts with Mr Breivik.
However, he said he rejected Mr Breivik as a Facebook friend because he "didn't like the look of him".
He says what Mr Breivik has done is "pure evil" and "does not equate" to anything he's involved in.
The  
          Daily Mail attacks David Cameron and Nick Clegg for failing to tackle the growth in plastic carrier bags,
 despite promises made in opposition.
It says tackling the scourge of carrier bag pollution is more useful and popular with voters than "putting exorbitant taxes on fuel bills".
The  
          Sun wants shops to cut back on them but is against the 5p tax on bags which has been mooted.
"We don't need any more taxes," says the paper.
The  
          Daily Telegraph 
tells how police seized a stolen motorbike in a raid on a house in Edinburgh and spent a further four hours searching the property for other stolen goods.
The Yamaha machine has been returned to its rightful owner.
It transpired that he bought the bike a few weeks earlier at a police auction of unclaimed stolen goods.
The householder, who said the raid was embarrassing and stressful, has demanded an apology and compensation.
