Manchester City have "a point to prove" after their struggles to defend their Premier League title last season, says captain Vincent Kompany.

The Belgium defender added to Yaya Toure's first-half brace as City won 3-0 at West Brom in their opening game.
"Last season was below what we're used to doing," said Kompany, 29.
"There are a lot of favourite teams now and we're not part of it, I've heard. It's something that gives us extra motivation."
City, runners-up to Chelsea last season, dominated at The Hawthorns on Monday, with BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage saying their performance was "on a different planet" and that they looked the best team following the opening weekend of the new campaign.
A Toure shot trickled in after appearing to be deflected off team-mate David Silva to give the visitors the lead after nine minutes.
Toure then scored a fine second in the 24th minute before Kompany headed in Silva's corner to complete the win for City, who host champions Chelsea on Sunday.
"It will be a big game very early in the season," said Kompany, speaking to Sky Sports.
"We can't go into it thinking it's about winning the league, but it will matter so we need to put in a great performance."
Raheem Sterling made his City debut after his controversial Â£49m move from Liverpool this summer and he failed to take two good chances.
However, Kompany believes the 20-year-old England forward's pace has added to City's attacking threat.
"The main thing is that we have some new tools to use this season," he said. "Raheem has given us sharpness and speed to hurt teams when we're defending.
"It gives other teams things to think about. It gives us that bit of danger we need and we have so many tools to hurt teams."
Toure, who went off with an apparent injury late on, was sometimes criticised for his performances last season but put in an impressive display, along with Silva, to inspire City to victory.
"We know what he can give to our team in every game," said manager Manuel Pellegrini.
"Yaya had a strange year last year. It was not the way he normally started a season. He had many problems, with the death of his brother, and then problems with his agent.
"Now he is more calm and we will see the same Yaya that we know."

West Brom manager Tony Pulis conceded that he employed the wrong tactics in playing two strikers - Rickie Lambert and Saido Berahino.
"I said to the players after the game I have to take responsibility for this one. I played Saido Berahino and Rickie Lambert and that left the midfield too open. It went against the principles I have always worked to and it has given me a rude awakening.
"I won't be doing that against the big teams. You have to make sure you fill the midfield and don't get out-numbered. I want to be positive but that has taught me a lesson."
