[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth trafficking trial: Workers 'forced to urinate in bottles'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vulnerable eastern Europeans were trafficked to Plymouth and ordered to "urinate in bottles" and "eat outside", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plymouth Crown Court was told the victims from the Czech Republic were brought to the UK and forced into compulsory labour.
The jury heard victims slept on a floor and in garages while the defendants pocketed their wages.
Five people deny trafficking and other charges.
The defendants are:
Judge Paul Darlow told the jury an earlier trial had to be stopped after concern about one of the interpreters.
Malcolm Galloway, prosecuting, told the court how the victims, some of whom worked as house servants, were sometimes threatened with violence or told their families at home were at risk.
The trial continues.
