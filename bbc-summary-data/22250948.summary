Warwickshire: Rikki Clarke signs new contract at Edgbaston

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All-rounder Rikki Clarke has committed his long-term future to county champions Warwickshire by signing a new four-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clarke, 31, who has played two Test matches and 20 one-day internationals for England, started his career with his native Surrey.
Having left to join Derbyshire, he then moved on to Edgbaston in 2008.
Guildford-born Clarke is now contracted to remain with the Bears until at least the end of the 2017 season.
Clarke had not represented his country since 2006 but his form last summer both in first-class and one-day cricket earned him a place in the England Lions tour squad.
And he was one of six Bears players selected earlier this month for the provisional 30-man England one-day squad for this summer's Champions Trophy.
