An injured dog which was first thought to have been thrown from a car on a busy dual carriageway had probably escaped from home and run across the road, police say.

The King Charles spaniel was found on the A38 near Kennford service station in Devon on Thursday afternoon.
The owners of the dog, which suffered two suspected broken legs, have now been traced.
CCTV footage is being reviewed  by police "to shed light" on the incident.
