The 31-year-old, an Olympic downhill gold medallist in 2010 and world champion in 2009, finished the 2.6km course in one minute and 37.1 seconds.
Canada's Larisa Yurkiw was second, 0.28 seconds behind, with Swiss Lara Gut third, 0.67 seconds off the pace.
The victory sees Vonn surpass Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell's record of 36.
It was Vonn's 74th win on the World Cup circuit overall, edging her closer to the record of 86 set by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark.
Gut retains the overall lead in World Cup standings, with 810 points compared with Vonn's 800, but that margin could narrow again on Sunday in the Super-G, scheduled for 10:30 GMT.
