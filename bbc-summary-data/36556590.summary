Wales must keep up with New Zealand for the full 80 minutes in Wellington on Saturday or the world champions will run away with victory, says kicking coach Neil Jenkins.

Wales lost 39-21 in the first Test, leading after an hour before conceding 21 unanswered points.
The Welsh have lost 27 consecutive games against the All Blacks, with their last win coming in 1953.
"We've got to keep up with the pace of the game," said Jenkins.
"Not just 60 minutes, it's got to be 70 minutes, it's got to be 80 minutes. It's that simple, otherwise the scoreline can be as it was.
"It was 25-21 after 64 minutes [last week] and then it blows out to 39-21 and that can happen very quickly against New Zealand."
Steve Hansen's side kicked on in the final quarter at Eden Park, with the All Blacks replacements helping to take the game away from Wales.
Former British and Irish Lion Jenkins says Wales' reinforcements need to have a similar impact.
"It's not a game for 15 players anymore, it's a match-day 23 so no matter who comes on they have to front up, perform and make a big impact, as probably the All Blacks boys did last week.
"They're all comfortable with the ball in hand, no matter what position they play in. For us, that's something we can learn and get better at.
"We've certainly got skills across the board, but maybe not quite to the standard that we need them at this moment in time."
Twice-capped Rhys Patchell starts at full-back at the Westpac Stadium and Jenkins, who played at both fly-half and full-back for Wales, says his advice to the 23-year-old is just to enjoy the occasion.
"He's an exciting talent and he likes to play with the ball in hand and he's obviously got a pretty good kicking game as well," he said.
"I'm sure tomorrow he will hopefully enjoy the occasion and play the game in front of him, make the right decisions and I'm sure he will do that.
"The most important thing we can tell him is just go out and enjoy yourself.
"You're playing against the best side in the world, there's no better place to test your skills."
