[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conor Munro attacked Nicole Jarrett after she poured his whisky down the sink at the supported accommodation in Arbroath where he was staying.
A court heard the attack was carried out in front of staff who did not intervene "for their own safety."
Sheriff Alastair Brown had sent Munro's case to the High Court in Edinburgh, which has greater sentencing powers.
Munro, 24, admitted the offences, which were committed on 21 September last year.
Judge Lord Ericht said Munro had subjected his victim to "a terrifying attack" and in addition to the prison sentence said he would impose a 12-month supervised release order on him.
One of the conditions of the supervision period is that Munro must inform his supervisor of any developing romantic relationships.
