[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford survived a second-half fightback from Super League strugglers Huddersfield to seal victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denny Solomona put Cas ahead and Jake Webster restored their lead after Jamie Ellis had gone over for Huddersfield.
Luke Gale scored before half-time and although Leroy Cudjoe pegged the Tigers back, Solomona and Webster went over again to put Castleford 30-10 up.
However, Huddersfield rallied and late tries from Giants pair Ryan Brierley and Jake Connor set up a tense finale.
The win was Castleford's eighth Super League victory of the season and moved them up a place to sixth in the table.
Huddersfield's 13th league defeat of the campaign kept them second from bottom after 17 games.
Half-back Gale, who signed a new five-year contract with Castleford earlier in the day, also kicked five goals in the victory and helped to open up the visitors' lead with his first-half try.
The Tigers, who were without on-loan forward Larne Patrick as he could not play against his parent club, were given a scare when Connor crossed with three minutes to play, but they held on to seal victory by an eight-point margin.
