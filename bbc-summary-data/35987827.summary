"Some of the things he does are different and unusual - but it works."

That is how Yeovil Town defender Ben Tozer describes the methods of manager Darren Way.
Some evidence of precisely what Tozer meant emerged on Thursday, when Way surprised the gathered local media with a computer slideshow of his plans for the League Two club.
Having lifted Yeovil from the foot of the Football League to now be 14 points clear of danger, the 36-year-old boss has been rewarded with a three-year deal.
At Thursday's news conference, he was re-introduced by chairman John Fry and then, in front of a room which also included academy players and some of their parents, explained his pathways to success for the Somerset club, before answering questions.
Yeovil have won eight and drawn five of their 16 league games in 2016 since Way was officially appointed, after a six-game spell as interim boss following the departure of Paul Sturrock.

"Everyone likes him," Tozer told BBC Somerset. "It's incredible the amount of work he has put in to get to where we are.
"You can tell with the way we play for him and work for him.
"When we came in one day, there was green tape everywhere, a horizontal line of green tape. He said it was for the relegation line - we need to finish above that line.
"Little things like that are quirky and stand out. It's worked."
Way was part of the Yeovil team that reached the Football League in 2003.
His career, which included 273 appearances for Yeovil, was ended after a car crash in February 2010 and he subsequently joined the club's coaching team.
On his new contract, Way told BBC Somerset: "The only thing that changes for me is I was a new manager and now I'm a manager.
"It's a proud moment. I appreciate the commitment and support and certainly I'm really, really excited about the future.
"The hard work is just starting now. I have to get people following me in the right way."
