Pompey beat struggling Newport County at home on Saturday to stretch their cushion over fourth-placed Stevenage to six points with seven games to play.
"The gaffer has brought in people who've experienced the pressure in these run-ins," Rose told BBC Sport.
"That's important when you get to this stage of the season."
The 29-year-old was a member of Northampton Town's League Two title-winning squad last season before joining Portsmouth in the summer.
"You've got to try and enjoy these moments of these run-ins as they don't come along too often," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"The sooner we can get ourselves over the line, we can relax and enjoy it a bit.
Portsmouth's only remaining games against rival promotion and play-off contenders are Plymouth at home and Mansfield away.
But Rose feels they cannot afford to ease off in any of their last eight fixtures as they look to return to League One after four seasons in the fourth-tier, having lost to Plymouth in last season's play-off semi-finals.
"It's nice having a points cushion," he admitted. "But, it doesn't automatically mean you have a day off.
"We have to keep concentrating and focusing on results and trying to get as many points as we can."
