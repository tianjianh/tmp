Mossely, the world champion, claimed her first Olympic title by beating Chinese fifth seed Yin Junhua, 25, on a split decision in Rio.
Yin's silver was China's first medal of the boxing competition.
Yoka fights for gold against Britain's Joe Joyce at 19:15 BST on Sunday.
Richie Woodhall, former British super-middleweight world champion:
"It was rugged and scrappy, and was nice to watch from a boxing bout of view, but it came down to who wanted it the most.
"Both corners thought they had won it. There wasn't a lot in it, but Mossely seemed to want it a little bit more and kept coming forward. Overall I think she did enough to win it."
