South Wales Police searched addresses in Aberporth Road, Gabalfa, and Heol Trelai, Ely, in the hunt for Lorraine Ridout, 57.
Ms Ridout was last seen at the Premier shop on Gabalfa Avenue on 31 January.
Det Ch Insp Mark O'Shea said: "I do have grave concerns for her. We are looking for clues which may help to explain what has happened to her."
Det Ch Insp O'Shea added: "Lorraine is a much-loved mother and grandmother and we are keen to establish what happened to her on 31 January for the sake of Lorraine's family and her many friends who have been, and continue to go through, a traumatic time. They need answers.
"I want to stress at this point that Lorraine's family are working with South Wales Police and have been very cooperative throughout - they understand that we must leave no stone unturned in our efforts to find out what happened to her."
