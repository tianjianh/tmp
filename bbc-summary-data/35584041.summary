The Metropolitan Police commissioner is due to meet the widow of Lord Brittan later to discuss the investigation of a rape claim against the late peer.

Police interviewed Lord Brittan about the claim in 2014 but he died last year unaware the inquiry had been dropped.
In the private meeting, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is expected to be questioned about the length of time Scotland Yard took to conclude its investigation.
Lord Brittan had denied the historical allegation against him.
The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later.
Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan passed away in January 2015.
In a letter last year, a senior officer apologised to Lady Brittan saying she should have been told earlier that had he been alive, Lord Brittan would not have been prosecuted.
Investigating officers had told the complainant this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time.
Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.
A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been "premature", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015.
Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was "fully justified".
The former home secretary has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster.
The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says it is understood Sir Bernard will also be asked about this investigation in the meeting.
Lord Brittan, whose career included two years as home secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, died in January 2015 aged 75.
