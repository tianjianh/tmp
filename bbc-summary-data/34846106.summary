Non-toxic food chemicals 'may hold key' to cancer treatment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chemicals in food could hold the key to beating untreatable cancer and relapses, researchers have claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff University scientists said highly toxic therapies had a limited ability to stop most cancers.
Instead, the researchers - working with scientists from across the world - said they would recommend low-toxicity chemicals from food and vegetables.
Clinical trials are under way in China with patients suffering from lung, liver and gastric cancers.
