The band, who released their first album in 1997, won the Outstanding Contribution to Music prize at the 18th Scottish Music Awards in Glasgow.
They also performed at the ceremony, which raises money for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins.
Other winners included Glasgow alternative rock band Twin Atlantic, who were named best UK band.
Biffy Clyro, who formed in Kilmarnock, won the best live act category, while KT Tunstall collected a song-writing award at the ceremony which was held at Glasgow's Old Fruitmarket.
Donald MacLeod, chairman of Nordoff Robbins Scotland, said: "The SSE Scottish Music Awards is now one of the biggest and best music moments on the Scottish event calendar, and this year's ceremony was nothing short of spectacular.
"It was the perfect celebration of 20 years of Nordoff Robbins Scotland and we're incredibly grateful to the guests, sponsors, volunteers, and musicians who helped us make the event happen.
"Also, to everyone who has supported us for over 20 years - thank you."
The charity said funds raised by the awards ceremony had helped it to put on more than 8,000 music therapy sessions, involving around 450 vulnerable people, over the last year.
