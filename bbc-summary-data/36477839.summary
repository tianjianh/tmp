The BBC has confirmed it is scrapping Wimbledon highlights show 2Day.

Launched last year, the widely unpopular programme saw presenters mingle with a live audience and included funny home-video clips.
The BBC said it will now revert to its original Today at Wimbledon format.
A spokesman said this year's show will "have a traditional look and feel" and will "bring highlights of the day's action and insight from our expert pundits".
Last year, the corporation made major changes to its TV highlights coverage, replacing host John Inverdale with Clare Balding and introducing a chat show-style format.
At the time, The Guardian said "the whole show is a mess", while a scathing review in the Daily Mail referred to it as "super right-on" and "tooth-achingly trendy".
Mounting public criticism forced the corporation to tweak its format halfway through the tournament, eventually removing the studio audience altogether.
"Last year we made some format changes to the programme which evolved throughout the championships based on feedback from our audience," the BBC spokesman said.
This year will see the return of Today at Wimbledon, with Balding remaining as the host alongside two expert pundits.
It will be shot from a new studio next to Henman Hill overlooking the All England Club grounds.
