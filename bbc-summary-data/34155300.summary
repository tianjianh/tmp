Hand of God star Ron Perlman on "golden age of television"

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We're in "the golden age of television", according to Hand of God star Ron Perlman, who says his new drama - from Hollywood director Marc Forster - proves it.

"Naked, in a public fountain in broad daylight - speaking in tongues." Ron Perlman is describing his arresting opening scene in new series Hand of God.
"Whoever talked me into doing that scene should be arrested, that's for sure," quips the actor.
It's our introduction to Perlman's anti-hero Pernell Harris - a morally corrupt judge who appears to have found religion and lost his mind as he struggles to deal with a series of shocking family events.
Best known for FX biker series Sons of Anarchy and the big-screen adaptations of the Hellboy comic books, Perlman says it's a "challenging" role that's "never boring".
The ten-part drama is Amazon's latest television signing as the retail giant continues its bid to rival streaming service Netflix and take on the traditional US networks. A "completely original" tale, that's often "sick, twisted and disoriented".
Topics tackled include suicide, religion, rape and mental illness - and that's just in the first episode.
But without a young online platform keen to take risks, Perlman says Hand of God might never have got made.
"Being one of the guys who was taking it around town to find a producing partner, halfway through the process I became aware that we were selling something that not everyone was going to have the balls to step up to," he tells the BBC.
For Perlman, writer Ben Watkins and director Marc Forster, Amazon's willingness to "embrace the uncomfortable" sealed the deal.
"Not only did they embrace it," reveals Perlman, "but they encouraged us to go as far with it as our imaginations would allow us to."
Watkins "unique" story persuaded film director Forster (World War Z, Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland) it was time to try television for the first time.
"[For] a few years I wanted to do a TV series and just hadn't found anything that inspired me," says Forster.
"Ben's writing had a dark emotional part and humour as well. It's not just relentlessly dark, it has hopeâ€¦ and I'm entertained."
It does get dark though. Judge Harris' son is in a coma, having attempted suicide after being forced to watch his wife being brutally raped. Harris suffers a mental breakdown, is born again at a dubious chapel and goes on a vigilante hunt to find the man responsible.
"The last thing we wanted was a show where people would be like, 'uh, that was pretty good'," says Watkins.
"We wanted people to have intense feelings about this show. It wasn't something you just passed the time with."
The show was green lit for a full series by Amazon last year, after the public gave the pilot the thumbs up - a "genius idea" says Perlman.
"I would gladly trade being professionally criticised, [with] your average audience member [who] has no agenda other than 'I want to be entertained'."
Perlman says the end of his last show Sons of Anarchy after six seasons was "bittersweet" and he found it "hard" saying goodbye to his character Clarence 'Clay' Morrow.
But, despite being a self-confessed "cinema freak", he "insisted" on doing another TV series, because it's such a "unique period" for the genre.
"The thing that puts us in the golden age of television - which we're in right now - is the fact that there are all these new companies that are vying for attention.
"They come to the party knowing that the only way to gain market share is by being original and by being fresh and by doing things that nobody's ever seen before with regards to storytelling, which makes for a phenomenally exciting environment."
Dana Delaney - who plays Parnell's sometimes "ferocious" wife Crystal - is equally excited about the opportunities streaming services like Amazon, Netflix and Hulu can offer actors.
"My last show was Body of Proof and I took a year off because it had taken so much out of me. I was in every scene, it was mentally and physically exhausting - so I said to my agents, 'don't send me anything!'
"Then they called me up and said 'we've got this meeting'â€¦ and I was like, 'that's the future! I want to do that'."
The Desperate Housewives and China Beach star says it was a stark contrast to the hand-holding that goes on at traditional TV networks.
"It's like when you give children freedom and say, 'you know we're going to leave this up to you - be responsible!'. And it's interesting to see whether you rise to the occasion or not.
"At first I was like 'wow, I get to swear! I get to smoke pot, I get to be naked!' And then you realise, well, 'how do I want to use those so I can tell a good story?'
"You know swearing is fine, but you shouldn't do it all the time."
For Forster - who ventured into blockbuster territory with World War Z - directing Hand of God gave him the chance to return to a style closer to earlier films, like Oscar-winner Monsters Ball.
"People go [less and less] to see those movies in the cinema - so some of the greatest writing today is in TV, because these independent movies are not getting made any more," says Forster.
He joins a growing list of movie directors turning to TV; Netflix secured David Fincher to debut House of Cards, Martin Scorsese directed Boardwalk Empire's pilot episode for HBO in 2009, and both Steven Soderbergh's Red Oaks and a Woody Allen TV project are coming soon on Amazon.
Forster can't comment on his fellow director's motivations - but after disappointing Bond fans with Quantum of Solace, and having to re-shoot the end of World War Z, he found one element of small-screen storytelling refreshing.
"At the end of the movie, the audience has an expectation these days that everything has to be wrapped up - there has to be a conclusion, we don't want to leave the cinema dissatisfied.
"You can have a bad beginning, bad middle - [if] the last 15 to 20 minutes was good, they believe the movie was great.
"In telly, the opposite - the more things [left] open, or questions, the more you want to watch."
The Hand of God team - which also includes Andre Royo (The Wire's heroin addict Bubbles), Garret Dillahunt, Alona Tal and British actor Julian Morris - are hoping they have left enough questions to get picked up for a second season. Watkins meanwhile has a "five-series vision" for the show.
But Delaney has a dream back-up plan if it doesn't work out - Game of Thrones.
"It's the perfect treadmill show. It gets me out of bed, I get to watch Game of Thrones - yay! - and I'm screaming at the television, like 'no!'.
"I love it. I want to be on that show."
Hand of God Season One is available on Amazon Prime now.
