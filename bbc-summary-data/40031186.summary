[SN]TITLE[SN]
Who gets to rule Scotland's new councils - and why?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proportional representation generates interesting results. Power does not always end up where voters might expect it to.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the Scottish council elections on 4 May, none of the 32 local authority's gave a clear-cut result.
No national political party gained a majority on any of the the country's councils.
This inevitably meant deals to secure coalitions or minority administrations.
The SNP were the clear winners in the election polling and returned more councillors than any other party (431).
The Conservatives (276) were the second biggest party, edging ahead of Labour (262).
It has taken some times for councils to work out how they will be run but three weeks on, just a handful of administrations are still to be formed.
The SNP has more councillors than any other group in 16 councils, the Conservatives in 6 and Labour in 3.
A few administrations have still to be formed but the trend so far suggests the SNP has less power in practice than might have been expected while Labour and the Conservatives have more.
Generally the largest local party is either governing as a minority or leading a coalition but there are significant exceptions.
There is no rule which says that the largest local party has to be part of the administration.
The SNP is in opposition in Aberdeen, Argyll and Bute, Angus, Moray and North Lanarkshire even though it is the biggest party on the council.
The Conservatives meanwhile have been left in the cold in Dumfries and Galloway, East Renfrewshire and South Ayrshire.
It can be tricky to assess whether the fact that the SNP and the Conservatives have not formed the administration in some of the areas they "won" is balanced out by power elsewhere.
For instance, the SNP and Labour are in coalition in East Renfrewshire and Dumfries and Galloway and among the partners in the administration in South Ayrshire.
Meanwhile the Conservatives are the biggest political party in the administrations leading Argyll and Bute, Angus and Moray.
With Labour the overall situation is clearer - while they hold their weakest position in modern times in Scottish local government, it is not as weak as the party may have feared.
Labour were left as the largest party in just three administrations but has secured more influence with minority administrations in North Lanarkshire and North Ayrshire.
Overall the SNP are in their strongest ever position in practice in local government - aided by the symbolism of winning the former Labour fortress of Glasgow and many SNP-led administrations in the west of Scotland.
But across Scotland, the deals so far still suggest a very mixed, complex patchwork is emerging with no single party appearing dominant.
The overall national situation matters. It influences the relationship between local and central government.
The Scottish government is due to announce what are likely to be radical proposals on how schools are run after the General Election.
With the SNP in power in more councils, they can expect a more sympathetic hearing than might otherwise have been the case.
But Scottish local government cannot be said to have a dominant party - even if one party is clearly the largest one.
