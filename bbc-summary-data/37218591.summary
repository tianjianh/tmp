[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police say they cannot take further action over claims from the mother of a murder victim that she is being taunted online by the killer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Breck Bednar was killed after being lured to the Essex home of Lewis Daynes, 20, who is now serving life.
Essex Police investigated internet posts which Breck's mother Lorin LaFave claimed were by Daynes.
The Crown Prosecution Service it gave "early investigative advice" and police decided to take no further action.

The Ministry of Justice previously said it had found no evidence of electronic communication.
Breck, from Caterham in Surrey, was killed in 2014 after travelling to Daynes's home in Grays.
The trial heard there was sexual activity between the pair and Daynes then slashed his victim's throat.
Ms LaFave, who is from the United States, previously told how she had received two online letters purporting to be from Daynes; one sent in November and the other in January before a BBC Three television programme called Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar.
In the second post, Daynes allegedly denied he was a "sinister internet paedophile" or a groomer and called the TV trailer "highly dramatic".
He also said police photographs of his home showed a "very clean tidy flat" in a "very nice residential street" and was the opposite of what has been described.
"It would take too much time to address all the lies and spin," he wrote.
In his first letter, Daynes alegedly said he was responsible for Breck's death, but accused the media and others of exploiting Breck's death to "suit their own agendas".
Daynes was sentenced to life with a minimum jail term of 25 years at Chelmsford Crown Court last year.
