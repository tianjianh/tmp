The 36-year-old has been without a club since leaving Championship rivals Blackburn at the end of last term.
Robinson, who won 41 international caps, began his career at Leeds before spells at Tottenham and Rovers and had been training at Nottingham Forest.
"I've been fit and training, so it's nice to join a fantastic club," Robinson told the club website.
"The manager goes about his business here very well and having spent some time with him I can't speak highly enough, so I'm looking forward to working with him.
"I have played a lot of Premier League and Championship games and hopefully that experience can help people in and around the club."
Robinson, who has not played competitively since 17 September 2014, is likely to provide cover for first-choice Tom Heaton, with regular back-up Matt Gilks injured.
The Clarets are third in the Championship, four points outside the automatic promotion places.
