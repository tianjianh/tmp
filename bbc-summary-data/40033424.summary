Donaldson, 41, reached a career high of 28th in the world in 2013.
But he is currently 244th in the world rankings and is 178th on the European Tour's Race to Dubai rankings.
"I've struggled with injuries. These things happen and you've just got to manage the problems and get on with it," Donaldson said.
"I'm pretty fit now and looking for a really good week. I'm starting to play nicely now."
Donaldson tees off in the first round on Thursday morning at Wentworth alongside Felipe Aguilar of Chile and England's Simon Dyson.
Fellow Welshman Bradley Dredge will be in the same first-round group as Australia's Scott Hend and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands.
