Shane Williams believes Matthew Morgan should get his chance in Wales' final Six Nations clash against Italy.

"People are tired of me talking about Matthew, but Matthew is a fantastic talent," he told Scrum V. "Why put him in the squad if you aren't even going to put him on the bench?"
Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones agreed team changes could help against Italy after their late resistance at Twickenham.
"It wouldn't surprise me if changes are made," Jones explained.
"Though probably the guys that had a poor first half will want the opportunity to put that right."
Ex-winger Williams, who won 87 caps for Wales, wants to see Morgan even though he admits he might add to Gatland's stress levels.
"Yes he will give Warren Gatland a heart attack and heart palpitations at times, but there is nothing on this game, so give a talent like Matthew a chance."
Williams believes Rhys Webb replacing Gareth Davies at scrum half could also be an option for Gatland.
Webb has returned to the Wales fold after a serious foot injury.
"You are spoiled for choice, they are both quite similar," Williams said.
"You could go with either, it is great to have Rhys back. What a headache to have.
"So perhaps you will see Rhys back and bringing that tempo to the game.
"When Wales have that tempo, they are deadly. As they showed at the end of the England game."
