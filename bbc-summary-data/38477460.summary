Police said the first taxi driver was robbed of his phone, cash and his taxi at about 22:30 GMT on Friday in Deerhurst Crescent, Paulsgrove.
About an hour later a second driver was robbed by two men in Tunstall Road.
A third taxi driver was then robbed by two men in the Almondsbury Road area shortly after 05:00.
Det Insp James Stewart said: "We are carrying out inquiries today to identify these people.
"We are working with local taxi companies in the Portsmouth area to ensure drivers feel safe, remain vigilant and report anyone suspicious to us."
Police described the two men as white. One of them is slim, about 6ft tall and in his early 40s. The other man is slightly younger with a larger build and is about 5ft 7in tall.
Police said the stolen taxi had since been recovered for forensic examination.
