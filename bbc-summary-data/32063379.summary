[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of the first pier to open in Wales could be under threat, according to the managing company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Don Leisure Ltd said administrators had been called in to manage the assets of Aberystwyth's Royal Pier.
Managing director Andrew Deakin said last year's tidal storms and the resulting loss of business could be to blame.
He said: "A number of options are being considered, ranging from a restructuring to a possible sale."
Mr Deakin said the pier escaped the worst of last year's storm, but its trading suffered with many students returning home.
