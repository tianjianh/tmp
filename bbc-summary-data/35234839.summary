Andy Mangan: Shrewsbury Town re-sign Tranmere Rovers striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have re-signed striker Andy Mangan from National League side Tranmere Rovers on an 18-month contract for an undisclosed fee.

Mangan, 29, joined Rovers on a one-year deal in July after leaving Shrewsbury, who had offered him a new contract.
But, after an early season run of seven goals in 22 games, he lost his starting place following injury and has not scored since 6 October.
"At 29, I want to be playing 90 minutes on a regular basis," he said.
"The gaffer (Gary Brabin) could not guarantee that I would get that at Tranmere.
"Shrewsbury made an approach for me and offered an 18-month contract and the chance to be involved in League One.
"I had a long chat with the gaffer about it and he agreed that he would not stand in the way of me going. Any talk of there being a fall out is absolute nonsense."
Shrewsbury boss Micky Mellon is in the middle of a mid-season shake-up, aimed at addressing their worrying position of 20th in League One, a point clear of safety.
He has already seen two strikers leave. Top scorer James Collins has gone out on loan to Northampton Town, while former million pound man Tyrone Barnett has joined Southend United for the rest of the season - and skipper Liam Lawrence is about to tie up a move to League Two side Bristol Rovers.
"The bottom line is we need to find a way of scoring more goals, especially the front men," said Mellon.
Shrewsbury, who re-signed defender Jack Grimmer from Fulham earlier this week, are also in advanced talks with a League One side to bring in another striker - a deal that could be completed in the next 24 hours.
