Moeen Ali returned to form as England beat Hong Kong by 169 runs in their warm-up match in Abu Dhabi before the one-day series against Pakistan.

Eoin Morgan's team batted first and set their associate opponents a tough target of 342-8.
David Willey struck twice with the new ball to see off both Hong Kong openers as he finished with 4-43.
The only worry for England before the series opener on Wednesday was a finger injury suffered by Jos Buttler.
Buttler, who had made 38 in his side's innings, hurt the ring finger on his right hand while keeping wicket and may need a scan.
Moeen (71) and Alex Hales (64) both had confidence-boosting time at the crease while Jason Roy provided most of England's early momentum, with 42 off 32 balls in an opening stand of 63 with Hales, as England's batsmen all reached double figures.
Hong Kong struggled with their response as Willey dismissed both Kinchit Shah and Anshuman Rath in consecutive overs, and although Babar Hayat (78) and Chris Carter (34) had a useful third-wicket stand of 81, they were never in danger of challenging the England total.
