Dover Athletic 1-4 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere came from behind to cruise to a comfortable 4-1 victory over Dover at the Crabble Athletic Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aswad Thomas broke the deadlock for the hosts, heading Sam Magri's cross home after 22 minutes, but from there the visitors took charge.
Andy Cook took his goals tally for the season to 10 with a brace, notching either side of half-time, before an own goal from Mitchell Walker and Ben Tollitt's fourth added late gloss to the scoreline.
The emphatic victory was not enough for Rovers to climb any higher in the National League table, but they have closed the gap behind leaders Forest Green Rovers to four points.
