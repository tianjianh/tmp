The 84-year-old was targeted by the female attacker in the Bridgeton area of Glasgow on Thursday morning.
Detectives said the woman forced her way into a block of flats in Main Street at about 08:05 before demanding money from the pensioner.
She made off with a two-figure sum. Police have appealed for witnesses.
Police said the suspect threatened the victim with a knife before making off with the cash and escaping north along Main Street towards Bridgeton Cross.
Det Con Lucy McMillan said: "For someone to force their way into an elderly woman's home and subject her to such a terrifying ordeal is absolutely despicable.
"It is crucial that we find the person responsible for this cowardly crime and I would urge anyone who was in the Bridgeton area on Thursday morning to come forward if they think they may have seen a woman matching the description or anything else suspicious."
The attacker is described as being about aged between 20 and 30, about 5ft 4in tall with a gaunt appearance. She was wearing a black and grey jacket, dark trousers and trainers. She was also wearing glasses.
Police said they were increasing the number of patrols in the area to provide assurance to concerned residents.
Anyone with information is asked to contact officers from the Community Investigation Unit based at Govan via 101.
