A second man fell to his death from the flat at Donside Court shortly after police officers arrived at the scene on Tuesday night.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner will investigate the circumstances surrounding his death.
Police Scotland said the incident presented no threat to the wider public.
The force also said officers were not looking for anyone else in relation to the deaths.
Emergency services were called to the flat at about 20:15 on Tuesday after reports of a disturbance.
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said it had launched "a thorough investigation" to establish the full circumstances.
"Officers attended at Donside Court following reports of a disturbance and found the bodies of a man and a woman within a flat," he said.
"Both of these deaths are being investigated and treated as murder.
"At this stage, we can also confirm that a second man died at the scene a short time after officers attended. The circumstances of this death are likewise being investigated.
"Given that officers were present at the time of the death, the procurator fiscal has instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) to review the circumstances."
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie said the involvement of Pirc was in line with procedures when a death occurs when officers are in attendance.
He told BBC Radio Scotland the officers' discovery of the man and woman and the other man's fall from the flat happened "almost simultaneously".
The senior detective said there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of the police.
Det Ch Insp Hardie said that at this stage police were not looking for anyone else in relation to the deaths.
He said it was a "contained incident" and there was no wider threat to the community.
The officer added: "There will continue to be a police presence in the area as we continue with our investigation into this incident and I want to thank the community for their patience.
"A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal in relation to all three deaths later today."
A spokeswoman said the Pirc investigation "will focus on the circumstances leading up to the death of the second man following the arrival of police officers at the scene.
"A report on the commissioner's findings will be submitted to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in due course."
