The keys for Barry Island Pleasure Park were handed to new owner Henry Danter on Monday, leaving just five days to get the site ready for visitors.
Mr Danter's daughter Kimberley, who is managing the construction, said that Monday's high winds, problems with diggers and a delay in receiving the keys had put them behind schedule.
On Wednesday 30 men were on site.
Ms Danter said that they would complete "three days' work in one day" in order to "put on a show for Barry" on Friday.
A new ride, the Star Flyer, has been delivered to the site alongside fairground staples like the dodgems, the Miami trip and the waltzer.
A child-size caterpillar roller-coaster and hot dog stand has also been planned for the  opening.
The Vale of Glamorgan fair has been an attraction since 1920 and had 400,000 visitors over a bank holiday at its peak in 1934.
In recent years it found new fame with the TV comedy Gavin and Stacey after featuring in the BBC show.
