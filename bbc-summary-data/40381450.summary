More than 50 stars including Stormzy, Rita Ora and Liam Payne recorded Bridge Over Troubled Water to support victims' families and survivors.
The track sold 170,000 copies in less than 48 hours - the vast majority of which were download sales.
The cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic was organised by Simon Cowell.
Dua Lipa - who appears on the track - told the BBC: "It's such a special song. I feel really honoured and grateful to have been a part of it.
"To see so many artists come together for such a great cause, and to see the community come together, it's really sad and upsetting but to know that together we can help the families that have lost loved ones, it's very important."
The song had the biggest first day sales of any single released this decade, shifting 120,000 copies, according to the Official Charts Company.
Bridge Over Troubled Water also features vocals from Emeli Sande, Robbie Williams, Kelly Jones and Paloma Faith.
Residents and survivors of the tower block also appear as part of a choir led by Gareth Malone.

The song knocked Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber's Despacito from number one after six weeks at the top of the chart.
This week's highest new entry was Wild Thoughts, performed by DJ Khaled, Rihanna and Bryson Tiller - making it Rihanna's 30th single to reach the top 10 in the UK.
Over on the album chart, Royal Blood went straight in at number one with their second album How Did We Get So Dark?
The group told the BBC: "To have a career and make another record that has taken us to this kind of level is not only something we didn't expect, but something we didn't even contemplate... it's incredibly exciting."
Nickelback's ninth studio album Feed The Machine entered at number three - marking the band's first top 10 album in 10 years.
Lorde's Melodrama entered at number five.
