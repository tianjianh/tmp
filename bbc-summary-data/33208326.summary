Some students told the University of Northampton they would be "more comfortable using gender-neutral toilets".
"That some students described having to 'hold it in' until they got home was, to us, unacceptable" said students' union vice president Nick Woodward.
Existing single-cubicle disabled toilets have been re-designated.
In a statement, the university said the move was designed so "there will be no situation in which two people of any gender identity will be in the same room, ensuring they can feel comfortable using the space".
Victor Agboola, students' union at the University, said: "There is a growing population of trans students, with those who identify as transgender, non-binary or are inter-sex.
"Some students would be more comfortable using gender-neutral toilets and at the start of this academic year we had a number of students here visit the Students' Union and tell us exactly that."
The LGBTQ Society and "members of the student population" were consulted about the move, the university said.
