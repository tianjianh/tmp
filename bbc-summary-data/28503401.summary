[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of campaigners have aired their concerns over the lack of a minor injuries unit at Cossham Hospital in a public meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cossham Hospital in Kingswood, near Bristol, reopened last January after a Â£19m refit but without the facility.
South Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group said it was listening to local concerns but had to balance its books.
More than 7,000 people have also signed a petition calling for the unit.
Cossham hospital is run by North Bristol NHS Trust.
Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate, Jo McCarron has been supporting the campaign.
She took part in the meeting on Saturday afternoon which more than 100 people attended.
Ms McMarron said: "People were promised that when the facilities were moved from Frenchay to Southmead that Frenchay would be protected as a community hospital but that promise was broken.
"They were also promised a minor injuries unit at Cossham but the longer people are forced to wait, the more suspicious they're going to become. This is about trust in the delivery of local healthcare."
Ben Bennett from South Gloucestershire and Bristol Clinical Commissioning Groups listened to people's experiences of not being able to get treatment locally.
He said: "In terms of the numbers of patients we plan to treat at Cossham, the minor injuries unit was going to be about 10% of the whole so in a sense 90% of what Cossham is there for is happening.
"Sometimes those plans do get modified and changed but what we don't want to do is to create a service that doesn't do the job it's meant to do."
