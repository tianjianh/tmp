Miss Lawrence, who lived in Heworth Road, went missing on 19 March in 2009 when she was 35. Her body has never been found.
The men, all in their 50s and from the York area, were held on Wednesday.
Police said they have been bailed to allow detectives to follow up lines of inquiry.  A fourth man in his 50s, arrested in March, remains on bail.
A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: "Although they have been released from custody, proceedings in this case - as they relate to them - remain active."
Det Supt Dai Malyn, from North Yorkshire Police, repeated his request that members of the public and the media did not identify any of the men involved because it could "cause serious harm" to the investigation.
Miss Lawrence's family have been informed and continue to receive support, police said.
The 35-year-old had left her home for work at the University of York at the time of her disappearance.
She was reported missing by her father, Peter, after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her shift.
North Yorkshire Police's major crime unit launched a review of the investigation in 2013.
Fresh searches of her home and an alleyway at the rear of the property were conducted but no-one has been charged over her death.
A 60-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder last May and was later released from bail.
A 47-year-old man held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice last July has also been released from bail.
