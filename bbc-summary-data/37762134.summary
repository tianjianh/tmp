Murray, the current world number four doubles player, has won both the US and Australian Open titles with his Brazilian tennis partner Bruno Soares.
The 30-year-old from Dunblane received the honour at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.
His younger brother Andy, who is the current Wimbledon men's singles champion, was awarded the OBE in 2013.
Speaking after the ceremony, Jamie said: "I never expected this, and it's not something you think about.
"It's amazing to be honoured like this for some of the achievements I've been able to do in my tennis career."
The doubles player said topping the rankings earlier this year was a highlight of the past 12 months.
"To get to number one in the world - that was a huge achievement," he said.
"I think every sportsman wants to be the best that they can be I guess, so few people get to achieve that and I think it showed the consistency I had to get to that point.
"And obviously to win the Davis Cup as well was an amazing achievement for the whole team. It had been so long since the country had been able to do that, and I had so many memorable experiences playing for the country."
He added: "Last year I had my best year and got to two grand slam finals, then I changed partner (to Bruno Soares) and it was only our third tournament we played together and we won the Australian Open.
"For me it was an amazing feeling to do it, especially having lost finals and you never know when you're going to get back to one of them because they're the toughest tournaments we play in.
"And to do it again at the US Open was an incredible couple of weeks for us - we were really excited about it."
