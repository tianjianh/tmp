Scottish comedy Still Game has made a hugely successful return to TV after almost a decade.

The sitcom attracted its highest ever overnight audience for a single episode on Friday night.
It took a 58% share of the Scottish TV audience with 1.3 million viewers - beating its previous record of 1.2 million.
Airing for the first time on BBC One throughout the UK, it drew a total of audience of 3.2 million.
Still Game follows the antics of pensioners Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade and ran for six series between 2002 and 2007.
The new six-part series was commissioned after the show's writers and stars, Greg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan, rekindled their partnership for a Still Game live show at The Hydro in Glasgow.
The comedy had a 21-night sold-out run 18 months ago.
Friday's TV figures were second only to the Wimbledon men's final, which Andy Murray won, in terms of overnight audience in Scotland this year.
It also became the only non-sport BBC One programme so far this year to achieve a Scottish overnight audience of more than one million.
Ewan Angus, commissioning editor for BBC Scotland and executive producer of Still Game, said: "The return of Still Game has been hugely anticipated since it was announced earlier this year.
"It's without doubt a jewel in BBC Scotland's crown and we are delighted that it continues to sparkle for audiences.
"This is the first time Still Game has aired on BBC One throughout the UK and its heart-warming to see UK audiences getting to know Jack, Victor and the Craiglang gang in such numbers and we hope they continue to enjoy their stories over the next five weeks.
"These figures are testament to the hard work Ford, Greg and the whole team have invested in this new series and we are thrilled for it to be rewarded in this way."
Ford Kiernan added: "It felt like the Bells last night. There was no traffic outside, the pubs were quiet, it was odd but a comforting odd.
"The feedback from the audience has been immense, thanks so much."
