[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Smith, 55, punched, kicked and stamped on Steven Larkin, 45, before throttling him at Stravanan Road, Castlemilk, Glasgow, in December 2014.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr Larkin was attacked inside Smith's home then dragged from the flat and killed.
Smith denied murder but was convicted by a majority verdict. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years.
Judge Lord Matthews said the death had brought "anguish" to those close to Mr Larkin.
As the sentence was passed, a large group of Mr Larkin's family and friends in court celebrated by clapping as well as exchanging high-fives.
An earlier hearing was told that the brutal beating Mr Larkin suffered was not life-threatening.
His death came from being strangled with his scarf.
It emerged after the guilty verdict that Smith has a number of previous convictions, including one for violence.
