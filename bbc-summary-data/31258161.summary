The song, from the soundtrack to the Fifty Shades Of Grey film, sold more than 172,000 copies, about 87,000 more than Ronson's Uptown Funk, featuring Bruno Mars.
It is Goulding's second number one, after Burn in 2013.
In the album charts, Bob Dylan scored his eighth UK number one.
Goulding's song Love Me Like You Do - her 15th top 40 hit - is the fastest-selling single of the year so far.
Ronson's Uptown Funk has spent nine weeks in the chart in total, seven of them in the number one slot. And it remains the most listened to track of the week, with 2.10m streams, compared to the 1.46m accrued by Love Me Like You Do.
Rounding off the top five singles, was Hozier's Take Me To Church; Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney's FourFive Seconds, and Meghan Trainor's Lips Are Movin.
US singer-songwriter Dylan's 36th studio album LP Shadows In The Night, featuring covers of 10 classic pop standards made famous by Frank Sinatra, was a new entry at number one.
Dylan's last UK number one album was in 2009, with Together Through Life.
Last week's number one album, Meghan Trainor's Title dropped two places to number three, with X by Ed Sheeran retaining its number two slot.
