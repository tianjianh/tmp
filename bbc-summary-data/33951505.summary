The roots of the game date back to 1823 and are widely attributed to William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School.
MP Mark Pawsey said this year's world cup offered a "great opportunity" for the local economy and a chance to celebrate the town's role in the game.
He said hotels, restaurants and bars could all benefit.
A fan zone is being set up in the town, showing world cup matches.
The council is also backing a festival and investing in cultural events taking place alongside the tournament.
Councillor Heather Timms, responsible for economy on Rugby Borough Council, said the authority was investing almost Â£1m in the town.
She said it was part of a Â£5m investment to make sure Rugby was ready to welcome fans of the game.
Mrs Timms said it was also important local children learned about the town's role in developing the sport.
The Webb Ellis trophy visited Rugby as part of a nationwide tour ahead of the tournament's start on 18 September.
