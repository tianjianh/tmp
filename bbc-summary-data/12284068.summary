The 23-year-old woman reported the attack on 14 March, after waking up in the City Warehouse Apartments on Great Ancoats Street in the early hours.
Detectives said she had been on a night out at the Lakota bar on Deansgate Locks the night before.
Police have released a CCTV still taken from inside the bar of a man they wish to speak to.
Det Con Louise Edwards, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "We would urge anyone who may recognise this man to get in touch with us, as his assistance to this investigation is vital."
