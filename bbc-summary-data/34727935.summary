This award goes to the sportsperson whose actions have most captured the public's imagination during 2015.
An expert panel (hereafter 'the Panel') will be convened in November 2015 in London to decide the shortlist of 10 sportspeople for the main BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.

- they are residents in the UK.
Non-playing coaches or management are not eligible.
The Panel will endeavour to produce a shortlist based on reaching a consensus view. If a consensus view cannot be reached on all or some of the candidates, then the Panel will be asked to vote for the remaining candidates. In the event of a tied vote, the chairperson's decision (Director, BBC Sport) will be binding.

In the unlikely event of:
• A tie in the public vote amongst the two contenders obtaining the highest number of votes, the award will be shared amongst those two. There will be no award the in the second place category and the third place category award will go to the contender scoring highest after the two in the tie.

• A tie in the public vote amongst two contenders obtaining the second highest number of votes, the second place award will be shared amongst those two and there will be no award in the third place category.

• A full list of the number of votes polled by each contender will be available on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year website after the show.
1. Voting for the main award will be from a shortlist of 10 contenders presented during the live show on BBC One & BBC One HD on Sunday, 20 December 2015. Voting will be available by phone or via the BBC website. The number to call for each contender will be revealed during the programme. There is no voting via email, Red Button or by text. The telephone numbers will be available through Red Button and via the BBC website.
2. Telephone Vote: Voters in the UK can choose either to call from their landline using the long (11-digit) number for the contender(s) of their choice or from their mobile phones using the shortcode (7-digit) number for the contender(s) of their choice. Please note that callers from the Channel Islands and Isle of Man should call from their landlines using the long (11-digit) number to avoid higher mobile charges, as the short (7-digit) numbers are not available in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for reasons outside of the BBC's control.

The top three will be announced on Blue Peter and invited to the live event at the SSE in Belfast. The other top seven contenders will be notified out of courtesy that they have not made the final shortlist.
The winner will be announced live on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year programme and the BBC Sport website on Sunday, 20th December 2015.
By way of explanation the young judge selected by Blue Peter will be done so using the following criteria:
• The applicant will have been successful in their application for a Blue Peter Sport Badge 2015 and the quality of the Sport Badge application may also be taken into consideration.
• The quality of the answer to the question, "Why would you be a great judge for Young Sports Personality of the Year 2015?" will be assessed. The answer must demonstrate a passion for sport, show why they are good at making decisions and be all their own work. If there is any reasonable doubt about this, the application will not be considered.
• In a phone interview the candidates will be assessed on their suitability for the role, confidence in a judging situation and ability to deal with the task and appearing on camera.
• Being part of the panel that decides who wins Young Sports Personality of the Year 2015 is a responsible role, the young judge will need to be confident working with adults and making informed decisions.
