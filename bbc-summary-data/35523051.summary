Langley Mill fire deaths: Father and sons found guilty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and his two sons have been found guilty of murdering two teenagers and a baby in a house fire in Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six-month-old Ruby-Grace Gaunt, her mother Amy Smith and her friend Edward Green, both 17, died in the blaze in North Street, Langley Mill, in June.
Peter Eyre, 44, and his two sons, Simon, 24, and Anthony, 22, all of Sandiacre, were convicted at Nottingham Crown Court.
All three were accused of starting the fire as an act of revenge.
During the trial the court was told the "catalyst" for the attack was a dispute over a stolen moped, which had been stolen by another of his sons, the court heard.
The moped belonged to Miss Smith's boyfriend, Shaun Gaunt, 18 - who escaped the fire with the help of neighbours.
The prosecution said following a confrontation, Peter, Simon and Anthony Eyre drove to Langley Mill and petrol was poured outside the front door of the block of flats where Mr Gaunt lived.
The door was the only means of entry and exit, the court was told.
During his evidence, Peter Eyre denied being part of any plan to kill anyone or start a fire.
Ruby-Grace was found in her dead mother's arms on a landing, while Mr Green was found dead near the front door.
