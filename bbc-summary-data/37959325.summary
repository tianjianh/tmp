[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles won a penalty when Richard Duffy fouled Rhys Healey and Sean Rigg scored on the rebound after Notts keeper Adam Collin saved his spot-kick.
Healey drove from long range to double Newport's lead but was disallowed a second goal for a foul after the break.
Josh Sheehan scored his fifth goal in six games with a 25-yard volley as the visitors sealed a fine win.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I think it was a strong away performance and we worked very, very hard for the points.
"There was a lot of discipline, organisation and care in our performance and we were good with and without the ball.
"It's obviously pleasing to come to a tough environment like this against a very good side and earn three points."
