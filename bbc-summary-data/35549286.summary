[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burlesque, bar and tattoos permitted at Bawtry barbers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A barber's shop business has been given permission to add a tattoo parlour, bar and put on special events, including burlesque.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gentlemans Retreat in Bawtry can also host poker nights and show 18-rated films.
Doncaster Council granted permission but has imposed a restriction on under-18s being on the premises.
But owner James Herrington said the ban on children was unfair and he is appealing against the decision.
He said: "They won't allow under 18s into the building whatsoever - that includes some of my staff, my daughter and younger clients.
"We have said it is hugely inappropriate what they have done, especially as in other bars and restaurants you can take under 18s in as long as they don't go to the bar area.
"Our bar  is completely separate and private."
He said the bar would be members only and the tattoo parlour appointments only.
"You can take children into other bars and restaurants where they can watch their parents drink until they are under the table," he said.
"We are trying to create an experience which is about socialising and relaxing in a comfortable environment - it's not about getting drunk."
He said poker nights, burlesque and whisky evenings were all in keeping with the theme of his business, aimed at a "particular sort of gentleman".
Mr Herrington said he was now torn about whether to proceed with the plans, which he said would hit his existing trade as a result of the restriction.
David Kirkham, from Bawtry Town Council, said he welcomed the decision to exclude children from the premises.
He said he was still uncomfortable about the potential for the mix of activities to cause a nuisance to nearby residents.
