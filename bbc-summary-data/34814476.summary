The "recently serviced and relatively new" device, at King Edward VI School in Southampton, caught fire at about 10:45 GMT on Friday.
Headteacher Julian Thould said the fire was contained to one room of the independent school's ground-floor design technology building.
He said the school was evacuated within five minutes and no-one was injured.
It was brought under control by the fire service by midday, and next week's timetable was unlikely to be affected, Mr Thould added.
