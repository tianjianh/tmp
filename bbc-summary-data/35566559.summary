Darren Fletcher opened the scoring for the away side by drilling a low shot from inside the area into the corner.
Reading's equaliser came through Paul McShane, who powered in a header. He could also have scored in the first half but shot narrowly wide.
Michael Hector nodded in the second for the hosts, before substitute Lucas Piazon stroked in the third late on.

Reading's inconsistent season sees them lie 15th in the second tier, with little hope of reaching the play-off places.
Manager Steve Clarke was dismissed earlier in the campaign and former Royals boss Brian McDermott was brought back.  Although he has struggled to make an impact in the league, McDermott has guided the club to their fourth FA Cup quarter-final in seven seasons.
The hard-working Hal Robson-Kanu missed two clear opportunities - a first-half header was tipped over by Baggies keeper Ben Foster and he shot agonisingly wide after running clear in injury time.
Despite falling behind, the hosts continued to battle and earned their reward through two set pieces, both of which were headed home, as well as a neatly taken third.
In a largely forgettable opening 45 minutes, the two sides mustered just one shot on target but the match livened up considerably in the second once former Manchester United man Fletcher had struck the first goal.
However, West Brom's poor run at Reading continues, the Midlanders having failed to win away to the Berkside side for 11 straight games - a sequence stretching back to January 1995.
The Baggies were outplayed for large spells by their Football League opponents and can now concentrate on survival in the top flight, where they sit eight points above the relegation zone.
At the final whistle, Chris Brunt went over to the stand in which the visiting supporters were housed and was hit in the face by a coin. The midfielder remonstrated angrily with the crowd and had to be ushered off the pitch by captain Fletcher.
