[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irn Bru maker AG Barr has announced a fall in pre-tax profits and sales for the first half of the year.

Interim results to 25 July showed pre-tax profits at the Cumbernauld-based firm fell 11.3% to Â£16.9m.
Sales for the same period fell to Â£130.3m from Â£135.7m a year earlier.
The Scottish drinks maker, whose brands also include Strathmore water and Rubicon, said poor weather and tough market conditions were responsible for the "extremely demanding" first half.
Chief executive Roger White said: "Market conditions across the first half have been difficult and are forecast to remain so.
"The business is responding well to the market challenges but the weather since we last updated the market in July has been poor and, although we have recovered some sales momentum, it is not yet at the run rate we have targeted."
He added that even with "satisfactory" trading over the key Christmas period, full-year results were now expected to be "broadly" similar to a year earlier.
