A daughter has made an emotional plea to other hillwalkers to help find her father who has been missing in the Cairngorms for a week.

Lynn Strachan said her father Jim Robertson went to stay in Bob Scott's Bothy on the Mar Lodge estate.
She told the BBC they had not heard from the 61-year-old since Monday and said the family was going through an "absolutely hellish" wait for news.
Mountain rescue teams resumed their searches on Monday morning.
Mr Robertson, an experienced hillwalker who has climbed all 284 Munros, was planning to climb mountains close to the bothy.
About 85 mountain rescuers from the Braemar, Cairngorm and Aberdeen teams searched the area. Search and rescue dogs and the Coastguard helicopter were also involved in the operation.
Ms Strachan said her father left his home in Glasgow on Monday and boarded a bus at the Buchanan Street bus station.
Police have found since his belongings in the bothy.
Ms Strachan said: "We're  just terrified and it's made worse by the fact that there's nothing we can do, so it's just a waiting game for us. We're just relying on the experts who are at the scene.
"We're extremely grateful to everything that they've done so far and everything they're still doing now."
Ms Strachan said she wanted anyone who thought they may have seen her father to get in touch with police.
"Because we don't know what mountain he's on we really just need anyone who's been on the Cairngorms who may have seen him to come forward," she said.
"If anyone has been up in the mountains and seen a lone walker in any area we would really urge them to contact the police straight away so that they can narrow their search and start looking in the right place for him."
Mr Robertson is described as 5ft 10in tall, medium build with short grey hair and wearing glasses. He may have been carrying a large rucksack.
A spokesman for the Braemar Mountain Rescue Team said: "There is an ongoing search for an overdue 61-year-old walker named Jim Robertson who was staying at Bob Scott's bothy during the week.
"If anyone has been out walking in the southern Cairngorms, particularly hills accessible from the bothy, and think they may have met or seen this lone walker please get in touch with us."
