More than 150,000 people braved the rain to line the parade route sporting gold hats and waving flags.
The procession started at the Museum of Science and Industry and ended in Albert Square where 400 athletes gathered on stage.
London will have its own celebration on Tuesday in Trafalgar Square.
Team GB set an Olympic record in Rio 2016 by winning 67 medals - two more than they managed at London 2012.
The Paralympians also beat their previous performance with 147 medals - 27 more than four years ago.
Manchester was chosen for the first parade to reflect the contribution made by athletes from across the UK, the government said.
The city has become the hub for Team GB and Paralympics GB's all-conquering cyclists and para-cyclists since the opening of Britain's first indoor Olympic cycling track in 1994.
Singer Rebecca Ferguson and Kaiser Chiefs performed live to the crowds in Albert Square, where the parade ended.
Sports stars including Jessica Ennis-Hill, Dame Sarah Storey, Max Whitlock, Jade Jones and Nicola Adams were among the athletes who attended.
Ennis-Hill, who announced her retirement from athletics last week, said even though she was "a bit wet" it was "a really nice occasion to come here and be on the float, celebrating Rio, and also saying goodbye to everyone".
Team GB's Women's Hockey Team were also there although goalkeeper Maddie Hinch, who saved all four penalties in the shootout in the final against the Netherlands, nearly missed the parade.
Her flight from the Netherlands, where she now plays, was cancelled but luckily three hours later she was on the way.
Paralympians were also out in force including Jonnie Peacock, Jody Cundy, Ellie Robinson, Ellie Simmonds and Richard Whitehead.
Sue Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said: "We couldn't be more thrilled to host the national parade."
She added: "The city has been a medal factory, pumping out golds as the home of British Cycling and British Taekwondo."
Many of Team GB's heroes and the Paralympic stars have lived and trained around Greater Manchester.
BBC One will broadcast a 30 minute highlights show from 20:30
