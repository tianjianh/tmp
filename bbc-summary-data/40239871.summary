The man was walking with a 21-year-old man along a footpath in Tollcross Park, near the Leisure Centre, at about 18:40 on Saturday when he was attacked.
He was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where his condition has been described as serious but stable. The 21 year-old was not injured.
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the attack to contact them.
They are keen to hear from anyone who was in Tollcross Park or Wellshot Road around the time of the incident to get in touch.
Officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries and gathering CCTV footage.
Det Sgt John Semple said: "We need to know exactly what has happened and why and we are still trying to piece together events which led to a man being assaulted.
"We believe the attack took place within Tollcross Park near to Wellshot Road, although both men came out of the park and sought help from a passing motorist.
"If you were in the park or the surrounding area in the early evening last night and saw or heard anything which you think may be related to this attack then please do get in touch with us."
