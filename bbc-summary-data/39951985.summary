[SN]TITLE[SN]
Champions League: Kosovo champions to make competition debut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trepce '89 will next month become the first Kosovan club side to compete in Europe when they play in the Champions League qualifiers on 27 or 28 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are one of four Kosovan clubs who have met Uefa's licensing criteria.
Kosovo were granted member status by Uefa in May 2016 but neither champions Feronikeli nor cup winners Pristina, obtained a Uefa license for last term.
Either the Kosovan Cup winners, or the second-placed team in the league, will enter next season's Europa League.
The first qualifying round draw for the Champions League and Europa League takes place on 19 June, with the first qualifying round first leg ties taking place a week later.
Three of the five teams Trepca '89 could meet are Wales' New Saints, Northern Ireland's Linfield and Vikingur of the Faroe Islands.
