The Gobbins Cliff Path in County Antrim will reopen this summer after hundreds of thousands of pounds of repair work.

The Mid and East Antrim Borough Council confirmed that £430,000 of public funds has been used to repair the path.
The money came from a £2m maintenance fund set aside for the coastal walk, which reopened two years ago at a cost of £7.5m.
The path has closed twice because of storm damage and has remained shut since June last year.
The second closure was because of an "increase in levels of rock-fall".
The Mayor, Audrey Wales, said the path would open again after the council paid for the repair work.
"There will be periodic closures because it is a natural environment, it is an adventure walk, not a play-park, so there will be times when we have to do maintenance," she said.
"We have learnt from this experience that it is not going to be a year-round attraction."
