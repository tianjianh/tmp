Millions of television viewers saw John West run onto the pitch and hug Aleksandar Mitrovic after the Newcastle striker scored a late equaliser.
Police said Mr West, 35, from Durham, was handed an interim banning order ahead of a court appearance in April.
The game at St James' Park ended in a 1-1 draw.
After the match, which ended with 20 people being arrested, Northumbria Police said Mr West had been charged with going into the playing area of a designated football match.
A spokeswoman said: "He was handed an interim football banning order until his first appearance at Newcastle Magistrates' Court on 6 April."
