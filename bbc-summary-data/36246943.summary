The island where Diana, Princess of Wales, is buried is to undergo an "extensive remodelling" to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.

Diana's grave is at the centre of Oval Lake at the Spencer family's estate at Althorp, Northamptonshire, in 1997.
"The Oval Lake is undergoing an extensive redesign to honour her memory," the estate said.
"It will be completed in time for the 20th anniversary of her death, in August 2017."
Diana died as a result of injuries from a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997.
The Althorp estate opens to the public during the summer, but does not allow access to the island at the centre of the 13,000-acre site.
Its gardens are also undergoing remodelling, which the estate said was the first transformation of the grounds since they were designed 350 years ago.
The work is being led by Countess Spencer, the wife of Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, who currently owns the estate.
