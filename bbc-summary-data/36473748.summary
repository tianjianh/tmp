The First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he is worried the Welsh Government may be 'stitched-up' over a deal to devolve tax powers.

The revised Wales Bill is to allow the assembly partial control over income tax, without the need for a referendum.
But, speaking to BBC Wales political editor Nick Servini, Mr Jones said: "Surely the assembly should be able to consent to those powers being transferred.
"The worry I have is that we're going to get stitched-up when it comes to the financial framework that is agreed," he said.
"My objection to income tax has not been the principal necessarily, it's the deal that's on the table.
"Now, at the moment, Treasury holds all the cards. It shouldn't be that way."
