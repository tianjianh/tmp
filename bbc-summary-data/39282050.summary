Inverewe Garden, near Poolewe in Wester Ross, has been named as UK Garden of the Year.
The Scottish Beaver Trial's reintroduction of the once-native species to Knapdale, Argyll, was voted Wildlife Success of the Year.
Abernethy Forest in the Cairngorms won the nature reserve category.
The Stein Inn on the Isle of Skye was joint-second place with The Earle Arms in Norfolk in the best country pub section.
Mull in the Inner Hebrides was also second-place winner in the Holiday Destination of the Year category, while Skara Brae on Orkney took the runner-up spot in the heritage site category.
Balephuil Bay on Tiree, also in the Inner Hebrides, was second in the best beach prize.
Author Amy Liptrot's book, The Outrun, which gives a personal account of a journey from alcoholism in London "to salvation in her Orkney homeland" won second place in the Book of the Year section.
More than 56,000 votes were cast across the awards' 12 categories.
Kevin Frediani, property manager of National Trust for Scotland's Inverewe Garden, said: "We have an excellent and dedicated team at Inverewe who work hard to make the garden the brilliant visitor experience that it is.
"This wonderful accolade is testament to the team's achievement in delivering a world class quality product."
Susan Davies, director of conservation at the Scottish Wildlife Trust, one of the organisation's involved in the beaver project, said: "The reintroduction of beavers to our lochs and rivers is a big opportunity for both the environment and wildlife tourism.
"They are unique ecosystem engineers that have the potential to do the work of many thousands of conservation volunteers.
"By naturally managing woodland and creating new wetland habitats they will benefit a wide range of species such as otters, water voles and dragonflies."
