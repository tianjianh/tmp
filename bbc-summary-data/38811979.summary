The 27-year-old left the Cards to join the League Two club last summer, after spending two years at Kingfield.
Arthur has made 12 appearances for Crawley this season, but has only started three league games.
"Chris needs games. This is a good move for him to a club and set-up he is familiar with," Reds boss Dermot Drummy told the club website.
The length of Arthur's loan deal has not been disclosed.
