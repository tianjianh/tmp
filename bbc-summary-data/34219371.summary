Zaman Iqbal has filmed the bird's antics at his 24-hour newsagents in Aberdeen's Crown Street.
In 2007, an Aberdeen seagull found fame when it turned shoplifter by wandering into a shop and helping itself to crisps.
The bird - nicknamed Sam - would walk into the newsagents when the door was open and make off with cheese Doritos.
