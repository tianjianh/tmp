A large air and sea search began following the discovery on a beach in north Cornwall shortly after 08:00 GMT on Saturday, amid concerns there could be other people in the water.
The man's body was pulled from the shoreline at Treyarnon Bay.
Police say they do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.
The coastguard helicopter, coastguard rescue teams, police and ambulance crews were all called to the scene.
Rescuers say they tried to revive the man, but were not successful.
He is described as being in his 40s with cropped ginger hair, and was wearing brown trousers and a black Yamaha top.
Officers want to hear from anyone who may have seen him in the area in the hours before his body was discovered.
