[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stranraer 1-0 Cowdenbeath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark McGuigan's solitary strike was enough to seal Stranraer a promotion play-off place and consign Cowdenbeath to a relegation play-off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stranraer took the lead early in the second half, McGuigan drilling home after goalkeeper Grant Adam had parried Willie Gibson's effort.
Craig Malcolm, Paul Cairney, Andy Stirling, Steven Bell and Jamie Longworth all went close for Stranraer.
Greig Spence and Declan McDaid threatened for the visitors.
Stranraer will face Championship second-bottom side Livingston in their semi-final while Cowdenbeath will battle to preserve their League One status, initially against Queen's Park of League Two.
