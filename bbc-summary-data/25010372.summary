The plans include a new science block to support new research in areas such as genetics, drug discovery, ecology and neuroscience.
There will also be more on-campus student accommodation and a "potential new sports centre".
Professor Michael Farthing, university vice-chancellor, said it wanted to increase its local and global impact.
"We need to do that through creating more fantastic Sussex students.
"We need to be bigger so that we can compete in terms of research and again we need to be competitive internationally and it will help us have a sustainable financial future and be financially more independent," he said.
The university said the growth in student numbers would mean more jobs, more custom for local businesses and services, new buildings and services and more link-ups with industry, technology and the creative arts around the world that would bring "even more business to the university's neighbours".
The "campus masterplan" is due to be submitted for outline planning permission next month.
