[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident happened in Dalness Street, Shettleston, at about 15:15.
The boy, a pupil at St Paul's Primary School, was taken to hospital with serious injuries where he died a short time later.
Police said the white Ford Transit van had gone in to Dalness Street from Tollcross Road. It was turning into a car park on Dalness Street at the time.
The 62-year-old driver of the van was not injured.
Sgt Jackie Dunbar, of Police Scotland, said: "It was picking-up time at the school and there were a number of people in the area at the time of the incident.
"I would ask that anyone who saw what happened, and who has not already been spoken to by police, contact officers at the road policing complex via 101."
Dalness Street at Dalness Close was closed and local diversions put in place.
The boy has not yet been named.
