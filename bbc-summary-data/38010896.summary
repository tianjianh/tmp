Capped 54 times, he played at the 1994 World Cup and at Euro 96.
Prodan was 26 when he joined Rangers from Atletico Madrid for Â£2.2m in 1998, but a knee injury prevented him from making a single first-team appearance.
It was later revealed the signing was completed without a medical examination, and Prodan left after two and a half years in Glasgow.
He had won five successive titles with Steaua Bucharest before moving to Madrid, where he spent one season with Atletico.
Prodan took up a sporting director role with the  Romanian Football Federation following his retirement at the age of 31.
