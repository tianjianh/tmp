Wales football fans face travel disruption as transport unions have called strikes ahead of their World Cup qualifier against Ireland in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A one-day bus strike is taking place and some trains have also been cancelled - leaving one group of 20 fans stuck in Rosslare.
Pre-booked tickets will be refunded but there are no alternative bus or rail services running.
Wales take on Ireland at 19:45 GMT.
Irish Rail passengers have been warned of major disruption across services due to the Bus Ã‰ireann strike.
Drivers stopped working at midnight across the country and the disruption has now spread to the rail network due to picketing related to the dispute.
Services likely to affect fans include routes to and from Dublin to Limerick, Cork, Galway, Sligo, Waterford.
Bus Ã‰ireann said it was "extremely disappointed" by the action, which it claims would cause major inconvenience to customers and exacerbate the "perilous financial situation at the company".
