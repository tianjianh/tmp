Health worker and journalist face court over misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating alleged corrupt payments to public officials have charged a 47-year-old healthcare worker with conspiracy to commit misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Hagan, of Kirkby, Liverpool, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 10 July.
An as yet unnamed journalist has been summonsed to appear on the same charge.
A 29-year-old health care trust worker from Liverpool was also arrested in the Met Police inquiry but will face no action due to insufficient evidence.
The charge faced by Mr Hagan and the journalist accuses them of conspiring together to commit misconduct in a public office between 18 January 2008 and 29 August 2010.
They were arrested by police as part of Scotland Yard's Operation Elveden, set up to investigate corrupt payments.
The investigation is being run alongside two other inquiries - Operation Weeting, which looked at alleged phone hacking, and Operation Tuleta into claims of computer hacking and privacy breaches.
