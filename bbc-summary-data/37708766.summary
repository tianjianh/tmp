Glow is a similar format to popular programmes The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea.
It follows the lives of a "young, stylish group of Glaswegians", according to programme makers GRTV. They say it will capture Glasgow's "unique" sense of humour.
It will air on glasglow.tv on Thursday.
Stephanie Docherty, GRTV producer, promised viewers "tears, romance, bust-ups and lots and lots of drama".
She said the company had been "inundated" with messages - both positive and negative.
Ms Docherty added: "Hopefully when people see the first episode they will appreciate that we, and the cast, are having fun with this and taking a light-hearted approach.
"We could never represent everything about Glasgow in 45 minutes each week but hopefully it showcases Glasgow in the positive, stylish and fun way we know and love."
