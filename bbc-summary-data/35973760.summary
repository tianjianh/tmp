[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid defender Filipe Luis believes "there is fear that Barcelona will be eliminated" from the Champions League, and claims his side were treated unfairly at the Nou Camp.

Atletico lost Tuesday's quarter-final first leg 2-1, with goalscorer Fernando Torres sent off when they led 1-0.
Luis Suarez scored both home goals, but earlier appeared to kick Juanfran.
"I don't know what Barca players have to do to get sent off just like us," said Brazil left-back Luis.
Holders Barcelona, aiming to become the first team to win back-to-back Champions Leagues, take a slender advantage into the second leg at the Vicente Calderon next Wednesday.
Atletico scored a potentially valuable away goal through Torres, but the game turned when the Spain striker was sent off for two needless bookings inside seven minutes.
Atletico manager Diego Simeone was incensed by the decision of German referee Felix Brych, who also seemingly missed Suarez lashing out at Atletico right-back Juanfran near the byeline.

"We shouldn't have got the red card, it was totally unfair," said former Chelsea defender Luis.
"It is not easy to play against Barcelona in the Champions League. We know it is really dangerous if they go out in the quarter-finals. We have to play against everyone and everything.
"You can tell there is fear that Barca will be eliminated."
Luis acknowledged Atletico faced a "really difficult" task to reach the semi-finals but added: "We are still alive. It is possible."
Simeone said he was not "angry" with Torres, though the 32-year-old former Chelsea and Liverpool forward later apologised and took responsibility for his dismissal.
