He fought back from 4-1 down to beat Michael Holt 13-8 and set up a Tuesday meeting with Ding Junhui or Judd Trump.
"I had a miracle to get to four each. I could easily have been 6-2 or 7-1 down," said 2000 and 2003 winner Williams.
"I was struggling at 3-1 down and 4-1 down and lucky to win a couple of close frames."
Williams felt he played "quite" well in a solid performance to keep Holt under pressure after his fight-back before going on to win.
The Welshman hopes Trump beats Ding "because it would be a more fluent and quicker game".
Williams added: "I'm just happy to be here. I'm normally watching the quarter-finals in the house so to actually be involved is great for me."
