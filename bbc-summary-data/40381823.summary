Scheme to limit commercial bins on city streets launched

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to limit the amount of time commercial waste bins are left on the street is being launched in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Containers found on streets and lanes in eight areas in the city centre outside designated times will be removed by the council.
Offending businesses will then have 28 days to reclaim their bins as well as pay council costs.
The six-month pilot scheme is designed to "improve the look and feel of the city centre".
If successful, the project will be rolled out across the city centre.
Councillor Kenny McLean said: "This project will make Glasgow city centre more attractive for all those who work, live, study in or visit the area.
"Clearing commercial waste bins from our streets will make the city centre cleaner, greener and safer, and we have received great support from local businesses and residents for the pilot scheme.
"We are greatly encouraged by the input of businesses within the project areas.
"Although this is a challenging initiative, this input will be invaluable in ensuring its success and our streets are cleaner."
Waste can only be placed on the street within a specific time period. The proposed windows are 07:30 to 09:30 and 17:00 to 23:00.
Bins must only be on the street for an hour, only when the business is open and never left out overnight.
Similar schemes operate in Edinburgh, Manchester and the City of Westminster.
The areas initially covered from Sunday will be:
