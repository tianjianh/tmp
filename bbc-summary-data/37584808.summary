[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police looking for a missing airman said they do not believe his disappearance is in any way related to his job in the RAF.

Corrie Mckeague, 23, a gunner based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, went missing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds 13 days ago.
Supt Kim Warner said: "There's nothing to suggest at the moment that his status within the RAF is a factor with him going missing."
That was "not relevant", he said.
Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating a takeaway in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 BST on 24 September.

It is thought he stopped for a nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to his base.
A trace on his mobile phone showed it was in Bury St Edmunds early on 24 September but then moved to the Barton Mills area.
Police are continuing their search in that area, concentrating on roads and pathways, Supt Warner said.
"There's nothing specifically about Barton Mills to suggest why Corrie might gravitate towards that particular area, it's the fact that the phone has pinged off that particular mast and that's why we've concentrated searches [there]," he said.
There was nothing to suggest his disappearance might be related to his job in the RAF, he said, and "absolutely nothing at the moment to suggest any third party involvement" or any "criminality".
The search is a missing persons inquiry, he added, although "we're not ruling anything out".
Police have released a poster appealing for information and officers will be in the Brentgovel Street and Short Brackland areas of Bury St Edmunds overnight in the hope of jogging people's memories of events two weeks ago.
