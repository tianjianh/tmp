Fermanagh and South Tyrone selection 'major embarrassment for Sinn Féin'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If at first you don't succeed try, try again.

Sinn Féin, of all parties, do not normally get bound up in selection dilemmas.
Looks like someone forgot to tell its members in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
First they met in December and ditched the sitting MLA Phil Flanagan in favour of former MP and Stormont minister Michelle Gildernew, MLA Sean Lynch and Fermanagh councillor John Feely.
So far, so unsurprising.
However, after concerns were reportedly raised over "procedural errors" the party decided to re-run the whole selection process.
This time the sitting MLA, Bronwyn McGahan, put her name forward as well after announcing that she was stepping down and not standing in the original contest
It made no difference - she was not selected anyway.
But the real story, this time, neither was Michelle Gildernew selected, something which seemed to come as much a shock to the party hierarchy as herself - never mind those of us who watch and pretend to understand these things.
Back in, however, was Phil Flanagan along with Sean Lynch and councillor Feely.
So not only was there not a woman on the ticket - which goes against Sinn Féin policy, but all three candidates came from Fermanagh which seemed to show a somewhat reckless disregard for the South Tyrone part of the constituency.
Even before the meeting there had been a strong rumour the party wanted to move the former MP to neighbouring Mid-Ulster to replace the departing Martin McGuinness.
She quickly scotched that rumour in a tweet telling those who had been speculating "Mid-Ulster has excellent candidates to replace @M_McGuinness_SF and my heart's in #FST."
She also said she had been "blown away" by all the messages of support adding "don't be worrying about me, could be a blessing in disguise".
What she was not doing was hiding her disappointment and metaphorically drawing the curtains over an episode which was rapidly becoming a major embarrassment for Sinn Féin.
Senior figures hastily made it clear the matter was not over which brings us neatly to 19 February when a third selection convention will be held.
And messily four candidates will now be selected which should help create a space for the party's best-known figure in the constituency.
At least that is the obvious conclusion, but it is probably unwise to count too many chickens just yet.
Either way the damage has probably already been done.
Sinn Féin divisions in Fermanagh and South Tyrone have already been exposed and one of the party's most recognisable names has been undermined.
It is not the Sinn Féin way and many will continue to ask why.
