[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Wolves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Baldock's first-half header proved enough to give in-form Brighton a home victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Knockaert headed wide early on but striker Baldock made no mistake shortly after, guiding Gaetan Bong's cross into the top corner.
Helder Costa came closest to equalising just before the break but his long-range shot was tipped over by Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale.
Wolves pressed late on with several corners but Brighton held on.
Walter Zenga's Wolves went into the game having won just two of their past nine away league games with only one clean sheet and they conceded what turned out to be the winning goal after only 16 minutes.
Full-back Bong whipped in a pinpoint cross which was headed home by Baldock for his third goal in three games as the Seagulls took control before the break.
Top-scorer Glenn Murray almost doubled Brighton's lead early in the second half but his header was narrowly wide and a minute later Knockaert forced a fine save from Carl Ikeme with a long-range left-footed shot.
Wolves committed men forward late on but, despite a succession of corner kicks in the dying minutes, Albion held on for victory and their eighth clean sheet in 13 games.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "It is very timely that Sam is in this form and I am very pleased for him. He's been good for us.
"He may not score too many with his head but he showed a desire to get across the defender.
"He is a team player, works hard for the team and he is at the right place at the right time."
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: "It was a good game in my opinion but they scored and we didn't. We played at the same level as Brighton.
"We were in the game and there was no difference in the teams. I would prefer to play badly and take the points.
"In the last four games we have only taken one point, but we must believe in our job."
