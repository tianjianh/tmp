[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portland Timbers became Major League Soccer champions for the first time as they beat Columbus Crew in the final, with ex-Premier League defender Liam Ridgewell lifting the trophy.

Diego Valeri put Portland ahead after just 27 seconds when he charged down a clearance from keeper Steve Clark.
Rodney Wallace then headed in to make it 2-0 in the seventh minute.
Kei Kamara pulled one back before half-time but the Timbers won their first major trophy since joining MLS in 2011.
Portland captain Ridgewell, 31, who played in the Premier League for Aston Villa, Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, is in his second season with the club.
The final, at the Crew's Mapre Stadium, got off to a dramatic start when Clark's error gifted Valeri the opening goal.
The keeper's attempted clearance bounced off the Argentine and into the net, to set a new record for the fastest goal in the history of the MLS Cup - the name given to the final.
Portland were then gifted another goal when they were allowed to play on after the ball had clearly gone out for what should have been a throw-in, and Lucas Melano crossed for Costa Rica international Wallace to head in.
Columbus hit back as their top scorer, Sierra Leone forward Kamara, fired in his 26th goal of the season on the turn after goalkeeper Larsen Kwarasey had spilled a cross.
But the hosts barely made another chance as Ridgewell's defence stood firm and Portland were unfortunate not to add to their lead in the second half as they created a number of chances.
Melano saw a shot blocked, Kamara was spared an own-goal by Michael Parkhurst's goalline clearance, Fanendo Adi headed against a post and Clark saved superbly from Natt Borchers' close-range header.
