[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A detailed study of potential sites for a proposed new stadium for Grimsby Town Football Club has been agreed by councillors.

The decision was made after discussions of the benefits a new stadium and leisure complex would bring.
Grimsby Town FC's preferred site is 22.7 hectares of council land between Peaks Parkway and Weelsby Avenue.
The authority said more than three potential sites were being considered but declined to disclose the locations.
It said it would examine the whole of North East Lincolnshire and would publish its findings in a report, which is expected to be released later this summer.
Under council plans, the club could move to the new stadium.
Leader of North East Lincolnshire Council Ray Oxby said: "It's clear that a thriving local football club makes sense - it's good for business, creates a lasting legacy and provides a catalyst to boost to the borough's general wellbeing.
"I'm pleased that we can now take the next step and take an objective look at the most appropriate sites."
In 2012, the authority agreed to carry out an independent survey of land for the development.
A planning application is yet to be submitted.
