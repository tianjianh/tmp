Stoke City 3-1 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke City moved up to seventh in the Premier League as three second-half goals saw off a Norwich side which played over an hour with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was goalless when Canaries midfielder Gary O'Neil saw red for needlessly clattering through the back of Ibrahim Afellay on the touchline.
Stoke's Jon Walters slid in the opener at the far post, only for Jonny Howson to level with a 20-yard half volley.
Joselu's low drive and Ryan Bennett's headed own goal sealed the home win.

Reaction to all of Wednesday's Premier League games
Norwich started the match in 15th position in the Premier League, and knew an away victory would open up an eight-point gap between them and the relegation zone.
And, having won three of their previous four league matches, the Canaries started positively at the Britannia Stadium.
The visitors shaded possession and territory in the opening half an hour, with centre-half Bennett's strike stretching Stoke keeper Jack Butland.
However, their efforts were severely hampered by O'Neil's rash challenge.
The 32-year-old midfielder wiped out Stoke counterpart Afellay as the ball harmlessly ran towards touch, leaving referee Neil Swarbrick with no option other than to produce a straight red card.
Norwich comfortably held out until half-time, but buckled after the break as Stoke eventually made their 72% of second-half possession pay.
"The whole evening turned on that incident," admitted Canaries manager Alex Neil afterwards. "It didn't need to happen."
Stoke have been predictably unpredictable this season, impressing with thrilling wins against Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Everton, only to implode against the likes of West Brom, Watford and Sunderland.
But victory, coupled with Liverpool and Watford both dropping points, moved the Potters just four points adrift of the top four.

However, Mark Hughes' side were far from their fluent best for large periods against Norwich, despite their numerical advantage.
They have struggled to score goals at the Britannia Stadium this season, netting just 10 in their previous nine home matches, and looked to be heading towards another frustrating night after Howson's surprise leveller.
But Spanish striker Joselu's crisp shot from the edge of the area eased any lingering tension.
The Potters were firmly in control from then on, Bennett's unfortunate header from Afellay's clipped free-kick sealing Stoke's third win in four league matches.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes:
"We know we didn't play as well as we can but it is great to get maximum points when we know the squad didn't play to the heights that they can.
"Sometimes it is more difficult to play against 10 men than it is against 11 if they keep their organisation - which they did to good effect. They've got pace as well so we had to be vigilant. But in the end we saw the game out quite comfortably.
"If we continue in this run then who knows where we can get to. We have just got to keep close to the guys in front."

Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"Up to the sending-off we performed very well and had the best chance through Ryan Bennett. But after that point it becomes tough.
"After conceding the opener we showed character to equalise, but we didn't squeeze the ball quick enough for their second goal.
"When you're drawing the game you've got something to hang on to and I think Stoke were getting agitated."
Stoke are back at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday when they welcome Premier League leaders Arsenal.
Norwich face another important away trip on Saturday, going to a Bournemouth side which is one place and two points behind them in the top-flight table.
