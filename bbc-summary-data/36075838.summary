Real Madrid kept pace with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga by comfortably beating fourth-placed Villarreal at the Bernabeu.

Striker Karim Benzema instinctively headed Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo's parry back into an empty net to give Real a 1-0 lead at the break.
Lucas Vazquez drilled in a low second, before Luka Modric slid in to wrap up Real's eighth straight La Liga win.
Third-placed Real are a point behind the top two with four games left.
But there was a late concern for coach Zinedine Zidane when Cristiano Ronaldo limped off in injury-time.
Relive the action from Wednesday's La Liga games
Real knew they needed a victory to maintain their push for a first La Liga title since 2012 after Barca ended their three-match winless run by thumping Deportivo and Atletico edged past fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao.
And they responded with an efficient display against a toothless Villarreal side.
Real had dominated without stretching away keeper Asenjo, finally making their superiority count through Benzema's 27th goal of the season.
Vazquez, given a rare start as Gareth Bale missed out with a slight back injury, took advantage of his opportunity by converting Benzema's neat lay-off after the break.
Real never looked like letting Villarreal back into the game, sealing a routine victory through Croatia midfielder Modric.
