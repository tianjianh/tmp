In a statement, the DUP man said it had been an honour to represent the people of East Antrim since 2003.
He added it was deeply disappointing to leave the assembly at a time of such uncertainty caused by "the economic illiteracy of Sinn Fein and the SDLP".
The party said a replacement would take up the post before the assembly resumes sitting in September.
"Devolution is good for Northern Ireland and brings government closer to the electorate.  I have always supported local people making local decisions," Mr Wilson said.
"Whilst at Westminster, I will continue to campaign with my party colleagues for a normal system of government in Northern Ireland. The structures need to be reformed to allow efficient decision-making."
DUP leader Peter Robinson added: 'Sammy has made a huge contribution to the Northern Ireland Assembly, in his role as a constituency representative as well as both a committee chair and minister.
"He will continue to serve the people of East Antrim as their member of parliament."
In 2014, the Northern Ireland Office passed an act banning MPs from double-jobbing as assembly members.
The law is due to come into force in March 2016, ahead of an assembly election in May 2016.
