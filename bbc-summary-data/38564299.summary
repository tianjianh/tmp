The former England international, 36, was dismissed by referee Kevin Friend for a professional foul on Lee Angol in the second half of the 4-1 win.
Terry will now be unavailable for Saturday's trip to champions Leicester.
The Blues' FA Cup win was Terry's first start since October and only his eighth appearance of the season.
