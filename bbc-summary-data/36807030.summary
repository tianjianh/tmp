A post-mortem examination on the body of a teenager who died while in the custody of police has proved inconclusive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mzee Mohammed, 18, was detained by security staff at Liverpool One shopping centre where he was seen "behaving erratically" with a knife.
He suffered "a medical episode" while in the custody of police, and later died in hospital.
Further tests will be carried out to establish what caused his death.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating his death.
IPCC Commissioner Carl Gumsley said investigators had met with Mr Mohammed's family as part of its evidence gathering.
He said it was too early to "comment on or verify any accounts from any source as to what occurred at this time".
Body camera footage from one officer was being analysed, he added, as well as CCTV footage from the scene of Mr Mohammed's detention.
Witnesses who were at Liverpool One and who saw Mr Mohammed earlier in the evening have also been interviewed, Mr Gumsley said.
Merseyside Police said a man had run into a house in the Toxteth area of the city in "a distressed state".
Later, a man was seen with a knife "behaving erratically" at a number of locations in the city centre, it added.
Mr Mohammed's mother Karla has said her son had "a troubled past" but "he got past that".
Separately, a video showing the 18-year-old on the ground outside Liverpool One and receiving treatment while being detained has emerged.
North West Ambulance Service told the BBC it had "no concerns" about the standard of care, based on what it saw in the mobile phone footage.
