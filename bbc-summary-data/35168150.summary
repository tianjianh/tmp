[SN]TITLE[SN]
How Italians ended up in the Borders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Borders Italians feature in a new exhibition by the National Records of Scotland, on view in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It features a census taken by Benito Mussolini of expatriates around the world in the 1930s.
Scotland's census is thought to have been the only one to survive.
Visitors to the General Register House exhibition can search towns online for registered Italian immigrants.
It shows local names such as the Macaris in Galashiels; Fortes in Gala as well as Jedburgh, Kelso and Duns; Valentes in Coldstream; and Serafinis in Selkirk and Hawick.
There are artefacts, too, such as a birthday telegram to an Italian man who had been interned - from his wife and children in Peebles.
"The majority are in the central belt but in fact there are many who find their way into the Borders and set up shops and prospered down there," explained the exhibition's curator Dr Tristram Clarke.
"That's right through the Borders from the east to the west.
Italy and the fascist involvement in World War II brought many hardships on Italians settled in Scotland.
Families were separated as adult males were interned. Family members that were left behind were forced to cope with mistrust and discrimination.
"The telegram is actually sent to the father and husband Biagio Boni in internment in the Palace Hotel internment camp in Douglas in the Isle of Man.
"It is a birthday telegram - it is just as if it is normal and then you look at the addresses and you suddenly realise what the story is going on there.
"It is a fascinating document."
The records themselves still belong to the Italian government.
Their ambassador to the UK, Pasquale Terracciano, said he believed they would be of interest to families around the region.
"Those Italians who came to the Borders and settled down - they opened their ice cream parlours and coffee shops and so on and gave, I think, an important contribution to the catering business in Scotland," he said.
"They can now reclaim their origins and get information on their roots.
"We know that they are all perfectly integrated in Scottish society but they might be interested in knowing something about the history of their families."
Historian Dr Terri Colpi's new book, Italians' Count in Scotland: The 1933 Census, looks at how they became part of our communities.
"They didn't come to Scotland and set up in Hawick or Peebles," she said.
"They'd have come to Edinburgh or to Glasgow and sort of found out what was going on and who was where.
"Maybe they were quite young and they had to work their apprenticeships with uncles or the padroni (bosses) in already established businesses before they set out looking for nice little Scottish towns with little markets that they knew would support their family."
The exhibition Family Portrait: The Scots Italians 1890-1940 is on at General Register House in Princes Street until 29 January.
