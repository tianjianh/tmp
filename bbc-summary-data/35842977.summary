Elite League: Sheffield Steelers pip Cardiff Devils to title

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Steelers beat Cardiff Devils to the Elite League title on a dramatic final evening of the 2015-16 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Devils beat Nottingham Panthers 4-3 to briefly regain top spot.
But Steelers, who had faced off 30 minutes later, won 3-1 at Fife Flyers to take the glory.
Had Devils won and Steelers lost, the Welsh team would have celebrated being at their new home in style on a weekend on which they also won 5-2 at Manchester Storm.
