Warrington Borough Council: Concerns over £11.5m college loan plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cross-party group of councillors claim there has been a lack of openness over plans to lend £11.5m to a college.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A confidential report, seen by the BBC, says Warrington Borough Council plans to grant a loan to Warrington Collegiate. The money would refinance a high street bank loan, and fund the building of a new training centre.
Councillors have raised concerns after a decision to grant the loan was taken in a private session on 13 July.
The college has declined to comment.
The report says the loan would "contribute to meeting the educational needs of Warrington".
It was passed in a session of the council's ruling Executive Board, but is currently under review following pressure from councillors.
A council scrutiny meeting was told the college needs the loan to be confirmed by the end of July to comply with accounting regulations, and because its bank loan will need repaying.
Councillor Chris Vobe from the ruling Labour group told the meeting: "It's very clear this loan is to convenience the college so they can repay their existing bank loan.
"If we're considering a loan this substantial, we should not speed through."
Opposition Liberal Democrat councillor Bob Barr said: "There has been a lack of transparency, a lack of consultation.
"In almost every respect it's been an example of very poor decision-making."
It has also been claimed that concerns about the loan from auditors have not been given "due consideration".
A confidential report - prepared for councillors but seen by the BBC - details how the £11.5m council loan would also be used to fund a new "manufacturing, distribution and engineering apprentice training centre" as part of a major regeneration scheme dubbed the Stadium Quarter.
The report says the centre will attract external funding to the town and bring regeneration benefits.
A final decision about the loan will be taken by the council's Executive Board on Thursday.
