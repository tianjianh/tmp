[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, a jury found ex-PC Colin Hart, 61, from Nelson, Caerphilly County, not guilty of five counts of indecent assault and one of raping a girl under 16.
The jury failed to reach a verdict on two counts of indecent assault.
He was formally cleared of the remaining charges at a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday.
