Challenge Cup final: Matty Smith's alternative view of Wigan Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan go into Saturday's Challenge Cup final against Hull FC with hopes of winning the famous trophy for a record 19th time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England international Matty Smith is in his first full season with the Warriors and is set to appear in his first Wembley final.
The 26-year-old scrum-half gives BBC Sport an alternative insight into the Wigan Warriors squad of 2013:
1. Sam Tomkins: Full-back
Nicknamed 'Hollywood' because he is always talking about his A-list celebrity mates and the white Porsche he has got.
A massive player for us and one of our stand-out players. If he is fit and on form, we are going to have a good chance of winning the cup.
2. Josh Charnley: Wing
Absolutely terrible dress sense. Will try and tell you it is the best at Wigan, but it definitely is not, so gets a bit of stick for that.
Another big player for us and another one who can change the game on his day. Can create a try out of nothing.
3. Darrell Goulding: Centre
The quiet man at the club and keeps himself to himself. Really steady. Never at the front in fitness drills and does not really like training.
Someone who is really underestimated and should be in the international set-up. A big part of what Wigan do well.
4. Jack Hughes: Centre/second row
Another one who is fairly quiet, but a very funny guy once you get to know him. Comes out with lots of sly comments.
One of the young lads who has come through the system at Wigan and has done really well.
5. Pat Richards: Wing
The Aussie Irishman. Very sarcastic and always cracking jokes.
Will be missed when he goes back to Australia at the end of the season and will be difficult to replace. His goal-kicking is second to none. In close games, you can rely on him to slot over the two points.
6. Blake Green: Stand-off
Nicknamed 'The Snake' because he bites a lot.
Came in from Hull KR at the start of the year to form a new half-back partnership with myself. We have played really well together and we are good mates off the park. Hope he has a great game at Wembley.
7. Matty Smith: Scrum-half
Once described as a poor man's Paul Deacon. Not done too badly since then.
Really enjoying my rugby at Wigan and hungry to improve. Very proud to be playing with such a great bunch of blokes and coaching staff.
9. Michael McIlorum: Hooker
The tough bloke of the group.
One of those who is great to have playing with you, but you do not want to be playing against him. Lifts the boys in games and is a great player. Will be wanting a big game on Saturday.
10. Lee Mossop: Prop
Gets a bit of stick for his receding hairline.
Another England international. Will be a massive miss when he leaves for Australia at the end of the year and another who will be hard to replace. Will want to finish on a high, starting by winning on Saturday.
11. Harrison Hansen: Second row
My second-rower and I think there is no bigger player at the club than him. Got loads of respect for him.
One of the people that goes under the radar and is a real workhorse for the team. A pleasure to play alongside.
12. Liam Farrell: Second row
Nicknamed 'The Ginger Pearl'. Pretty quiet lad, but always mentions he is related to [Wigan legend] Andy Farrell.
Has had an awesome season and will be up there for the Man of Steel award. As long as he does not kick the ball, we will be alright.
13. Sean O'Loughlin (captain): Loose forward
Mr Reliable. Every time he puts that Wigan shirt on, he gives 100%. Never seen him have a bad game since I have been playing.
Will be massive for us on Saturday. Hope I will be seeing him lift the trophy at the end of the game because it is what we all want.
15. Ben Flower: Prop
He and [Wales international team-mate] Gil Dudson are always trying to crack jokes and get one over on each other.
Has come of age this year. Has got better and better since he joined Wigan. Like myself, is looking to win his first trophy on Saturday.
16. Chris Tuson: Prop
Leaving Wigan to join Wakefield at the end of the season. Has had a really good year for us and it will be sad to see him go because you need people like him in your side.
A real workhorse, great in defence and great in attack. Will be missed.
17. Iain Thornley: Centre
A bit of a worrier. Always coming into training worrying about whether it is fitness work we will be doing and how hard it is going to be.
Another one who has stepped up for us. Only a young lad still learning the game, but if he gets his chance on Saturday, he will take it.
20. Gil Dudson: Prop
Ben Flower's partner in crime.
Has added to the competition in the props and has done really well when he has played. If he gets the nod, he will be firing and will put in a big performance for us.
21. Scott Taylor: Prop
Another one of our new recruits from Hull KR, along with Blake Green.
Has been in and out of the squad and he would probably admit he has had a mixed first year with the club, but has done fantastically well in recent weeks and has become a big player for us.
23. Logan Tomkins: Hooker
Sam's younger brother, although he does not like being called that. A great player in his own right.
Has picked up the pace in games when he has come on and is getting better and better. Will be a great player for the future for Wigan.
26. Dom Crosby: Prop
Another of the young lads that has come in and keeps the senior guys on their toes. For me, he is up there for a starting place on Saturday.
Missed out on the squad that went to Catalans but I am sure he is in Shaun Wane's thoughts. Has made a massive impact this year.
