In pictures: Gender blending at London Fashion Week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gender blending and unisex clothing is not a new phenomenon - from David Bowie to Cara Delevigne, men have worn women's clothes and vice versa. However, recently this has been increasingly more common, with brands such as Zara, Selfridges and Alexander Wang, to name a few, creating specific gender neutral lines. Is this just a trend or a larger cultural shift in society?

We went to London Fashion Week to ask people their views.
"I'm not just a tomboy. Yesterday I was wearing a summery dress.
"But I like that I can wear whatever I want and not have to worry about whether or not it's gender appropriate. I feel empowered when I wear combat trousers and a hoodie because I feel like I can wear boys' clothes."
"The fashion industry has changed so much in the past 10 to 15 years. People such as David Bowie have pushed gender lines by wearing women's clothes.
"You can now wear a Gucci bag if you want - it doesn't matter if you are a woman or a man. Everything is unisex for me - I'm wearing women's trousers, top and bag."
"Women and men are now compared to one another in every sector, not just fashion. It's empowering that women can wear suits, as what you choose to wear is very important in all walks of life."
"The unisex style, that passed a few years ago, has now come back into fashion with oversized garments and boyfriend fit clothing.
"Fashion changes all the time, today it might be oversized and tomorrow it'll be something different. I like to wear similar things to men - like this XL jacket."
"There's been a general change in attitude, I don't think it's much to do with fashion, but I think fashion is the easiest way to get your identity out there.
"I wear women's clothes all the time. I don't believe clothing should have a gender - why should a plain hoodie be for a man or woman? I think couture brands are realising this and becoming increasingly unisex, but high street brands have a long way to go."
"I design my clothes to allow men to explore a broader range of fashion.
"I've noticed that men are becoming more open to try out different designs and concepts. I don't think it'll get to a stage where men are wearing wedding dresses, but we could get close."
"My brand ended up becoming unisex because women kept wearing the male pieces, which is often the case.
"As for men, they are gradually becoming more adventurous in what they wear. I often add female touches to many of my clothes to try them out.."
