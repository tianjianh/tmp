[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paris St-Germain 4-1 Reims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain need a maximum of 10 more points to retain the Ligue 1 title after Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and made two more in a win over Reims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laurent Blanc's side remain 24 points clear of Monaco, who beat bottom club Troyes 3-1 later on Saturday.
Gregory van der Wiel put PSG in front, but Prince Oniangue headed Reims level after an error by keeper Kevin Trapp.
Ibrahimovic made it 2-1, played in Edinson Cavani for the third and then volleyed in Van der Wiel's pass.
Television replays showed the Sweden striker should have been ruled offside when he scored the fourth goal, his 23rd in Ligue 1 this season.
However, he was excellent despite that piece of good fortune, with two finely judged passes to set up Van der Wiel and Cavani to score, in addition to his goals.
Despite the ease of unbeaten PSG's victory, there was concern for manager Blanc as winger Angel Di Maria was forced off with a first-half injury.
Kylian Mbappe broke Thierry Henry's record as the youngest scorer in Monaco's history as they defeated bottom club Troyes 3-1.
The Paris-born forward, aged 17 years and 62 days, scored the third in stoppage time after Guido Carillo had earlier scored twice.
Henry, who went on to have two spells with Arsenal, was 17 years and 254 days when he scored his first Monaco goal in a 6-0 win over Lens in April 1995.
Ajaccio missed the chance to move above Reims and out of the relegation zone, conceding a 91st-minute equaliser to Danish striker Martin Braithwaite in a 1-1 draw at next-to-bottom Toulouse.
Guingamp are just three points above the bottom three after letting a 2-0 lead slip as they lost 4-3 at Lorient. Montpellier moved four points clear of danger with a 3-2 victory at Angers.
