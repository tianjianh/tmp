Wigan Athletic 0-0 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan avoided a fifth-straight Championship defeat with a forgettable stalemate against Fulham, who remain unbeaten on their travels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had the better of the first half, Neeskens Kebano's drive was pushed clear by keeper Adam Bogdan.
Gary Caldwell's side went close when Yanic Wildschut cut inside and found Michael Jacobs, but his shot went wide.
Fulham keeper David Button was forced into action at the death, tipping Nick Powell's effort over the crossbar.
The game was marred by a serious-looking injury to Wigan midfielder Alex Gilbey, who was stretchered off in the first half with his leg strapped.
The draw moves the Latics up a place, but they remain in the relegation zone, while Fulham drop out of the top six.
Wigan have now failed to beat the Whites in their last 16 meetings - their longest winless run against an opponent and Fulham's longest unbeaten run against a side in their league history.
Wigan boss Gary Cauldwell:  "I think if we can get our defending right, we will win a lot of football matches. As an attacking team, I don't think there's many better in the league.
"The way we pass the ball is excellent, we cause teams a lot of problems, and we have attacking players who can score goals.
"We've scored in all but one game this season, and that is our main strength. We are very good going forward and that will get us points this season.
"If we can get the defending bit right, we'll be very difficult to play against."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "I cannot be satisfied because we didn't win the game. In my opinion we played very well, especially in the first 45 minutes.
"We defended very well but it was the same problems as the last two games. We had a problem opening up the game and we didn't create enough chances.
"We were moving around the box but weren't creating enough chances and we didn't score.
"At the end it's good news because we kept the clean sheet but we didn't score a goal."
