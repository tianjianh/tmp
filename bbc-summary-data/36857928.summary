[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Kenvyn, 26, from Dumfries, was driving on the wrong side of the road when his Renault Clio hit Barbara D'Amato's Fiat hire car.
The crash happened on the A702 near Elvanfoot, Lanarkshire, on 16 January 2014.
Mrs D'Amato, who hoped to buy a house in Scotland, died after suffering serious facial injuries.
Judge Lady Scott told Kenvyn: "You are facing the possibility, if not likelihood, of receiving a prison term."
He will be sentenced next month.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Kenvyn had not been paying attention at the time of the crash.
Mrs D'Amato's friend, Colette Ralph, age 48, who was travelling with her, suffered abdominal injuries in the crash.
She told the trial that Kenvyn had been travelling at "very high speed" at the time.
Mrs Ralph said: "It all happened so quickly. It was over in seconds.
"There was a loud bang and a violent jolt and the airbag was in my face. It took me a few seconds to register what happened.
"I couldn't get out of the front door. I climbed out of the back seat and tried to get out the back door. "
Mrs Ralph, a British ex-pat living in Switzerland, was taken to hospital where doctors informed her that her friend had died.
Kenvyn admitted that he was on the wrong side of the road but could offer no explanation as to why.
Mrs D'Amato, age 61, who lived in France, was visiting Scotland with a view to buying a property for her retirement.
Mrs Ralph said: "She had been planning to retire in Scotland. It was always her plan. Her intention was to come and live here."
The jury took 90 minutes to find Kenvyn guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.
Lady Scott banned him from driving and ordered reports.
He will return to the High Court in Edinburgh for sentencing on 19 August.
