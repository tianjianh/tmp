The 37-year-old had a five-year wait between his first two Test appearances but has been a regular opener alongside David Warner since 2013.
"I've been fortunate to have this second go at it and have loved every moment of it," he told Fox Sports.
"But time calls on everyone and I think it's nearly up for me."
Rogers, who has had spells with Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Middlesex and Northants in the County Championship, added: "I think to go out in the Ashes and in England where I've played a lot of cricket is pretty fitting."
In his 20 Tests for Australia, Rogers has scored 1535 runs, including four hundreds, at an average of 39.
