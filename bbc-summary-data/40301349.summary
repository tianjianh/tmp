Cladding systems used on four blocks of high-rise flats in Belfast have been "rigorously tested" according to the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive.

The social housing body has been reassuring tenants after concerns about cladding emerged in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in London.
NIHE confirmed cladding was used during the refurbishment of Eithne House and Cuchulainn House in the New Lodge area.
Whincroft House and Carnet House in east Belfast are currently being clad.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) said it has used two different systems to insulate the four Belfast towers but both systems were tested to British safety standards.
However, the housing body said it has also arranged meetings with the manufacturers of the cladding "to receive extra reassurance".
The NIHE carries out regular safety inspections at all 32 of its high-rise buildings but "follow-up checks" were undertaken on Wednesday and Thursday, in the aftermath of the London fire.
Its staff also held an emergency meeting with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service on Thursday afternoon to seek advice on any further action necessary.
In a statement on Thursday, the Belfast-housing body said it would be "wrong to speculate as to the cause of the London fire".
NIHE added it would "await the preliminary findings before drawing any initial conclusions".
"If there are lessons to be learned from the investigation we will take those on board and as a responsible landlord, we will undertake any actions that are required".
The housing body said it wanted to reassure its tenants that "their safety is taken extremely seriously".
It pointed out that all NIHE tower blocks have "fire-resistant" staircases, smoke alarms in communal areas and were designed with fire breaks on every floor.
Cladding has recently been completed at Eithne House and Cuchulainn House - two of seven tower blocks in the New Lodge, north Belfast.
According to the housing body, the buildings have been covered with a "rainshield rainscreen system made up of PvC panels, with Rockwool insulation underneath".
"The system was tested by the Building Research Establishment to British Standard BR135," the NIHE statement said.
The same system is currently being used at the ongoing refurbishment of Whincroft House in the Braniel area of east Belfast.
A different system has been commissioned to refurbish Carnet House in Dundonald.
The NIHE said the Carnet House project is using a "BBA (British Board of Agrement) external wall insulation system which consists of 120 mms of fire retardant polysterene, covered with a 9mm reinforced plaster render".
The housing body assured the BBC's Nolan Show that both systems had been tested to the same British safety standards.
Speaking on the same programme, North Belfast MLA Nichola Mallon said that since the London fire, a number of residents have been in contact with her about safety concerns, which she has raised with NIHE.
"It isn't about scaremongering, but it's about quickly establishing the truth and the facts, and then learning lessons from that and acting swiftly," she said.
The SDLP MLA welcomed the NIHE's review of its 32 tower blocks and a similar move by the Department of Health to check hospital buildings.
But Ms Mallon said her party was now calling for a "full assessment, in terms of safety and fire, of our public and private high-rise accommodation".
