Notts County 2-2 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aaron Collins scored an 88th-minute debut equaliser as Notts County made it four games unbeaten by coming from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mariners started brightly with Ashley Chambers firing off target following a neat flick by Shaun Tuton.
Tuton was linking up well with Omar Bogle up front and he wasted a glorious chance to give Grimsby the lead when he raced through only to slot wide of the post.
County's response was for Richard Duffy to force James McKeown into a save with a smart volley.
But it was Grimsby who made the breakthrough when Shaun Pearson's header from a corner snuck in.
Bogle extended the lead when he raced on to a poor back pass from Stanley Aborah and beat the advancing Adam Collin.
The hosts gave themselves hope when Jonathan Forte forced home his first goal for the club and they could have equalised straight when Vadaine Oliver was hauled down in the area.
Michael O'Connor took the spot-kick, but his shot hit a post. But Collins did snatch a 2-2 draw for County with a lovely finish from Oliver's brilliant knockdown.
