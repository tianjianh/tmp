Donald Trump and Conservatives offer no solutions - Corbyn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US president-elect Donald Trump tapped into "real problems" faced by voters but has failed to offer a remedy, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said.

Instead of offering solutions to issues such as falling wages and underfunded public services, Mr Trump has only blamed others, Mr Corbyn said.
He accused the Tories of being like Mr Trump by offering "slogans, but not solutions for most people in Britain".
The Conservatives said Labour was "out of step" with "ordinary people".
In a speech to the Labour South East Regional Conference, Mr Corbyn described Mr Trump's shock election victory over Hillary Clinton as a "global wake-up call".
Mr Corbyn said millions of people in the US and UK feel "left behind" and "marginalised" by the current economic system - something Mr Trump had tapped into during the election campaign.
"There is deep anger at a political elite that doesn't listen," he said.
"But instead of offering real solutions or the resources to make them work, he offered only someone to blame - everyone that is apart for those actually responsible for the broken economy or the failed political system.
"That's Trump in his election campaign in the USA. Now cross that Atlantic to here. The Tories do exactly the same."
The Labour leader said the US and UK electorate both feel left behind by a economic system that makes them work harder while rewarding a small elite.
He told supporters the UK will be unable to "take back control" by simply leaving the EU and instead needed to "take on corporate vested interests".
The Conservatives have "opened the door to UKIP and fanned the flames of fear", he added.
"Theresa May as home secretary fed the idea that immigration was the real problem, made promises she knew she couldn't deliver about slashing numbers," he said.
"And she whipped up hate with those notorious go home vans. No wonder she didn't even temper her welcome to Donald Trump.
"She has used the same strategy herself - if delivered with a more refined voice."
A Conservative spokesman said: "Jeremy Corbyn presides over a Labour Party that is divided, divisive and utterly out of step with the concerns of ordinary working people.
"Labour would bankrupt our country like they did last time, erode our armed forces, making us less safe - and they also don't think there should be any limits on immigration at all."
