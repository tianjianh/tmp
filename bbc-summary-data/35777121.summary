Scotland and Celtic skipper Scott Brown has praised "rising star" Kieran Tierney, listing what he sees as his club-mate's range of talents.

The 18-year-old has replaced Honduran Emilio Izaguirre as Ronny Deila's first-choice left-back and has now been called into his first Scotland squad.
"For the last three or four months he has been exceptional," said Brown.
"Nothing fazes the wee man. He will thrive off the occasion, playing with international players."
Tierney made his breakthrough into the Celtic team at the tail end of last season and has made 23 appearances in the current campaign.
His performances have been rewarded with a call-up by national team manager Gordon Strachan to the squad to play Denmark in a friendly at Hampden on 29 March.
"He [Kieran] works so hard in training and he's got a great attitude," said Brown.
"He's a rising star, that's for sure. Hopefully he gets a little chance against Denmark and he can show the manager what he can do. We see him every day in training. Just to put that Scotland jersey on, he'll love it.
"He is still learning the game, he is still a young kid. He is composed on the ball, he is good at one-on-one defending and he is also a great attacking outlet for us. He has pretty much got everything you could ask for.
"Tackling is a strength of his game and wingers and midfielders get scared when they go one-on-one with him because they know what he can do.
"Plus he can break as well; he's got great pace."
With Strachan offering nine players the chance to win their first cap, 30-year-old Brown, who has won 49 caps, admits he and the other experienced players will have to keep on their toes to retain their places.
"The gaffer has a few new faces," add the midfielder. "It's a challenge for everyone. There are always younger ones coming in who want your position."
