The academy, on Martingale Way, Lawley, is expected to cater for 201 pupils and is due open in January 2016, three months later than first announced.
It will be sponsored by REAch2 WM Academy Trust, one of the largest primary-only academy trusts in the UK, Telford and Wrekin Council said.
The school will provide "much needed places for local children in a growing community", a council spokesman said.
It is the last in a series of 13 schools secured through Labour's Building Schools for the Future programme, which was scrapped four years ago by the incoming coalition government.
The council has said the school, which will have a playing field and community facilities, could eventually cater for about 420 pupils.
