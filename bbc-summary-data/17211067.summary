What's special about 29 February?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Usually February is a very short month, with only 28 days. But every four years, in what's known as a leap year, it has an extra one - giving it 29.

Have a look at our guide to leap years and let us know your thoughts at the end.
According to the calendar, there are 365 days in a year.
But it actually takes the Earth almost 365 days and six hours to revolve all the way around the Sun.
So every four years, about an extra 24 hours have added up, so one extra day is added to the year to keep the calendar in tune with the Sun.
It takes slightly less that 365 days and 6 hours for the Earth to go around the Sun, so to make up for that, a few years aren't made into leap years even though you'd expect it.
A person who was born on 29 February is sometimes called a leapling.
And although their birthday only actually happens once every four years, they don't go without presents!
In normal years, leaplings celebrate their birthday on 28 February or 1 March instead.
A year that can by divided evenly by four is usually a leap year.
February 29 is the 60th day in a leap year of the Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used calendar in the world today and the one used in the UK.
Traditionally, it was seen as the man's job to ask a woman to marry him.
Women could propose themselves only on a leap day.
We asked what you're doing to celebrate and how old you'll actually be today.
