Train operators have said there will be no extra trains back to south Wales after the Rugby World Cup clash between Wales and England at Twickenham.

Wales fans hoping to travel home after Saturday's game said they would be left stranded if they relied on the train.
The last service from Paddington is at 22:00 BST - just 30 minutes after the game is due to finish.
Great Western Railway said the closure of Severn Tunnel for engineering work prevented them putting on more trains.
Meanwhile passengers may face delays travelling to London, after Arriva Trains Wales confirmed delays between Cardiff and Newport due to a cable theft.
Wales and England face each other at Twickenham at 20:00 BST in what is expected to be the most explosive contest of the World Cup so far, as both sides aim to bolster their quarter-final chances.
GWR said less than 2% of match tickets had been sold to fans in Wales - with most staying overnight.
"Given the particularly late kick off and with a journey time from Twickenham to a GWR station of at least an hour - meaning the earliest train to some destinations in south Wales would not arrive until at least 02:00 - most fans from Wales are likely to choose to travel by alternative means, or stay overnight," an official for the train operator said.
"No amount of additional trains would change the fact that the Severn Tunnel is closed, and we are not able to run any more trains through it to get to Wales than we already are.
"The train timetable following the game has been published well in advance and the majority of customers will have planned their return from the match accordingly."
GWR said its plans were also based on match ticket data provided by Rugby World Cup, which said less than 2% of match tickets have been sold in Wales.
Train travel arrangements for the game is the latest in a series of complaints that have marred the start of the tournament, following overcrowding problems at Cardiff Central after the Ireland v Canada game.
It prompted Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb to tell train operators to "fix it".
GWR also had to apologise after fans faced long delays following the Scotland v Japan game in Gloucester and Australia's match against Fiji in Cardiff.
The issues have also seen the Welsh economy minister Edwina Hart intervene to warn train operators that "they've got to get their act in order".
She told assembly members: "I don't very often agree with the secretary of state for Wales, but I do agree with him on this occasion and what he says: 'Can't they just get on with it and actually sort it out?'
However, with five more Rugby World Cup matches still to be played at the Millennium Stadium - including two quarter finals - Cardiff council dismissed any suggestion that delays experienced by rugby fans painted the city in a poor light.
"The positive benefits for the city massively outweigh the negatives - it's a good thing for the city," insisted a spokesman.
Moving tens of thousands of people in and out of the city centre always "poses some challenges" he added, which was why the council had established areas such as fan zones, to ease pressure on the road and rail network, by persuading people to stagger their journeys home.
The council said it was continuing to liaise with rail and bus operators for the upcoming games, with the possibility of increasing capacity for one of two sold-out park-and-ride facilities in the city.
