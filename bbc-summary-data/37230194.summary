The 24-year-old played more than 200 times for the Rams in the Championship and signed a three-deal at Turf Moor on transfer deadline day.
The Clarets had a bid for Hendrick turned down earlier this summer.
Hendrick had an impressive Euro 2016 campaign in June, helping the Republic of Ireland progress out of the group stage.
"The Premier League was a big draw for me and it's where I aspire to be after the summer I've had," Hendrick told the club website.
"Burnley did so well last year going unbeaten for five months and how much they wanted me this summer was a real positive."
A product of the Derby academy, he made his Rams debut in April 2011 and has gone on to score 27 goals in 214 games.
Burnley's previous record signing came earlier this month when they signed Belgium midfielder Steven Defour for £8m from Anderlecht.
Meanwhile, Clarets defender Danny Lafferty has joined League One side Sheffield United on a season-long loan.
Austrian youth international Renny Smith, 19, has also left Turf Moor, moving to Italian Serie B side Vicenza in a permanent deal.
