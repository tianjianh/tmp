Police have renewed their appeal for information on the first anniversary of the death of a man in west Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Corrigan, 31, was found at a flat in St Mary's Garden and later died in hospital.
Post mortem results indicated he may have died in suspicious circumstances.
Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said police believe Mr Corrigan may have been assaulted in the hours prior to his death.
"We are carrying out a full investigation into Sean's death," he said.
"We have examined CCTV footage and spoken to a number of witnesses. We will also be carrying out house to house enquiries in the area over the coming days.
"It is vital that we speak to anyone who may have more information in relation to Sean's movements that night and what happened in the apartment.
"I would urge the local community to help us ascertain what happened to Sean by coming forward with information. If you were in the area between 1am and lunchtime, if you saw any suspicious activity or if you have any other information about Sean's death which might assist us with our enquiries, then please get in touch."
