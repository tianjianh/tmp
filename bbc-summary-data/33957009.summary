I Believe in Miracles tells the story of the club's rise under Brian Clough, from second division strugglers to European champions in 1979 and 1980.
Nottingham Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi announced the news on Twitter earlier.
The documentary film has been directed by actor Jonny Owen.
Mr Al Hasawi tweeted: "I am excited to announce that the world premiere of I Believe in Miracles will be held at The City Ground."
When Brian Clough took over at Nottingham Forest in January 1975, the team were in the bottom half of the old second division.
Within two years they were promoted to Division One and in their first season beat Liverpool, Everton, Manchester City and Arsenal to the title.
The following year the team, captained by John McGovern, beat some of Europe's best to claim the European Cup at the Olympic Stadium, in Munich.
The film features interviews with a number of the squad who won the trophy in 1979 and retained it a year later.
The documentary also charts events in Nottingham at the time and how the club's achievements impacted on the city.
Nottingham Contemporary will also hold a short exhibition, alongside the release, titled Miracle Men.
A book written by Daniel Taylor, the Guardian's chief football writer, who is also a Forest supporter, will be published to coincide with the film's general release, which is expected in October.
