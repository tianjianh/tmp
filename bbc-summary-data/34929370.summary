[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is to become QPR's manager, interim boss Neil Warnock said after Nedum Onuoha sealed victory at Reading.

Warnock said Thursday's match was his last in charge, with Burton Albion boss Hasselbaink his replacement.
"Jimmy will find it tough, but there's no reason why he can't be successful," Warnock said.
Onuoha profited from a mistake by Reading goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi to give Rangers victory in the last minute.
The centre-back had earlier missed a glorious chance from a close-range header after Charlie Austin had flicked the ball on.

Nick Blackman had Reading's best chance when he hit the crossbar with a second-half free-kick.
Just as a game of limited quality and few chances looked set to end goalless, Onuoha rose at the back post to head in Alejandro Faurlin's deep corner.
Oman international Al-Habsi saw the ball squirm through his legs and across the line to secure victory for Warnock in his final game as interim boss.
Warnock, who took charge after Chris Ramsey was sacked on 4 November, said afterwards that his temporary reign was over.
Reading and QPR were both guilty of creating little quality in the final third.
Aside from Blackman's left-footed free-kick off the bar, Michael Hector headed chances from set-pieces wide in either half while substitute Hal Robson-Kanu screwed a left-foot effort wide from the edge of the area for the Royals.
Junior Hoilett had QPR's only other attempt on target with a tame left-foot shot in the first half.
Defeat sees Reading miss out on a return to the top six while QPR move to within two points of the play-off places.
QPR interim manager Neil Warnock: "It's been a difficult 24 hours as I didn't expect it to be my last game.
"It was quite strange today. I asked the players to give me everything they had and they did, they were magnificent.
"I'm off to Cornwall tomorrow and then we'll see what's around the corner in the next few weeks."
Reading manager Steve Clarke: "I understand the supporters are disappointed that we're not winning matches.
"If supporters direct anger at me, it means they're not directing at the players, so that's fine."
