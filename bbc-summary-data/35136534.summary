[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Bates, 43, and seven-year-old Fraser were struck at Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, on 6 December.
Anna-Louise Bates said her husband and son were the most "entertaining and inspirational two boys".
The service took place on Saturday morning at St Martins Church, Roath, Cardiff.
Mr Bates and his son were crossing the A4119 at about 00:30 GMT on Sunday 6 December when they were hit by an Alfa Romeo car.
Mr Bates was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital where he died from his injuries.
Fraser was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital but also died from the head injuries he sustained.
Last week, more than 300 people gathered in a park near Watkins Square in Cardiff to release orange and blue balloons to celebrate the lives of the pair, who lived in the Llanishen area of the city.
Mrs Bates has also launched a crowd-funding page to raise money that will support a charity being set-up in their memory called Believe.
It will provide help for families to discuss organ donation and has already attracted pledges of Â£2,800.
The organs of Fraser, a pupil at Llysfaen Primary School in Cardiff, were donated to transplant patients.
An inquest into the deaths was opened and adjourned earlier in the week.
A 22-year-old driver has been arrested and bailed by police.
