The 42-year-old worked with Easter Road boss Alan Stubbs at Everton's youth academy and leaves his job as Wigan's Under-18s coach to move to Edinburgh.
Doolan, who played for Mansfield, Barnet and Rochdale, has also coached at the Liverpool academy.
"I'm thrilled to be able to bring John to Hibernian - he is a quality coach with an excellent pedigree," Stubbs told the club website.
"I've known him for a long time and I completely trust his judgement. He will be able to implement fresh ideas to improve our squad and his appointment is a real coup for Hibernian."
