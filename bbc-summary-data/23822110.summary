A Nevada pair has appeared in court accused of plotting to abduct, torture and kill police to promote their anti-government movement.

David Allen Brutsche, 42, and Devon Campbell Newman, 67, told a Las Vegas judge they did not recognise his authority to keep them in jail.
The roommates were arrested earlier this week after a sting operation.
Police say an undercover officer spent four months with the pair monitoring their alleged "sovereign citizen" plot.
There are 300,000 followers of the sovereign citizen anti-government philosophy around the US, according to a non-profit civil rights group, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The two suspects shopped for guns, found a vacant house and set it up to bind and interrogate captives, according to the authorities.
They also allegedly recorded videos to justify their murder plot against police officers.
The investigation began when an undercover officer befriended the two accused in April, said police.
Las Vegas police Lt James Seebock told reporters the plot had been a case of domestic terrorism.
"They were furthering their 'sovereign citizen' ideology by committing criminal acts toward law enforcement," Lt Seebock said.
"The suspects believed that once the first kidnapping and execution was accomplished, they would be compelled to keep repeating their actions, kidnapping and killing multiple officers."
The judge sent them back to jail pending a court hearing on 9 September.
