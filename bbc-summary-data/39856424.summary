The 26-year-old scored six goals in his last five league games, earning him the player of the month award for April.
Boyce has one year left on his contract but says he has ignored speculation about interest from other clubs.
"I try not to let it go to my head, [or] start trying to impress people that are watching you. I'm just happy to be here," Boyce said.
"I just try to forget about it and keep doing what I'm doing on the pitch."
The Northern Ireland international remains the second top scorer in the Premiership with 20 goals, behind Celtic's Scott Sinclair.
His scoring form in April - which included all four goals in the Highland derby victory over Inverness - helped to lift Ross County up to seventh in the Premiership table, seven points clear of second-bottom Motherwell.
Boyce is in his third season at the club after joining from Cliftonville on a free transfer three years ago, after returning to Ireland following a spell with German side Werder Bremen.
"Obviously, when you're getting linked with clubs you're obviously doing something right," Boyce told BBC Scotland.
"I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing. I was in Germany and came back to Ireland and found it tough. I didn't think I would probably would have got another chance.
"My family is all happy here and I'm just buzzing to be where I am at the minute and enjoying it."
Boyce admits it has been a frustrating season for County, having missed out on a top six place but he believes they'll finish strongly, on the back of five games unbeaten.
"Every year we go on a wee run where it sort of drives us over the line or pushes us into the top six like we done last year," said the 26 year old. "We hadn't done it this year.
"We've won three and drew two of our last five games and that's cemented our place.
"When we're under pressure we seem to do better. Thankfully we got that run together, the pressure will be off and we can go out and show what we can do."
