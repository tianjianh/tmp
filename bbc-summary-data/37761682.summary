Premiership: Bristol 13-31 Sale Sharks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol's Gavin Henson suffered a shoulder injury on his comeback as the Premiership's bottom side were easily beaten by Sale Sharks at Ashton Gate.

Henson lasted 11 minutes for the winless hosts, having been out injured since the opening day of the season.
Paolo Odogwu and Mike Haley tries put Sale 12-0 up at half-time, with Byron McGuigan, Eifion Lewis-Roberts and Tom Curry going over after the break.
In response, Shane Geraghty landed three kicks and David Lemi went over.
Defeat was the ninth in all competitions for Bristol this season, with Andy Robinson's side picking up just two losing bonus points since winning promotion from the Championship.
For Sale, the West Country triumph ends a three-game losing run - they lost both their opening games in the European Champions Cup after suffering a heavy Premiership defeat by Bath earlier in October.
The loss of fly-half Henson was an early blow for a side that attracted a 14,025 crowd, most of them wanting to see a first win in the top flight for seven years.
In a largely scrappy affair, Bristol failed to apply sustained pressure, while Sale were more ruthless on the way to collecting a bonus-point win, as Haley marked his call-up to the England squad for the autumn internationals with a try and teenager Curry became the club's youngest ever Premiership try scorer.
Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson on Henson's injury:
"It is a serious shoulder injury which is a real shame.
"We really feel for him. It is a potential operation that is needed to the shoulder but we will find out more later.
On the defeat, Robinson said: "Our players kept going right to the final whistle but that is our worst performance. We have got to be better defensively and use the Anglo-Welsh games coming up to see if we can get a victory, which will give a bit of confidence to everyone."
Sale Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond:
"I don't expect bonus points in this competition. If you get them, it is a bonus.
"We took a couple of head knocks early doors but from this Monday, we are picking from a full-strength squad with everyone back from injury."
