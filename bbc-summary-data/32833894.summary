[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield ballot paper error did not affect election outcome

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An administrative error did not alter the outcome of a local election in Macclesfield, a review has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mistake at a polling station meant "an unknown number" of people were incorrectly able to vote for candidates from outside their own ward.
The votes were part of the first election for Macclesfield's new town council.
Cheshire East Council was granted a court order to reopen ballot boxes from the South ward.
The review "confirmed that the administrative error had not affected the outcome of the parish election", Cheshire East Council said.
One Conservative and one Labour member were elected to represent South ward on 7 May.
The Conservatives have eight seats on the new authority while Labour has four.
The first meeting of the new town council takes place later.
