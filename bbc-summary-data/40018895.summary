Sir Roger Moore: a life in pictures
"I knew him all my life, my sister and I grew up with his children Geoffrey, Deborah, and Christian," says Steven who lives in Monaco.
Steven says Sir Roger had a great sense of humour despite his illness.
"We knew he had been sick for a while. But he was so elegant throughout this battle. He never let his humour slip.
"Only up to very recently he sent me jokes via email - his sense of humour was extraordinary.
And it wasn't just his sense of humour that left an impression on Steven: "He had such a beautiful character, and was always impeccably dressed, even in Monaco!"
He went on to say that Sir Roger had many friends in Monaco and had lived there for many years.
"The man had three strings to his bow: his family, charity work and his craft.
"We can't believe it - We are just crest-fallen.
"There is a huge outpouring of grief here. We are all weeping. We just miss him.
"I loved this man."
