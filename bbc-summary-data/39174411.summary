Officers are keen to locate the mother of the child after the remains were found in Broadway, Sheerness, on Saturday afternoon.
Kent Police said the identity of the dead child is still not known and neither is the cause of death.
Det Insp Richard Vickery said the remnants of a small fire were found at the scene.
The fire is thought to have been started between 10:00 GMT and 12:30.
Officers received a report the remains had been found just before 12:50 GMT.
Det Insp Vickery said: "We're very keen to locate the mother of this girl as we are concerned for her wellbeing and want to make sure she is receiving the necessary emotional and medical support."
He appealed to hear from anyone who was in Broadway on Saturday morning. Officers have said information will be handled sensitively.
