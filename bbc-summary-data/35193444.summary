A campaign has been launched to save a telephone box which is used by walkers for shelter in the Cambrian mountains.

The red box, situated between Tregaron in Ceredigion and Llanwrtyd in Powys, has been listed for removal by BT because it has not worked for more than 18 months.
But keen walkers have described it as an "important part of the landscape".
BT said the box had been targeted by vandals and gave the public 90 days to raise objections before it is removed.
But campaigner Marilyn Barrack said it could be a "lifeline" to ramblers caught in bleak conditions.
Ms Barrack, chairwoman of the Elenydd Wilderness Hostels Trust, said: "Mobile coverage is very sparse and there is not another phone box for about seven miles, and there are not many houses in the area."
Dafydd Morgan, of Tregaron Walking Club, said: "From a distance it stands out prominently in whatever direction you see it from - it's the only landmark up there that can assist people on their travels."
A spokesman for BT said: "We have started a consultation with Ceredigion council and the community would have an opportunity to feed into this."
