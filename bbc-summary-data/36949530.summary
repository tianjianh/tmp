It was the hosts who started the better, but Woking took the lead just after half an hour when Nathan Ralph, unmarked in the box, headed home a cross from the right.
Woking's second arrived when Zak Ansah's cross went all the way in just four minutes after half-time.
Substitute Harry White was at the heart of things for Solihull, first pulling a goal back in the 72nd minute, and then seeing his shot poked home by Jordan Fagbola after a rebound seven minutes later.
