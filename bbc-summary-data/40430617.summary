Police said the Guilsborough School pupil came into contact with electricity from an overhead line.
Supt Chris Hodgkiss, from British Transport Police, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the boy and we are doing all we can to understand exactly what led to Harrison's death.
"As well as investigating the circumstances surrounding his death, our focus is also on preventing any other children from coming to harm in a similar way.
"With that in mind, I would urge all parents to remind their children about the dangers of trespassing on the railway, which is an extremely dangerous environment."
Assistant Chief Constable Robin Smith, of the British Transport Police, said: "It's a deeply tragic incident when a young person dies on the railway.
"We recognise that trespass is an issue on the railway and there is an attraction to young people to go near the railway, and if we can learn anything from this it is how dangerous it is.
"We have our own unit to understand where our hot spots are, but the best thing we can do is prevent it happening. A lot of fencing is already going up, but it would have to be very long and expensive to fence every route.
"The real answer, given the tragic events, is that parents and schools do their best to reinforce that message [of the dangers]."
