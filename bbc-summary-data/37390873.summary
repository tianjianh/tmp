The 22-year-old, who won the 2015 US Open, carded six birdies to end the day with a five-under-par round of 66.
Compatriot Sung Hyun Park made three bogeys to lose her share of the lead and ended the day tied in second with China's Shanshan Feng at 11 under.
England's Laura Davies, 52, missed the cut after she finished four over par.
Four-time major winner Davies followed up her first-round 69 with a round of 77, which included three bogeys and a double bogey.

Charley Hull, England's highest ranked player at 26th in the world, made the three-over cut as she shot a second-round 73. The 20-year-old heads into the weekend one under par, while 47-year-old Scot Catriona Matthew will return on Saturday after a round of 70 left her at one over.
New Zealand's world number one and defending champion Lydia Ko is tied for 13th on the leaderboard at three under after she shot 68.
Chun, who holds the lead in a major after 36 holes for the first time, said she has not contemplated the prospect of winning a second major title.
"I had one bogey early on today but recovered to have a good round and that gives me a lot of confidence," she told the Ladies European Tour.
"I always try not to think about winning a tournament because if I think about that it gives me more pressure, so I just try to focus on my game."
