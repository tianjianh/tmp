The accident, on the A140 at Roughton at about 07:25 GMT, was one of 12 police dealt with earlier.
Some of the vehicles collided while others skidded off the road, Norfolk Police said.
The road was closed between the B1436 Thorpe Market Road junction and the White Post Road junction but reopened just after 12:20 GMT.

Insp John Chapman, from the road policing unit, said his team alone had dealt with seven accidents "in the space of an hour".
He said bearing in mind the weather conditions, "it didn't surprise me that we were suffering quite a high volume of road traffic collisions".
"Fortunately, there were no serious injuries in any of these... but there was obviously a high demand on our resources."
He advised drivers to "expect the unexpected" during the cold snap.
