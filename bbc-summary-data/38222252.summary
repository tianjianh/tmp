A lorry driver who killed a mother and daughter when he drove through a red light has been jailed for 14 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zena Victoria Jackson, 43, and Cidalia Mendes-Jackson, six, died after being hit on a pedestrian crossing on Spring Bank, Hull, in April.
Neville Fletcher, 55, of Southcoates Lane, Hull, admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving.
Hull Crown Court heard he had driven to the middle of the road to perform a sharp left turn by traffic lights.

The lights changed to red as the lorry approached, with the mother and daughter starting to cross the road.
Patrick Palmer, prosecuting, said the pair had waited at the crossing for a second full sequence of lights as if the mother was showing her daughter how to cross safely.
Fletcher's attention was caught up in negotiating other vehicles on the busy road and checking side mirrors as he got his vehicle into position to turn, the court heard.
Dashcam footage from the lorry showed Fletcher failing to stop with the vehicle travelling at about 1.9mph (3km/h) when he hit the pair.
Malcolm Galloway, defending, said Fletcher had worked for 35 years in driving jobs and had never had an accident before.
He said the accident would live with Fletcher forever and "if he could possibly turn back the clock, he would".
Ms Jackson's daughter Sadie Jackson wrote a victim personal statement describing how "dreadfully affected" the family was by the loss of Ms Jackson and Cidalia and how loved they were.
Sentencing, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC accepted Fletcher was remorseful, but said: "You made an appalling mistake with catastrophic consequences."
