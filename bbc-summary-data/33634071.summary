The 1970s Welsh rugby star's wife Mari, family and friends will watch 'Grav' at Mynydd-y-Garreg Hall, Carmarthenshire.
Former Llanelli RFC centre, Gravell, who was also a broadcaster and actor, died in 2007, aged 56, after problems related to diabetes.
Grav, a one-man show with actor Gareth Bale, was first performed in January.
Pembrokeshire-based Torch Theatre took the production on tour around Wales earlier this year.
Following Saturday's performance, it will move to Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, before its stint at the Edinburgh Festival this summer.
