Banksy's Dismaland provides weapons guide ahead of arms fair

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A free Banksy weapons guide - which the artist describes as being "of limited use in Weston super-Mare" - is being offered at his Dismaland theme park.

The guide for tracking manufacturers of weapons used against public protest, is also available on Dismaland's website.
The release coincides with the opening of the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) fair in London.
A statement on the theme park's website said: "We're asking anyone who might find this helpful to disperse the PDF."
Since the park opened in the derelict seafront lido in Somerset on 22 August, thousands of fans have flocked to the site, with the Â£3 tickets selling out in minutes.
Dismaland has been labelled as "twisted", but the Bristol artist insists it was built as a "family attraction that acknowledges inequality and impending catastrophe".
A statement on the park's website - under the headline "Tickets to the gun show?" - reads: "This week sees the opening of the DSEI Arms Fair (the world's largest arms fair).
"To commemorate the occasion Dismaland's museum curator Dr Gavin Grindon alongside the #RiotID project have produced a guide for tracking the manufacturers of weapons used against public protest.
"These are available in the park from today, but obviously are of limited use in Weston super-Mare so we're asking anyone who might find this helpful to disperse the PDF below."
The artist said he was inspired to create the park after peering through a gap in the fence at the Tropicana site in January.
The show, a dark take on theme parks with a nod to Disneyland, was organised in secrecy over the course of months.
Running twice a day until 27 September, it has been claimed it will boost the local economy by Â£7m.
