The 25-year-old overcame an early penalty miss to fire in a last-minute winner for the Cherries on Saturday.
Norway international King took his goal tally to 11 for the season as Bournemouth came from 1-0 behind.
"I'm enjoying playing higher up the pitch as a two-man pair alongside Benik Afobe," he told BBC Radio Solent.
King became the sixth Norwegian to net a Premier League hat-trick joining illustrious names such as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Tore Andre Flo, as Bournemouth picked up a first win of 2017.
The 14th-placed Cherries are now six points clear of the relegation zone with 10 matches left.
With team-mate Callum Wilson set to miss the remainder of the season, King has become a focal point for Bournemouth's attacking threat alongside fellow frontman Afobe.
"I like playing under pressure," he said. "Any side we play against, Benik and I are going to cause a problem when we're on it and I'm enjoying that.
"I had set myself a target of 15 goals at the start of the season, but I just want to help the team and try and score as many as I can to climb that table with my team-mates."
