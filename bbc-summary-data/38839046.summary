The year seven pupil, named locally as Michael Sousa, fell at Jane Austen College in Norwich on 23 January.
An air ambulance helicopter took him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he died on Wednesday.
The Health and Safety Executive is investigating. The school is holding a non-uniform day on Tuesday in his memory.
An online fundraising page was set up for the boy's mother, Sandra Rodriguez, after the initial incident.

The college is a free school, one of 13 academies and free schools run by the Inspiration Trust.
Rebecca Handley Kirk, principal at Jane Austen, said: "We are devastated by these events and we send our thoughts and our love to Michael's family and friends.
"Michael had only joined us in September, but was already becoming a well-known student throughout the school, thanks to his lively personality.
"These tragic events are upsetting for students, parents, and staff, but we will continue to support each other, as a strong and loving school community."
A Norfolk Police spokesman said: "We are not investigating any suspicious circumstances surrounding the fall and subsequent death at Jane Austen College.
"We are in the process of preparing a file for the coroner who will carry out an inquest in due course."
Pupils can take part in the special non-uniform day on 7 February by wearing green clothing, which the school said was Michael's favourite colour.
It will raise money for the East Anglian Air Ambulance and Nelson's Journey - a local charity which provides bereavement support for young people.
