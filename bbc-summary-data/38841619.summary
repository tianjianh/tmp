Harris made 79 appearances for the Blades after joining from Blackpool in January 2014, but he has been without a club since being released last May.
The 29-year-old ended last season on loan at Fleetwood, featuring in only one League One game.
"He has done well in training during his time with us and will provide cover for us," said manager Darrell Clarke.
