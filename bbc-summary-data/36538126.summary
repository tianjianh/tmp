National Grid agrees power cables under Menai Strait route

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Grid has said it was trying to protect the Menai Strait's beauty by keeping connections to Anglesey's planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station away from the coast.

Last year, it said it would use underground cables instead of pylons between Anglesey and the mainland.
It has since confirmed three miles (5km) of underground cables with no pylons between Gaerwen and Bangor.
The local AM said it would not affect plans for other pylons across the area.
The National Grid said it could refine its proposals further following more technical considerations and it would provide extra information later this year.
Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was "frustrated" the company was not listening to people and considering alternatives.
But National Grid senior project manager Gareth Williams said the revision affecting the Menai Strait followed a public consultation which showed it was a "valued landscape and tourist destination".
