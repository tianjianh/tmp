RMT union plans 17 days of DLR strikes in 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Workers on London's Docklands Light Railway (DLR) plan to strike for 17 days in the new year in a long-running dispute over working practices.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 640 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union plan to take industrial action between January and March, the RMT said.
DLR operator Keolis Amey said it was "disappointed" strike dates had been announced as talks were still ongoing.
One element of the dispute is about the operator's use of agency staff.
The union said it was against the "casualisation" of the workforce, but a Keolis Amey spokesman said the percentage of agency staff it employed was "very low".

DLR workers went on strike for 48 hours last month, the first since the service began in 1987.
The first 24-hour strike is scheduled to start at 03.59 GMT on 11 January followed by further walkouts on 13 January, 8 and 11 February, and 7, 10, 21 and 29 of March.
The final two strikes are due to last for four days.
