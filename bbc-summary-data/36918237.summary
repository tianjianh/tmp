The 17-year-old made his senior debut for West Brom against Liverpool in May, having previously been named as a substitute when he was aged only 16.
He signed his first professional contract at The Hawthorns in January.
"Tyler's an exciting player who has pace, plenty of skill and an eye for goal," Oxford boss Michael Appleton told the club's website.
"A lot of people within football believe he has the talent to play at the highest level.
"This will be a fantastic chance for him to start showing what he can do on a regular basis."
Roberts was first spotted by scouts playing in a tournament in his hometown of Gloucester for junior side Tredworth Tigers.
After joining Albion, he made weekly journeys up and down the M5 to train at Albion's academy, in the shadow of the M6 junction at Great Barr.
But when he reached secondary school age, his mother chose to move north to Birmingham, finding a new job to allow her son to switch schools to Sandwell Academy and follow his football dream.
He captained Wales Under-16s to victory in last season's Victory Shield, setting up two goals against Scotland before scoring in the final against Northern Ireland.
He qualifies to represent Wales through his grandparents.
