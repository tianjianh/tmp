Derbyshire explosion: Neighbour tried to save couple

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An off-duty firefighter has told how he made his way into a burning house as he tried in vain to save the lives of two of his neighbours after an explosion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Archer put on old fire-fighting equipment and searched for casualties in the house on Sunday morning.
The bodies of a married couple, named locally as Simon and Shelley Saxton-Cooper, were later found in a bedroom of the house in Riddings, Derbyshire.
Investigations into the cause of the fire are continuing.
"The flames started straight away," said Mr Archer. "One of the neighbours had got a key and they opened the back door."
A pet dog got out of the house as the door was opened.
"I made my way in shouting 'Can you hear me?' and the downstairs was really clear," said Mr Archer.
"I got to the bottom of the stairs, shouting again, and made my way up to the top of the stairs.
"By this time the house was pretty well ablaze - the front bedroom door was on fire but I was shouting, 'Hello, can anyone hear me?'"
Mr Archer feared the roof might cave in, and eventually left the house via the front door as he heard the sirens of the first fire engines to arrive.
The fire destroyed much of the building's roof, and fire crews had to wait for several hours for the remaining structure to be declared safe before they could recover the victims' remains.
Mr Archer, who knew the couple "to say hello to", said what had happened was "very, very sad".
"I just thought I would try and do my bit," said the firefighter, who had worn old equipment stored in his garage including a tunic, flash-hood and fire-retardant gloves.
"With our training, I might have been able to do more with the proper kit."
The alarm was raised at about 07:30 BST when neighbours in Valley View Road heard what they described as a "bang".
Emergency services declared a "major incident" and neighbours were evacuated from their homes as a precaution.
Police said they were keeping an open mind about the cause of the fire. A gas leak is one possible cause.
A Home Office pathologist will be carrying out post-mortem examinations on the bodies as soon as possible to determine the cause of their deaths.
"Because of the extent of the fire damage, it's a difficult and complex investigation and there will be a full forensic examination of the scene," police said.
The dog is fine and is being looked after by relatives of the couple.
