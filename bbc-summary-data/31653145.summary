[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the UK's first multiplex cinemas, built nearly 30 years ago in Milton Keynes, has shown its last film before demolition for a shops scheme.

The Point, a pyramid shaped building, is a distinctive landmark in the town.
But, on Thursday it featured the Kingsman: The Secret Service, as its last broadcast.
The Point opened on 3 November 1985 but less than a year before its 30th birthday the Imax at Stadium MK has replaced it.
Several attempts have been made to retain part of its legacy.
A year ago, Milton Keynes Museum director Bill Griffiths said the red pyramid structure above the building would make a "great gateway" to its Wolverton site.
But, lobby group Urban Eden fought against the idea and said there would be "huge cost implications".
Milton Keynes Council had already granted permission for it to be demolished by developers, who want to build new shops and leisure outlets.
Work to clear the site for a new development will start later in the year.
Campaigners have said any new design should incorporate the original pyramid structure which had become a landmark in the town.
