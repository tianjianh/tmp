Dorset waste team predicts £2m overspend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A waste partnership set up to save money for Dorset's councils is expected to overspend its budget by £2m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dorset Waste Partnership has already laid off some agency staff and removed bring banks in a bid to cut costs.
Residents are now being consulted over a raft of future cuts including closing recycling centres and extra charges.
Launched in 2011 with the aim of saving £2m a year, the partnership provides waste, recycling and street cleaning services to seven councils.
A spokesman said the councils - Christchurch, East Dorset, North Dorset, Weymouth and Portland, Purbeck, West Dorset and Dorset County Council - would be legally-bound to take a share of any increased cost.
The projected overspend for 2014/15 already takes into account "savings options yet to be secured".
Future measures being considered include the closure of one or more of the 11 recycling centres - each saving up to £100,000 a year, charging to enter the recycling centres to save £65,000 a year for each site and closing the centres for two or three weekdays to save up to £300,000 annually.
Other options include charging to dispose of DIY waste and tyres to save about £250,000 a year and charging residents to use recycling sites in neighbouring areas to save £70,000 a year.
A spokesman for the partnership said: "Waste management is becoming increasingly challenging for local authorities, with rising disposal costs and falling income from recycling.
"Total household waste has grown due to the economic recovery while market prices for recycling have fallen to zero and are set to become a cost.
"The Dorset Waste Partnership has used hire vehicle use and agency staffing in a planned, flexible approach to deliver the new collection service."
Residents have until 13 February to give their feedback.
