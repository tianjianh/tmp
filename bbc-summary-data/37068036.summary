A few eyebrows were raised, but Wiggins is not the first athlete whose podium exploits have made headlines. Here are some other common reactions...
American gymnast Gabby Douglas had just won gold in the team event, but as her four team-mates stood to attention, their hands on their hearts to greet the Star Spangled Banner, the 20-year-old had her hands by her side, looking dejected. She was accused of being unpatriotic, others thought she was protesting, but she later explained she was overwhelmed by the occasion.
Swimmer Michael Phelps had just won his 20th Olympic gold medal with victory in the 200m butterfly when he burst into hysterics during the American national anthem.
Apparently his friends, watching from the seats, had brought a Baltimore Orioles baseball tradition to Rio, chanting "Oooooooh" for the line "Oh say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave."
Sir Chris Hoy was a blubbering mess after winning gold in the keirin at London 2012. It was a record sixth Olympic gold for the track cyclist, and his last act as an Olympian.
British decathlete Daley Thompson had won gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games when he began whistling to 'God Save The Queen' after receiving his medal.
South Korean gold medallist Jin Jong-oh shook hands with bronze medallist and North Korean Kim Song-guk following the 50m pistol event. Despite the political differences of the neighbouring countries, the gesture showed the true Olympic spirit in action.
Fiji won their first Olympic medal in the rugby sevens by beating Great Britain in the final.
As they stood on the podium and received their medals from Princess Anne, one player dropped to his knees in a sign of respect and was praised by people on social media.
Mo Farah and his 'Mobot' was one of the defining images of London 2012, and he made sure he did his signature gesture during the medal ceremony for the 5,000m.
Swede Ara Abrahamian placed his bronze medal at the centre of the competition mat in protest of the result in the men's Greco-Roman -84kg wrestling during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
