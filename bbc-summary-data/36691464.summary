In a tight, tactical race, Centrowitz broke clear with 250m remaining to take victory in three minutes 50 seconds.
Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi won silver in 3:50.11 and New Zealand's Nicholas Willis bronze in 3:50.24.
Kenya's Asbel Kiprop, the world champion, faded badly in the home straight to finish sixth, with Grice clocking 3:51.73.
Centrowitz, 26, whose father Matt competed at two Olympics, is the first American winner of the event since the London Games in 1908.
The first two laps were run at a relatively pedestrian 66 and 69.7 seconds respectively, but Kenya's Ronald Kwemoi tripped on the second to fall to the back of the pack.
Kiprop, the 2008 Olympic champion, made his move with about 400m left, but Centrowitz clocked a final lap of 50.62 to hold on for gold.

Grice gave himself a chance, passing the bell in seventh, but didn't quite have the speed to contend for a medal in his first Olympic final.
"I'm very happy to be here but was hoping to perform a bit better than that," he said.
"It was very pushy and 'shovey' as always and I think I kind of panicked a bit and was surging, but my legs just didn't have it. I think they're pretty tired from the qualification rounds."
