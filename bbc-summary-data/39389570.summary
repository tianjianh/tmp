The hosts' captain Joss Labadie and visitors' Josh Yorwerth were red carded after they clashed in the 51st minute.
Demetriou scored from long range after 18 minutes as County ended a three-match winless run to leave them five points from safety.
Crawley dropped a place to 18th in the table as Newport held on.
Newport manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought there was a superb attacking performance in the first half and we should have been out of sight.
"The second half showed the other side of what the boys have got. They defended unbelievably, but I would have much rather them have finished their chances.
"I haven't seen the red cards incident. I haven't seen it back yet and until I have, I haven't got anything to say on it."
