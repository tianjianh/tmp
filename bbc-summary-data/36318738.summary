The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Charlie Flanagan, has met politicians and community representatives during a visit to Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was Mr Flanagan's first visit to Northern Ireland since the formation of a Fine Gael minority government.
Earlier, he met Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr McGuinness said he had had a "very wide-ranging discussion" with Mr Flanagan.
The Irish foreign minister also met the new Stormont speaker, Robin Newton.
Mr Flanagan did not meet First Minister Arlene Foster as she was not in Belfast at the time of his visit.
The Irish foreign minister also met the victims' commissioner, Judith Thompson, to discuss the outstanding difficulties concerning the legacy of the Troubles.
During his visit, Mr Flanagan raised the Irish government's concerns about the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.
Mr Flanagan met representatives of the Ardoyne community in north Belfast, including the widow of Michael McGibbon, who was murdered in north Belfast in April.
He also met Irish Football Association (IFA) officials ahead of what he called the "hugely positive participation" by both the Ireland and Northern Ireland teams in next month's Euro 2016 championships.
