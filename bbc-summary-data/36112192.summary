A Batman mural has been painted on the side of a nursery in a village that shares its name with the comic book hero's home city.

The artwork, by graffiti artist Buber Nebz, shows the superhero and his Batmobile behind the Old Cooperative Day Nursery in Gotham, Nottinghamshire.
Manager Charlotte Harris said the children's parents have been taking selfies next to the caped crusader.
The village has a historical connection to the fictional Gotham City.
Mrs Harris said she contacted Buber Nebz - real name Dan Smith - after seeing his "fantastic" street art around the East Midlands.
The mural was completed last week, after the graffiti artist spent about 30 hours hard at work.
Mrs Harris, who also runs an after-school club called the Bat Cave, said: "I knew we'd got a Superheroes Week coming up so I contacted him to see if he'd come and do some artwork for us.
"The children and parents have been absolutely wowed by it."
Buber Nez, 27, from Loughborough, Leicestershire, said he "really enjoyed" completing the mural, but said similar artwork is "still in the making" of being socially accepted.
