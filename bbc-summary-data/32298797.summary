Groceries and toiletries were among the items taken from ReadiFood warehouse, run by Faith Christian Group, on Boulton Road in Reading, Berkshire.
A generator, which the charity used to power its street kitchen, was also stolen.
Thames Valley Police said it was investigating the burglary and has appealed for witnesses.
Malcolm Peirce, director of Faith Christian Group, said the charity would have to find the cash to replace the generator.
With regard to food and other items stolen, he added: "I suspect people's generosity will rise to this and we'll find ourselves overwhelmed with jars of coffee before too long and hopefully shampoo and body wash.
"It sets you back, it's upsetting."
A police spokeswoman said it is thought the burglars got into the building by forcing their way in through a window, between 20:00 BST on Sunday and 08:00 on Monday.
