The Kyrgyz National Security Committee (GKNB) named the prime suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a 22-year-old with Russian citizenship, born in the Kyrgyz city of Osh in 1995.
He is thought to be among the dead. The hunt is on for possible accomplices.
Russian officials suspect that he had links to so-called Islamic State (IS).
So far few details have emerged about Jalilov. There are unconfirmed reports that he was an ethnic Uzbek.
Russia's State Investigative Committee said "an explosive device could have been detonated by a man whose body parts were found in the third carriage of the train."
"The man has been identified but his identity will not be disclosed for now in the interests of the investigation," the statement added.
The bomb blew up in a train carriage which had just left Sennaya Ploshchad station. The driver managed to continue to Tekhnologichesky Institut station.
Later a similar device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya.
The Russian news website Gazeta.ru reports that the bombs were concealed in car fire extinguishers, with ball bearings taped to the outside. The one which exploded is said to have been carried in a rucksack.
Reports say Jalilov had been living in St Petersburg for six years and had used several passports.
He had worked as a chef in a St Petersburg sushi restaurant, Gazeta reported.
Kyrgyz investigators are working with Russian authorities on the case.
Reuters news agency spoke to people in Osh who said Jalilov was from an ethnic Uzbek family. They said they knew his parents but had not seen him for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop.
IS has recruited many Islamist militants from Central Asian republics and from Chechnya in the North Caucasus.
Russian aircraft and cruise missiles have targeted IS and other rebel groups in Syria - a vital intervention for embattled Syrian government forces.
Osh - Kyrgyzstan's second-largest city - was the scene of inter-ethnic clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in June 2010, in which hundreds of people died.
Home to a large ethnic Uzbek community, the city was the power base of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was overthrown in April 2010.
