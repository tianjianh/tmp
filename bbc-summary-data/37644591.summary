A virtual reality view of how flood protection plans could transform the Whitesands area of Dumfries is to be offered to the public.

Using the latest technology, it promises to "transport viewers into the heart" of the regenerated area.
A 3D model of the scheme will also provide views of the project which have never been seen before.
Dumfries provost Ted Thompson said the technology could "really bring the designs to life".
Flood protection in the area has been a controversial issue for many years.
Thousands of people signed a petition against plans for an embankment in the area, prompting a review of the multi-million pound project.
The local authority now believes it has found a compromise that addresses long-standing flood problems while preserving views of the River Nith and maintaining car parking space numbers.
The latest plans claim to see the height of the defences reduced while still maintaining the same levels of protection.
"This is an exciting time for the project as we are able to show the public our plans for the Whitesands in ways that have not been seen previously," said Mr Thompson.
"We are pioneering the use of technology because it's important that people see for themselves what the Whitesands will look like."
He said it would be transformed into somewhere people would want to spend time, businesses would want to invest and locals could be proud of.
"The exhibition gives the public a chance to find details on the project for themselves and debunk any myths about the scheme," he said.
"I hope people will come along and speak to those working on the project design first hand and see for themselves what the regenerated Whitesands is going to look like."
An exhibition of the plans will be held at St George's Hall in the town from Thursday 3 November to Saturday 5 November.
