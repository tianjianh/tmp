Dundee Stars head coach Marc LeFebvre was pleased to pick up three points out of four over the weekend and wants to build further momentum.

Stars went down in overtime to Edinburgh Capitals on Saturday before thrashing the Caps on Sunday as they came out of a five-game winless run.
And LeFebvre couldn't have been happier at how his team bounced back with such a comprehensive victory in the second of the double-header.
"The whole team have worked so hard in these last two weeks and we've been three imports down," he said. "We've put in a good effort and I'm delighted for the guys in the end.
"We ran out of steam on Saturday and Edinburgh are a team that can surprise.
"But It's important for us to keep the momentum going.  It's a good feeling to get three points from the weekend and we'll start to get some bodies back."
On Saturday, Brett Switzer and Justin Faryna fired the Stars two up with Jared Staal scoring in reply for the Caps before Vinny Scarsella added Dundee's third.
However, like last week against Fife Flyers, Edinburgh stormed back as Karel Hromas and Taylor MacDougall levelled, taking the game to overtime, where Yevgeni Fyodorov struck for the 4-3 win.
On Sunday in Dundee there was quite a turnaround as five goals from Kevin Bruijsten helped the Stars to a thumping 10-3 win over Michal Dobron's side.
Kevin Hart, Cam McGiffin and Bruijsten had Dundee three up in the first five minutes before Jacob Johnston pulled one back for Edinburgh.
Justin Faryna and another from Bruijsten put the Stars 5-1 by the end of the first period, with the Caps mounting a comeback through Jared Staal and Karel Hromas in the middle session.
But Dundee found their mojo again in the third as one from Lidhammar, Bruijsten, one from Ben Edmonds and a further two from the Dutchman completed the rout.
Fife Flyers ended another weekend without a point, starting on Saturday at Manchester Storm, going down 4-3 after penalty shots.
Taylor Dickin and Paul Phillips were on target for Storm before Brendan Brooks and two from Chase Schaber had Fife in front with three minutes to go.
But Mario Valery-Trabucco tied the game in the final minute and after overtime couldn't produce a winner, Mark Heatley and Darian Dzuirzynski came up trumps in the shootout for Manchester.
Fife welcomed Braehead Clan to Kirkcaldy on Sunday and lost for the fourth consecutive game against their Glasgow rivals, going down 4-1.
Mike Hammond opened the scoring before the Flyers levelled the game through Carlo Finucci during the second period.
Jay Rosehill restored Braehead's lead at the end of the second before Zach Sullivan struck with a rare goal to open a two-goal advantage when he was assisted by Alex Leavitt.
Leavitt then turned scorer from provider to add a fourth that sealed the game and as Ryan Finnerty's men headed into a busy Christmas schedule with an important victory.
Clan started their weekend with a 7-4 loss to Coventry Blaze, whose upturn in form saw them pick up their fourth win in their last five.
TJ Syner and Robin Bergman put the Blaze in front, but Clan hit back through Matt Beca on the powerplay before Josh Godfrey restored Coventry's two-goal lead.
Scott Pitt got Braehead back to one then Liam Stewart struck with a shorthanded goal.  Although Kyle Wharton got another on the board for the home team, Blaze kicked on in the third.
Another one shorthanded from Stewart and Syner's second sealed the points. Corey Cowick pulled one back, but Barry Almeida rounded off a good night's work for the visitors.
