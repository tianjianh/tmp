Make-up advice from politicians as Russian says use Beetroot lipstick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Russian politician has suggested women who can't afford imported beauty products use beetroot instead of lipstick.

Igor Chernishev offered the advice on a Russian website. He's not the first politician to have opinions about lipstick. Winston Churchill is said to have ensured it was still available during World War Two because it was good for morale.
So what other beauty tips can we gather from those helpful people in power, past and present?
Margaret Thatcher was often said to have mastered the art of power dressing.
In a TV interview in 1984 she said: "I really only dress in two kinds of ways. One, the kind of way I am now, in a classic suit, and many, many varied different blouses - terribly important to have a wardrobe full of attractive blouses."
Got that? It's terribly important to have an attractive blouse.
When former PM Gordon Brown lost his make-up instructions in the back of a cab, we all rushed to find out how to get the look (maybe).
In case you weren't paying attention back in 2006, this is how:
"1. Transparent Brush. Foam all over.
2. Small pot under eyes, dimple, creases, blend in.
3. Clinique. Super balanced make-up. All over again, like painting a wall, and ears. Shut eyes over lids then with make-up pad smooth over liquid."
Don't forget the dimple!
The former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi had a hair transplant in 2004.
He said: "I am very happy to have subjected myself to such pain. I think this should be regarded as an example."
He also had cosmetic surgery around his eyes. You'd never know.
Ed Miliband's staying natural.
When asked if he was going grey by Now magazine he said he "definitely" wasn't tempted to dye it.
He said he didn't whiten his teeth or have any sort of beauty regime.
But not to worry, he did add: "It's important not to look scruffy".
It's difficult to know how much to tip after a haircut.
In January Prime Minister David Cameron's hairdresser was awarded an MBE.
Lino Carbosiero styles lots of celebs as well as the PM, and does charity work. He was handed the honour for his "services to hairdressing".
He's the man credited with shifting Cameron's parting from right to left, although he has denied doing it deliberately.
Meeting a beauty studio director last year, Boris Johnson asked what the latest thing was in beauty.
"Contouring," she said.
"Do you use green?" he asked.
"No, unless you're contouring the hulk," she said.
"But when you think about the complimentary colours - Matisse and people like that they used green on people's faces," Boris argued.
"Um right, I think that's special effects," she said doubtfully, "but I'll try it."
"It might work," replied Boris, "All those modern paintings - the flesh tones they use are green."
"Err, yes actually you are right, because of the undertone shades! Well done Boris, I might call you up for tips." she said.
Still following? So maybe politicians' beauty tips are not entirely useless.
Pass the beetroot.
