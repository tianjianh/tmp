Police officers and Scottish Ambulance Service personnel were called at about 08:20 after the boys were found in what is thought to be a fish pond.
The boys were taken to Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital where they were pronounced dead.
A police investigation is under way and Police Scotland has said officers are supporting the family.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "We received a call around 08:20 on Saturday following a report of concern for two children.
