Two County Armagh farmers have been fighting to keep the rising waters of Lough Neagh from swamping their farm.

Water levels at the lough are at a 30-year-high after recent heavy rain, which caused damage to numerous businesses on its shores.
Brothers Steven and Glen Allen farm beef cattle on a 50 acre farm near Portadown. Thirty of those acres are now under water.
The pair said long-term action needs to be taken to address the problem.
They have hired pumps and are using sandbags to keep the water from the lough out of their cattle sheds.
They claimed a build up of silt, where the River Bann flows into Lough Neagh, is causing the river to back up and flood.
Elsewhere in County Armagh, the Rivers Agency is working to protect a Grade 2 listed thatched cottage outside Portadown.
Water started coming into Dan and Kate McQuillan's home around New Year's Eve.  The couple said they will need help to save it.
Mr McQuillan said the house is suffering from multiple problems associated with the flood water.
"The electric keeps tripping, the septic tank's two feet under water, we can't use the toilet or the shower, wash dishes or clothes," he said.
"Kate keeps watch during the night to make sure the pump doesn't go off, because the minute it goes off, the place fills up with water.
"I make sure everything's okay during the day - checking the drainage and the wee trenches the boys have dug are clear."
He said he now fears the listed building could collapse.
A short distance away, a man, whose son returned from Australia at Christmas to marry and move in to a newly renovated cottage, says their home has been destroyed.
Adrian McKernan spent several years renovating the cottage, which has been badly affected by the flooding from Lough Neagh.
The Rivers Agency is pumping water away from the house and have built a sandbag barrier in an attempt to protect it.
Mr McKernan said the young couple's "dreams have been ruined".
An "urgent" ministerial meeting has been held to discuss the response to flooding across Northern Ireland.
The agriculture, regional development and environment ministers attended.
It comes after a range of flood-hit businesses on the shores of Lough Neagh questioned if enough was done to prevent rising waters brought on by winter storms.
The agriculture minister said the meeting would be a chance to "hold [government] agencies to account" over their actions in dealing with floods.
