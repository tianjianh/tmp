[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-0 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Bodin hit a second-half double as Bristol Rovers kept alive their slim League One play-off hopes with victory over 10-man Shrewsbury at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder fired the hosts in front from the penalty spot in the 54th minute after being fouled inside the box by Aristote Nsiala when there appeared no danger.
And Bodin made sure of the points seven minutes from time, showing neat skills to set himself up for a crisp right-footed finish from 10 yards.
The first half was most notable for the two yellow cards picked up by Shrewsbury midfielder Ryan Yates, sent off for a sliding late challenge on Rovers goalkeeper Joe Lumley in the 41th minute, having previously been booked for a foul on Bodin.
Rovers started brightly and Shrews keeper Jayson Leutwiler had to make early saves from Tom Lockyer and Chris Lines.
At the other end, Pirates defender Ryan Sweeney had to clear a shot from Gary Deegan off the line after Tyler Roberts had rounded Lumley to set up the chance.
