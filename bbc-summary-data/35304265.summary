[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old has been capped 44 times by his country, but was not included in head coach Eddie Jones' first England squad.
Wilson has made 87 Premiership appearances for Bath since joining from Newcastle in 2009.
"Bath is a great place to be right now and I have a strong bond with the club," Wilson told the club website.
"There is a fantastic drive amongst the squad and coaches to succeed and it's exciting to be part of that."
Bath have not disclosed the length of Wilson's new deal.
First-team coach Neal Hatley added: "David is an important member of the squad for us, not just for his scrummaging ability, but also the impact he makes around the field and also his experience in the tight."
