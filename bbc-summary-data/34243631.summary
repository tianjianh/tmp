Tiverton High School pupil Olly Croker was airlifted to a Bristol hospital after the incident on Saturday but died on Monday night.
A Bradninch club spokesman described it as a "freak accident".
Olly's mother Pippa called him "our gorgeous boy" and said his organs had now "given life" to five children.
The schoolboy was watching his brother in the fixture between Bradninch and Bampton when it is believed there was a collision and fencing gave way.
A piece of material then lodged in the youngster's head but the club spokesman said it was "unclear how the accident occurred".
Mrs Croker wrote on Facebook: "We would very much like you all to feel so proud of Oliver this evening, through organ donation he has given life to to 5 other children.
"He will live on in them. What very lucky boys and girls they are!!! Love you our beautiful gorgeous boy!!"
Olly was a regular supporter at Bampton games, said the club.
The spokesman said everyone was "absolutely shocked and devastated".
The club tweeted: "Everyone at Bradninch Town FC would like to give our sincere condolences to the family of little Oliver who has tragically passed away.
"No-one deserves to be taken so young and he will be dearly missed. Gone but never forgotten. Rest in peace."
Head teacher Andrew Lovett expressed his "great sadness" at the youngster's death.
He was "the life and soul of the party, a larger-than-life character, brimming with confidence, with an eagerness and enthusiasm for taking part in all aspects of school life".
Mr Lovett added: "His youthful vibrancy and curiosity about life shaped his whole character.
"He was a very knowledgeable and sparky lad with his finger on the pulse of what was going on at school, in the local community and beyond.
"He was multi-talented and we had high hopes for his future. Olly was a keen sportsman and represented THS at rugby and even played up an age group.
"Our thoughts and wishes are with Olly's parents and brothers."
The school has a team of support staff and counsellors on hand to help students at this "difficult time".
Roger Spray, chairman of the Devon and Exeter Football League, called the youngster's death an "absolute tragedy" and the league had sent its condolences to the family and Bampton Football Club.
Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the death on Monday night.
"Our sympathy and thoughts are with the family," said the force.
A local authority inquiry is under way to discover the exact circumstances of the accident.
Kirsty Bond wrote on Facebook: "He always had a smile on his face, always polite, and a pleasure to know."
