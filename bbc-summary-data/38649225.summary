Plymouth Argyle manager Derek Adams says he will not change his side's defensive tactics when they face Liverpool in their FA Cup third-round replay at Home Park on Wednesday.

Argyle defended deep, had only 23% possession and one shot on target in their 0-0 draw at Anfield on 8 January.
"We have to defend very well again," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"I think that we've shown in the first game that we can do that, and we'll have to do exactly the same."
The Scot, whose team are second in League Two, continued: "I can't see that we're going to be too cavalier on our approach. We've got to show respect to the Premier League team.
"They're third in the top flight and we've got to be careful of that."
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp picked the club's youngest-ever side for the first game, with an average age of 21 years and 296 days, and later said his selection was "not a mistake".
Adams added: "The Liverpool line-up could change, although I don't see it changing a lot from the team that played against us.
"I think they might put in a bit more experience in the team, but I can't see it shifting too much.
"The only difference for them will be that the changing rooms are not as luxurious as Anfield. But the playing surface is excellent, it's a nice stadium, so I don't see it being a problem.
"It'll be milder than they're used to in Liverpool, so from that point of view they might think it's the Mediterranean they're going to," joked Adams, who also said he had a 'Plan B' if Liverpool took the lead.
"We're going to sign (Manchester United's Marouane) Fellaini and hit it long," said the Argyle boss.
