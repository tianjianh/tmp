Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch has finally opened up to the media in the build-up to Sunday's Super Bowl.

Lynch had refused to answer questions at two news conferences.
But on Thursday, the running back, 28, relented: "Y'all shove cameras and microphones down my throat. But y'all mad at me. And if y'all ain't mad at me, then what y'all here for?"
On Tuesday, he repeated the same line 29 times. On Wednesday, he offered 11 variations of: "You know why I'm here."
In his most revealing Super Bowl news conference yet, the microphone-shy Seahawks man revealed his struggles with opening up to the media.
"All week I done told y'all what's up and for some reason y'all continue to come back and do the same thing," Lynch said. "I don't know what story y'all trying to get out of me.
"I don't know what image y'all trying to portray of me, but it don't matter what y'all think, what y'all say about me because when I go home at night, the same people that I look in the face - my family, that I love - that's all that really matters to me.
"So y'all could go and make up whatever you want to make up because I don't say enough for y'all to go and put anything out on me.
"I'll come to y'all event. Y'all shove cameras and microphones down my throat. But y'all mad at me. And if y'all ain't mad at me, then what y'all here for?
"I'm here preparing for the game and y'all want to ask me all these questions, which is understandable. But I told y'all I'm not about to say nothing."
The five-time Pro Bowler then told the assembled media that, for the final three minutes of his commitment, he would be "looking at them just as they'd been looking at him".
He also began name-checking various locations across the country.
Lynch's final five-minute encounter with reporters was once again ended by an alarm sounding on the player's mobile phone.
Before walking off, Lynch's parting shot to reporters was: "Thank you."
The former Buffalo Bills player has previously been fined for violating the NFL's media policy.
