Vytautas Jokubauskas, 57, of Mayor's Walk in Peterborough has been charged with murdering Ramute Butkiene.
The body of Ms Butkiene, 42, who was formally indentified earlier, was found with no arms, legs or head at a house in Mayor's Walk last Friday.
Mr Jokubauskas will appear at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
Mother-of-one Ms Butkiene was an agency worker in the city, Cambridgeshire Police said.
Officers said "some body parts" had been found and searches were continuing.
The torso was found after other tenants in the shared house reported a "pungent smell" and called police.
A post-mortem examination failed to establish how Ms Butkiene died.
Ms Butkiene's family members in Peterborough and Lithuania have been informed, a police spokesman said.
The murder is being treated as an isolated incident and a dedicated team has been set up to investigate.
