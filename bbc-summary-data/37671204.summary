Aside from spacewalks and science experiments, one of Tim's missions is to inspire children to get into science, perhaps even to become an astronaut like him one day.
With the support of the European Space Agency, Tim's now on a UK tour to share all his space adventure stories with the public.
And not only that, he stopped by Newsround towers to answer some of the questions you sent in to us too!
