The 70-year-old victim was attacked at a shop in Carr Road, Walthamstow, at about 21:10 BST on Sunday. He tried to defend himself with a shop sign.
He was stabbed several times and is in a serious but stable condition, Met Police said.
The trio were arrested on Tuesday and remain in custody.
Two customers and the shopkeeper's wife were also in the store when the masked attackers targeted the shop.
CCTV images released by police show a customer using a stool to fend off the attackers and the shopkeeper being stabbed as he tried to defend himself with a shop sign.
Det Sgt Ben Voss said: "The assailants used an extreme level of violence against an elderly man who was trying to defend himself, his wife, customers and business.
"The attack could have resulted in tragic consequences, but luckily the victim is now recovering in hospital."
