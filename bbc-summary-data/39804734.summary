Then we thought; why don't we ask YOU to send in a video of you doing your favourite spinner trick?
So get a friend or grown-up to grab a quick video and Send it here.
You must ask your parent, teacher or guardian for permission before you send us a picture or video.
We may show your picture or video on our website or in our TV bulletins. We'll show your first name and which town you're from - but we won't use your details for anything else.
