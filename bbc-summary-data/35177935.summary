[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police looking for a man who went missing after a night out have completed intensive searches of the routes he could have taken while heading home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Miers, 21, was last seen on a footpath near the River Tawe in Swansea at about 22:30 GMT on Saturday.
Police divers, dogs and a helicopter have searched the area from Park Tawe retail park to his home in Bonymaen.
Family and friends have also conducted their own searches.
While intensive searches have now been completed, it is understood general surveillance of the area and monitoring of the river bank will continue.
Police said one witness who had come forward followed Mr Miers for a time near the retail park on Saturday night because he appeared "intoxicated" and they were concerned for his safety.
Anyone who saw the children's football coach that night is asked to contact police on 101.
