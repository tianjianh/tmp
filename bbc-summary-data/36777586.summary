[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager has pleaded guilty to a cyber attack on Mumsnet which caused the parenting site to reset the passwords of 7.7 million members.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Buchanan, 18, of Haslemere, Surrey, admitted two counts of hacking and one of impairing the operation of or hindering access to a computer.
The charges refer to "computer intrusion and damage to network profiles" in July and August 2015.
Mr Buchanan will be sentenced on 2 August at Guildford Magistrates' Court.
The Mumsnet homepage was redirected to a now suspended Twitter profile page and had some posts edited during a cyber attack in August.
It was also subjected to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where an attempt is made to force a site offline by swamping it with internet traffic.
Mumsnet users were made to reset their passwords as a "precautionary measure" following the attacks.
