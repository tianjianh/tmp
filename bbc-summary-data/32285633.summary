Awford, 42, took over from Richie Barker at the end of last season and helped steer the club to safety.
However, after a mixed season in which Pompey find themselves 14th in League Two, Awford has left by mutual consent.
Assistant manager Gary Waddock has been placed in temporary charge until the end of the season with four games left of the current campaign.
In a statement Pompey said: "The club would like to place on record their sincere thanks for Andy's efforts - his service to Pompey is immeasurable.
"One of his most significant contributions was when he took charge of the team in March 2014 and steered the club to safety from the threat of relegation out of the Football League."
Ex-academy boss Awford replaced Barker on 27 March and won five out of six games, with the other drawn, to steer Pompey to League Two safety.
He had previously taken charge as caretaker when Guy Whittingham was sacked in November 2013.
Awford, a former defender at Pompey, was also once the youngest ever player in the FA Cup, at just 15 years and 88 days old, while at Worcester City.
He made over 300 appearances for Portsmouth and has held several roles at Fratton Park, including chief scout and reserve-team manager.
The club have, however, left the door open for a potential return to the club for Awford, whose last game in charge was Saturday's 3-1 defeat by Morecambe.
"All parties have agreed that, after a natural break, further conversations will take place about the potential of Andy playing a further role within the football club," added the statement.
