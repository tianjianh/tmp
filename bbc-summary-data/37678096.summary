The 27-year-old South Sydney Rabbitohs forward was appointed ahead of James Graham, with Wigan's Sean O'Loughlin ruled out through injury.
Burgess spent a year at rugby union side Bath before returning to league.
England play New Zealand in their opening Four Nations game on 29 October.
"It's an absolute honour and privilege to be asked to captain my country and lead this group," said Burgess. "My mum got a bit emotional.
"Although I am captain on the field for this tournament, there are a group of leaders in this squad and I know that we will work together and as hard as possible to try to achieve success on the pitch for England."
Burgess has won 14 caps for England but last played in the 2013 World Cup semi-final defeat by New Zealand.
He switched codes to play in the 2015 rugby union World Cup, when England were eliminated at the group stages.
Burgess, whose twin brothers George and Tom also feature in England's 24-man squad, has stood in as Rabbitohs captain this season during Greg Inglis' absence.

England have never won the Four Nations, which this year includes Australia, New Zealand and Scotland.
The side is coached by Australian Wayne Bennett, who replaced Steve McNamara as head coach in February.
They play a one-off match against France in Avignon on 22 October, for which Burgess is suspended and in which Graham will be captain, before the Four Nations starts on 28 October.
After facing New Zealand in Huddersfield, England meet Scotland in Coventry on 5 November and Australia at the Olympic Stadium in London on 13 November.
