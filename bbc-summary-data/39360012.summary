After reaching the semi-finals at their first major international tournament for 58 years, Wales have won once in four World Cup qualifying games since.
Chris Coleman's side are third in Group D and face leaders the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Friday.
"There is a long way to go, but of course, the next two games are vitally important," Davies said.
He continued: "There has been no hangover from the Euros. It was always going to be hard to match our efforts from the summer, but as a group we are determined to give it every effort and to push as far as we can.
"It is difficult to say what exactly has been going on in this group, we've put our best foot forward in every game and hopefully our luck will be in going forward and we can pick up a few wins."
After beating Moldova 4-0 in their first qualifier in September of 2016, Wales have gone on to draw against Austria, Georgia and Serbia.
"We are not surprised Ireland are top, they are a good team and it is a good group, any one of us could have been leading at this stage," Davies added.
"We will do what we usually do. We've been in games of massive magnitude, we've been there before."
