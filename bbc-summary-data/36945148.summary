Two men have been arrested as part of an inquiry into alleged abuse at a former detention centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 250 men have come forward to complain about physical and sexual abuse at HMP Kirklevington near Yarm.
They claim the abuse took place between the 1960s and 1990s when the prison was a mixed remand centre.
Cleveland Police said a 61-year-old man has now been bailed pending further inquiries, and another aged 70 released without any charges being brought.
The force said it was continuing to investigate.
One of the complainants, Andrew Drabarek, told BBC Tees: "The minute you walked through the gate to the minute you left it was just abuse.
"I got punched, I went blind for three days. I was punched at the dining room table because I was the last one to leave.
"You accept punishment but not like that, being beaten by a grown man when you are a teenager is something else."
The Ministry of Justice has urged anyone with allegations to report them to police.
Kirklevington was converted to a resettlement prison for adult male offenders in 1992.
