Police said they attended Meadowhead Community Infant School and Nursery in Shorrock Lane, Blackburn, at about 15:00 GMT on 17 March.
Five Blackburn women, aged between 18 and 46, were held on suspicion of affray before being bailed.
Headteacher Sue Mellor said the school, which has 270 pupils aged between three and seven, was helping police.
"We would like to reassure parents and the public that the safety of our pupils, parents and staff is of the utmost importance to us," she added.
