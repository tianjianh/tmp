Are these the best Halloween costumes?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Halloween - a celebration of the ghoulish and the ghostly on the eve of the Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. Also a time when celebrities appear in flashy outfits.

We have rounded up some the most prominent examples of famous people - and other humans - in costume so that you don't have to.
Top of list is hip-hop power couple Beyonce and Jay Z, appearing as human-sized dolls from a "Black Barbie" collection, complete with giant toy boxes.
They're creepy and they're kooky... it's American baseball player Gio Gonzalez and family dressed up as the comically macabre Addams Family.
Model Heid Klum dressed up as Heidi Klum and Heidi Klum and Heidi... yes, she appeared to have cloned herself for All Hallows' Eve.
She "literally has human accessories", one person pointed out on Instagram. I bet you don't have human accessories.
Canadian-American actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson gave his baby daughter Jasmine a nice surprise by dressing up as a Pikachu - a yellow species of Pokemon.
"What Pikachu didn't know was that Jazzy would start crying when he stopped dancing and demanded he continue to shake his tail with a loud 'EH!'" the Rock said on Instagram.
Here's another great Halloween picture featuring a child - American football player AJ Green posted this photo of his son as a little skeleton.
Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen appeared as Luigi from the classic Nintendo game because her son wanted to be Mario and "no-one wants to be Luigi".
But wait, it is not just celebrities getting into the action.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went trick-or-treating with his two-year-old son, dressed as the pilot and the Little Prince from the classic French novella The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince).
And then there was lightsaber-wielding Ken Bone - swiftly dubbed ObiWan Kenboni - who became an internet star after asking a question in the second US presidential debate while wearing a chunky red jumper and simply being his "cuddly" self.
And now for some photos from you, our lovely audience. Here is a dramatic silhouette of Lucy Hart's daughters on Salisbury Plain.
Craig Russell in Glasgow was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic The Birds. "I made the two-piece myself from an old duvet cover," he told us.
Kaila Ziarnowski in Suffolk dressed up her son as something truly ghastly - a hipster.
Here is Daniel and Camilla Nerdal in Bergen, Norway appearing as a monster monk and DC Comics character Harley Quinn.
Think your outfit was better than these? We would love to see and feature some of your photos:
