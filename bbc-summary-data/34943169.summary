The Volkswagen was stopped by officers in the early hours of Friday morning after it was spotted on a wet and unlit stretch of the M56 near Manchester Airport.
The children were aged 20 months and six months, Altrincham Today reported.
The driver is accused of speeding, driving without due care and attention and driving without insurance.
PC Rob Hughes, of Greater Manchester Police's road policing unit, said: "I was appalled that anyone would drive at these speeds on an unlit section of motorway on a wet road surface.
"I have never seen such a blatant disregard for the safety of the children."
