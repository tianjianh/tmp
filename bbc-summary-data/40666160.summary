The force said the latest arrests were made this week in Huddersfield and Bradford during a three-day police operation.
Ch Insp Ian Mottershaw, who is leading the investigation, said: "This ongoing investigation forms part of West Yorkshire Police's commitment to the investigation of both current and non-recent sexual offences against children."
"These are abhorrent crimes that affect the most vulnerable in our society," he said.
The force is urging anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to contact them.
