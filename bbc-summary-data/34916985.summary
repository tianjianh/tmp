Enzo Maccarinelli claims he will not be in awe of Roy Jones Jr when they meet in a non-title cruiserweight fight in Moscow next month.

Maccarinelli, 35, a former WBO champion and Jones, a four-weight former world champion, will fight over 12 rounds.
The Welshman regards Jones as one of the true greats of the ring, but at 46 believe he is not what he once was.
"He's not as fast as he was, he's not as good as he was but he's still got a lot left," Maccarinelli said.
"If he was still at the peak of his career I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you thinking I could win."
Jones has won eight fights in a row, with his last defeat coming against Russian Denis Lebedev in 2011,
"He was an amazing fighter and at one point he could probably have gone down as THE greatest of all time," Maccarinelli said.
"But I won't be in awe of him. They call him superman and superstar, but to me he's just plain old Roy."
The bout, which takes place at the at the VTB Ice Palace on 12 December, was originally billed as a WBA cruiserweight title fight.
But the governing body's vice president Gilberto Mendoza said no title would be at stake.
And neither fighter was included in the WBA's latest cruiserweight rankings released earlier this month.
Maccarinelli says he is not disappointed there is no title at stake.
"When I accepted the fight I didn't know it was for anything anyway," he said.
"But it didn't really bother me in the slightest. People know the sort of person I am I don't think I would have classed myself as a world champion anyway if there was anything on the line."
In 2003, American Jones became the first former middleweight to win a heavyweight world title for 106 years.
But he has not held a world title since 2004, when he lost his light-heavyweight title to compatriot Antonio Tarver.
Maccarinelli, meanwhile, has not been a world champion since losing his WBO cruiserweight title to David Haye in 2008.  He has competed at light-heavyweight in recent years.
Jones officially became a Russian citizen after he was presented with his Russian passport in Moscow in October, 2015.
Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree to grant citizenship to Jones in September after meeting the boxer in Crimea in August.
Former super middleweight world champion Carl Froch has said both fighters are risking their health and Jones Jr in particular is putting his legacy on the line.
"He should not be fighting - he should be sitting at home with his feet up watching fighting," Froch said.
"By fighting on and on you are risking your legacy and your career. But more so than that, you are risking your health.
"I don't like to see it, it's a shame."
