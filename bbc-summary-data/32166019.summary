Living near Waitrose boosts your house value, claims research

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Having a Waitrose near where you live - as every middle-class person knows - increases the value of your home, claims Lloyds Bank.

Properties within "easy reach" of a Waitrose cost 12% more than other homes in the same area, says the bank.
Homes close to a Sainsbury's carry a 10% price premium - and those near Tesco carry an 8% premium.
However, having a Lidl or Aldi nearby can actually reduce the value of your house or flat, it is claimed.
But having any sort of supermarket nearby can add an average of Â£15,000 to a property, concludes the research.
"Having a grocery shop within easy reach appears to be high on the list for homebuyers looking for good access to local amenities," said Andy Hulme, Lloyds Bank mortgages director.
