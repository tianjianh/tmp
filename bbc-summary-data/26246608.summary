Ian Brady: Moors Murderer 'still wants to die'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moors Murderer Ian Brady has said he still wants to die after losing his bid to be transferred from a psychiatric hospital to prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His move to a Scottish jail from Merseyside's Ashworth Hospital was refused by a tribunal in June.
In a statement issued through his solicitors, Brady, 76, said "recent events" had not changed his intentions.
Brady, who tortured and murdered five children along with Myra Hindley, also denied reports that he had dementia.
He went on to stress that he no longer had any dealings with a woman who says she has acted as his mental health advocate.
Jackie Powell was with Brady during the mental health tribunal which ruled he should remain at the maximum-security hospital where he is force-fed.
Brady argued he was not insane and wanted a return to prison and to be allowed to die.
Brady said Ms Powell had not visited him at Ashworth since last summer and would not be permitted to see him again.
In February 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service said Ms Powell would not be charged over claims she failed to tell police about a letter which may have revealed where one of Brady's victims, Keith Bennett, was buried.
Ms Powell had been arrested on suspicion of preventing his lawful burial after she told a television documentary that Brady had given her a sealed envelope to pass to Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, in the event of his death.
The letter was never found and Mrs Johnson died not knowing where her son was buried.
Brady was jailed for life, along with his lover Hindley, in 1966.
She died in prison in 2002, aged 60.
He has been detained at Ashworth since 1985.
