[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bath death crash truck owner 'was warned about brakes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A haulage company boss was warned one of his trucks had faulty brakes days before it crashed and killed four people, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitzi Steady, four, Robert Parker, 59, Philip Allen, 52, and Stephen Vaughan, 34, died in the crash on Lansdown Lane in Bath on 9 February 2015.
A worker told Bristol Crown Court the ABS warning light came on when he drove the lorry days before the fatal crash.
Driver Phillip Potter denies causing death by dangerous or careless driving.
His boss Matthew Gordon, 30, of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, who was driving a truck in front of Mr Potter's, also denies 14 offences, while the truck company's mechanic Peter Wood, 55, of Brinkworth, Wiltshire, denies four charges.
Andrew Haywood, a former employee at Mr Gordon's firm Grittenham Haulage Ltd, said he drove the truck on 5 and 6 February 2015 and on both occasions the warning light came on which he reported to Mr Gordon.
He also told the jury of an incident involving a different lorry owned by the company when its front wheel caught fire and he had to put out the blaze with a fire extinguisher at the side of the road.
Previously the court heard the truck hit several pedestrians including Mitzi and her grandmother Margaret Rogers and a car containing Mr Allen and Mr Vaughan, both from Swansea, and Mr Parker, from Cwmbran, south Wales, when the lorry's brakes failed on the steep hill.
The court has also previously been told the trucks being driven by Mr Potter and Mr Haywood were too big to legally use Lansdown Lane.
Mr Potter, 20, of Dauntsey, is also charged with causing serious injuries to Karla Brennan and Ms Rogers by dangerous driving.
He denies a total of 10 charges against him.
The trial continues.
