The 29-year-old centre-back was forced off in the early stages of Saturday's 0-0 draw at Bradford.
Former Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Leeds man Pearce has featured 18 times for the Addicks after joining from Wigan in the summer.
"The time span is 12 to 15 weeks, which is a big disappointment for us." boss Karl Robinson told BBC Radio Kent.
"It's difficult one for him and me as a manager."
