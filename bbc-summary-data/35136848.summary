The former member of The Wanted, who danced with Aliona Vilani, was the hottest favourite in the show's history, according to bookmakers.
He beat former Coronation Street actress Georgia May Foote and partner Giovanni Pernice.
The other finalists were broadcaster Katie Derham and Anton du Beke and soap star Kellie Bright and Kevin Clifton.
The results show opened with Derham and Du Beke in fourth place.
All the couples performed three dances in this year's final - one routine from a previous show that the dancers had chosen to perform again, one judges' choice and a showdance.
For their choice, Jay and Aliona chose to do the paso doble to It's My Life by Bon Jovi, while Georgia and Giovanni returned to the charleston, dancing to Hot Honey Rag from Chicago.
Katie and Anton went back to the Viennese waltz, set to Elvis Presley's If I Can Dream, while Kellie and Kevin picked the charleston, accompanied by Star Wars Cantina Band by John Williams.
They had survived to the final from the 15 celebrities who took to the dancefloor at the start of the series in September. Peter Andre, Carol Kirkwood, Daniel O'Donnell, Ainsley Harriott and Jeremy Vine were among those who were knocked out along the way.
This was the 13th series, and the BBC One show has remained popular with viewers, with more than 10 million households tuning in to every instalment this year.
Last year's winners were TV presenter Caroline Flack and partner Pasha Kovalev.
