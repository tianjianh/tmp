The 31-year-old Honduras international made 200 appearances during his five-year spell with the Latics between 2008 and 2013.
He left to join Hull last summer but has failed to earn a place in Steve Bruce's team during this season's Premier League campaign.
Figueroa started for the Latics in Tuesday night's Championship game with Millwall.
"He knows and understands the club well and his presence gives us a real shot in the arm," Wigan manager Uwe Rosler told the club website.
Figueroa added: "I loved my time at Wigan and it was a sad day when I left. It's great to be back and I just hope to get some good game time under my belt and help the team."
Prior to Tuesday, the defender had only made one appearance so far this season, in Hull's 3-2 defeat by West Brom in the Capital One Cup.
