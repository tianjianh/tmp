Aberdeen Council tax rate 'still to be decided'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Labour-run administration at Aberdeen City Council has said it is still considering whether or not to increase council tax.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councils across Scotland are in the process of setting their budgets, with many opting to increase the tax by 3%.
Aberdeen councillors are due to meet to set the rate on Wednesday 22 February.
The local authority warned last week that it faced making savings of more than Â£21m. It also said staff numbers could be cut.
Finance convenor Willie Young told BBC Scotland that the administration was still deciding if council tax rates should be raised.
