A bridge that partially collapsed on to railway tracks is to reopen to traffic next month.

The collapse, in Barrow-upon-Soar in Leicestershire on 1 August, caused severe disruption for rail passengers heading to and from London.
It reopened to pedestrians three weeks later but required further work before being deemed safe enough for vehicles.
Network Rail said it had been a "huge project" to repair the bridge which is due to reopen on 27 March.
The firm said the work involved removing 200 tonnes of debris, restoring the brick parapet wall, reconnecting gas and water mains and resurfacing the road.
Area director Gary Walsh said: "Work to repair old bridges such as this one are complicated and can run into unforeseen challenges."
Further repairs will be carried out on the bridge later in the year.
