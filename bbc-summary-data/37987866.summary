Keane, 23, suffered the injury in the win over Southampton on 6 November and has now successfully undergone surgery.
He joined the Tigers from Manchester United on 30 August and has made six appearances for Mike Phelan's side.
"To lose a player of Will's quality and potential for such a long period of time is a big blow," Phelan told the club website.
"I'm sure his determination and mindset will see him through the tough journey ahead."
Keane previously spent a lengthy period on the sidelines in 2012 after suffering the same injury while playing for England Under-19s.
Hull are 18th in the Premier League, one point behind 17th-placed West Ham.
