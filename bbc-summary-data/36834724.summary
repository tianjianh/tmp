England will also play Lebanon for the first time, while France are the other team in Pool A.
Scotland will face 2013 finalists and co-hosts New Zealand along with Tonga and Samoa in the second pool.
There are 14 teams in the competition and three spaces remain up for grabs from this autumn's European qualifying section, which features Wales, Ireland, Spain, Serbia, Italy and Russia.
