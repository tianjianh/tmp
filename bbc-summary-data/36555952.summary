Grace Reid is looking forward to "the biggest show on earth" now that her place in the diving team for the Rio 2016 Games has been confirmed.

The 20-year-old from Edinburgh will compete in the 3m springboard.
She won gold at this month's British Championships and picked up a bronze medal in the same event at the European Championships in May.
"There's been such a build up that it is a bit of relief," said Reid of her selection for Team GB.
"It's so exciting but I'm already thinking, if I'm going, I want to do well and I'm not just going there to make up numbers.
"I just want to go and do five really good dives and see where it takes me.
"I don't think about positions or semi-finals or anything like that. I think about each dive individually and what will be, will be.
"Over the last four years, I've been gaining international experience and I've got a good body of work to pull upon, so hopefully that will help me."
Reid, who started diving aged six, missed out on a medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, finishing fifth in front of a home crowd.
This year started well, with her display at the Rio World Cup in February ensuring Britain would have a 3m representative, before her European and British medal successes.
"I did everything I could do and knew I had put myself in a good position," she said.
"The biggest change we've made is mentally. We treat every competition, whether it's a club competition or a World Cup away in Brazil, the same as everything that I'm doing in training.
"It takes the pressure away and I get into this zone and I go into auto pilot.
"If I go in confident and believe in my ability and the training and work I've put in, that's definitely enough to stand me in good stead."
Reid also collected a European gold medal alongside Tom Daley in the mixed 3m synchro, a non-Olympic event.
"It was an amazing experience," she enthused. "There was so much media attention on Tom and he's a fantastic athlete, so it was great to have him almost push me to step up.
"I wanted to prove that I was right to be his synchro partner at the Europeans and I think I did that."
