The deal for the versatile 25-year-old, who can play on the left of defence or midfield, is subject to international clearance.
Leu played for Moldovan club side FC Spicul last season and won an international cap in 2014.
"We're delighted to add a full international to improve our squad," said Glens manager Alan Kernaghan
"I am confident Alex will be a high quality addition," Kernaghan told the club website.
"This further demonstrates the club's determination to build the strongest possible playing squad for this season.
"We have worked very hard for some time now to get the deal over the line and I must again thank our loyal and dedicated supporters for their help."
The arrival of Leu at the Oval follows the signing of former Rangers striker Nacho Novo last month.
