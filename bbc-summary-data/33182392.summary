A woman has been found guilty by a jury at the High Court in Glasgow of murdering her husband in Breakish on Skye in February last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandra Bruce, 61, had denied killing Norman Bruce and also assaulting him between 1991 and 2014.
The court heard that Mr Bruce, 64, had previously lived in Kilmarnock in Ayrshire before later moving to Skye in 1991 or 1992.
Judge Lord Armstrong has sentenced her to a minimum of 15 years in prison.
He said Bruce had perpetrated a "vicious attack" on man who was unable to defend himself.
Lord Armstrong told her: "There are no reasons which could possibly justify the taking of another's life."
The court heard that Bruce had stamped and jumped on her husband. The former paramedic did not recover from the injuries caused, including 20 rib fractures.
Bruce, formerly of Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, told the jury that she could not remember the attack.
The trial heard that after the killing she complained of her husband hiding a packet of cigarettes that night.
She was also said to have smirked when later shown photos of his dead body.
The murder happened at the couple's home on Skye. They had moved there in the 1990s after Mr Bruce left his then wife.
Prosecutors stated Mr Bruce was scratched before being kicked, stamped and jumped on.
It was said his wife also inflicted "blunt force injuries" to his head and body.
Ambulance technician Andrew Alexander told the trial how he attended at the house on 9 February last year.
He said Bruce appeared "agitated" and "slightly unsteady on her feet".
Mr Alexander then added: "She stated that Norman was dead and that there was no need for the defibrillator.
"She took hold of me - she did not let go for a period of time."
Mr Alexander and a colleague found Mr Bruce's body in the house, but it was clear he had already died.
Bruce gave evidence during the trial and insisted she had tried "thousands of times" to remember what happened that evening.
She also claimed to have been the victim of domestic violence.
The former secretary later told the jury that she did not accept murdering her husband and that she "never meant to harm him".
Bruce had also faced allegations of assaulting her husband's son Andrew Bruce when he was a young boy in the 1990s.
The now 37-year-old - a police officer with the Civic Nuclear Constabulary - recalled her trying to choke him when he came to Skye to visit his dad.
The accusation was later dropped by prosecutors during the trial.
