Oxford bans non-recyclable takeaway boxes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non-recyclable takeaway food containers are to be banned in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new regulations form part of Oxford City Council's new street trading policy, approved by the council on Monday evening.
It insists that all packaging and utensils passed on to customers by street traders must be made of biodegradable or recyclable materials.
Those who fail to follow the rules could face prosecution, the council said.
The new policy takes effect immediately for all new traders.
However, existing traders have until 1 August to use up current stocks of non-recyclable containers.
The council has pledged to cut down on the amount of waste generated in the city that ends up being sent to landfill.
