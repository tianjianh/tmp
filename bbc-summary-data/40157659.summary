[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
English rider Davey Lambert is in a critical condition in hospital after crashing in Sunday's opening Superbike race at the Isle of Man TT event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lambert, from Gateshead, sustained multiple injuries after coming off his 1,000cc Kawasaki machine at Greeba Castle.
He crashed on lap three of the six-lap race on the Mountain Course.
It is understood the race continued while Lambert received treatment at the side of the road.
Marshals waved yellow flags for the remainder of the race urging riders to slow down in the area.
Lambert was making his TT debut, but had previously competed at the Manx Grand Prix over the same course.
The Superbike race was won by Yorkshire racer Ian Hutchinson, - his 15th TT victory, making him the third most successful solo rider in the event's history.
