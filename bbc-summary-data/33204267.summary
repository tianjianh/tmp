Royal Ascot: Ryan Moore secures record-breaking ninth winner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jockey Ryan Moore secured a record-breaking ninth winner at Royal Ascot on Aloft in the Queen's Vase.

Moore's victory on the 5-4 favourite saw him surpass the modern-day record of eight winners in a single meeting, set by Pat Eddery in 1989 and Lester Piggott (1965, 1975).
The 31-year-old could yet break the all-time record of 12 winners set by Fred Archer in 1878.
Moore had earlier come second on Found, to Ervedya, in the Coronation Stakes.
It looked unlikely Moore was going to break the record on Friday as he came into the home turn of the two-mile Queen's Vase contest.
But the three-year-old Aloft, trained by Aidan O'Brien, finished well to beat Tommy Doc and Future Empire by half a length.
Moore said: "It was a very messy race. I got into a bad position and I had to pick my way through.
"He's a fair horse this fellow. He's open to all sorts of improvement, it's his first run of the year and you wouldn't know where he could end up.
"I'm very lucky, I get to ride the best horses and that makes a big difference, " the three-time champion jockey added. The record is not something you think about, we'll think about rides tomorrow then worry about this."
Moore, who had equalled the post-war record on Friday, has six races to try and beat the all-time record on the festival's final day on Saturday.
"Ryan Moore often gives the impression that he can't quite work out what all the fuss is about, but beating records held by racing greats like Piggott and Eddery is outstanding.
Saying anyone is the best at anything in the world is a huge statement, but the manner in which he's totally dominating Royal Ascot, one of the great, global Flat racing championships, is simply astonishing.
"What makes him? Dedication obviously; not for Moore any Royal Ascot parties but instead a trip to the evening fixture at Newmarket. Tactical cunning and physical strength are part of it too, plus a cool head and, of course, he's often on the fabulously talented Coolmore-owned horses.
"All these things come together to make him the most potent riding force in world racing at the moment, and, judged by these results, only getting better and better."
