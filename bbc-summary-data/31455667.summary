[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leslie Ross to find out if he will stand trial for murders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former stonemason from County Down will find out next month if he is to stand trial for the murders of three women over a 10-year period.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Ross is accused of killing Michelle Bickerstaff, Margaret Weise and Elizabeth McKee.
A preliminary enquiry has heard evidence from a number of witnesses over the past three days.
These included relatives of some of the deceased as well as retired state pathologist Jack Crane.
The details of the evidence cannot be revealed, due to reporting restrictions.
A district judge thanked all those who had taken the stand, but said there was a "significant amount of material" to be sifted through and that "it wouldn't be proper" to come to a decision on Friday.
The case will now be mentioned at Newry Court on 25 February when the judge will give a date for his decision.
He told the families of the deceased that he expected that to be within 10 days of that appearance.
