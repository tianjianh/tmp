It is the second suicide attack in northern Nigeria in less than a week.
On Saturday, at least nine people were killed in Yobe state when a woman blew herself up at a bus station.
Although no-one has yet claimed responsibility, the militant group Boko Haram is suspected to be behind the attack.
The bomb went off at about 12:15 GMT in the village of Garkida in Adamawa state.
The BBC's Abdullahi Kaura Abubakar in Abuja said locals at the entrance to the market were suspicious before the blast and tried to prevent the bomber going in when he detonated explosives strapped to his body.
The attacks come as the Islamist insurgents are under increased pressure from the Nigerian military, our correspondent adds.
Officials say most of the militants camps in the vast Sambisa forest have been destroyed and many of the jihadists killed while some are on the run.
But observers believe many of the fighters are still alive and capable of regrouping and rearming to continue their attacks.
In January at least 19 people were killed and several injured by a bomb strapped to a girl reported to be aged about 10 in north-eastern Nigeria.
