Jonathan Toews, Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz scored as Canada became the first team to retain the Olympic title since the Soviet Union in 1988.
The Canadians are also the first team in 30 years to go through a Games unbeaten, inspired by the energetic Toews and Crosby's breakaway goal.
Sweden were without Washington Capitals centre Nicklas Backstrom who failed a drug test prior to the game.
The 26-year-old was dropped from the team after testing positive for what Swedish Olympic Committee spokesman Bjorn Folin said was a substance found in an allergy medication that the player had taken for the past seven years.
"It was a shocking message to get," said goaltender Jhonas Enroth after the final. "We found out two hours before the match."
Canada finished with 10 gold medals and 25 in total for third place on the medal table behind Russia and Norway.
At their home Games in Vancouver four years ago, the Canadians won 14 gold medals and topped the table, an achievement capped off by Crosby's famous overtime winner against the United States but this year's final proved nowhere near as close a contest.
In Backstrom's absence, a depleted Sweden lacked the creativity to match Canada.
Sweden's Gustav Nyquist hit the post early in the first period but his side subsequently faded.
Once Toews had opened the scoring from close range in the first period, converting Jeff Carter's assist, Canada only ever looked destined to increase their lead.
Crosby's sublime second-period finish beat goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who had impressed during Sweden's run to the final.
Kunitz's shot into the roof of the net, having stolen the puck from a sleeping Swedish defence with 10 minutes remaining, made certain of victory.
