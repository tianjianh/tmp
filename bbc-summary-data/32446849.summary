Those taking part will be calling for improved facilities and safer roads for both cyclists and pedestrians.
But is Scotland moving forward? Are we on the road to becoming a cycle-friendly country?
"Funding has increased from central and local government, mainly through match funding programmes like the Community Links partnership run by Sustrans.
"Some local authorities are committed to 20mph, design of infrastructure is improving and programmes delivering training and awareness of walking and cycling are more sophisticated.
"Cycling is increasingly part of strategic planning and is recognised as a way to improve people's health.
"We are meeting ministers and national politicians much more easily than before and they are sympathetic.
"There are lots of positives, but we are only at the beginning of a journey toward a nation where short trips are easily made by foot and bicycle."
"Scotland has enormous potential for increasing the number of people walking and cycling, leading to better health and wellbeing for everyone in our country.
"Cities like Edinburgh have shown that with political leadership and sustained investment you can achieve a significant increase in the number of people choosing to walk and cycle.
"No parent wants their child to share the road with HGVs, buses and fast moving motorised vehicles.
"That's why I'll be at Pedal on Parliament with my family asking our political leaders for the resources and determination needed to change our streets into places that put people first."
"Cycling is becoming an everyday activity for more people of all ages and abilities.
"Inverness and Edinburgh regularly have 1 in 10 journeys to work by bike.
"38% of primary schools offer Bikeability Scotland on-road cycle training, up from 32% just three years ago thanks to Transport Scotland funding.
"Midlothian provides training in 87% of schools and East Renfrewshire in 100% of schools.
"The figures show it is possible to increase cycling in communities anywhere in Scotland but there is clearly much more to be done."
"As a grassroots campaign group, Pedal on Parliament (Pop) has opened up campaigning beyond "cyclists" to everyone wanting safer roads, a healthier population, and cleaner air.
"We're the first national campaign to call for infrastructure protecting cyclists from motor vehicles, but which doesn't take space away from pedestrians.
"Since Pop started, active travel funding has stopped falling, but is still just 2% of the transport budget.
"To meet the government's goal of 10% of journeys by bike by 2020, we need 5 times that investment, and a long-term commitment to spending it on quality infrastructure."
