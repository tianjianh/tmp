Election TV debate: Parties claim spoils after seven-way battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives and Labour have both claimed victory in the aftermath of Thursday's TV election debate between the leaders of seven political parties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tories said David Cameron emerged "clearly ahead" as the best person to lead the UK but Labour said Ed Miliband had staked out an "alternative vision".
The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has been praised for an "impressive" performance by some senior Conservatives.
Seven million people watched the two-hour debate on ITV.
In the most high-profile event of the campaign so far, the seven politicians - also including the leaders of the Lib Dems, UKIP, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru - were questioned on a range of issues including the NHS, immigration and the deficit.
In other post-debate developments:
The party leaders have returned to the campaign trail in the wake of Thursday's encounter - the only time before polling day on 7 May that Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband will share a stage.
During the debate, the Conservative and Labour leaders locked horns over spending cuts, management of the economy, and standards of care in the NHS.
Mr Miliband vowed to "save" the NHS from the Conservatives, claiming David Cameron had "broken his bond of trust", while Mr Cameron said the Conservatives' economic plan was working and Labour would take the country "back to square one".
As the dust settled on the encounter, both the Conservatives and Labour suggested their man had come out ahead.
"The overall impression people will have got is if you want to look and say 'who is the best person to lead the country over the next five years', David Cameron will have come out clearly ahead," Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
But shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint suggested that Mr Cameron had "faded".
"Given that David Cameron designed and demanded this debate... he didn't seize the opportunity to make his case... At the end of the day there was one alternative prime minister to David Cameron and that was Ed Miliband."
Amid suggestions of a hung Parliament and possible coalitions and deals after the election, commentators have said that the debates made the British political system look very different from the traditional two or three-party set-up.
Both the Conservatives and Labour conceded that the three parties appearing in a national debate for the first time - the SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party - could have benefited the most from the primetime exposure.
Ms Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Green leader Natalie Bennett all argued against austerity.
The SNP leader signalled areas, such as on tax, where she could work with Labour but said getting more SNP MPs elected to Westminster was needed to "keep them honest".
Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said she had made the case for a "progressive change" in Scotland and across the UK.
The SNP, she suggested, could work with Labour to "lock" the Conservatives out of power but also make sure Labour did "sell out its values" in government.
Mr Gove said the SNP leader had done "very well".
"I think it is also legitimate to say Nicola Sturgeon emerged as the most impressive debutante on the stage," he said.
Labour have suggested it is in the Conservatives' interests to talk up the SNP, as the more seats they win in Scotland, the less likely the chances of Labour getting a majority.
The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said Ms Sturgeon had "managed to project herself as a distinctive, articulate voice of anti-austerity in a way which we've not really had on the national stage".
But he said both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband's supporters were "pretty pleased" as "they felt their men came through it relatively unscathed, they got over their core message, they both believed they managed to look prime ministerialâ€¦"
This issue includes EU and worldwide migration, border controls and rules on work and benefits.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Other notable clashes during the debate came between David Cameron and Nick Clegg on schools funding and between Mr Clegg and Mr Farage over immigration.
Speaking on Friday, Mr Clegg said it was clear politics was becoming more "fragmented" and no longer a "game of pass the parcel" between the Conservatives and Labour.
"I actually think that most people watching last night will have realised no-one's going to win this election outright so it's all about who's going to work with whom," he said.
Mr Farage was attacked by his opponents after highlighting the number of foreign nationals with HIV whom he said were treated by the NHS.
But the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe said the debate had been a "resounding success" for Mr Farage because he had been "straight-talking, honest and had set out commonsense policies for leading Britain and putting Britain's interests first".
Snap polls taken after the debate gave a mixed verdict.
A YouGov poll of 1,100 people gave a clear victory to the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, with 28%, followed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage on 20%, Mr Cameron on 18%, Mr Miliband on 15%, Mr Clegg on 10%, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett on 5% and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood on 4%.
But a ComRes poll for ITV made it a dead heat between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Farage and Ms Sturgeon, although Mr Cameron came out on top on the question of who was most capable of leading the country.
Mr Miliband was judged best performer in an ICM poll for the Guardian, taking 25% of support, just ahead of David Cameron on 24%.
This issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people.
The seven-way debate emerged from tortuous negotiations between the parties and the broadcasters, with Mr Cameron refusing a direct head-to-head with Mr Miliband.
The Democratic Unionist Party, which has eight MPs, has criticised its exclusion from the programme.
A question-and-answer programme featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband appearing separately was hosted by Channel 4 and Sky News last week, and a BBC debate involving opposition party leaders, moderated by David Dimbleby, will be broadcast on 16 April.
There will also be a special Question Time on BBC One, a week before polling day, with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to answer questions from a studio audience.
