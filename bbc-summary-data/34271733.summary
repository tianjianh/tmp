The £5 fee paid by people departing from Newquay Airport has prompted anger from passengers and airlines.
Adam Paynter from Cornwall Council, which owns and subsidises the airport, confirmed the authority was looking to drop the charge.
Low cost airline Ryanair previously cited the fee as a reason for pulling its flights from Newquay.
Mr Paynter, Liberal Democrat, said: "The airport development fee clearly was something that was not wholly popular with a lot of the operators and a lot of the public."
The fee was introduced in October 2006 to raise funds to invest in the former military airbase.
Council talks regarding the matter have so far been held in private with a decision to be taken by full council on a date to be decided.
Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall said scrapping the "disliked" fee would be good for tourism.
Conservative councillor Fiona Ferguson said the airport would have to gain additional flights as a result of scrapping the fee to make it worthwhile.
A spokesman for Ryanair said it was always interested in new routes depending on "demand, aircraft capacity and a viable airport deal".
The airport currently serves around 220,000 passengers a year and receives an annual subsidy from Cornwall Council of around £2.3m.
