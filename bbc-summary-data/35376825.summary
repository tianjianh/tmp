[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Missing Blackpool teenager Paige Chivers has been officially declared dead following an inquest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paige, 15, was reported missing in 2007. Her body has not been found.
Blackpool's coroner Alan Wilson said the cause of death was unascertained and he recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing.
Robert Ewing, 60, of Kincraig Place, Bispham, was convicted of Paige's murder last July following a trial at Preston Crown Court.
The court heard Ewing exploited the vulnerable teenager for his sexual gratification and then decided to silence her when she threatened to go to the authorities.
He is serving a life term and will stay in jail for at least 33 years.
Gareth Dewhurst, 46, of Duncan Avenue, Bispham, who was found guilty of helping dispose of the body, was jailed for eight years.
Police say they "remain committed" to finding Paige's body.
