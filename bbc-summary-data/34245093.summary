Campaigners are urging a north Wales council to rethink the planned closure of a training and workshop centre for people with special needs.

Gwynedd council has told families and those using the Manton Centre in Caernarfon that it will shut in April next year, as part of Â£9m budget cuts.
Supporters said the centre has provided a "vital service" for years.
The authority said it was discussing continued support for those who use the current service.
The centre provides opportunities for people with disabilities and learning difficulties to work in the community.
Some 450 supporters have already signed a petition against the closure, and a Save Manton Facebook page has attracted backing from over 1,200 people in a few days.
Wendy Campbell, 53, whose son Craig, 31, works at the centre, told the Daily Post: "Working there provides structure and a place to work. It's a crucial part of their lives."
A Gwynedd council spokesperson said: "We appreciate that any change of this kind can be difficult, and that is why, over the coming weeks and months, the council's social care staff will continue to work closely with everyone who currently attends the centre and their families to establish their individual needs so that appropriate support can be put in place for them from next April onwards.
"In these discussions, our aim will be to develop care packages that fully meet their needs and aspirations."
