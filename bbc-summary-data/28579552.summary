About 147,000 people now tune into the station each week - up 4,000 in the past three months.
Meanwhile BBC Radio Wales saw a 34,000 fall in its weekly listeners to 438,000, but its listener share rose.
Radio Two broke the one million-listener barrier in Wales for the first time.
Rajar (Radio Joint Audience Research Ltd) issues latest radio listening figures for stations across the UK every three months. The latest figures cover the six months to the end of June.
