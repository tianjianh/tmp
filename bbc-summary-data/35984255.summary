A campaign for the 190-mile Coast to Coast walk to be given official National Trail status has begun.

The route, which runs from St Bees Head in Cumbria to Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire, was devised in 1973 by fell walker and author Alfred Wainwright.
Campaigners say the walk should be included alongside the 15 designated National Trails, which include the Pennine Way and the Cleveland Way.
Wainwright Society chairman Eric Robson said the walk was a "wonderful route".
The campaign has been backed by Richmond MP Rishi Sunak and BBC presenter Julia Bradbury.
Walkers want the path to have the same prominence and national funding as the existing National Trails, which are looked after by Natural England and Natural Resources Wales.
Mr Sunak said: "The Coast to Coast runs right through the heart of the Richmond constituency and some of the most beautiful scenery in the UK.
"Hundreds of businesses depend on it and official recognition would bring a real boost for the economy of the area.
"This is a walk that was rated as the second best walk in the world in a survey of expert opinion carried out by Country Walking magazine a few years ago and yet it has no official status. This is a real anomaly."
