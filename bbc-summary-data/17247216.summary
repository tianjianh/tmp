Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the two-seater plane was involved in the crash at 11:05 GMT on Saturday.
Two people were in the aircraft, but neither was injured and they were not taken to hospital.
The fire service sent crews from Swansea West, Swansea Central and Gorseinon to the airport, at Fairwood Common, Gower.
The incident comes a week after two people escaped unharmed when a light aircraft made an emergency landing in a field near the airport.
Just after 13:30 GMT last Saturday a twin-seater single-engine Piper aircraft ended up in a hedge at Manor Farm.
The people in that plane were members of a flying club based at Swansea.
A report into the earlier incident will be prepared by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport.
