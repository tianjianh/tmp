Zac Evans died and two other men were injured on 24 January outside The Pike and Musket pub in Tuffley, Gloucester.
A motorcycle hearse carried Mr Evans' coffin to the city's cathedral, where around 300 people - including friends and family - wore items of blue clothing in his memory.
A 44-year-old man has been charged with murder and attempted murder.
The Reverend Bruce Clifford said the funeral would be a "great occasion".
He said: "It's going to be a tremendous day because I know that all the support of the family, over the last four weeks, will reach a climax.
"In the midst of this sorrow and tragedy, the family are finding a way to express joy, and in expressing joy rekindle the life of Zac.
"He had such a zest for life."
