Brighton's British Airways i360 attraction has been closed after it broke down for a second time, trapping passengers in the observation pod.

Staff at the new seafront tower told the BBC it had shut for the day following technical problems on Sunday.
About 200 people were stuck for more than an hour at ground level because of a problem with the door sensors.
The British Airways i360 later said the tower would remain closed on Tuesday while safety checks continued.
A spokeswoman said: "We advise customers to visit our website and social media channels for updates.
"We apologise for any inconvenience caused and will continue to contact customers who have already made bookings to offer them the chance to rebook or claim a refund."
Another technical hitch was blamed for leaving 180 passengers stuck in mid-air for two hours on Thursday evening.
The i360 pod was carrying a private party, including a heavily pregnant woman, who boarded the pod at about 17:00.
Would-be passenger Paul Appelbe was turned away on Monday morning after a two-hour journey from Essex.
"They told us it was due to maintenance," he said. "They should tell you on the website if it is not working. A lot of people have come from a long way to see it."
The world's thinnest tall building, which offers views of up to 26 miles of Sussex coastline, opened on 4 August.
The 531ft (161m) viewing tower stands on the site once occupied by the entrance to Brighton's ruined West Pier.
Visitors ascend 450ft (137m) in a 360-degree curved-glass pod.
A spokeswoman said British Airways i360 apologised for inconvenience caused by the closure.
"Customers who have booked tickets for flights today will be offered alternative visits or refunds," she said.
