Rubio sees surge of support after strong showing in Iowa

US presidential hopeful Marco Rubio has seen a surge in high-profile endorsements, after a surprisingly strong finish in the Iowa caucuses.

The Florida Senator's campaign said that it had also received $2m (Â£1.37m) dollars in funding after the vote.
Mr Rubio is currently polling in third place in averages of national polls.
Amid the endorsements, rival candidates, notably New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have stepped up attacks on the first term senator.
With the rapid series of endorsements, Mr Rubio is now leading the Republican pack of candidates in number of endorsements, having surpassed Jeb Bush, according to statistics website FiveThirtyEight and the campaign.
Thus far the Republican race has been dominated by outsider candidates like businessman Donald Trump and conservative firebrand Senator Ted Cruz.
However, the next primary in more moderate New Hampshire will be a critical test for the "establishment" candidates - a group that includes Mr Rubio, Mr Christie, Mr Bush and John Kasich.
The four are seen more viable candidates in the general election.
Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum suspended his campaign for president on Wednesday. Shortly thereafter, he endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio, calling him a "tremendously gifted young man" and "a born leader".
An unhelpful rule of thumb for political endorsements is that they don't matter - except when they do.
A Pew Center poll back in 2012 found that endorsements from prominent politicians had no influence on the candidate preferences of a clear majority of Republican voters.
Only 23%, for instance, said they'd be more likely to support a candidate who had the backing of former vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin. In fact, 15% said it would make them less likely to back that candidate
There are exceptions, however. In 2008 both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton sought the backing of their former competitor John Edwards. In May he opted for Mr Obama. Following his announcement, 12 of the 19 delegates Mr Edwards had won in earlier primary contests pledged to support Mr Obama - valuable in that tight nomination battle - as did one of his biggest union backers, the United Steelworkers.
An endorsement can also be helpful if a former candidate represents a clear electoral bloc. Jesse Jackson's blessing was valuable both in 1988 and 1992 because of the "rainbow coalition" that supported his campaigns. In the past, Republican presidential aspirants have courted candidates from the evangelical right in order to consolidate their base as they head to a general election.

Among those endorsing Mr Rubio is US Senator Tim Scott, a black Republican from South Carolina, who is very popular in the conservative state.
His support could prove crucial for his fellow senator who is hoping to win big in the Palmetto State when its primary is held on 20 February.
Also throwing his support behind Mr Rubio in recent days was former presidential candidate Rick Santorum.
Mr Santorum who has strong support among evangelicals and is known for his conservative social policy agenda recently dropped out of the race.
The former Pennsylvania senators endorsement could help broaden Mr Rubio's base of supporters and prove useful in elections in socially conservative states.
Among those endorsing Mr Rubio since the Iowa caucuses:
But success has come with attacks.
Looking for a strong showing in New Hampshire, Mr Christie, the governor of New Jersey, has stepped up attacks on Mr Rubio.
In recent days, he challenged a crowd to "to show me the significant accomplishment that Senator Rubio has done while he's in the United States Senate", said Mr Rubio was "constantly scripted" and called him "the boy in the bubble".
This comes after weeks of attacks in the form of television advertisements, paid for by Mr Rubio's former ally, Jeb Bush and his supporters.
On Thursday, the New York Times reported that the Bush Campaign and Christie Campaign were colluding to try "to stop or at least slow" Mr Rubio's burgeoning popularity.
