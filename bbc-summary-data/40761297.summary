[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 0-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley and Eastleigh fought out a dull goalless opening day draw at Hayes Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors edged a tight and disciplined first half. The best chance came midway through the period when Eastleigh centre-back Reda Johnson came forward for a corner and headed against the bar.
While the Ravens took 40 minutes to register their first shot, Richard Hill's men pressed hard and Sam Wood hit just over.
Bromley were brighter in the second period. Ben Wynter found Louis Dennis, whose header bounced agonisingly over.
Home substitute Iffy Allen also hit just too high, but there was to be no breakthrough.
