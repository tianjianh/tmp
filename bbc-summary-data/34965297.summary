But what do we know about them?
Watch Hayley's report to find out...
IS are a group based in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria, who have extreme religious beliefs. They use brutal violence against anyone who doesn't agree with their views.
They claim to follow the religion of Islam, but many people say their beliefs of hatred and violence have little to do with what the majority of Muslims believe.
Since early 2014, IS has grown quickly, using the internet and social media to recruit followers and spread fear.
They have been able to take over large parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq, declaring this their own state, and punishing anyone who doesn't follow their strict rules.
Lots of different groups are fighting in Syria, and nations around the world can't agree on who they want to control the country.
What does unite most of the world is the desire to stop IS because of how violent their methods are.
Last year, the UK joined the US and France in bombing some areas of Syria which are controlled by IS.
The UK's former Prime Minister David Cameron argued in Parliament that bombing IS was one way to try and stop them.
But some people feel that the bombs affect too many innocent people living in Syria and that the UK shouldn't be involved.
