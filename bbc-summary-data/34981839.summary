BBC London's political editor Tim Donovan asked London Mayor Boris Johnson whether he had failed on his 2008 mayoral election pledge to bring down knife crime.
Mr Johnson said: "Overall, the volume of knife crime is well down but that is no consolation to the families of victims.
"What we're doing is to intensify sensitive stop and search and get the message across that carrying a knife does carry a custodial sentence."
