The key action on Saturday and Sunday will continue to be shown live on BBC television, as will highlights of the first and second rounds on Thursday and Friday.
But in addition, six more digital feeds will help audiences watch the play across four screens - PC, tablet, mobile and connected TV.
This weekend's play from Augusta will be shown on up to seven live video streams on mobile, tablet, desktop and Connected TVs as the Masters builds to its climax on Sunday.
You can also listen to all four days on Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra, while BBC Two will have live coverage over the weekend.
Live text coverage on the BBC Sport website will also help you keep up to date, with easy access to video streams, radio commentaries and statistics just a click away.
There will also be the chance to catch up on the highlights, reaction and interviews online, via the Red Button or on Connected TVs.
Ryder Cup-winning captain and 1993 US PGA champion Paul Azinger has joined the BBC commentary team to share his expert knowledge this year.
Audiences can access all of BBC Sport's digital coverage from bbc.co.uk/sport via a web browser on PCs and handheld devices or the BBC Sport app for mobiles and tablets (iOS and Android). The BBC Sport app for connected TVs will also provide all live streams and video highlights.
Full coverage details are available here.
