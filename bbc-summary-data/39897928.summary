Richard Cockerill takes over as head coach this summer, with interim boss Duncan Hodge reverting to his role as attack coach.
Calum MacRae will be defence coach and Grant, 30, completes the backroom team.
"Following encouraging discussions with all involved, we're excited to confirm the coaching and management set-up for the season ahead," said Cockerill.
"Roddy, Duncan and Calum all have a great affinity with Edinburgh and our supporters, which will prove instrumental in developing a strong culture for the club going forward."
Grant, who has worked with Scottish Rugby's academy, made more than 100 appearances for Edinburgh and also played for Scotland A and Scotland Sevens.
Forwards coach Stevie Scott - who also played for Edinburgh - will leave the club and managing director Jonny Petrie said: "Stevie has been a great servant to Edinburgh over his significant playing and coaching career.
"He leaves with our very best wishes and sincere thanks for all that he has done for this club."
