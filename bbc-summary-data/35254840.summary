NHS out-of-hours GP service 12-hour wait 'clinically unsafe'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callers to out-of-hours GP services faced waits of more than 12 hours, posing a "significant risk to patient safety", a leaked report has revealed.

The interim report into Integrated Care 24 (IC24), which runs non-emergency 111 and out-of-hours services in Norfolk and Wisbech, found deficiencies in call handling and a shortage of GPs.
During unannounced inspections following complaints, staff said they had been asked to alter their records.
IC24 said it had addressed the issues.
The organisation operates NHS 111 services in areas including Great Yarmouth and Waveney and parts of Essex, and took over the Norfolk and Wisbech contract in September 2015.
Assessors from Norwich Clinical Commissioning Group (NCCG) inspected five IC24 bases in Norfolk and one in Cambridgeshire in November following staff complaints.
Their report highlighted issues including:
In October last year, IC24's interim chief executive said the organisation was still struggling to fill shifts.
A month later, Norwich resident Peter Rowley said he called 111 but waited 11 hours for a call back, eventually going to A&E instead.

The company apologised, but said it had followed procedures.
Karen Watts, who wrote the interim report into IC24, concluded it was "not clinically assured of the safety of the OOH [out-of-hours] service" and only "partially assured" of the 111 service.
She said the CCG believed the issues identified were having a "negative impact on recruitment and retention of the existing workforce".
Ms Watts also demanded IC24 provide a detailed improvement action plan by the beginning of December.
The BBC asked to see the improvement plan, and whether concerns highlighted in the report had been sufficiently addressed, but both NCCG and IC24 declined to answer, instead sending a joint statement.
NCCG spokesman Tim Curtis said the organisation had been "very encouraged with IC24's response".
Yvonne Taylor, IC24 chief executive, said: "As an open organisation, I would like to reassure our patients that we continue to work with our commissioners to provide a robust and transparent service for our patients."
Both organisations said: "There were no deaths that we know of which can be attributable to the long waits."
The NCCG has been asked to share the outcomes of its investigation so they could be examined by a health committee, a Norfolk County Council spokeswoman said.
Tony Durcan from the Royal College of Nursing said it had "sought reassurances that measures had been put in place to address the worrying points raised by the leaked report".
Dr Tim Morton, chairman of Norfolk and Waveney Local Medical Committee, said IC24's problems were "a consequence of a severe workforce crisis within the NHS in recruiting and retaining GPs".
