Relatives of those killed by the IRA, including in the Enniskillen and Claudy bombs, took part in the service.
Prayers were said by Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist ministers.
A minute's silence was held beside a memorial in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church of Ireland as a mark of respect for victims of the IRA.
David Temple, whose 16-year-old brother William was killed in the Claudy bombing in July 1972, said Martin McGuinness would "go to his grave without telling these victims the truth of what happened".
He said he wanted to send his condolences to the McGuinness family but "Claudy hasn't gone away. We will still fight and look for justice for Claudy".
Church of Ireland minister Rev. Alan Irwin's father and uncle were killed by the IRA.
He said he did not think the service was insensitive to those mourning Martin McGuinness today.
"I don't believe it's insensitive to what's going on. I think we had to provide something for the innocent victims," he said.
Presbyterian Minister Rev. Rodney Beacom said the service was "not insensitive in any way, shape, or form".
"We're here to provide pastoral care for those folk who are hurting, and who are living day and daily for all of their lives with the hurt and pain of terrorism, so we have a duty and indeed a responsibility to be here today," he added.
The event was organised by the South East Fermanagh Foundation which supports victims and survivors of paramilitary violence.
Spokesman for the group Kenny Donaldson said that in the days since Mr McGuinness's death "survivors of IRA terrorism have been expressing feelings of being further cheated" of the prospect of learning more from the former IRA leader about what had happened to their loved ones.
"Martin McGuinness will now meet his Maker and unlike on this earth, he won't be able to dodge accountability citing the IRA's Green Book or any other document. Each and every one of us faces the same destiny," said Mr Donaldson.
