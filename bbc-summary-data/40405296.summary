Campbell, 23, joined on a one-year deal in February 2016 but missed much of the season with injury.
She returned for the 2017 Spring Series and City's FA Cup win, scoring once and contributing four assists.
"This club is like a family. I'm really grateful to the players and staff for putting their trust in me," said the Republic of Ireland international.
