[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Bourne cut from Wales Office in PM's reshuffle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of ministers in the Wales Office has been cut in the prime minister's post-election reshuffle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The department, which represents Wales in the UK government, will now have two ministers instead of three.
Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth has been transferred to the Northern Ireland Office.
He will combine it with his role as minister for faith and integration at the Department for Communities and Local Government in England.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and part-time junior minister Guto Bebb, who is also a government whip, retained their roles.
A Wales Office source said there was a plan to ensure the department's voice was heard in the House of Lords after Lord Bourne's move.
The Wales Office has only had a minister in the upper house since 2012. Before that a peer acted as a spokesperson there.
