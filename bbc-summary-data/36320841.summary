Cameraman Lindsay McCrae shot the film of the bird of prey hunting near Inverness.
It was shown in episode one of Highlands: Scotland's Wild Heart, narrated by Ewan McGregor, and uploaded to the BBC Scotland Facebook page.
The footage was filmed for slow motion playback, at 800 frames per second.
Mr McCrae said filming the osprey took patience.
He said: "You have to be well hidden, because the ospreys won't tolerate you being there.
"They want to know they are safe to land in water.
"But it meant I couldn't have an overhead view to check out the sky and had no idea if there was an osprey overhead. I had an assistant out on a hill watching through binoculars who was on the radio saying: 'There's one in the air. Get ready.'"
He added: "You really don't know where the bird is going to hit the water because you can't see the fish.
"You just have to frame an image on a bit of water and hope the osprey hits that particular bit."
