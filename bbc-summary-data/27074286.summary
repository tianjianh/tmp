The son of US Vice-President Joe Biden has announced plans to run for governor of the state of Delaware in 2016.

Beau Biden, 45, said on Thursday he would not seek a third term as Delaware's attorney general.
The Democrat will seek the seat currently held by Governor Jack Markell, who will be vacating after serving two terms.
The announcement comes as the elder Mr Biden mulls a possible run for the US presidency in 2016.
"After careful consideration, I have concluded that it is not right to ask for your support in 2014, knowing that my focus would be divided between doing my job as attorney general while at the same time running as a candidate for governor," Beau Biden wrote on his website.
"After my term is completed, I look forward to meeting with Delawareans and continuing to discuss my plans as a candidate for governor."
Mr Biden weighed a run for the US Senate in 2010. The same year, he suffered a mild stroke.
Subsequently he received surgery at a Texas cancer centre in 2013 for what was said to be a small lesion.
Mr Biden served as a captain in the Delaware Army National Guard during a year-long tour in Iraq and was elected Delaware attorney general in 2006.
Meanwhile, Mr Biden's father has not yet announced whether he plans to seek the nation's highest office after it is vacated by second-term US President Barack Obama.
