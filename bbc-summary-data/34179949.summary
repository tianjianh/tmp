[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two "mannequin brides" have spent more than 48 hours in a bridal shop window in a bid to win thousands of pounds worth of wedding gifts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kate Holder, from Holsworthy, Devon and Tara Attis, from St Austell, Cornwall have been modelling their wedding dresses in a 1ft x 3ft window space in Bude since 11:00 BST on Saturday.
The bride-to-be who remains on the platform the longest will win prizes worth Â£5,000 towards their wedding day.
Both must also sleep in the window.
The pair are refusing to quit and at the 54-hour mark, Tara, 32, who is getting married in 2017, said both women were "quite stubborn" and she did not see the competition "ending anytime soon".
Her opponent, Kate, 27, is due to be married in February and said winning would add "an extra bit of sparkle to the day".
Win or lose, both women have invited each other to their weddings.
The pair are allowed to take a toilet break every four hours.
