Low-protein silage prompts fears of starving stock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Farming leaders have warned that cattle and sheep in Scotland are at risk of slowly starving to death due to poor quality silage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland's Rural College analysed silage samples from beef herds and flocks of sheep, and found "disturbingly low levels of protein".
Researchers said this "could cause stock to slowly starve, even though they might look full".
They urged farmers to have their silage tested, and to supplement feed.
The Scottish Agricultural College, part of Scotland's Rural College, conducted tests on silage to gauge protein levels.
Almost half of the silage analysed had a protein content below 10%, with a quarter "insufficient for even a dry beef cow".
In a normal year, silage will have a protein content of 13% to 14%.
Senior beef specialist Basil Lowman said: "So far press articles on this year's silage quality have reported good results, with both energy and protein levels being higher compared to last year.
"However these reports have mainly been collected from English dairy herds. In comparison our figures, for solely beef and sheep units, show a different, worrying story.
"Energy levels in the silage are average to good, but protein levels are disturbingly low.
"We are strongly advising farmers and crofters to get their silage analysed so they can supplement the feed if necessary."
Protein deficiency is difficult to detect in animals in its early stages. Mr Lowman stressed the importance of having silage analysed, and said concerned famers should contact their local SAC Consulting office for guidance.
