New Aston Villa boss Roberto di Matteo hopes to make his first signing this week by bringing in Bournemouth club captain Tommy Elphick.

The 29-year-old central defender is discussing personal terms and a fee of Â£3m has been agreed between the clubs.
Elphick was an apprentice at Brighton and made his debut for them in 2005 before joining the Cherries in 2012.
He was hampered by an ankle injury last term and made only 14 appearances for the Premier League side.
Elphick captained Bournemouth to two promotions - from League One to the Premier League - in the space of three seasons.
The defender has a year remaining on his contract and BBC Radio Solent understands he has been considering a number of offers, with Villa the standout option.
