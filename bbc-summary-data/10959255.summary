Future of Blaenau Gwent People's Voice 'to be decided'

The future of the Blaenau Gwent People's Voice party, founded by the late MP Peter Law, is yet to be decided following a meeting of its members.

Recommendations were made for the future direction of the party, which was set up in protest over imposed all-women election shortlists.
Councillor Peter Abbott said one option being considered was to transform the party into an independent lobby group.
A decision will be made at a future meeting.
Mr Abbott, who was the first councillor to be elected under the People's Voice banner, said he and four other councillors had decided that in future they will stand as independents, although they were still members of the party.
He said the meeting in Blaina on Thursday had seen a "full and frank exchange of views" and there had been a "good airing of views".
Trish Law, who is a member but was elected as an Independent AM, also attended the meeting.
Don Wilcox, leader of The People's Voice, said the meeting had been private and friendly.
He said that it was decided that the party would carry on and that some recommendations were made about its "future form", although he would not give details.
He added that it would be be decided at a future meeting.
Blaenau Gwent People's Voice was founded to support Mr Law after he quit the Labour Party ahead of the 2005 General Election in protest over an imposed all-women shortlist in the constituency.
He won the parliamentary seat in 2005 as an independent but died a year later from a brain tumour.
In the by-election following his death, Mr Law's agent Dai Davies became the new MP and Mr Law's assembly seat was won by his widow.
In the May 2010 general election, the seat was lost to the Labour candidate Nick Smith by a majority of more than 10,500.
Mr Davies has since announced that he is leaving politics.
