Nigel Clough: Jackson Irvine has a 'worrying' likeness to Robbie Savage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough has only one concern about record signing Jackson Irvine - he runs like Robbie Savage.

The 23-year-old played in Saturday's pre-season friendly win over Stoke City after arriving the previous day from Ross County for a fee understood to be £300,000, and set up fellow newcomer Chris O'Grady for one of his two goals in the 3-0 victory at the Pirelli Stadium.
Wearing Burton colours for the first time, the Australia international took the field with his long hair tied back - drawing further comparisons with former Wales international Savage, who played under Clough at Derby County before retiring in 2011.
"Jackson has settled in nicely," the Brewers boss told BBC Radio Derby.
"The only worrying thing is the way he runs - it's a little bit awkward, not easy on the eye at times and he reminds me of Robbie Savage."
Irvine, who moved to the Championship club from Scottish Premiership side Ross County, was the second player in a week to break Burton's transfer record after Kyle McFadzean.
Prior to defender McFadzean joining from MK Dons, the club's biggest spend was £20,000 for midfielder Russell Penn in 2009.
"It's a remarkable achievement to get to the Championship paying a maximum fee of £20,000 to this point," Clough said.
"We had to pay a bit more than that to get Jackson and Kyle McFadzean in for similar fees. You can see the quality you get."
