Greenwood, 22, featured in the 2015 Women's World Cup and is the club's eighth signing of the transfer window.
"This is a fantastic move for me and I am really enthusiastic about the new season," she told the club's website.
"I had a great year at Notts County but this represents an exciting, new challenge and one that I am really looking forward to."
The fee, which is undisclosed, is a club record sale for Notts County who "reluctantly" accepted the offer from Liverpool.
"We received a significant bid from Liverpool, which was close to our valuation for the player, and considering her wish to leave we reluctantly accepted the offer," Notts County Ladies chief executive Matthew Alexander said.
