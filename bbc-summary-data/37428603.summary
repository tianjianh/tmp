Scotland's social care services 'unsustainable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The current system of social care in Scotland is "unsustainable" and an additional £667m will be needed by 2020 to maintain levels of service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report by the Accounts Commission, which scrutinises council spending, said a "frank, wide-ranging" debate was needed on the issue.
They said an ageing population, budget cuts and legislative changes were all putting pressure on the system.
Scotland's 32 councils currently spend about £3.1bn on social care.
That money was used to provide support to more than 300,000 people in 2014/15 - about 70% of whom were aged over 65.
The commission also said the public and service users needed to be more involved in shaping future care.
Councils plan to save £54m from their social work budgets over the next financial year, with most now only providing services for people aged over 65 assessed as being at "critical or substantial risk".
The report said: "Councils' social work departments are facing significant challenges because of a combination of financial pressures caused by a real-terms reduction in overall council spending, demographic change, and the cost of implementing new legislation and policies."
£3.1bn
Annual spending in 2014/15
300,000 people supported
759,000 unpaid carers in Scotland
£54m planned saving in 2017
27% more pensioners by 2037
The report added: "If councils and integration joint boards continue to provide services in the same way, we have estimated that these changes require councils' social work spending to increase by between £510m and £667m by 2020."
Social work departments also cover services for vulnerable children, with 17,357 youngsters being looked after by local authorities or appearing on child protection registers as of July 2015.
That represents an increase of 36% since 2000, said the report.
The overall aim of the audit by the Accounts Commission was to examine how prepared social work departments were for future financial and demographic changes.
The commission's report said that between 2012 and 2037, Scotland's population was projected to increase by 9% - that included a 27% rise in the number of people of pensionable age.
Although life expectancy had continued to rise, the number of years that a person can expect to live in good health has not changed significantly since 2008, said the report.
Recent legislative changes have seen the increased integration of health and care services and a real-terms reduction in overall council spending.
Spending on social care now accounts for a third of overall council spending in Scotland.
However, the Scottish government estimates that there are 759,000 unpaid carers aged 16 and over in Scotland, while Carers UK estimated the value of unpaid care in Scotland at £10.8bn.
The commission said that there was a recruitment issue in the care sector and low pay, anti-social hours and difficult working conditions were all adding to the crisis.
They also said that some care providers had expressed concerns that Brexit and the possibility of a future points-based immigration system could add to this.
They cited a 2008 survey which indicated that 6.1% the workforce in Scottish care homes were EU - non-UK workers, and a further 7.3% were employed under work permits from places such as the Philippines, India and China.
Just over 200,000 people work in social work and social care services, representing about one in 13 people in employment in Scotland - 85% are women.
Responding to the report, Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "The integration of health and social care services is one of the most ambitious programmes of work that this government has undertaken and we have committed over half a billion pounds towards making the integration of services a success.
"Integration will support better provision of care within communities and in people's homes - helping people to lead longer, more independent lives."
