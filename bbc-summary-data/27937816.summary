A multi-million pound project to repair damage caused in Guernsey's winter storms, is to go before the island's government for approval.

Repairs to the sea defences, including the breaches at Vazon and Fermain, are expected to cost about £2m.
Rock armour protecting reclaimed land at Longue Hougue also needed to be repaired "to protect the waste infrastructure site", officials said.
The Treasury and Resources Department said the work could be done in stages.
The £4m price tag would also include replacing the roof of Sir Charles Frossard House, the main administrative building for the States.
It was due to be replaced in the next five years but started leaking following the high winds and heavy rains experienced in the winter.
The only non-storm related project is an upgrade to the fencing at Guernsey Prison to improve the prison's category from C to B status.
