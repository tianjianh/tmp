Jones led the side in the 2017 Six Nations, but top try-scorer Keiran Williams misses out through injury.
Rhun Williams, who played in the under-20s Six Nations campaign this year, was called up to Robin McBryde's senior side to face Tonga and Samoa.
Wales U18 captain Will Griffiths is one of five debutants in the 28-man squad.
The fresh faces also include Connor Edwards, Eddie Drake, Joe Goodchild and Scott Jenkins.
In a warm-up match ahead of the tournament, which begins at the end of May, Wales will take on Scotland U20 on Tuesday, 16 May at Bridgend's Brewery Field (14:30 BST kick-off).
Their world title bid kicks off against Australia on 31 May before facing England on 4 June and Samoa four days later.
The tournament ends on Sunday, 18 June with Wales' three Pool A matches taking place at Avchala Stadium, Tbilisi.
