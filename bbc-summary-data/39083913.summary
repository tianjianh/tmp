Aaron McEneff put the visitors ahead from a penalty and substitute Nathan Boyle made it 2-0 from close range.
Boyle added a third with a low strike early in the second half before Dinny Corcoran gave the Dubliners hope by firing in on 55 minutes.
Lucas Schubert netted from a rebound with his first touch after coming on as a substitute to seal the points.
Defensive errors gifted Derry their opening two goals with the penalty coming after 14 minutes.
Bohs keeper Shane Supple brought down Rory Patterson and McEneff slotted in from 12 yards.
Patterson was injured in the penalty incident and was replaced on 28 minutes by Boyle, who made the most of his introduction from the bench.
City keeper Gerard Doherty kept out two efforts from Jamie Doyle before City doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time.
Bohs defender Derek Pender misplaced his backpass and Supple managed to claw the ball off the line, but it fell to a grateful Boyle and he supplied the finish.
The opening exchanges of the second half proved decisive, starting with Oscar Brennan heading over the Derry bar when he should have scored.
The action quickly switched to the other end and Boyle held off Brennan before drilling the ball between Supple's legs and into the net.
Corcoran slotted past Doherty and seconds later the ball was in the City net again, but referee Paul McLaughlin ruled it out for Doyle's foul on the City keeper.
Schubert restored the three-goal advantage on 65 minutes, bundling in at the far-post after Supple could only parry a fierce shot from Boyle.
Both sides squandered chances late in the game but this was the perfect opener for Derry boss Kenny Shiels.
