A survey of 20,000 spectators found 91% were satisfied. The top three words used in feedback were "fantastic", "exciting" and" fun".
Athletes set nine world records during 11 days of competition and broke 142 Commonwealth Games records.
The figures are among a tranche of facts and figures released to highlight the Games' success.
Other statistics include:
Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg said: "The Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has made history as the best Commonwealth Games ever, setting a new gold standard for the Commonwealth sports movement, new benchmarks for event delivery."
He also praised Glasgow itself, saying it had received "universal accolades for a proud host city and its people for the joyous enthusiasm with which they embraced athletes and visitors during Scotland's biggest-ever sporting and cultural festival".
Scottish government sport secretary Shona Robison said: "The number of spectators at the Games exceeded all expectations.
"Time after time we saw amazing crowds who really helped make the Games and cheered on athletes whether they were winning or not."
The organisers said the opening ceremony on 23 July at Celtic Park, where performers included Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle, was watched by a television audience of more than one billion people.
Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council, said the Games were "without a doubt the best-ever in the event's history".
"This is something we should take enormous pride in after all the hard work, training and planning from all involved over the years," he said.
"The legacy of these Games won't just be a golden glow in people's memory, but a city that has been changed forever and is looking confidently to its future."
