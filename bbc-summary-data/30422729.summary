[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dr Dre has taken home an enormous amount of money this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The $620m (Â£395m) he made before tax means he has topped Forbes' list of the biggest earners in music in 2014.
Not only that, but he has now also got the Forbes record for the highest earnings in a single year by any musician.
The majority of his cash has come not from record sales but from Apple's purchase of Beats, the company he founded, for $3bn (Â£1.9bn).
Best known for their headphone range, Beats also makes technology used in car audio systems and has a music streaming service known as Beats Music.
Priced about $300 (Â£191) in the US, Dr Dre, if he were so inclined, could buy more than two million sets of his Studio headphones with his earnings.
