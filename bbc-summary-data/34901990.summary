Ipswich Tolly Cobbold brewery: New homes plan submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to transform a derelict Victorian brewery into a 300-seat auditorium and homes has been revised and sent to planners.

Pigeon Investments had wanted to covert the Tolly Cobbold site on Ipswich waterfront into 27 flats, a supermarket and hotel.
A new Â£40m scheme has dropped the supermarket and hotel elements, but it now includes 222 residential units.
The theatre would still be built in the Grade II-listed brewery building.
Brewing had taken place on the site since 1746 and the main brewery building dates from 1894-96.
The new plan was revised from the 2013 one that was granted outline planning permission.
Clive Thompson, Pigeon's project co-ordinator, said: "The retail marketplace has changed out of all recognition in the last three years - the big supermarkets aren't looking at Ipswich town centre at the moment and there have already been new hotels built elsewhere.
"With the recovery and construction cranes around the wet dock, there is a belief Ipswich is on its way back.
"Funding is in place to be able to deliver the scheme."
Mike Cook, planning co-ordinator with the Ipswich Society civic campaign group, said: "We are very happy a building on the at-risk register, and subject to vandalism, is being converted sympathetically and will utilise the space as best it can.
"It balances the preservation of a listed building with an apartment block which the project is financially dependent on."
Pigeon's plans also include creating a brewery museum and the possible relocation of the Ipswich Transport Museum from Priory Heath.
A spokesman for Ipswich Borough Council said the scheme was likely to go before the planning committee early in the new year.
