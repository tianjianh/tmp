The houses were close to a bonfire at Hopewell Square.
Alan Walmsley of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said crews were at the incident "very quickly" and that their "hard work" had prevented a row of terraced houses being destroyed.
He said at this stage it looked like the fires at Hopewell Square may have been caused by burning embers carried through the air.
