The tickets cover all of Wales' five home games against Moldova, Georgia, Serbia, Austria and Republic of Ireland.
The final batch of tickets for members of the Wales Supporters Club goes on sale on Tuesday.
Football Supporters' Federation Cymru (FSF) said the number sold so far was "a good sign".
Paul Corkery, of FSF Cymru, said: "It's a sign not only of the team playing well in the Euros, but it's also coupled with the FAW doing wonders and keeping prices low.
"For 10,000 fans to be buying tickets for all five games so far in advance, with some not taking place until next year, it is very encouraging."
Tickets have been sold to club members in four staggered sales according to membership eligibility but are not on sale to the general public.
Wales kick off their qualifying campaign against Moldova on 5 September at Cardiff City Stadium.
