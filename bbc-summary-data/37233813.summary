More money than ever is flowing into the English domestic game, thanks to a £225m deal between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership clubs, and a bumper TV deal.
As a result the salary cap has risen to £6.5m a year, while each club can also sign two 'marquee players' who do not count under the cap.
With the new season starting on Friday, BBC Sport takes a closer look at some of the stellar new arrivals set to make an impact this year.
South African flanker Burger is the most experienced of the new international stars arriving on England's shores, with 86 international caps under his belt.
The 33-year-old, who won the World Cup with the Springboks in 2007, moves to champions Saracens after spells with Japanese outfit Suntory Sungoliath and Super Rugby side Stormers.
Burger made his international debut for South Africa in 2003 and has featured in four World Cups.
"I've had a good career so far but you have two ways to look at it," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"One - you can try and slow down, try and limit the schedule and play a little bit less. I look at it the other way.
"I've got a couple of years maybe more left and I just want to challenge myself as much as possible."
The Australia full-back, capped 60 times by his country, is one of the highest-profile signings in Premiership history.
Beale, 27, is one of Wasps' marquee players with his salary - in excess of £500,000 a year - falling outside the salary cap.
But Wasps fans will not see the former Waratahs star in action until at least November as he recovers from a serious knee injury.
"It's pretty frustrating coming in injured - not being able to do the things I am meant to do - but I guess when the opportunity comes I will be fighting fit and ready to go," Beale told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Obviously there is going to be a little bit of expectation and pressure. But I don't think it will be a huge problem for me because I really enjoy it when the pressure is on."
France number eight Picamoles has made what has been an unusual move over the past few years, from France to England, while at his playing peak.
The 30-year-old, who has 54 international caps and is noted as one of the finest ball carriers in the game, said he was looking forward to the quicker pace of the Premiership.
"Maybe it is more physical in France, but here all teams want to play a fast game, and this is good for my progression," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It's a big change for me and my family but we are enjoying starting a new life and adventure."
The Wales international - foreign in that he is not English-qualified - may not have moved far in heading to the West Country from Newport, but Faletau's arrival at Bath was not without controversy after it was initially blocked last October by Wales coach Warren Gatland.
The 25-year-old number eight's arrival at the Rec from Pro12 side Newport Gwent Dragons was eventually confirmed in December.
Faletau, who already has 61 international caps, adds a wealth of experience and all-round talent to a Bath side under the stewardship of new director of rugby, Todd Blackadder.
"In my opinion [Faletau] is one of the best players in the world currently playing," Blackadder told BBC Radio Bristol.
South Africa full-back Le Roux adds more international class to a Wasps side which will be looking to better its semi-final place in the last Premiership campaign.
The 27-year-old, noted for his electric running from the back, will arrive at the Ricoh Arena in January once his spell in Japan with Canon Eagles finishes.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young has described him as one of the world's "top two or three international full-backs".
Versatile Australia international Toomua's debut for the Tigers may have to wait a little longer than expected after the 26-year-old suffered concussion in the Wallabies' 42-8 defeat by New Zealand last month.
Toomua, who can play at fly-half or inside centre (where he is most likely to feature for Leicester), has won 33 caps for his country since making his debut in 2013. He joins from Super 15 side Brumbies.
When the signing was unveiled last November, Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: "It is no secret we have been looking to sign a top-class player to add to our backline resources and Matt is in that category."
