London Irish will conduct a full review of its rugby department on Monday following Premiership relegation, chief executive Bob Casey has confirmed.

The club will receive a parachute payment ahead of their Championship campaign but Casey said revenues will significantly decrease.
"We will have to restructure accordingly," he told BBC Sport.
"We'll have to sit down with the board of directors and look to see what appetite they have for the losses."
Relegation for the Exiles has come in Casey's first year in the job, as well as that of head coach Tom Coventry.
Casey, who played more than 200 times for the club as a second row, was unable to give reassurances about Coventry's future.
"Once that review (on Monday) is complete, we'll look to see what went wrong and how we can take this club forward," he added.
"We've just got to make sure that we do it as thoroughly as we can and that we will move forward after it.
"Tom would have learned a huge amount from this season. He has held himself incredibly well in very difficult circumstances."
Casey admitted to making mistakes during his first 12 months as chief executive, but stressed the club's owners remain committed to its long-term strategy.
"It's proved very difficult and ultimately, if your rugby isn't performing, it's a very difficult business to turn around," he said.
"We have a long-term vision of where we're taking this club. This is a setback, there's no doubt about it. But we're determined to take this club forward."
