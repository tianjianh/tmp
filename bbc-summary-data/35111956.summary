Biju John, 44, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency in Harlow and was due to be sentenced in 2011 when he fled the UK.
The details emerged as John was struck off by a panel, which heard one of his victims felt "degraded and scared".
Essex Police said John was still wanted by officers.
John, then a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, took covert videos of women, without their knowledge, at The Harvey Centre in April 2011.
It is understood he used a bag containing a concealed camera.
One victim told police: "The incident has made me feel dirty and degraded. I feel like I can't wear a skirt anymore and I am going to be scared every time I see a man with a bag.
"I feel violated as if he has actually touched me inappropriately. At this moment in time I am very upset and shocked."
Chelmsford magistrates released John on bail to be sentenced in May 2011, by which time he had already left the UK.
The panel heard he then phoned his colleague Jeffrey Philips, a consultant in intensive care.
"He understood that Dr John had flown out on the day of the Royal wedding, which took place on 29 April 2011, in the belief that the airport would be quiet," the panel heard.
Police broke down the door of his rented flat in Dads Wood, Harlow, a week later and found food in the fridge that was weeks out of date.
Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service said it had served notice about its hearing to John's parents in India.
In reaching its decision, the panel said: "Public confidence in the medical profession would be seriously undermined if Dr John was not erased from the medical register after indicating a guilty plea to an offence related to his actions in filming beneath women's skirts, and then fleeing the country prior to sentencing.
It added: "Ms A [the victim] had been caused significant and understandable distress.
"In addition, it considered that the public would also regard Dr John's action in absconding before sentencing to be wholly reprehensible and unbecoming of a doctor.
An Essex Police spokeswoman said: "He is believed to have left the country and is currently wanted."
A hospital spokeswoman said: "Dr Biju John joined The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust as an anaesthetic registrar on 14 April 2009.
"Following his arrest on 10 April 2011 internal disciplinary proceedings were instigated and he was immediately excluded from duty."
