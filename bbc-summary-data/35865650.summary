The Bayern Munich coach has signed a three-year contract to succeed Manuel Pellegrini this summer.
Sunday's defeat by Manchester United has put City's top-four place in doubt, leading to discussion over whether Guardiola has an escape clause.
But BBC Sport has learned no break clause exists, so the 45-year-old Spaniard will join in July as planned.
Sunday's defeat means City are in the fourth and final Champions League qualifying slot, a point above West Ham and Manchester United.
All three teams have played 30 Premier League games.
Former Barcelona boss Guardiola has never coached in the Europa League.
