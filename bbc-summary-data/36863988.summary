The world number two recovered from a double bogey at the 14th to roll in a 12-foot eagle putt at sun-baked Glen Abbey Golf Club outside Toronto.
Fellow American Luke List, ranked 309th in the world, also reached six under, picking up a stroke at each par five.
Defending champion and world number one Jason Day also had an eagle in his 69.
Johnson, who finished tied ninth at last week's Open Championship at Royal Troon, said of the opening day at Glen Abbey: "Conditions were tough. The wind was blowing pretty hard and I felt like I played pretty well.
"I just made one bad swing, on 14. Other than that I thought I played really nicely all day long."
