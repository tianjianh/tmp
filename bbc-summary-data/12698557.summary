Kelly Jennings, whose father Harvey Jennings leads Derby City Council, said the government was slashing budgets in the wrong areas nationally and locally.
Ms Jennings, 26, a single mother who voted Conservative in the last general election, said cuts were hurting the most vulnerable people.
Mr Jennings was quoted as saying his daughter could make her own decisions.
The council recently approved budget cuts of almost Â£25m, that could result in 530 staff job losses.
This included the closure of six children's centres, reducing some adult support services and increasing charges for burials and parking.
At the same time the council is renovating its headquarters at the cost of Â£40m.
Ms Jennings said: "I voted for the Conservatives because I thought there was going to be more help for the NHS.
"Now they are cutting that off and locally they are cutting off the Sure Start centres which single parents like myself rely on."
She said her father "was a bit shocked from what I could tell but he was also pleasantly surprised and wished me well".
Derby City Council said it had done all it could to reduce the impact on front-line services.
