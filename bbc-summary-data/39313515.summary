[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sutton opened the scoring after 13 minutes when Kevin Amankwaah laid the ball back for Roarie Deacon to fire in.
Nine minutes later they were two up when Maxime Biamou headed down for Jamie Collins to volley in from 10 yards.
Biamou turned scorer 11 minutes later when he netted the third with a simple tap in after Cadogan had sent in a low cross to the far post.
North Ferriby pulled a goal back three minutes into the second half when Robbie Tinkler ran into the area, evading four defenders, before shooting into the far corner.
But any thoughts of a fightback were ended when Cadogan netted just after the hour, shooting through the goalkeeper's legs, before getting his side's fifth goal with seven minutes to go.
