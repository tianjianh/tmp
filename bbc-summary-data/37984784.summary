The 34-year-old right-hander played for the club in 2013 and has also featured for Middlesex and Sussex.
Bailey has scored more than 20,000 runs in a 12-year career.
"He made a lasting impression on us as a club in 2013 and we've spoken to him a number of times about coming back," director of cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent.
Bailey played the last of his five Tests in January 2014 but is a regular in Australia's one-day international team and may be involved in the 2017 Champions Trophy, which will be staged in England in June.
White continued: "How the first part of 2017 pans out in terms of availability depends on his Australian commitments, but there will be clear periods when he'll be with us for a significant amount of time over the next couple of years.
"There will be small chunks (of absence) along the way, but he's keen to play county cricket and make a difference in the next period of his career."
