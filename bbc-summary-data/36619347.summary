New osprey chicks at Loch Garten fitted with rings

Two osprey chicks at RSPB Scotland's Loch Garten Reserve, near Grantown on Spey, have been fitted with rings to help ornithologists to monitor them.

The pair, named Rowan and Willow by listeners of BBC Scotland's Out for the Weekend programme, hatched in May.
The young raptors are being raised by a female and male known as EJ and Odin. EJ returned to Loch Garten for her 14th season.
All four birds should migrate to West Africa later this year.
Rowan, the largest chick has the ring identification PP0 and Willow AF0.
