[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who described herself as "the Michelangelo of buttocks injections" has been convicted of the 2011 murder of a UK woman.

Padge-Victoria Windslowe, 45, illegally injected silicone into Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and university student.
The silicone eventually moved to her lungs, stopping her heart.
Windslowe was also convicted of assault and faces as much as 40 years in prison for the murder charge alone.
Prosecutors argued Windslowe travelled to hotel rooms and "pumping parties" to inject women's buttocks using syringes and instant glue to close the injection sites.
Aderotimi was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to celebrate her birthday with a friend. In 2012, the friend testified they went to meet the woman they knew as "Lillian"  for a "a touch-up".
Windslowe's defence lawyer said the former madam did not know about the risks of the procedure because she had only had satisfied clients.
"Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky," David Rudenstein said. "We know that now. But we didn't know that then."

These types of convictions are rare - the number of fatalities from backstreet buttocks injections is still low. But more people are opting for cheap, yet unregulated procedures in their quest for a bigger behind.
It can lead to horrific consequences. Some victims have been left maimed and disfigured after they put their trust in fake doctors who injected them with all kinds of substances including Krazy Glue, tyre sealant and silicone.
One FBI official told me last year that they're investigating more of these cases. But there are challenges when it comes to tackling this boom in black market cosmetic surgery.
Many people are too embarrassed to come forward when things go wrong - there's still a huge stigma when it comes to admitting you've had enhancement on your behind.
During closing arguments on Friday, a prosecutor described Aderotimi as "a regular girl" who had asked whether the injections could interfere with her ability to have children.
Windslowe misled Aderotimi, telling her she had medical training, prosecutors said.
Prosecutor Bridget Kirn argued when the 20-year-old began having chest pains after the injection, Windslowe "kept up that ruse'' of being a nurse and pretended to examine her.
A jury decided to find Windslowe guilty of third-degree murder, which is not premeditated but involves malice.
Aderotimi's death was one of several similar incidents, including a mother of three in Texas who was left by the roadside after she died in 2011 following an injection.
