Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn closed with a triple-bogey seven on the 18th to fall back to two over par, alongside Scotland's Catriona Matthew.
Chun, 22, told the Ladies European Tour: "Before the round I felt really nervous today and it was windy and there was a thunderstorm this morning, so I tried to focus more on my game.
"I could see the putting lines very well and I was so good rolling the ball on those lines."
