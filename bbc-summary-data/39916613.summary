Aberdeen set to receive bye into Europa League second qualifying round

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen are set to receive a bye into next season's Europa League qualifying round two after Feyenoord clinched the Dutch Eredivisie title.

All three of Scotland's Europa League entrants were due to begin their campaigns on 29 June.
However, this year's finalists Manchester United and Ajax cannot qualify for the Champions League group stage through their domestic leagues.
Scotland, 25th in the Uefa rankings, therefore will move up one place.
By climbing to 24th, one of Scotland's entrants will have an extra two weeks to prepare before entering the competition on 13 July.
Aberdeen are in pole position to seal that spot, with six points and a far superior goal difference separating them from third-placed Rangers in the Scottish Premiership, with just two games remaining.
The boost comes because Ajax have finished second in the Netherlands, therefore missing out on a Champions League group-stage spot to champions Feyenoord.
Likewise, Manchester United can no longer finish in the English Premier League's top four following a 2-1 loss on Sunday to Tottenham Hotspur.
With the winners of this year's Europa League gaining direct entry to next season's Champions League, this will open up a spot in the Europa League qualifiers no matter who wins the final at the Friends Arena in Sweden on 24 May.
Aberdeen's recent performances in the Europa League, where they have reached the third qualifying round three years in a row, also mean they are likely to be seeded when the draw is made for both the first and second qualifying rounds on 19 June.
Rangers and St Johnstone will also learn their Europa League opponents that day, while Celtic will find out who they will meet in the Champions League second qualifying round.
