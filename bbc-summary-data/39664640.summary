Highland League: Buckie Thistle avoid title-killing points penalty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland League title challengers Buckie Thistle have avoided a points deduction that would have cost them the chance to win the title on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Jags had been accused of listing an ineligible player by naming Callum Murray as a substitute in last week's game against Formartine United.
But the league's management committee decided no action would be taken against the club.
However, it also decided that its rules would be reworded.
Murray, who did not play in the 0-0 draw with Formartine, had recently been recalled from a loan spell with Highland League rivals Deveronvale to cover for injuries.
In season 1992-1993, Elgin City won the Highland League but were later stripped of the title after having been found to have fielded ineligible players.
Buckie are likely to win the championship if they beat bottom side Strathspey Thistle on Saturday.
The Jags and Cove Rangers are two points behind Brora Rangers, but the present leaders have played all of their games.
Buckie have a superior goal difference over Cove, who face 12th-placed Lossiemouth, going into the final game of the season.
The title winners will have a chance to win promotion to League Two of the Scottish Professional Football League.
Victors of the Highland and Lowland Leagues will meet in a play-off to decide who should face League Two's bottom club in the play-off final.
