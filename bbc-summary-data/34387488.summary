Asian shares fell sharply as fears over growth prospects and commodity prices continued to drive a global sell-off in equities.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index closed down 4.05% at 16,930.84.
The index hit an eight-month low ahead of the closely-watched Bank of Japan's Tankan quarterly business confidence survey, due on Thursday.
Japan's economy has struggled to pick up momentum after shrinking in the second quarter.
A weak survey of Chinese industrial profits, released on Monday, also added to investors' concerns about the world's second-largest economy.
Investors are looking ahead to manufacturing surveys on Thursday for more information on the extent of the slowdown in China.
The Shanghai Composite closed down 2% at 3,038.14.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 3% at 20,556.60 after being closed on Monday. The benchmark was dragged lower by Glencore shares which finished the day down nearly 30% following a similar drop in London on Monday.
Glencore's share price plunge in the UK and in Hong Kong came after a note from broker Investec which said that the firm's equity value could be wiped out if commodity prices remain at current levels.
Worries over prospects for the mining sector also sent Australian-listed shares of BHP Billiton down 6.4%, while Rio Tinto closed down 4.6%.
"Its [Glencore's] rumoured reverse takeover of Rio Tinto at the start of the year is now seen as extreme debt risk considering the state of its balance sheet today - a blessing in disguise that the deal wasn't done," said Evan Lucas, market strategist at trading firm IG in a note.
Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed down 3.8% at 4,918.40.
Markets in South Korea are closed for public holidays.
