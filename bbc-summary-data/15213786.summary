Rowan Atkinson says there will be 'no more' Mr Bean

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Actor Rowan Atkinson has told Newsbeat there won't be a new Mr Bean series because he doesn't want the character to "grow old".

The 56-year old said: "I've always regarded Mr Bean as an ageless, timeless figure.
"I don't want him to particularly grow old, and if I carry on playing him then he's going to get older, whether we like it or not.
"I would like to remember Mr Bean how he was five or 10 years ago."
The TV series came out in the 1980s and 1990s, with the final episode being screened in 2006.
Rowan Atkinson developed the Mr Bean character while studying at university.
The actor's latest film Johnny English Reborn is out in the UK now.
It's the sequel to his 2003 hit Johnny English in which he plays a spoof James Bond type character.
In the film Rowan Atkinson drives a fast car and carries out a few of the stunts.
"There is a sequence in Hong Kong where I had to step over a 25-storey building drop, but I said 'no' to that as I do have a problem with vertigo," he revealed.
"I'll do an occasional stunt, but the problem is the insurance people want you to turn up the next day and be OK to film."
