The baby's grandmother had been walking alongside the River Severn, near Victoria Street, in Shrewsbury when the carrier fell into the water.
West Mercia Police said three council workers nearby heard the woman scream and rushed to her aid.
Two jumped into the water and rescued the baby, who appeared unharmed, police said.
The girl was taken by ambulance to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, where she is being looked after.
Det Insp Paul Mathison praised the trio for their "quick thinking and brave actions" and said they averted a potential tragedy.
