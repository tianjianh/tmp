UK car production has hit a 14-year high for August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has said.

According to the trade body, 109,004 vehicles rolled off UK production lines last month, up 9.1% on the figure for August last year.
Demand rose at home and overseas following an increase in investment in UK car plants, the SMMT  said.
SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said it was "good news for car makers and welcome news for the UK economy".
"[The UK] depends on this thriving sector for an increasing share of UK exports," he said.
A number of surveys and data have suggested the UK's decision to leave the EU has had little impact on manufacturing so far, despite previous fears to the contrary.
However, a spokesperson for the SMMT said it was "too early to tell" whether Brexit was affecting the car industry.
The SMMT's latest figures showed demand from British consumers climbed 6.2% while export volumes were up 10.2%.
In total 1.1 million vehicles have made in Britain so far this year, a 12% increase on last year.
Mr Hawes said: "British car producers are exporting a diverse range of high quality, attractive new models that are in demand across the world.
"[This is] thanks to multi-billion pound investments made in UK plants over the past few years."
He said that future success for the industry depended on "continued investment in plant and products".
"That in turn depends on the UK maintaining internationally competitive business and trading conditions."
