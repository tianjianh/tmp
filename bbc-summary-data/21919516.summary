Aberdeen bus lane crackdown begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists who use bus lanes illegally are facing a crackdown in Aberdeen as the city council takes over enforcement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Digital cameras have been installed across the city to tackle what the council called a "growing problem".
New lining and signing is in place and existing road markings and signs have been refreshed.
The council was granted authority to carry out enforcement after submitting a business case to Scottish ministers.
It said 11 cameras had been installed on strategic routes in Aberdeen ahead of the enforcement launch on Monday.
During one day of testing - when only four cameras were being used - 1,200 offences were detected.
The council is allowing motorists a grace period and anyone caught flouting the rules in that time will receive a warning letter instead of a charge notice.
Repeat offenders, however, will be fined.
The penalty for motorists driving in bus lanes has been set at £60, reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days.
The only vehicles allowed to use the bus lanes are buses, taxis, private licensed hire vehicles and bicycles.
Emergency service vehicles can use them only when responding to an emergency.
