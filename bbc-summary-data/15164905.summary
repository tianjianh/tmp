Joe Henson, who founded the Rare Breeds Survival Trust in 1973, was made an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his services to conservation.
Mr Henson attended a Windsor Castle ceremony with his wife Gill, daughter Louise and son Adam - a farmer and television presenter.
The Henson family has also owned and run the Cotswold Farm Park since 1971.
Mr Henson said: "I'm delighted to receive recognition of the work that I've done to save our rare breeds, and thrilled that this continues to be born out through the work of The Cotswold Farm Park.
"I was particularly pleased that it was Princess Anne who gave it to me because she is very involved with rare breeds as well."
