[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Merseysiders suffered an early setback though as Connor Oliver's free-kick found defender Mark Gray, who headed the Grange Lane hosts into an early advantage.
Harris, however, levelled with a 20-yard strike following a clever lay-off from Andy Cook.
The midfielder's second came on the rebound after Jeff Hughes' penalty had been saved by Rory Watson just before the break.
In the second half, Cook took his season's tally to a creditable 20, courtesy of an excellent cross by his forward partner James Norwood.
Harris registered his third late on from substitute Adam Mekki's terrific run and pass.
