[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Catalans Dragons 22-26 Warrington Wolves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Wolves moved to the top of the Super League table thanks to a late victory over Catalans Dragons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Declan Patton and Kevin Penny went over to give Warrington a 12-0 lead, before Patton crossed for a second time.
Vincent Duport scored to get the hosts off the mark, while Richie Myler made it 18-12 on his return from injury.
Ben Garcia went over to claw Catalans back into the game and Tony Gigot kicked them ahead, but Ben Currie's late try won it for Warrington.
The result means Warrington go top of the table a week after their Challenge Cup final defeat by Hull FC, maintaining their hopes of reaching a maiden Super League title with three rounds left of the Super 8s to play.
Catalans' hopes of sealing a spot in the play-offs suffered a blow, as the late defeat left them six points off fourth-placed St Helens.
Myler, who had been out for several months with a groin problem, almost scored a second try to put Catalans out of sight with eight minutes to spare but it was ruled out after a long consultation with video referee Phil Bentham.
The Wire were missing six of the side that lost the Challenge Cup final, including England man Ben Westwood, Chris Sandow and Daryl Clark.
