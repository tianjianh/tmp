Daniel James Holdom, 41, did not apply for bail after his arrest in Cessnock, New South Wales on Wednesday.
Ms Pearce-Stevenson's remains were found in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, in August 2010.
Her daughter Khandalyce's remains were found in July, 1,100km (685 miles) away in a suitcase in South Australia.
Police told the media on Thursday morning that said they had pinpointed the date Karlie Pearce-Stevenson was murdered.
Ms Pearce-Stevenson was probably killed between the 14 and 15 December 2008, they said.
"We believe that Khandalyce was murdered at some point after Karlie but we are trying to establish the exact time," Detective Superintendent Mick Willing told reporters in Sydney.
DSI Wiling said he was unable to take questions from reporters because the case was due before the courts.
The pair were last seen in November 2008, when Ms Pearce-Stevenson was 20 and Khandalyce was aged two.
Khandalyce's remains were found five years after her mother's, on the side of the road near the South Australian town of Wynarka.
Local media say the accused was an acquaintance of Ms Pearce-Stevenson.
Detectives say they both suffered "violent and deliberate" deaths.
Their bodies will be laid to rest in their home town of Alice Springs.
On Tuesday authorities revealed that Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson's bank account had been accessed hundreds of times after she was killed.
Police also said an impersonator called her family, providing proof of life, and convinced them to deposit more money into her account.
Ms Pearce-Stevenson's mother withdrew a missing person's report in 2009 after she received fake text messages and at least one phone call.
NSW and South Australian police are jointly investigating the murders.
