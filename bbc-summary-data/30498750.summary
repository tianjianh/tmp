The beginning of the year saw crowds of young girls descending on Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium as One Direction's Louis Tomlinson made his debut appearance
Tomlinson, originally from Doncaster, took a side step from singing to play on the pitch in February, after joining the club on a non-contract basis.
His appearance attracted much excitement with teenage girls travelling from as far afield as Denmark, France and Italy.
Events took a tragic turn in March with the killing of Leeds school teacher Ann Maguire, who was stabbed in the back and neck by a pupil at Corpus Christi Catholic College.
Her death left the wider community in a state of shock, with those having been taught by the teacher describing her as inspirational.
Will Cornick, 16, was later given a life sentence for her murder and told by a judge he may never be released.
In the same month, engineering giant Siemens confirmed it was to build major wind turbine production and installation facilities on the banks of the Humber.
The company said it would invest Â£160m in Green Port Hull and in a new blade factory in Paull, East Yorkshire.
Up to 1,000 jobs are set to be created at the two sites making offshore turbines, to meet demand for large wind farms in the North Sea.
Staying in Hull, the city came close to celebrating an unlikely FA Cup Final victory against Arsenal on 17 May.
But the Tigers saw an early two-goal lead evaporate and it fell to Aaron Ramsey to break Hull hearts with a winning goal for the Gunners, in the 109th minute.
July saw the region play host to one of the world's largest sporting events with the much-anticipated arrival of the Tour De France.
More than three million people lined the route over the weekend, as riders took in some of the region's most famous sights and landmarks.
The Le Tour spirit was embraced by many. Yellow bicycles propped up in gardens were common sights and even sheep painted the in shirt colours of the race could be spotted in Harrogate.
Race director, Christian Prudhomme, praised Yorkshire's Grand Depart and said it was the "grandest" in the 111-year history of the race.
Rotherham was put under the spotlight in August with revelations of child abuse on a massive scale.
A report detailed the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 children between 1997 and 2013, mainly by gangs of men of Pakistani heritage.
The report's author, Professor Alexis Jay, said senior council managers had "underplayed" the scale and seriousness of the problem and police also failed to prioritise it.
It was the catalyst for a number of high profile resignations.
It was the turn of Yorkshire's cricketers to dominate the sporting headlines in September after clinching its first county cricket championship in 13 years.
Yorkshire bowled hosts Nottinghamshire out for 177, to win by an innings and 152 runs and confirm the 32nd championship in their history.
In the same month a fire badly damaged the former Majestyk nightclub in Leeds.
The roof partially collapsed but fire crews managed to save the Grade II listed building in City Square.
The premises were used as the home of the Majestyk nightclub but it has also served as a ballroom and bingo club.
October saw the death of a Leeds woman who was known as the British Annie Oakley.
Florence Campbell was a 1950s fairground performer, who worked as a sharpshooter and snake-charmer in her family's Wild West show.
The 82-year-old had earned quite a reputation in her younger days, for being capable of knocking a pipe from between someone's lips while bent backwards over a chair.
Doncaster was the scene of tragedy in  November with a crash between two cars, claiming the lives of five teenagers, four from the same school.
Danum Academy students Arpad Kore, 18, Jordanna Goodwin, 16 and Megan Storey, 16, and ex-pupil Bartosz Bortniczak, 18, all died in the collision at Conisbrough.
Blake Cairns, 16, the brother of Leeds United player Alex, also died.
Speaking at the time, head teacher Rebecca Staples said: "Whether it's staff or students, the pain is going to be colossal and nobody's going to understand why this happened to these wonderful young people."
In December, it was a baby pygmy goat who captured the hearts of many and became an internet sensation.
The story of little Benjamin attracted attention world wide, after Barnsley man Tom Horsfield decided to raise the animal after the kid's own mother was unable to wean him.
His owner said: "Fame hasn't really gone to his horns. He's taking it all in his stride."
The year ended on a sombre note with news that right-to-die campaigner Debbie Purdy, who won a landmark ruling to clarify the law on assisted suicide, had died.
The 51-year-old, from Bradford, had lived with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) for almost 20 years and had spent her last year in the city's Marie Curie Hospice. She died on 23 December.
Lord Falconer, the former lord chancellor, said Ms Purdy's role as a campaigner against the law on assisted suicide was "absolutely key" and she had transformed the debate.
