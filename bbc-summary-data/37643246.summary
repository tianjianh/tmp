[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man aged 67 jailed for 10 years for Aberdeen sex crimes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 67-year-old man who carried out a catalogue of abuse against children in Aberdeen has been jailed for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Copland was convicted of rape and lewd and libidinous behaviour.
He had a previous sexual offence conviction from the 1960s.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Beckett told Copland his crimes had a "profound effect" on his victims and it was an "appalling course of criminal conduct" which had to be marked with a substantial sentence.
The offences were said to have happened over nearly 30 years, ending in the early 1990s, involving girls and boys.
The judge added: "You sexually abused children - for the most part, you were in a position of trust.
"Two were exceptionally vulnerable children. What you did has had profound and lasting effects.
"The gravity of the crimes means they have to be marked by a substantial custodial sentence."
