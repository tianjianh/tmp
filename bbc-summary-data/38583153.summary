Wing Seymour, 28, has agreed a new deal until May 2019 while lock Swinson, 29, is now contracted until May 2020.
Both made their Scotland debuts in 2013 and have 56 senior international caps between them.
Fellow internationals Stuart Hogg and Henry Pyrgos have already signed new deals with Glasgow, as has former Scotland sevens player Adam Ashe.
"This is my second three-year contract with the Warriors and I've signed for that length of time because it's a great club to be at and there is a good buzz around the place," Swinson, who joined from Newcastle Falcons in 2013, told the Warriors' website.
"With other guys signing new contracts it's good to know that the guys you get on well with on and off the pitch are going to be here."
New Zealander Dave Rennie will replace Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend in the summer, with the latter taking on the Scotland head coach job.
"It's great news that Tommy and Tim want to stay and continue their careers in Glasgow," said Townsend.
"They both work really hard to continually improve and have become important members of the squad over the last few years.
"They care a lot about the club and make big contributions both on and off the pitch."
Seymour started his professional career with Ulster, joining Glasgow in 2011. And, like Swinson, he helped Warriors win the Pro12 in 2015.
"The club has really built a big name for itself since I've been here and it's something I'm keen to remain a part of," he said.
"With the change of coaching staff next season it offers an exciting opportunity to carry on that development and really continue growing with the club.
"Dave Rennie is regarded as one of the best coaches in the world and we're all really looking forward to working with him next season."
