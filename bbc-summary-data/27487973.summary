The 44-year-old, who left Siena to replace Luigi Delneri in May 2011, led Juventus to their third successive Serie A title this term.
In winning their latest title, the Turin-based club achieved a record points haul of 102.
There had been doubts over Conte's future but Juventus tweeted: "Season 2014/15: manager Antonio Conte."
The former Juventus player led the club to their 30th league title with two games to spare, but in recent weeks had been linked with a move away from Serie A.
Newspaper reports suggested he would move to French league side Monaco, but it appears he will stay in Italy.
Juve made it to the Champions League quarter-finals in 2012-13, when they were eliminated by eventual champions Bayern Munich, but failed to get past the group stages this season.
