[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves scored twice in the last four minutes as they came from behind to beat Brentford and move four points clear of the relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full-back Maxime Colin fired low into the corner to give the Bees an half-time lead against the run of play.
Nouha Dicko hit the bar and Lee Evans had a shot blocked on the line for Wolves before Matt Doherty levelled.
The visitors continued to dominate and Ivan Cavaleiro crossed for Helder Costa to volley in a deserved winner.
Wolves are now 18th in the Championship, having picked up seven points from their past three games, and sit just five points behind their opponents.
Frenchman Colin showed the composure of a striker to slot home his fourth goal of the season from Konstantin Kerschbaumer's flick, but the defeat for Dean Smith's side was their second at home in the space of four days.
Ex-Benfica forward Costa ended an eight-game drought to snatch the points after Doherty had converted Ben Marshall's fine cross.
Brentford have kept just one clean sheet from their 13 league games in 2017, while Paul Lambert's Wolves side now have three teams between them and the bottom three.
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"That was certainly the worst performance at Griffin Park in my time here. I don't even think we had a first gear and Wolves were better from start to finish.
"Today we were out-battled. They won every loose ball, won the second balls and I don't think we won a header all game. Normally we out-football sides but we couldn't pass water.
"If you get beaten by a side that outmanoeuvres you, you can take it, but they had more desire."
Wolves boss Paul Lambert told BBC WM 95.6:
"Even at 1-0, I didn't think we should have been down, the lads were excellent. There was no problem for me.
"I never felt severe stress or pressure at all, even though we were a goal down, because we were creating.
"It was just a matter of time before we got one. In the second half, we looked great."
