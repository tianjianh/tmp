[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ambulance worker 'put his colleague's hand on his crotch'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ambulance technician put his colleague's hand on his crotch while she was driving a pregnant woman to hospital, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lee, 31, and the woman were transporting the patient from Aberdeen to Kirkcaldy when the incident happened, a trial was told.
Mr Lee denies 15 charges involving several people.
He has lodged a special defence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court claiming all activity was consensual.
The female worker, who cannot be named, said: "He took my hand off the gearstick and put it onto his crotch.
"I said 'stop it, I'm driving at 60mph down a dual carriageway with a pregnant woman and a midwife in the back'.
"He giggled and asked if I was being moody."
The woman also claimed that the accused exposed himself to her in the back of the ambulance.
Under cross examination by defence advocate David Moggach, the female witness denied she had willingly slept with Mr Lee after a night out.
She said: "I did not sleep with that man, to my knowledge.
"There were three other people staying at my flat that night.
"I was very drunk so I went to bed."
Mr Lee is alleged to have acted in a culpable and reckless manner towards women when they were behind the wheel of an ambulance.
The court heard Mr Lee had been working with the Scottish Ambulance Service, based in Aberdeen, for some time before the women joined the service.
At the time of the alleged offences - between 2013 and 2015 - he was a fully qualified ambulance technician and was training to be a paramedic.
The trial, before Sheriff Graeme Napier, continues.
