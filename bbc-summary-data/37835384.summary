An Edinburgh pub which went viral after it gave German football team Borussia Monchengladbach a new title has updated its signage ahead of the latest match.

Tiles Bar gave up trying to spell the club's name and instead went for "A German Team" on a sandwich board advertising the Champions League clash against Celtic a fortnight ago.
The German team changed their English language Twitter handle to match.
The bar now has a sign saying: "A German Team v A Glasgow Team".
Borussia Monchengladbach face Celtic in Germany on Tuesday evening in their second Champions League meeting. The Germans won the first game in Glasgow 2-0.
Ahead of the match, Gladbach fans were so desperate to get hold of merchandise referring to their club as A German Team that 2,000 scarves sporting the branding sold out within two days.
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland Radio programme, the man who wrote the sign, assistant manager of Tiles Bar, Brian Pickering, said: "It's been crazy. It just exploded. It snowballed so quickly.
"A lot of the local newspapers seemed to pick it up, then it got on to the TV stations, Match of the Day and CNN. It's just incredible."
He added: "The team took it in great spirit. We had a bit of a joke about it on Twitter."
Borussia Monchengladbach also used "a German Team" on their teamsheet on social media.
The club's head of corporate communications, Markus Aretz, told BBC Radio Scotland scarves were in such demand the team ordered another 2,000 to sell ahead of the latest fixture.
He said: "When we came back from Glasgow everyone was so enthusiastic about our travel to Glasgow. All the supporters were happy with the result, of course, but also happy with the way they were welcomed in Glasgow and Scotland.
"We thought about doing something for the match when they come to play here so we produced the scarves and within two days they were sold out."
He said he knew lots of people struggled to pronounce the side's name but that they liked to see the "funny" side of it.
Mr Pickering said the fuss over the sign had been attracting German fans to the Edinburgh pub.
He added: "We've shown the last three Monchengladbach games in the pub and it seems to be that some of the Germans in town make their way here to watch the game. It's been a great response."
