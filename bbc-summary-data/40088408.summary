Wigan Athletic are set to appoint Portsmouth boss Paul Cook as their new manager, reports BBC Radio Solent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pompey offered Cook a lucrative new contract to remain at Fratton Park but, after heading abroad for talks at the weekend, he is set to rejoin the club he had two spells with as a player.
The 50-year-old's move is likely to be completed on Tuesday.
The League Two champions are entitled to compensation although it is not thought that will take long to resolve.
Cook has one year remaining on his existing deal with Portsmouth.
Meanwhile, interim manager Graham Barrow has left Wigan following their relegation to League One.
The Latics finished 23rd in the Championship, having parted company with former boss Warren Joyce in March.
Barrow took over as caretaker for the third time at the club, but he and three of his staff have now left.
He was previously manager of Chester, Rochdale and Bury before returning to Wigan as a coach in 2009.
Wigan chairman David Sharpe told the club website: "Graham has spent a large part of his professional career with Wigan Athletic over three spells, and has been with us during the highs and lows of the past eight years.
"Graham has been a great servant to the club as a player, a manager and a coach and on behalf of everyone at Wigan Athletic, we wish him all the very best for the future."
Head of medical Mick Rathbone, interim first team coach John Doolan and first-team fitness coach Jimmy Barrow have also departed.
