[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 1-1 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead were held for a third time in four National League matches after Danny Rowe's goal helped Macclesfield leave the north-east with a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tynesiders went ahead with the first real chance of the match as Mitch Brundle's floated free-kick allowed an unmarked Danny Johnson to hammer home.
Macclesfield nearly drew level almost immediately as Rowe's deflected strike went inches past the post but the midfielder would not be denied again, heading home from Jack Mackreth's cross.
John McCombe and Danny Whitaker cleared efforts off the line to keep the Silkmen level, while Gateshead midfielder Wesley York was twice denied by goalkeeper Craig Ross after the interval.
Ross again came to the rescue for the visitors, using his feet to keep out Brundle's attempt as Gateshead were forced to settle for a draw as they stretched their unbeaten league run to nine matches.
