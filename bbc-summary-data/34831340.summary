Donegal crash: Shaun Kelly given 'unduly lenient' sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Donegal man, who killed eight men in a car crash, was given an "unduly lenient" four-year sentence, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Kelly, 27, of Hill Road, Ballymagan, Buncrana, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on 11 July 2010, at Letterkenny Circuit Criminal Court.
The crash at Meenaduff, between Buncrana and Clonmany was Ireland's worst ever road accident.
Eight men, aged between 19 and 66, were killed.
Kelly was the driver of the black Volkswagen Passat with seven other men when it collided with another car.
Kelly was sentenced to four years imprisonment with the final two suspended last December.
He was also disqualified from driving for ten years.
In October, the Director of Public Prosecutions sought a review of Kelly's sentence saying it was "unduly lenient".
Counsel for the DPP, told the Court of Appeal in Dublin that it was the worst fatal collision and the worst case of dangerous driving in the history of the state.
She said the sentence did not reflect the gravity of Kelly's culpability and the harm that was actually caused.
Acceding to the application on Monday, the Court of Appeal found Kelly's sentence was "unduly lenient".
Mr Justice George Birmingham said there were factors present in the case which "justified, indeed required" a sentence of lower than seven years.
However, he said the Circuit Court judge had erred in the "double discount" of mitigating the sentence from seven to four and suspending the final two years.
He said the sentence represented a "substantial departure" from what would be appropriate.
He said Kelly was entitled to know "his fate" and the court hoped to be in a position to impose a new sentence on him on 7 December.
