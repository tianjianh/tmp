Trump beat his fellow Englishman 5-4 and goes on to face Scotland's 77th-ranked Scott Donaldson, who beat Zhou Yuelong of China 5-0.
Hawkins had fought back from 3-1 down to lead 4-3, before Trump clinched the last two frames for victory.
Stuart Bingham will face Robert Milkins in Saturday's other semi-final.
World number two Bingham was 4-0 up on fellow Englishman Stuart Carrington in their quarter-final before the latter won three consecutive frames.
However, Bingham recovered to clinch the match 5-3 and will play Milkins on Saturday evening after the world number 32 saw off Kurt Maflin 5-2.
Hawkins, leading by 24 points in the deciding frame, missed match-ball yellow against Trump that would have secured a semi-final spot.
Trump continues the hunt for his first Welsh Open crown and second ranking title of the season, having won the European Masters in October.
"I am still in a bit of shock because I thought it was all over when I left him the yellow," he said. "He seemed to hit it well, but somehow it stayed out.
"Sometimes you play well and lose and today I didn't play very well and managed to get through. There is a lot of skill in snooker, but you need a bit of luck."
Donaldson, 22, who will play Trump in Saturday afternoon's semi-final, had never previously been beyond the last 16 of a ranking event.
He is already guaranteed Â£20,000 - the biggest pay day of his career.
"I have been playing a lot of TV matches recently and I think that helped me," said the Scot, who turned pro in 2012.
"I have been pleased for about a year now with my game, I can't pinpoint why, maybe it's confidence.
"I will go back to the hotel and calm myself down and get ready for the next match."
