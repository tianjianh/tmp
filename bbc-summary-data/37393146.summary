Stevenage 0-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter climbed out of League Two's bottom three after a 2-0 win at Stevenage despite being reduced to 10 men midway through the first half.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skipper Jordan Moore-Taylor saw red in the 24th minute but two strikes in as many second-half minutes from Lee Holmes and Ollie Watkins earned a surprise victory.
Exeter edged the opening exchanges and nearly took an 11th-minute lead as sloppy defending set up Robbie Simpson, who had his shot hooked off the line by Fraser Franks.
However, Moore-Taylor's desperate tug back on Tom Pett as the midfielder ran in on goal, prompting his sending off, looked to have pushed momentum with Stevenage.
The hosts kept control of possession but struggled to make the breakthrough as the Grecians sat back, with Tyler Walker's shot going into the side netting proving to be as close as they came.
They were made to pay with 20 minutes left as Stevenage's defence fell asleep and Holmes nipped in to score. With the hosts still dazed by this sucker punch, Exeter quickly doubled the lead as a fine passing move carved open 'Boro and allowed Watkins to fire home.
Stevenage hunted for an answer, but were not able to test Bobby Olejnik out as several headers failed to hit the target.
