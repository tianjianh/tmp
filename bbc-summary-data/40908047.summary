[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County stunned Coventry City to secure their first win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On their first ever visit to the Ricoh Arena, a second half goal from on-loan Brentford midfielder Reece Cole proved enough for Mike Flynn's side.
Cole's speculative effort was spilled by Coventry goalkeeper Liam O'Brien as the hosts conceded for the first time this season after successive wins.
Tony Andreu and Jodi Jones came close for the hosts, but they found visiting goalkeeper Joe Day in top form.
Newport County manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales:
"I am delighted, it was a great team performance.
"It has been an eventful week for me because my wife gave birth and this has kept the smile on my face.
"It is a beautiful stadium to come to and we are going in the right direction. We have competition in all positions in our squad."
