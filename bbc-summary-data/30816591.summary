The Doonhamers finished fourth in the league and reached the promotion play-offs.
The figure will be reported to the club's annual general meeting next month.
The 2013/14 season was the second in a row in which the Palmerston Park club operated in the black after major restructuring.
The club's financial statement for the year to the end of May last year says it was a largely successful season with the creation of the new Scottish Professional Football League benefiting clubs like Queens in the second tier.
The club made £1.28m from football operations including gate money, season tickets, grants and  TV income.
As well as performing well on the pitch, the club extended the capacity of Palmerston Park, laid the artificial pitch and began conversion work on the indoor arena.
Hire income for the outdoor and indoor facilities was more than £50,000 even though the arena had been open for only five months of the accounting period.
The accounts show the club's property has a book value of £1.15m and net assets are put at £718,000.
The financial report will be submitted to Queens AGM on 9 February.
