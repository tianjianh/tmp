There are seven warnings and several alerts in place across the country, said Natural Resources Wales.
A bridge to the village of Llechryd, Ceredigion, has been submerged in water, preventing motorists from travelling across it.
Firefighters attended five properties in Tremadog, Gwynedd, which had 7in (18cm) of water inside.
The fire service said it was called to incidents on Sunday morning, with pumps used to tackle flood water in homes.
Meanwhile a Met Office "be aware" alert for rain in south and mid Wales on Sunday has been lifted.
Forecasters had predicted up to 3in (80mm) of rain in some areas over 24 hours and said disruption was possible.
