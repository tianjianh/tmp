Teddy McDermott - known as the Songaminute Man - helped raise £130,000 for charity after son Simon recorded videos of the pair singing in the car.
Dean Ovel, who built and ran on a human-size hamster wheel in aid of dementia, was also recognised by the awards from website JustGiving.
Lyla Brown was named Young Fundraiser, after raising money for Water Aid.
She raised nearly £1,700 having asked for donations to the charity instead of presents for her fifth birthday.
She had been saddened by the number of children in developing countries with no access to clean drinking water and asked her mother for buckets of water.
They were some of the winners picked by 110,000 votes from 14,000 charity fundraising nominees.
Mr McDermott is a former Butlin's Redcoat, who spent decades travelling the country singing in clubs.
He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2013.
His son's video of them singing Quando, Quando, Quando in the car as they drove around Blackburn, Lancashire, has been viewed two million times.
Simon began an appeal in June, with the aim of raising £1,000 for the Alzheimer's Society, and it snowballed.
He said:  "Dad could become violent as the Alzheimer's kicked in, but singing seemed to help. Some days he might not remember me properly but he can still remember songs."
His father is dubbed the "Songaminute Man" because he knows thousands of songs by heart, with Frank Sinatra among his favourites.
He "can't grasp" the enormity of the support from across the world, his son said, but "gets more excited about having some fans in Birmingham where he's from".
Natalia Spencer, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, won the Endurance Fundraiser of the year.
She walked 6,000 miles around the English coastline in aid of the hospital which cared for her daughter Elizabeth.
Elizabeth died last year, aged five, after contracting a rare autoimmune condition, and her mother had fond memories of taking her to the seaside.
Also honoured was Nicole Sedgebeer, a 21-year-old from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who won a Life Changer award.
She raised £13,143 to help mark Mark, a homeless man who sleeps rough in London, get back on his feet.
He helped Ms Sedgebeer when she missed her last train home after a night out, directing her to an all-night cafe, and making sure she made it safely to the first train in the morning.
Where radio fiction met reality, Paul Trueman, a fan of The Archers, raised £171,000 for domestic abuse victims.
The 41-year-old was inspired to raise money for Refuge by the Radio 4 soap's story of Helen Titchener, a character who fled her abusive husband.
Earlier this year she was tried, and cleared, of the attempted murder of Rob.
"The tale gripped me," he said. "Very quickly people began donating and even sharing their own stories of abuse."
Mr Trueman, who works in marketing, has now been appointed trustee for a domestic abuse charity in his home county of Devon.
"It's changed the way I see the world, probably for the sadder," he said.
His efforts were named alongside Dean Ovel's 24 hours spent running on a giant hamster wheel in aid of Southend Hospital Charity's Dementia Appeal.
Mr Ovel raised nearly £8,000 by building a human-sized wheel in his garden and then moving it to his local high street, to run in front of shoppers for a day.
Zarine Kharas, JustGiving's founder, who has run the awards for seven years, said: "More of us give to complete strangers than ever before, because we have been moved by their stories."
