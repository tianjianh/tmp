Wyness retweeted a video of Villa being denied a penalty with a caption asking if referees had "disabilities".
He admitted a Football Association charge that the comment was "abusive and/or insulting and/or improper".
The 59-year-old has also been fined Â£10,000 for what the FA deemed was an "aggravated breach" of its rules.
Wyness deleted the tweet following the 1-1 draw with Brighton on 7 May and told the Birmingham Mail he was "both surprised and disappointed at the severity of the punishment" for what he described as an "honest mistake".
