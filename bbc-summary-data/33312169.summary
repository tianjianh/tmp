Kennington Park Road, in Oval, is closed between Kennington Oval and Kennington Station after a water main burst.
Thames Water apologised for inconvenience caused and said engineers had stopped the water flow and the flood was subsiding.
London Fire Brigade said the water reached 0.5m (1.6ft) deep and several basements in the area were flooded.
Thames Water said some homes in the area had no water supply.
The Southbank Centre tweeted that it was closing temporarily due to problems with its water supply.
In a statement, Thames Water said: "Our engineers have successfully stopped the flow of water and the flooding is subsiding.
"Our focus right now is to work as fast as we can to help customers affected by flooding, assess the damage to the pipe, and return water supplies in the area back to normal."
Ten fire engines and more than 70 firefighters were called to reports of flooding at about 09:10 BST.
The brigade used pumps to remove water from flooded properties.
Transport for London tweeted that a number of buses were being diverted.
