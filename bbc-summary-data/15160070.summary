The 25-year-old New Zealander's award came on the same day that he was called up by England, having qualified on residential grounds.
Chase is only the second Cas player to win the award, following Aussie loose forward Adrian Vowles in 1999.
St Helens scrum-half Jonny Lomax was named Young Player of the Year, while Catalan Dragons' Trent Robinson is Super League Coach of the Year.
The Catalans had double cause for celebration as they were also named club of the year.
While Robinson, in his first season in the job, has transformed them from wooden spoonists to play-off contenders, the club award recognises the investment they have made in facilities at their Stade Gilbert Brutus home in Perpignan, their increased attendance and strong business model.

Leeds president Harry Jepson was presented with the Mike Gregory spirit of rugby league award in recognition of his life-long involvement in the sport and Hull KR forward Jason Netherton was named community champion for his work with youth and schools groups.
Veteran duo Sean Long and Rob Purdham were presented with awards to mark their long service to Super League after their recent retirements.
And the selection of 21-year-old scrum-half Lomax as young player of the year ahead of team-mate Jamie Foster and Wigan winger Josh Charnley is reward for a season in which he has come of age in the Saints first team, getting promoted to England's elite training squad by England coach Steve McNamara earlier this year.
But it was Chase's night, as he collected the sport's most coveted individual honour at a gala presentation dinner at The Hilton Hotel, Manchester.
Chase secured the award, decided by a secret ballot of all Super League players, ahead of Wigan full-back Sam Tomkins and St Helens hooker James Roby.
His selection as Super League's player of the year for 2011 is even more impressive because he plays for such an unfashionable team.
The artful stand-off did help his team reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals, in which they lost narrowly to Leeds, but Cas did not even make the top eight in Super League XVI, after a late season slump which caused them to miss the play-offs.
Former Man of Steel Vowles told BBC Radio Leeds: "He's been outstanding, and the difference between those two other boys [Tomkins and Roby] is that they're in a lot a stronger sides than Castleford.
"The Cas side is quite young and Rangi has stood out and led them during the year. I think Danny Orr has been a huge help for him and organised things while Rangi can do his stuff, which he's done well."
Having joined Cas from Australian club St George Illawarra in 2008, he last week committed his future to Wheldon Road by signing a new contract that will keep him with the Tigers until the end of 2015.
He now qualifies to play for England under the residency ruling, having lived and worked in the UK for the last three years.
