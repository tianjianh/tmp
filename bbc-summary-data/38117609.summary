Ferensway closure: Major Hull road shuts for three days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Hull city centre's major roads has closed for three days for improvements to be carried out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferensway will be shut in both directions from Sunday to Tuesday, with people encouraged by the city council to use public transport.
Traffic lights and crossings are being installed between the Anlaby Road and Spencer Street junctions.
Diversions are in place, with drivers advised to allow more time for their journeys, particularly at peak times.
A free park and ride service will be operating, with all bus companies continuing to run full services.
On Sunday morning, bus company East Yorkshire Motor Services said access to the Paragon Interchange for buses was being blocked by "many motorists ignoring the signs".
Councillor Martin Mancey, portfolio holder for highways and transport at Hull City Council, said: "A full road closure is never ideal, however this complex reconfiguration of the Ferensway system cannot be completed with just a partial road closure."
