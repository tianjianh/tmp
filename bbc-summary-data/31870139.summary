The city council said 10 stands that were used near Commonwealth Game venues last year would now become permanent, bringing the city-wide total to 41.
The new stands will be sited mainly in the east and south of the city.
From its launch on 24 June 2014 until 1 March this year, there were 48,594 bike rentals with 6,522 registrations to use the scheme, which is run by Nextbike.
Monitoring of usage showed that the most popular cycle station has been Glasgow Green, closely followed by Broomielaw and Glasgow University.
The data also showed a high usage rate from Monday to Friday with a consistent drop off at weekends, suggesting the bikes are being used for commuting.
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "The fact that we are fast approaching 50,000 hires since its launch in nine months is fantastic.
"People of Glasgow and surrounding areas have clearly taken this scheme to their hearts from the extremely positive feedback and numerous requests we have received to provide more stations around the city.
"Two of our (Commonwealth Games) legacy aims were to make the city more sustainable and accessible and this scheme fits the bill."
