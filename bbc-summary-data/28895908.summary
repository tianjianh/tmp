Consultation over M54-M6 motorway link

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new link road between the M54 and the M6 motorways are to go out to formal consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Highways Agency has published four possible routes that would allow the M54 to directly join the M6 northbound for the first time.
The designs suggest either a remodelling of the existing junction 10A of the M6 or a new road to join junction 11.
Consultation will begin this month, the Highways Agency said.
Talks are set to start with MPs and local authorities in the area, while public exhibitions are expected to take place later in the year.
The proposals first gained government support in 2003 and last year it announced plans to fund the scheme subject to contributions from developers.
Mark Prichard, Conservative MP for The Wrekin, said it would cost "hundreds of millions of pounds", but would bring "long-term prosperity" as well as improved access to areas along the M54.
Local authorities in the area have increased their calls for links northbound to the M6, with the building of the i54 business park and Jaguar Land Rover's new Â£350m plant off the M54 motorway.
