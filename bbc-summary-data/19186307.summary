Jones' feat means Wales have equalled their 2008 Beijing tally of three golds with sailor Hannah Mills and boxer Fred Evans still in the hunt for gold.
Jones, 19, joined rower Tom James and cyclist Geraint Thomas on top of a 2012 Olympic podium.
She beat top seed Li-Cheng Tseng of Chinese Taipai in the semi-finals.
Earlier Jones beat Japan's Mayu Hamada in the quarter-finals and Serbia's Dragana Gladovic on her Olympic debut.
In the process Jones became only the third Welsh woman to win Olympic gold following 4x100m swimmer Irene Steer at the 2012 Stockholm Games and road cyclist Nicole Cooke in Beijing in 2008.
Sport Wales chair Laura McAllister paid tribute to Flint-bred Jones, who won Team GB's 25th gold, saying: "We are immensely proud of Jade Jones.
"To not only reach the Olympic final, but to win the gold medal at her first Games, and at just 19-years-old is just the most phenomenal achievement.
"We often talk about using role models to inspire the next generation of athletes and to encourage young people to participate in sport and what better way to inspire the young women of Wales, than to see one of their own, a young girl from Flint, standing on the top tier of the podium at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
"Wales are now guaranteed to bring home six medals from these Olympic Games, surpassing the unprecedented medal tally from Beijing four years ago and equalling the gold medal tally of three.
"And with the colour of Hannah Mills and Fred Evans' medals yet to be decided, we could be in for more golden success."
Jones, a silver medallist at the World Championships in 2011, recently gave an insight into her ambitions and preparations in her BBC column for this competition, including a diet heavy on pasta and jelly.
Rhythmic gymnast Frankie Jones has also made her Olympic debut.
Frankie Jones, who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, is competing in the women's individual all-around.
The 21-year-old finished the opening day 21st out of 24 competitors as Russia's Daria Dmitrieva led the field.
Dai Greene and Rhys Williams were not selected to run in the British quartet for the heats of the 4x400m relay during the morning session at the Olympic Stadium.
