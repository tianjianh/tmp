Cat's leg amputated after getting caught in illegal trap

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat had its leg amputated after getting caught in an illegal gin trap.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cat, which is not microchipped, was found with the trap attached to its leg in a field at Bowdens Lane, Penhow, near Newport, on 9 June.
Gin traps, which have been illegal to use since 1958, were designed to catch animals using spring-operated jaws with a serrated edge.
The cat was taken to a veterinary surgery where its leg was amputated and the RSPCA is trying to trace her owner.
RSPCA Insp Gemma Black said: "It was horrendous - she is only a young cat. She would have been in so much pain. It was lucky someone found her."
