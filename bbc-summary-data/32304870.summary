The club wants to move to the Silver Bow site on the outskirts of the city to allow their current Treyew Road ground to be turned into a retail park.
Proposals for the retail park at Treyew Road were deferred last month, but the club hopes the Strategic Planning Committee will consider both developments when they meet in May.
Plans for Cornish Pirates' new stadium
However, the Stadium for Cornwall has been put in jeopardy after plans to build a supermarket as part of the development were  while two other supermarket schemes got the go-ahead.
"This application is all part of our plan to provide a freehold ground for the club, with facilities capable of accommodating Truro City FC in its quest for promotion up the leagues," Philip King, from developers Helical Retail, said.
In February, Truro chairman Peter Masters told the BBC he would be happy to  an offer the Championship rugby club have declined.
"This is yet another milestone in our journey to put the club back on a secure footing and to play football in Truro at the highest achievable level," Masters said in a statement.
"We are in the process of agreeing the detailed specification with Helical Retail so that Truro City, along with the FA and Sport England, can approve the scheme.
"However our preferred option is for this to be a Grade A ground with a grass playing surface at this time to comply with the Conference League requirements should we achieve promotion this season."
