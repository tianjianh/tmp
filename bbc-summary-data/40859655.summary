A man in his 40s has died during an attempt to swim the English Channel as part of a gruelling triathlon.

Douglas Waymark, from Cheltenham, got into difficulty about half way across, 12 nautical miles from Dover.
The coastguard received a radio call from a support vessel at about 21:20 BST on Monday.
A search and rescue helicopter arrived within 10 minutes and airlifted the swimmer to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, but he later died.
The endurance athlete had been taking part in the arch to arc triathlon.
The challenge aims to connects London and Paris by running, swimming and cycling.
It starts with an 87 mile run from London's Marble Arch to Dover.
Then the athletes must swim across the English Channel to the French coast.
Finally they finish with a 181-mile bike ride from Calais to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
The Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation facilitated the swim.
Secretary Kevin Murphy said: "He was a supreme athlete. He was pushing himself to the absolute limits.
"He knew that, he knew the dangers, but he was doing what he absolutely loved."
Mr Murphy, who has swum the channel 34 times, said everything was done to mitigate the risks.
"My understanding is that he was speaking to the people on the boat and then suddenly rolled over, inert in the water, and was pulled out. Everything possible was then done to try and revive him.
"It happened suddenly, there was no opportunity to persuade him to come out of the water."
Mr Waymark's sister, Jo Ikel, posted a tribute to him on Facebook saying: "For all those following the recent updates, Douglas Waymark has not completed his Channel swim.
"Last night he felt he could no longer continue his quest and swam to the boat supporting him. He passed out and was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Ashford. At around midnight, he sadly died.
"We are all devastated but take comfort in him doing what he loved best to the very end."
Mr Waymark was taking part in the Enduroman Arch 2 Arc challenge, a continuous triathlon from Marble Arch in London to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
It involves an 87-mile run to Dover, swimming the channel and cycling 182 miles to the French capital.
Mr Waymark had been roughly half way through his crossing attempt when, according to Kent Police, he "became unwell".
He set off from Shakespeare beach at 07:27 BST but began to struggle later in the day.
Updating followers on Mr Waymark's progress throughout, Enduroman tweeted he was given painkillers around 17:00 BST. Swimming across the tide, he missed a feed and Enduroman said "he doubts but pushes on".
The last word on his progress came at 20:30 BST, saying he was swimming on through cooling temperatures and fading light.
Mr Waymark's tracker regularly posted his position online and the last data visible between 21:09 and 21:38 BST showed he had turned around and was heading back towards Dover.
Enduroman has not yet responded to a request for comment.
Kent Police confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious.
