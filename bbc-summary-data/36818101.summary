[SN]TITLE[SN]
Women's Super League One: Chelsea Ladies 4-0 Doncaster Rovers Belles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eniola Aluko scored twice against Women's Super League One bottom side Doncaster to help Chelsea end a three-game winless run in all competitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aluko met a Beth England pass to put last season's double winners ahead at half-time with a curled finish.
Ji So-Yun turned home Ana Borges' cross for Chelsea's second before Aluko made it 3-0 by shooting in off the post.
England completed the win from close range, consigning Doncaster to their second successive 4-0 defeat.
The loss leaves the Belles without a point from six games in Women's Super League One.
Although they are five points adrift of nearest rivals Reading, Doncaster have played as many as five games fewer than some other top-flight clubs.
Chelsea Ladies forward Beth England: "I've been here six months now and things are starting to gel a little bit. So hopefully we can continue this run and keep scoring goals.
"All week in training we've been doing a lot of pairings, so trying to find what works and what system is best for us.
"It's just about getting the goals and Gemma (Davison) coming on obviously had a massive impact for us."
Doncaster Rovers Belles manager Emma Coates: "They're last year's double champions, we're newly promoted and we're competing.
"The good news is we're competing for longer periods of time, now we've got to sustain it for 90 minutes."
