Wind-curbing work starts at the site of Yorkshire's tallest building

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has begun to curb the effects of strong winds around Yorkshire's tallest building.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
High winds around Bridgewater Place in Leeds were blamed for the death of Dr Edward Slaney, who was killed when a lorry blew over in March 2011.
About 100 yards (90m) of Water Lane at the foot of the skyscraper is to be closed until May.
The closure is to allow engineers to construct baffles that deflect strong gusts away from street level.

When there are high winds roads are closed near the 32-storey skyscraper as a safety measure.
Contractors for CPPI Bridgewater Place, the building's owners, are to erect three sail-like structures across Water Lane as well as screens and canopies.
The large screens and baffle boards will be up to 50ft (17m) high and 66ft (20m) long.
A letter has been sent to about 800 residents and businesses about a diversion for the closed road.
Lendlease, the construction company that built the building, is to manage the plans approved by Leeds City Council in November 2014.
The scheme is expected to take 16 months to complete.
