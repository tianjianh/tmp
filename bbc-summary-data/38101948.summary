The blaze began at about 02:15 GMT at a building in Nicholas Street and lit up the Chinatown arch at its peak.
No further details are yet known about the two people found, including their ages or gender. Police say they are investigating whether they were rough sleepers.
Some roads remain shut causing congestion in the city centre.
The fire was brought under control but the building is "severely damaged" and was an "unsafe structure", fire chiefs said.
Ch Insp Gareth Parkin, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "These are tragic circumstances and we working to identify the people who were found in the building.
"Due to falling debris, firefighters were forced to keep back from the multi-storey commercial building."

Borough Commander Paul Etches from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said there were still "pockets of fire" inside the building and it was "very unsafe".
He added: "Quite a large area of the building has suffered a partial collapse. The bodies were found in the first floor area. There is a lot of damage and debris that has fallen down through there as well.
"We're still carrying out systematic search to make sure no-one else is in the building."
The building had been unoccupied for some time, he added.
The area where the fire broke out may have been used by rough sleepers although there is no confirmation the people found dead were homeless.

Councillor Paul Andrews said: "This is tragic and shocking news and our hearts go out to those affected by it.
"Our message to anyone who is sleeping rough is please come and access the help and support available. We will find you somewhere safe to stay."
A dedicated rough sleepers team patrolled the city centre every day offering people help, he added.
A fire investigation team and Greater Manchester Police remain at the scene.

Portland Street was shut between Charlotte Street and Princess Street. It reopened at about 10:40 GMT.
"The roof has completely gone on this building. You can see the sky through the top windows there because the roof is completely collapsed.
"I can see the the charred burnt struts of the roof there. Most of it has just gone completely.
"This was a very fierce fire. It is now under control. It is not being actively fought now. But fire crews are still damping down."
