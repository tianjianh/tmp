The 34-year-old back row, who won eight caps for his country, was part of the Chiefs side that won promotion from the Championship in 2010.
In 2012 he became the first Exeter player since 1972 to represent England.
"I've been very lucky and privileged to be part of Chiefs for so many years and I will never forget the experiences they have given me," Johnson said.
"Being part of the club for all these years has been amazing. Yes, I've been frustrated at times, but that happens."
Johnson made 81 Premiership appearances for Exeter over seven seasons in the top flight, but featured just eight times in all competitions last season as the Devon side were crowned Premiership champions.
The ex-Coventry forward will now start a career as a personal trainer.
"Personally, I've gone from the Championship to playing for my country and then being part of a squad that's just won the Premiership. Not too many can say they've done that," he added.
