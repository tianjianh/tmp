Reality Check: Will the UK have to pay billions in tax refunds?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vote Leave has highlighted a section of HMRC's Annual Report and Accounts which says £7.2bn has been set aside for legal claims (where taxpayers are disputing HMRC's assessments through litigation). It also refers to contingent liabilities (meaning possible liabilities from cases currently in litigation) of £35.6bn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Claim: Vote Leave says membership of the EU means the UK will have to pay out up to £43bn in tax refunds to multinational businesses.
Reality Check verdict: The £43bn figure is likely to be much too high, and we don't know how much of it is connected to EU membership.
Adding the two amounts together gets Vote Leave to the £43bn figure.
However, there's no good reason to think that the full £43bn will ever be paid out.
HMRC say: "There is no question of this amount or anything close to this amount ever being repaid as the figure is based on our losing every single case currently being litigated, which is not going to happen. In reality, HMRC wins most cases at Tribunal."
Furthermore, it's not at all clear how much of the contingent liability is connected to cases where the UK's membership of the EU has any impact.
Some of it might be - cases can end up in the European Court of Justice if EU law is involved - but HMRC cannot disclose details of what the cases are or how much is potentially at stake in each case.
