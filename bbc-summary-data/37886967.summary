Great Britain's Tancock, 31, broke the world record to win 50m backstroke gold in Rome in 2009, and defended his crown in Shanghai two years later.
The Englishman also won golds at the 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games, and a bronze at Glasgow 2014, and represented Team GB at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
"It's been an incredible journey and a part of my life that I will remember forever," he said.
