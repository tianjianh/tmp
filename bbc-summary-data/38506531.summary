The 6ft flightless bird, nicknamed Chris, was first spotted on farmland near Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, over the festive weekend.
Despite efforts by police and others, the rhea evaded capture.
Officers tweeted on Tuesday that "Chris" had been found and his real name was Eric. They added he had been returned safely to his owner.
The rhea, a South American bird which can reach running speeds of up to 40mph (64km/h), had been spotted in a number of rural areas in the county including Foxton, Newton and Fowlmere.
