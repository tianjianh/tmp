[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tim Bresnan's unbeaten half-century helped Yorkshire launch a fightback on day two against Worcestershire.

Bresnan, batting at number seven, made 78 not out as the visitors recovered from 193-7 to reach 298-9 at stumps.
Captain Alex Lees hit a classy 87 off 135 balls and put on 108 with Richard Pyrah (43) as Gareth Andrew and Jack Shantry both claimed four wickets.
Earlier, all-rounder Andrew made 59 as Worcestershire moved from 264-8 to 311 all out, with Jack Brooks taking 5-56.
Andrew, who resumed on 42 not out, brought up his 17th first-class half-century off 59 balls, but was soon caught at second slip by Lees off Brooks while trying to flick the ball into the leg side.
Sri Lankan Sachithra Senanayake and Charlie Morris took the score past 300 to earn Worcestershire a third batting bonus point before Senanayake was caught at deep mid-wicket to give Brooks his fifth wicket.
Yorkshire were soon reduced to 3-2 in reply as Will Rhodes edged Andrew to Daryl Mitchell at second slip and Indian Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, on his debut, was snapped up at third slip off Charlie Morris, both for nought.
However, Lees and Pyrah then took the attack to the bowlers either side of lunch by scoring at almost five an over before Jack Shantry removed Pyrah and Jack Leaning in quick succession.
Lees, who is captaining the side at the age of just 21 with Andrew Gale suspended, continued to bat fluently, but fell 13 runs short of his century when he was trapped lbw by Andrew as the visitors reached tea on 179-5.
The wickets continued to tumble early in the evening session as Andy Hodd (30) nicked Andrew to Mitchell for his third slip catch of the day and Shantry bowled Steven Patterson without scoring.
Bresnan and Ryan Sidebottom took Yorkshire past 200 before Sidebottom was forced to retire hurt on 10 with a calf strain after setting off for a quick single.
But Bresnan, who has three Test fifties for England, found an able partner in Brooks who made 26 before he edged Andrew behind.
After Karl Carver was removed by Shantry, Sidebottom returned to the crease as the visitors closed 13 runs adrift. But Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie admits that he is "pretty unlikely" to bowl in the second innings.
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"Everyone could see that Sid was in a bit of discomfort. He's hurt his calf and we'll assess that over the next 24 hours.
"You'd say it's pretty unlikely he'll bowl in the rest of this match, and he's gutted about that - but we've got a couple of other options.
"I'm delighted with the positive way we played to get back into the game after Worcester had us in a bit of trouble.
"I think we've made a psychological blow already getting so close to their score even if we don't get a lead in the morning."
