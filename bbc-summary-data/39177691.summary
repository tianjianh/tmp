Ice hockey: Fife Flyers' coach Todd Dutiaume fumes at performance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fife Flyers head coach Todd Dutiaume criticised his team's commitment as they lost their only game of the weekend 5-3 to Edinburgh Capitals in Kirkcaldy.

Dutiaume was left seething as his team failed to build on last Sunday's superb 6-3 win current Elite League champions Sheffield Steelers.
"A point has to be made that once again, we saw two sides to this hockey club," Dutiaume said. "For the first and the last 18 minutes, we played like we're supposed to.
"The second period was a total lack of commitment and that's why we're in last place in the Conference.
"When we play a perceived 'big team', we put the commitment in, but against our Conference rivals and we go ahead, we take shortcuts.
"The fact Dundee and Edinburgh are fighting for their lives doesn't come into it for me and our guys just don't want to put on their work boots consistently."
Matt Sisca's opening goal was cancelled out by Jared Staal, before Ryan Dingle restored Fife's lead early in the second.
The Caps surged back into the game as Michal Dobron and Matt Tipoff turned the game around, with Jacob Johnston adding another early in the third.
Russ Moyer was on target for the Flyers, but Taylor MacDougall's empty net goal finally settled things as Edinburgh continued their fight for the top eight.
However, that fight could very well be over as Dundee Stars routed the Murrayfield side 5-1 on Sunday to put themselves back into the play-off spots.
Six points adrift with six games to go is a tall order for Dobron's side, but the Stars picking up two wins has now dropped Manchester Storm into trouble.
Mikael Lidhammar, Joey Sides and Vinny Scarsella had Dundee three up by the first break, with Lidhammar adding a second and one from Kevin Hart giving them an unassailable five-goal lead.
Although MacDougall pulled one back, it was a significant result for Marc LeFevbre's side, who successfully built on Saturday's 4-1 home win over Braehead Clan.
Cale Tanaka and Scarsella gave Stars a two-goal lead and although Cody Carlson pulled one back for the Clan, Scarsella and Justin Faryna clinched a massive victory.
It made it two defeats for Braehead Clan, who returned to the road after a month of home games and went to Nottingham Panthers on Friday night, going down 5-4.
Matt Carter and Davids Sarkanis opened up a two-goal lead for Panthers, but Stefan Della Rovere and Matt Beca soon hit back to level for Braehead.
Panthers found another gear as David Clarke, a second from Sarkanis and one from Jeff Brown saw them go 5-2 up after only one period.
Clan waited until the third period to hit back with Scott Pitt and Mike Hammond each scoring, but it was all they could muster as Nottingham took the win.
Friday
Nottingham Panthers 5-4 Braehead Clan
