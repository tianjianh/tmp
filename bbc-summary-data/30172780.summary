Premier League predictions: Lawro v comedian Henning Wehn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is German comedian Henning Wehn.
The Hagen-born comic's stand-up career actually owes its origins to English football, after he took part in an open-mic night while working for Wycombe Wanderers in 2002.
Wehn explained: "The company I was working for in Germany was about to go under so I looked at my CV, which looked all right, but I didn't speak English.
"I thought 'that has to change' so I applied to the 92 League clubs in England, because I'd always worked in sports marketing. I ended up working for Wycombe in their marketing department.
"They are still the first result I check, and I try to get to five or six games a season. A lot of the people who I worked with are still there, so it's great to go home."
Wehn is touring the UK with his new show 'Eins, Zwei, DIY' and is using his travels to watch "as much football as possible".
"So far I've been to Bristol Rovers versus Forest Green and Oldham against Bradford," he added.
"There's not that many people at lower league games so I can get in and out easily. If there's lots of people I might miss soundcheck."
You can see all of Henning's predictions on Football Focus at 12:10 GMT on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro got four correct results from 10 Premier League games, with no perfect scores.
His score of four points was was beaten by Citizen Khan actor Adil Ray, who picked three correct results, but had one perfect score to give him a total of five.
