Rugby World Cup 2015: Wales pick Gareth Davies at scrum-half

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Davies will start at scrum-half for Wales in Saturday's key World Cup match against England at Twickenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lloyd Williams is on the bench, meaning Mike Phillips is not in the match 23.
Tomas Francis starts at tight-head prop, Scott Baldwin at hooker with Gethin Jenkins at loose-head, while Samson Lee is named on the bench.
Full-back Liam Williams has recovered from his thigh knock, with George North and Hallam Amos - preferred to Alex Cuthbert - on the wings.
Captain Sam Warburton packs down at open-side flanker in a tried and tested breakaway trio of Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau, so Justin Tipuric provides back-row cover on the bench.
Alun Wyn Jones and Bradley Davies are the lock pairing, while Jamie Roberts and Scott Williams line up in the centre to take on England rivals Sam Burgess and Brad Barritt.
Scarlets tight-head Lee was an injury doubt but is fit enough to be named among the replacements, although there is no Paul James, who is suffering from a calf strain.
Instead, Aaron Jarvis and hooker Ken Owens are the other front-row reserves, while lock Luke Charteris, fly-half Rhys Priestland and Cuthbert are the other bench members.
British and Irish Lion Phillips was called into Wales' World Cup squad just over a fortnight ago when Rhys Webb suffered a tournament-ending foot injury, but will have to wait to win his 100th Test cap.
Instead Scarlets number nine Davies - the Pro12's top try scorer in the 2013/14 season - will make only his second start for Wales.
News of Newport Gwent Dragon Amos' selection came on his 21st birthday.
The winners of the Group A game will take a massive stride towards qualifying for the quarter-finals, with the losers realistically needing to beat Australia to avoid an early exit from the tournament.
"Saturday is a huge occasion for both teams and for the tournament and we are really looking forward to it," said Wales head coach Warren Gatland.
"Both sides kicked their tournament off with a bonus-point win but we know we will need to step up at Twickenham on Saturday."
Wales began their campaign on Sunday in Cardiff with a 54-9 win over Uruguay, while hosts England started two days earlier with a 35-11 victory over Fiji at Twickenham.
