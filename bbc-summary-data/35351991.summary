Human bones discovered in Lincolnshire garden

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Human bones have been discovered by a gardener at a home in Lincolnshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A homeowner found the remains on Sunday after digging a hole in the property's garden in Main Road, Stickney, about 10 miles (16km) from Boston.
Further tests are needed to establish the age of the bones and determine if they are from an ancient burial, police have said.
Officers said it could take several days for carbon dating examinations to be completed.
