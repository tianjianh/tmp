They disappeared in the town of Iguala in Guerrero state.
She confirmed the identification of Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz, found in a rubbish dump outside the city.
Austrian forensic officials have been carrying out tests. The remains of another student Alexander Mora Venancio were identified last December.
The group disappeared in September last year when they were on their way to take part in a demonstration.
Relatives of the students have questioned the account of the Mexican authorities who said corrupt local police handed over the students to a local drugs gang who killed them and burnt the bodies.
Earlier this month an independent investigation rejected the government's account of events.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights says it has found no evidence to support claims that the bodies were incinerated.
The Mexican government said it would send forensic experts to the area.
Relatives have always rejected the official investigation.
They accused the authorities of covering up the alleged involvement of high-ranking officials and possibly the army in the killings.
The case shocked Mexico and led to weeks of protests against official impunity and the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
