Paul Tomlinson, 29, from Nottingham, filmed the attacks and discussed it on social media, in June 2014.
Tomlinson, of Melford Road, was jailed for 20 weeks and banned from keeping dogs for three years, at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.
The RSPCA described Tomlinson's actions as "barbaric" and would not be tolerated in modern society.
Tomlinson was charged with two counts of wilfully killing or attempting to kill a badger, contrary to the Protection of Badgers Act, on 5 and 23 June 2014.
He was also accused of keeping three Lurcher dogs for use in connection with an animal fight, contrary to the Animal Welfare Act.
Magistrate Pam Draper told Tomlinson: "You kept and trained dogs for fighting, enabling them to kill the badgers.
"You videoed this happening and posted it on social media and the dogs sustained injuries."
After the sentencing Mike Butcher, RSPCA's chief inspector, said Tomlinson went out to "deliberately attack" animals.
"That can't be tolerated.  In this day and age it's a barbaric way to pass your time - it's amazing how many people do this and how prevalent it is," Mr Butcher said.
"It was organised, it was thought about, so that should always contain a jail sentence."
