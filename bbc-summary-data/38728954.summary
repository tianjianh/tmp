Dyfed-Powys Police said the call was made by a man in the Ceredigion area on Tuesday morning.
The force stressed the number is for emergencies only and warned misuse could block genuine calls.
"Before dialling 999, ask yourself if what you are ringing for is a life and death situation," a spokeswoman added.
