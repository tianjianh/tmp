Seven people were killed when a tram derailed in south London on Wednesday, 9 November with 51 taken to hospital, eight of who were said to be suffering "serious or life-threatening" injuries.
Pardew said some of the victims' families would be at Palace's home game against Manchester City on Saturday.
"The terrible events in Croydon had a massive impact on us," he added.
Some Palace supporters were among those who lost their lives and Pardew said the club had contributed to a fund to help the victims of the incident and their families.
"We as a club made a contribution to the fund, of course," the 55-year-old said.
"We also lost a fan to a train accident a couple of weeks before. Just awful. As a club we have to show we are with them and do all we can."
The family of 19-year-old Dane Chinnery, who died in the crash, have asked Palace fans at the game against Manchester City on Saturday to join them in a minute's applause.
The club have also announced they will be holding a minute's silence prior to the game.
Pardew said: "It is such a difficult thing. How can we get across the emotion they are feeling, it is such a personal thing.
"We as a club are fully behind them and want to help them as best we can. We have an important role to help the fans."
