Dutch hit seven past Scotland women

Scotland were given an indication of how tough it will be at next summer's European Championship when they were thumped 7-0 by the Netherlands.

Vivianne Miedema scored twice, with Lineth Beerensteyn also finding the the net before half-time at Livingston.
Renee Slegers scored number four in a one-sided friendly.
Ellen Jansen, Shanice van de Sanden and Jackie Groenen also scored for the Dutch, ranked 12th in the world, on a miserable night for the Scots.
The Dutch are hosting next year's tournament, the first major event 21st ranked Scotland has reached, and the visitors were on top from start to finish.
Scotland goalkeeper Shannon Lynn made early saves to deny Renato Jensen and Miedema, while Caroline Weir blasted high and wide from a rare Scottish opening.
Bayern Munich striker Miedema broke the deadlock with a shot that looked destined to be stopped by Lynn before defender Joelle Murray stuck out a leg and diverted the ball high into the net.
Two goals inside first-half stoppage time really knocked the wind out of the hosts, who were without star midfielder Kim Little.
Beerensteyn raced away from Scotland captain for the night Ifeoma Dieke to fire home a blistering strike and Miedema was first to react when Manieke Dekker hit the crossbar, nodding in the rebound.
The Netherlands continued to make all of the running after the interval, increasing their lead on 66 minutes when Van de Sanden cut the ball back from the bye-line for Slegers, who hammered it through the legs of Lynn.
Soon after, Lynn failed to hold a shot by Van de Sanden and Jansen followed up to score. The Swedish-based goalkeeper was injured in the process, with Gemma Fay taking over.
However, the introduction of the regular skipper did nothing to stem the tide and her mistake allowed the lively Van de Sanden to make it six.
Scotland's heaviest defeat is 8-0 to England in 1973 and that record was under threat when Groenen danced through the home defence before beating Fay at her near post.
With only two changes to the side that beat Iceland in their final qualifying match, this was a harsh lesson for Scotland, who have plenty of hard work ahead before Euro 2017.
Scotland head coach Anna Signuel: "They were playing in behind us all the time and we couldn't stand up to it. Losing two goals just before half time really killed the game.
"We played better in the second half, higher up the park, but we still let in four goals and that's from a lot of individual mistakes. One-v-one, they are much better than us.
"It's very disappointing and it shows that we have a bit to go, especially physically. We need more of these types of games in the spring because playing qualifiers against lower ranked teams becomes a false reality. You think you're better than you are, maybe."
