The owner and founder of Herbert of Liverpool died aged 72 on 20 October.
Mourners packed into the city's Anglican Cathedral to pay their final respects on Friday, including one of his friends, the comedian Ken Dodd.
The cortege included Howe's famous Cadillac, a classic car bearing the registration plate Bling1.
Mr Howe, who had suffered from cancer, flirted with politics and briefly stood for Mayor of Liverpool in 2012 as an independent candidate but withdrew because of what he described as the "viperous attitude" of local politics.
He featured on ITV docu-soap Shampoo, Channel 5's Celebrity Super Spa and regularly contributed to BBC Radio Merseyside.
Mr Howe also set up Queenie's Christmas charity in memory of his mother.
The cortege left his salon - known as the Bling Bling Building - at 11:30 GMT as hundreds lined Hanover Street, which was closed for the procession.
Radio presenters Pete Price and Linda McDermott spoke at the service, with the former asking mourners to give his late friend a standing ovation.
Celebrities including fellow hairdresser Andrew Collinge and former Liverpool and England footballer Sammy Lee were in the congregation.
Paying tribute, Mr Collinge said Mr Howe was "a great man - as we know a much loved part of Liverpool - and a great hairdresser" whose "work for good causes was unparalleled".
Liverpool stars Claire Sweeney, Jennifer Ellison, Danielle Lloyd and Ray Quinn also paid their respects.
Mr Howe will be cremated at a private ceremony later.
