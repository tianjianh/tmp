[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton earned a bonus-point win over Castres to end the French side's hopes of a place in the European Champions Cup quarter-finals.

Saints were already out of contention, while the visitors needed two wins from their final two games to keep alive their chance of progressing.
Castres fought back from 13 points down to level in the second half.
But Tom Wood's try, adding to scores from Teimana Harrison and Stephen Myler, handed Northampton the win.
Leinster became the first team to qualify for the last eight of the competition on Friday, and will progress as Pool Four winners.
The visitors fell behind after only two minutes when Harrison crashed over from close range and Myler converted from the tee.
Rory Kockott landed a penalty for Castres, before they lost Jody Jenneker to the sin bin for a maul infringement, but the French side took the lead for the first time thanks to Alexandre Bias' unconverted try in the corner.
Saints regained the lead through Myler's score and Harrison's second to go in 21-8 ahead at the break.
In a dominant second-half performance, full-back Julien Dumora seized on a gap in the Northampton defence to cross for Castres, and Kockott landed a conversion and two penalties to make it 21-21.
A Myler drop-goal attempt then came off the posts, before Wood went over from a driving maul to earn Saints the bonus point and extend their unbeaten record to five games in all competitions.
