Luke Shorthouse scored 44 goals in 51 games at Midland Football League side Nuneaton Griff last season, prompting one supporter to tip off Kevin Wilson - the manager of National League North neighbours Nuneaton Town - in a letter.
The 21-year-old is now set to sign a permanent deal with the club - making a five-tier jump.
"I can't believe it," Shorthouse told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. "I didn't think I would ever make it so far up in such a quick time."
Boss Wilson added: "Fans are sometimes good scouts because they go to watch other games, they see other kids.
"I take the credit because I've followed it up by watching him, like I do with anybody."
Leicester and England striker Vardy began his career at non-league Stocksbridge Park Steels then moved to Halifax and Fleetwood Town, before being signed by the Foxes for Â£1m in 2012.
Shorthouse scored on his debut for sixth-tier Nuneaton Town as a trialist against Coventry City on Saturday.
He said: "I never thought this could happen given I only came back into Saturday football two years ago.
"You've got to live in the moment, I think. That's what Jamie Vardy did when it happened for him, so you never know."
Former Chelsea and Northern Ireland striker Wilson, who has also managed Northampton Town, said he expected Shorthouse to sign this week.
He added: "Just being inquisitive as a manager, I had a little look and invited him in."
