Frank Standen, 84, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, started suffering from symptoms days into a trip from Southampton to Cape Verde in November 2011.
He was initially treated by the ship's doctors but flown to hospital on Gran Canaria when his condition worsened.
Fred Olsen said there was no evidence he contracted the illness on board.
After he was airlifted from the cruise ship Black Watch, Mr Standen spent seven weeks in hospital in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and then a further five weeks at Sevenoaks Hospital.
He said the whole experience for he and his wife Patricia, 83, was "absolutely terrible" and he was delighted to have received a settlement from Fred Olsen.
"I feel really lucky to be alive but the whole experience of the cruise, being airlifted from the ship and spending so much time in hospital was absolutely dreadful and really shook me up.
"Myself and Patricia did not get to enjoy our cruise and instead of being at home with my family over Christmas I was in hospital in a foreign country."
Irwin Mitchell lawyer, Clare Pearson, who represented the couple said it was "disappointing that the cruise operator denied liability" and waited until the case was due to go to trial before agreeing payment.
In a statement, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said it was "very sorry that Mr Standen was seriously unwell" but denied liability for his illness.
"As soon as his symptoms were discovered our ships doctors and nurses did everything possible to ensure he received the best treatment. They quickly identified that Mr Standen would need to be taken to hospital and the ship arranged for a helicopter evacuation," it continued.
"Despite thorough and extensive testing there is no evidence to suggest that he contracted Legionnaires' disease on board our ship. No other guests or crew were found ill on this or any other subsequent cruise."
Legionnaires' is a form of pneumonia which is most often contracted by inhaling mist from water.
