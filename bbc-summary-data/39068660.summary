Karl Milgate will continue as head coach, working alongside former Arsenal reserve-team coach Cook.
Former management duo Les Taylor and Jonny Edmunds left their positions at the club in November.
"I will be hoping that every player and staff member is ready to fight and work to better the club every day," Cook told the club website.
General manager Ruth Senior added: "I am really excited to work with Andy on our long-term vision for the club."
