One of Nato's largest military exercises came to a close last week after 13-days of mock combat.

Joint Warrior involved thousands of personnel, dozens of aircraft and the deployment of 30 warships and submarines in the sea of Scotland.
Marine conservation charity Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust observed the military activity off the west coast.
Trust staff and volunteers shadowed the war games to check for potential impact on marine life.
HWDT has shadowed Joint Warrior before, but this year added video range tracking kit to the monitoring equipment aboard its yacht Silurian.
The charity has now released a series of images from the expedition.
