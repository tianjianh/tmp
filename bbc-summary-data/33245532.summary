Scottish and UK ministers meet amid wind subsidy row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish and UK energy ministers are due to meet for the first time following a row over an early end to wind farm subsidies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, the UK government announced new onshore wind farms will be excluded from a subsidy scheme from 1 April 2016, a year earlier than expected.
Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the decision would disproportionately affect Scotland.
The move was part of a manifesto commitment by the Conservative party.
UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said it will give local communities the final say over any new wind farms.
The ministers are due to meet at a renewables conference in London, where both will be speaking.
Mr Ewing is expected to seek clarity about whether wind projects already in development will still receive funding.
He said Ms Rudd and Scottish Secretary David Mundell had given apparently contradictory statements on which projects would still go ahead.
He said: "The UK Tory government's decision to scrap investment in onshore wind is completely wrong-headed, and makes no economic or environmental sense - but it is absolutely essential that developers know whether projects already in the pipeline are going to receive financial support or not.
"Amber Rudd and David Mundell's different positions show that there is either confusion between UK cabinet members about the UK government position on the crucial issue of grace periods, or there is a welcome change in policy towards that set out by the Scottish government.
"I hope it is the latter and I will be raising this issue with Amber Rudd at our meeting - investment and jobs hinge on the UK government ensuring continued support to projects already in the pipeline."
Energy firms had been facing an end to subsidies in 2017.
The funding for the subsidy comes from the Renewables Obligation, which is funded by levies added to household fuel bills.
While subsidies will end from 1 April 2016, there will be a grace period for projects which already have planning permission.
About 3,000 wind turbines across the UK are awaiting planning consent.
Scottish Renewables have said the move was "neither fair nor reasonable" and could cost Scotland up to Â£3bn in business investment.
