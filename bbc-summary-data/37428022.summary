In his break, Bristol illustrator Henry St Leger uses his discarded biscuit and tea-cake wrappers to create mini-masterpieces of dinosaurs.
The tiny and shiny prehistoric creatures even have their own blog.
Mr St Leger, 33, who lives in Yatton, north Somerset said: "I have been making things with the wrappers for as long as I can remember."
"Both my brother Samuel and I used to make little men or dinosaurs whenever we had a Tunnocks caramel wafer.
"The wrapper on a Tunnocks is quite unique in that it's kind of a foil and paper combo and it seems to work beautifully for making things with."
When taking breaks from his job, Mr St Leger began making and leaving the "wrapper raptors" at the nearby Spike Island cafe where staff started keeping them in a collection.
"After that I decided to start blogging them on Tumblr more for my own amusement than anything," he said.
But the models, which range from a menacing pack of T-Rexes to airborne Pterosaurs and even tiny dinosaur eggs, soon created their own fan base among his colleagues.
Mr St Leger said: "Two exceptional Aardman directors Richard Webber and Merlin Crossingham, animator and director extraordinaire Jane Davies-Watkins kindly got involved after seeing the blog and my disgustingly talented brother has done a fair few.
"I specifically do dinosaurs because they are fun to do and it tests my very rusty childhood knowledge of dinosaurs- although I have gone well beyond that now and have to do a bit of research," he said.
