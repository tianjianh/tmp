It features new versions of the band's most famous tracks, including God is a DJ and Insomnia, reworked by producers like Avicii and Tiesto.
In the singles chart, Justin Bieber achieves a fifth week at number one with his hit song Where Are You Now?
There are also new entries for Olly Murs and The 1975, while The Weeknd and Jamie Lawson climbed into the top 10.
Formed 20 years ago, Faithless are pioneers of stadium dance music, racking up 17 UK Top 40 singles and seven Top 40 albums over the course of their career.
They disbanded in 2011, but reunited earlier this year to play festivals around Europe.
Although their latest chart-topper is a retrospective, founding member Sister Bliss said the group were currently discussing the possibility of new material.
"We're doing a lot of collaborations at the moment," she told the Official Chart Company, "so I'm very excited that perhaps they could form the basis for a new album."
Directly below Faithless in the album chart is Ed Sheeran's X, which spends its 69th week in the top 10.
There are new entries for US rapper The Game, whose The Documentary 2 is a sequel to his five-million-selling debut, released in 2005; and singer-songwriter John Grant, who lands at number ive with Grey Tickles Black Pressure.
Selena Gomez, Tom Jones, Reverend and the Makers and Hurts also score top 20 debuts for their new albums.
Meanwhile Gabrielle Aplin's Light Up The Dark zooms up 66 places following her appearance on Graham Norton last week, landing at number 40.
Next week's chart will be shaken up by the arrival of new singles from One Direction and X Factor winner Ben Haenow. There are also albums due from pop star Demi Lovato, Ed Sheeran protege Jamie Lawson, and Jamaican-American singer OMI, who scored a global hit this summer with Cheerleader.
