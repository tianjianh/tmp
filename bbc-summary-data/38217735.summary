[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 2-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham came from behind to beat bottom-of-the-table Rotherham and move to within two points of the play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Millers, who have won only twice in the Championship this season, led through Joe Newell's 20-yard strike.
Stefan Johansen slid home his third goal in as many games, converting Ryan Sessegnon's cross, to equalise.
Floyd Ayite turned in Lucas Piazon's cross to put Fulham ahead, while Chris Martin saw his penalty saved by the feet of Lewis Price.
That miss did not prove costly for the hosts, who secured their eighth victory of the season to move up to ninth.
Rotherham, without an away league win since April, had the better of the opening exchanges as Tom Adeyemi saw his shot tipped over the bar by David Button, while Isaiah Brown went close.
Brown and Adeyemi were involved in Rotherham's opener as they combined to set up Newell to lash home a low 20-yard effort.
The goal sparked Fulham into life and, after Ayite curled a shot past the far post and put a header wide, Johansen pounced from close range to equalise.
Ayite, who scored twice the weekend's 4-4 draw at Wolves, then put Fulham in front before Martin, on loan from Derby County, missed the chance to score his eighth goal of the season when Price turned away his spot-kick.
Rotherham had a late chance to equalise but substitute Lee Frecklington's volley was saved by Button.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"At the end of the day I have to happy. It was a freaky game for us on a Tuesday night against the bottom of the league, it was hard for us.
"When you get to the end of the game and only have a one-goal lead you get nervous because they can score easily.
"We made enough things and chances - we missed the penalty - to make the game easier for us. We didn't do it and if you don't do it you will suffer.
"We played well in the second half, although I was a bit worried when we didn't get the third goal. It is not easy against the bottom team."
Rotherham caretaker manager Paul Warne:
"We have worked hard with the lads, we knew they were a very good team.
"I knew it was a hard ask. We prepared well, the lads believed they were going to get something out of the game, and I thought in the first 20 minutes we were really dangerous on the counter attack.
"We should have gone one up earlier than we did, but I also knew they would keep coming at us. I asked the lads to give me everything and they did."
