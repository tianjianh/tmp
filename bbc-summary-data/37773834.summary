They may need to put animals like sharks in the same tanks as smaller fish - but they need to be sure the sharks won't eat their smaller tank-mates!
To do this, staff at the Blue Reef Aquarium in the north-east of England are teaching their sharks a special feeding technique called target feeding.
It means the shark will know what it is allowed to eat and what mustn't be dinner!
