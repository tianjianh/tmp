About 3,000 competitors - many of them clad in tweed - took part in the Mighty Deerstalker race at Traquair House near Innerleithen at the weekend.

The event, billed as "the toughest off-road race in the UK", is now in its 10th year.
Participants tackled mud-filled trenches, water crossings and forest trails in the Scottish Borders until late on Saturday night.
They were able to choose between a five kilometre and 10 kilometre challenge.
Jim Mee, creator of the Mighty Deerstalker, said: "In a world where obstacle-heavy events dominate, The Mighty Deerstalker goes back to the basics and uses Mother Nature to deliver the challenge.
"Competitors not only have to deal with a gruelling course in the wilds of the Scottish winter, but they also must do so in complete darkness."
He added: "This year was The Mighty Deerstalker's 10th anniversary, making it one of our most established and popular events.
"As always, there was a fantastic atmosphere on the night, with lots of participants dressed up in tartan and tweed, keeping with the event's historic theme."
