Scotland forward Ross McCormack has been disciplined by Aston Villa and dropped after "continually missing training", says manager Steve Bruce.

The 30-year-old was left out of Villa's match-day squad for Saturday's 2-2 Championship draw at home to Preston.
"He is nowhere near fit enough to play and be involved," Bruce told BBC WM 95.6. "I don't think he's in a physical shape or state to contribute.
"Unless his attitude towards everything changes, he's not going to be picked."

Former Leeds and Fulham front man McCormack, who signed for Villa for Â£12m in August, last scored on Boxing Day.
"It is fair to say disciplinary measures have been made against him because of his attitude and continually missing training," Bruce added.
"Not in 20 years in management have I ever gone down this route but I feel I have to take a stance because I will not put up with it. There has been too much indiscipline at Villa.
"He has decided the team has picked itself. How can I pick him when he doesn't come to training?
"His failure to turn up for training has happened more than once. Everyone can have an excuse but when it is more than once I will not accept it."
McCormack, who began his career as a trainee at Rangers, has netted three goals so far this season.
