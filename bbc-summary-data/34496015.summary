Cwmbran roads reopen after gas pipe repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roads which were closed while engineers repaired a damaged gas pipe in Torfaen have reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Contractors accidentally severed the pipe on Thursday, causing a leak which led to the evacuation of the nearby Premier Inn and Ashbridge Inn, Cwmbran.
It has now been stopped and the pub and hotel have reopened.
Avondale Road, Chapel Lane and Pontrhydyrun Road reopened at 16:00 BST.
A spokesman for Wales & West Utilities said engineers had worked through the night.
No gas supplies have been affected by the leak.
