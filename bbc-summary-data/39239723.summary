[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 1-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lacklustre game between Grimsby and Crawley ended in a 1-1 draw at Blundell Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Jones opened the scoring midway through the opening 45 minutes before James Collins levelled for Crawley on the stroke of half-time.
The Mariners ended the game with 10 men after Danny Collins was dismissed with nine minutes left but the visitors could not force a first win in six games.
Other chances before the break saw Grimsby's Jamey Osborne curl wide of the target, while the at the other end Jimmy Smith was denied by home goalkeeper James McKeown.
But the deadlock was broken in the 22nd minute when the visitors failed to clear a cross and Jones netted at the second attempt.
The lead lasted until first-half added time when James Collins was on hand to prod home the rebound after McKeown had flung across to his right to save from Josh Payne.
In the second period, a wayward attempt from Dominic Vose was followed up by a close effort from Jones as Grimsby began on the front foot.
But home hopes took a hit in the 81st minute when Danny Collins picked up his second booking for a foul on Enzio Boldewijn.
