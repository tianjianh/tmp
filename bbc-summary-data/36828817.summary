A proposed Â£900,000 visitors centre at an East Yorkshire nature reserve has been refused planning permission.

Yorkshire Wildlife Trust (YWT) wanted to construct the building and car park at Spurn Point on the Holderness coast.
East Riding of Yorkshire Council rejected the plan citing concerns over flooding and the visual impact.
Dr Rob Stoneman, from the YWT, said he was "extremely disappointed" by the decision and said the trust would appeal.
"We've spent four years actually addressing all of the issues the council brought up today and they are obviously not convinced with our arguments," he said.
"That's democracy, we'll have to get on with that."
The planned centre would be sited at the top of the 3.5 miles (6km) long peninsula which is located at the mouth of the Humber estuary.
Spurn is only 50m (164ft) wide at some points and is home to seabirds and other wildlife.
In December 2013 a tidal surge in the North Sea swamped the land damaging parts of the road which connects the tip of the point with the mainland.
The proposals had attracted hundreds of objections from local residents complaining about the impact of the development on the village of Kilnsea and the surrounding area.
Council officers had recommended approval subject to conditions on building materials and landscaping around the building.
