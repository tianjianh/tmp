Professor Mike Lean says children should be prevented from buying these drinks in the same way as alcohol.
There are worries that caffeine - which can be found in coffee, fizzy drinks and energy drinks - can have a bad affect on young people's brains.
Too much of it can increase a person's heart rate, make it harder to concentrate and harder to sleep.
The British Soft Drinks Association, who represent manufacturers of these types of drinks, already advise that high-caffeine drinks shouldn't be sold to or drunk by children.
However Professor Mike Lean doesn't feel enough is being done to enforce this and obstacles should be put in the way of children getting the drinks.
