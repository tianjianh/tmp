'Horrible' smell in Cardiff investigated by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cause of a "horrible" smell reported in parts of Cardiff city centre and Cardiff Bay has been investigated by Cardiff Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People in the Welsh capital took to social media on Tuesday to question the cause of the stench.

A spokesman for Cardiff Council said it had "contacted partners to ascertain the cause of the smell".
