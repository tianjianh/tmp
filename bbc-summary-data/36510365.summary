Edinburgh Gateway railway station 'extensively damaged'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flagship railway station being constructed on the outskirts of Edinburgh has been extensively damaged after a break-in.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edinburgh Gateway is a Â£41m project intended to complete a vital link with Edinburgh's trams and improve access to the airport.
British Transport Police said it was broken into between 19:30 and 21:00 on Saturday.
Buildings under construction, vehicles and machinery were damaged.
Insp Lindsay Clarkson said: "The station was broken into last night and extensive damage was caused to vehicles, machinery and the buildings in the station. Windows were also smashed and graffiti daubed all over.
"BTP takes criminal damage the rail network extremely seriously. It is nothing more than selfish vandalism that makes people fearful of their surroundings and costs the railway industry thousands of pounds to clean up.
"Unfortunately the costs associated with the clear up and fixing the damage caused is ultimately covered by the fare-paying passenger, which is not acceptable."
