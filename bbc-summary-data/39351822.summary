Chiefs had previously warned board members of the scale of savings required.
The board will be asked to consider the plans at a meeting on Tuesday.
Chief executive Elaine Mead said some work was already being done, including "significant" redesign on models of out-of-hours and out-patient care.
NHS Highland said pressures on services included an ageing population, difficulties with recruiting staff and rising costs.
In a report prepared by Ms Mead, seven initiatives have been set out to find efficiencies in areas such as adult care and medicine in 2017/18.
Ms Mead said: "The plan sets out the vision and strategy through which to deliver the board's corporate objectives.
"We are putting in place seven initiatives that relate back to people, quality and care. These will support the reduction of waste, harm and unwarranted variation, allow new models of care to be further developed and introduced and, in turn, will  be  more sustainable."
NHS Highland provides services in the Highlands and in Argyll and Bute.
