The body of Matthew McKenzie, 33, was found by a passer-by near Promenade Street in Rochdale on Thursday night.
Post-mortem tests found he died as a result of a stab wound in his chest, police said. Two men, aged 28 and 33, have been held on suspicion of murder.
Mr McKenzie's mother Kathryn Jones said he would "make friends with everyone he met".
She added: "When he would come and see me I would say to him, 'I love you, be careful, behave', and he would give me a big sloppy kiss."
