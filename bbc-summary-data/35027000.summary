Port Vale manager Rob Page says his job is not under threat despite their FA Cup second-round exit at the hands of League Two Exeter City.

Vale, 11th in League One, were beaten 2-0, prompting talks between Page and Valiants owner and chairman Norman Smurthwaite after the final whistle.
"The chairman's frustrated and rightly so," Page told BBC Radio Stoke.
"There are no problems there, we've had a lengthy chat and we move forward now and we have to put it right."
Vale's exit meant they missed out of valuable revenue, with Exeter picking up Â£27,000 after making it through to the third round.
"It's a cup competition that helps us financially - it was an opportunity to put a bit more money in the bank," said Page.
"I understand the chairman's concerns from that point of view and he's got every right.
"If he sees a performance he's not happy with he has a right to come and tell me about it - and I fully agree after that level of performance."
Vale, four points outside the play-off places in League One, take on Scunthorpe at Vale Park on Saturday.
