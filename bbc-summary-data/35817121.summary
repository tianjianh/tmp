The fifth episode of the franchise will be released in July 2019.
The as-yet-untitled film will come 11 years after the most recent Indiana Jones film, 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Ford and Spielberg first worked together on Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981.
In the first outing, archaeologist Jones raced around the world to find the Ark of the Covenant before it fell into the hands of the Nazis.
It was followed three years later by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade coming in 1989.
Ford, also known for his work as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, will be 77 when the new instalment arrives in cinemas.
Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn said: "Indiana Jones is one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history, and we can't wait to bring him back to the screen in 2019.
"It's rare to have such a perfect combination of director, producers, actor and role, and we couldn't be more excited to embark on this adventure with Harrison and Steven."
The four films have made nearly $2bn (Â£1.41bn) at the box office so far.
Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall are to produce the new film.
