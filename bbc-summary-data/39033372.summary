Dave Kilroy saw the wallet in the middle of a street in Stockport town centre and handed it to police.
Nobody came forward and after a year police said the unclaimed wallet was his, and Dave said: "I thought to myself 'what can I do with the money?'"
He donated £525 to Children in Need in November 2016 for a look round BBC Radio Manchester on Tuesday morning.
Mr Kilroy, from Stockport, was given a behind the scenes tour of the breakfast show with his granddaughter Eve following a day-long auction to raise money for the BBC charity.
He said: "I found a wallet lying in the street and handed it into police and a year after that police got in touch with me to say the money was mine.
"There was a library card in there but nobody came forward."
"I thought it'd be great to see the programme going out - I really enjoyed it," added Dave, who ferries children around Cheshire and Greater Manchester as a school bus driver.
As of October 2016, there were 254 projects worth £13.1m being supported by BBC Children in Need across the North West of England.
