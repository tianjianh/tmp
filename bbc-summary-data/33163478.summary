The route for a corridor of pylons that will connect a new nuclear facility in Cumbria to the National Grid has been unveiled.

The pylons will link new sources of electricity including the proposed new nuclear power station at Moorside into the grid in Cumbria and Lancashire.
National Grid has chosen a route that runs overland around the coast of Cumbria and under Morecambe Bay.
Project manager Robert Powell, said there was "support" for the final plan.
The chosen corridor will run from Harker substation near Carlisle, largely following the path of existing low voltage power lines around the Cumbrian coast to Moorside.
It will then head to the Furness peninsula where it will go under Morecambe Bay to emerge at Middleton substation near Heysham.
The National Grid said a route running mainly offshore was ruled out due to "obstacles on the sea bed" and concerns over the use of new technology.
Mr Powell said: "People understand how important it is for us to connect new sources of generation into the grid and the task we face in doing this in a region with some of the most spectacular landscapes in the country."
The decision was following a public consultation.
The company aims to submit an application to build the new connection in 2017 and if it is given the go-ahead, work is expected to start in 2019.
