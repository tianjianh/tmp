Play was stopped at an Australian darts competition when rioting fans in fancy dress brawled and threw chairs.

Dutchman Michael 'Mighty Mike' van Gerwen was playing Australia's Simon 'The Wizard' Whitlock in an invitational tournament at the Etihad Stadium in Melbourne when chaos broke out.
The pair - among the top-ranked players on the Professional Darts Corporation circuit - were halted when a boisterous crowd took to throwing chairs, tossing tables and grappling in groups.
Images show a man dressed as Batman's sidekick Robin wrestling with an English knight, while security guards try to calm the situation down.
Other pictures show men in Hawaiian shirts and also a gang of Oompa Loompas throwing furniture.
Police later arrived on the scene but not before the entire seating area had been wrecked by the marauding crowd.
