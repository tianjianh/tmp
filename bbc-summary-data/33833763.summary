Up to 40,000 people and 140 bands took part in the march, which is the largest loyal order demonstration in Northern Ireland.
Three people have been arrested for public order offences.
The event began with a parade around the city's historic walls and was followed by a wreath laying ceremony at the War Memorial in the Diamond.
A religious service was also held in St Columb's Cathedral.
PSNI Supt Mark McEwan praised all sides for working together to ensure the parade was peaceful.
"There haven't been any problems today at all, the operation has been a success," he said.
"Everyone seems to have been enjoying a good day out. The feeling and atmosphere in the city is one of festivity."
Jim Brownlee, governor of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, said the emphasis within the Apprentice Boys was on respect.
"That's still down to every member of this association especially when we're on parade and in the public domain," he said.
"We want people to respect this parade and we want the people on parade to respect the people who will either be watching it or commenting upon it."
A pageant re-enacting the Siege of Derry took place ahead of the start of the main parade.
