Chorley police dog attack victim 'called thief by officers'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was attacked by a police dog claims officers accused him of being a thief rather than offering help.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Pemberton alleges he was left for "a good hour" before being taken to hospital after the attack by the Greater Manchester Police dog-in-training, outside a Lancashire hotel.
The 23-year-old was held on suspicion of going equipped to steal before being de-arrested and taken for treatment.
GMP said an inquiry had begun after a dog "unexpectedly detained" a man.
Mr Pemberton, whose family has complained to the force, remains in hospital and has undergone two operations since the attack in the car park at the Best Western Park Hall Hotel in Charnock Richard, last Friday.
GMP said the dog had been taking part in a planned training exercise at a secure site at the old Camelot Theme Park in Chorley.
Mr Pemberton, from Chorley, said he had parked his car and was going to the hotel to renew his gym membership when the dog attacked him.
He said: "I had all these injuries and all [the police] were doing was throwing these accusations at me. They weren't concerned about my welfare.
"They accused me of trespassing - which I wasn't - and they just didn't treat me well. They didn't treat me like a human being.
"I was on the floor for a good hour with my injuries waiting for an ambulance."
Ch Insp Mark Dexter of GMP's Specialist Operations branch said: "During the exercise, which involved searching an open area within the site, one of the police dogs unexpectedly detained a man next to the perimeter fence just outside the site."
He said the dog handler brought the animal under control and carried out inquiries at the scene.
"I know the images of the man's injuries appear quite distressing and will understandably cause some concern but I would like to assure everyone that we are investigating this matter and will be looking to speak with the injured man as a matter of urgency to better understand what happened," Ch Insp Dexter added.
Mr Pemberton's father Jim Pemberton, said: "First of all, we want to see Dominic recovering and we also want to make sure the police officers that treated Dominic in such a way are held to account."
GMP said: " In line with standard policy the incident was referred to the GMP Professional Standards Branch."
