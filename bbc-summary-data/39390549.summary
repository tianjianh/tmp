The 19-year-old City right-back let fly with a fierce 25-yard right-foot shot, which deflected in off Damon Lathrope.
The Gulls, who had to play the whole of the second half with 10 men after Myles Anderson was sent off, went closest when Jamie Reid hit the post.
Chester are now nine points clear of trouble, with Torquay in 21st place.
The closest either side came before the break were a pair of curled free kicks over the bar from Chester's Evan Horwood and Torquay front man Reid.
The visitors went close to earning a 43rd-minute penalty when James Alabi was brought down on the edge of the box. But referee Sam Allison opted not to give the spot-kick and instead sent off Anderson.
Chester had to survive a huge second-half scramble when Ruairi Keating was denied in a triple let-off that ended with keeper Alex Lynch touching Reid's shot onto the post
Hughes, the best player on the park and already on the wish list of Football League clubs, then fired home before Chester had to survive a real scare when defender Ryan Astles somehow scooped over his own bar in the 86th minute.
