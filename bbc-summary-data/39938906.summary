Celtic want to test themselves against the best teams in Europe next season, says assistant manager Chris Davies.

The Scottish champions faced Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach after reaching this year's Champions League group stages.
They drew three and lost three games and Davies says they would love to face the likes of Real Madrid next season.
"The Champions League is a better place with Celtic in it. Everyone would agree with that," he said.

"It would be great to play against one of the big teams again next year and measure ourselves in terms of where we are at as a team against them.
"That's the aim, we want to be at the highest level, representing Celtic, making our fans proud on the biggest stage and that is what we're aiming for."
Celtic clinched a sixth straight domestic title on 2 April and could break a host of records in the final two games - away at Partick on Thursday, home to Hearts on Sunday - of what could be the first undefeated Scottish Premiership season.
Having already beaten their own previous record of 32 league matches without defeat from 2003-04, Brendan Rodgers' side could set new marks for the most goals, most points, most wins and fewest defeats in one campaign in the modern era.
Currently 30 points clear of Aberdeen, Celtic could also beat the 31-point winning margin Paris Saint-Germain set in Ligue 1 last season for the most comprehensive title triumph in any of Uefa's member countries.
"That would be great," Davies added. "I'm aware that 31 points is the European record margin win that's been set by PSG.
"At Celtic, with the history and tradition, to open up a gap like that is still something very special.
"We have set a high standard. There is an awareness that what we are doing is something incredible. In terms of 44 games unbeaten [domestically, in league and cups] everyone in football and out of football acknowledges how good that is."
It is almost a year since Davies arrived in Glasgow with Rodgers. With three games left to play, including the Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen on 27 May, he says it has already been a memorable 12 months.
"It's been brilliant," he added. "We knew what a big club Celtic was before we came and it hasn't disappointed. We've had a brilliant year here, personally, professionally, everything. And there's still a lot more to come.
"Obviously we've got a big couple of weeks coming up, we know that. What we want to do is give the fans a team they are proud of.
"A year ago seems a long time. I'll never forget the day we came up to see Brendan getting unveiled. It was my first time at Celtic Park and I just knew what an amazing club it was."
