A Harry Potter super-fan from Cardiff has spent £100,000 on her "obsession".

Tracey Nichol-Lewis, 43, has collected more than 2,500 items of memorabilia, including cases of wands and casting call sheets from the films.
She has travelled the world to meet her favourite characters - including Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley.
The mother-of-one said her obsession started after her late husband Simon gave her the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire before his death.
Simon, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, died in 2005 aged 39.
"I liked the Harry Potter books before my husband died but my grief in losing him triggered off a bit of an obsession," Ms Nichol-Lewis, from Heath, said.
"Originally I bought the toys and money boxes and the castle model all for my son knowing that when he grew out of it I could keep them."
Her collection features posters, scarves in the house colours, broomsticks and the official Harry Potter magazines - with the memorabilia costing more than £40,000.
The rest has been spent travelling to Orlando in Florida to the film studios and more recently to Harry Potter World in both London and America.
She lives with her partner Martin Chester, 41, her 15-year-old son and Martin's 16-year-old son.
Mr Chester said: "She'd do away with the cooker and replace it with broomsticks and storage for her Potter obsession."
Ms Nichol-Lewis is set to travel to London's Comic Con and hopes to meet the Weasley twin actors James and Oliver Phelps.
She said she hopes to get the autograph of every actor from all eight movies.
