[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tuberculosis (TB) screening exercise at a Bristol school has found the disease has not been transmitted after a case in March.

About 120 pupils and staff at the Bristol Brunel Academy in Speedwell who had come into contact with the person involved were tested for the condition.
Several people were, however, found to have a "latent" version of the disease.
This means they could have been exposed to the bacteria at any time in their lives but are not a risk to others.
However, there is a small chance that they may go on to develop active TB later on in life.
The Health Protection Agency (HPA), which carried out the screenings, has treated those found to have the latent version of the disease with a routine course of antibiotics to clear it.
TB is a serious but curable infectious disease which normally affects the lungs.
The HPA's Dr Bharat Pankhania, said: "Our tests are very sensitive and pick up evidence if you have ever been exposed to TB bacteria at any time in your life. These bacteria are hidden away inside you and may never cause illness or disease.
"But we further assess these people and make absolutely sure that they don't have any evidence of illness.
"I am reassured that a transmission has not been occurring at the school."
Principal Brigid Allen said: "The results of the screening show that TB has not been transmitted amongst either our pupils or our staff and we want to reassure parents that there is nothing to worry about.
"We're so pleased and want to thank the HPA for their help in all this."
