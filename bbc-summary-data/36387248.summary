[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's batting struggles continued as Jack Leach's four wickets put Somerset in control on day one at Taunton.

Spinner Leach (4-31) exploited Surrey's middle-order, taking three wickets in five balls.
Steven Davies (49) was the only player to get to grips with the bowling before he fell lbw to Leach.
Ben Foakes (17 not out) began to mount a recovery with the lower order before rain ended play early, with Surrey 236-8 at stumps.
Despite Jason Roy being ruled out with a wrist injury after Surrey's 93 all out in the T20 Blast against Glamorgan, Surrey won the toss and opted to bat but lost opener Rory Burns (14) cheaply.
Surrey struggled to build any meaningful partnerships, with Kumar Sangakkara (45) adding 44 for the second wicket with Arun Harinath before the latter edged Jim Allenby to slip.
Davies' stand with Zafar Ansari (37) was the most substantial, the pair putting on 85, but Leach's accuracy reaped rewards to dismiss Davies.
Ansari, Tom Curran and Gareth Batty fell in quick succession to Leach but Somerset were unable to find another breakthrough before a thunderstorm ended the day early.
