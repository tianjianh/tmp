Mr Paterson is best known for his work on Truly Madly Deeply, The Witches and Auf Wiedersehen Pet.
Earlier this year, he performed on stage with Brian Cox in Waiting for Godot as part of the 50th anniversary of Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum.
Channel 4 News' Dorothy Byrne and prop master David Balfour will also receive outstanding contribution awards.
The awards ceremony will take pace in Glasgow on Sunday, 15 November
Mr Paterson, who has been honoured for his work in film and television, said: "It was tremendous and entirely unexpected to be told I was to receive such a prestigious award.
"I'm delighted and looking forward to a wonderful evening - thank you so much to Bafta Scotland for such an incredible honour."
The Glasgow-born actor, who appeared in the Oscar winning film The Killing Fields, will next star in a Dad's Army movie.
Ms Byrne, who will receive an outstanding contribution to broadcasting award, has worked as a commissioning editor for Dispatches and has overseen Unreported World and Channel 4 News.
She said: "To be honoured in my homeland means a great deal to me. Some of the UK's best television has come out of Scotland where there is a vibrant creative sector which I believe has even more to offer.
"I am very proud that Bafta Scotland, which plays a key role, should have chosen to give this to me."
Mr Balfour has been awarded the outstanding contribution to craft award. He has created props for many Hollywood films including Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Maleficent and a new Jungle Book movie.
He said: "I was over the moon to hear I was to receive the outstanding contribution to craft award at this year's British Academy Scotland Awards.
"Having worked with some of the very best talent in Scotland on TV and film, it's incredible that this evening will shine a light on the amazing talent we have on our doorstep.  I can't wait for what is no doubt going to be a fantastic evening with my fellow Scots."
