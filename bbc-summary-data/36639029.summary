A Dundee man who tried to kill a friend moments after giving him a hug has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court was told that John McGrandle pushed David Kettles down a flight of stairs before stabbing him with a knife.
McGrandle later insisted Mr Kettles had injured himself during the incident in a common close last November.
The 42 year-old was convicted of attempted murder following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.
Mr Kettles told a jury that he had visited his girlfriend at her flat before going to a local shop.
When he returned, McGrandle was inside the close arguing with another resident, Robert Ramsay.
Mr Kettles let Mr Ramsay into his partner's home in a bid to "calm it down" before asking McGrandle to leave.
Mr Kettles said: "He cuddled me, said alright - and then pushed me downstairs."
He told the jury he then remembered blood "coming out" of him.
He initially thought he had been punched, but realised he had been stabbed.
Mr Kettles said: "It was definitely a knife. I saw the glint. He was taking his anger out on me. It was meant for Rab."
Judge Sean Murphy QC told McGrandle the assault had "potentially fatal consequences".
He also noted McGrandle had previous convictions for assault and possession of a knife.
The judge ordered McGrandle to be supervised for a further two years on his release.
