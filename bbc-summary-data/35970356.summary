The 23-year-old has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for the Wolves.
He could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC.
"With Jordan Tansey having returned to Wakefield, the opportunity for another outside back to come into the squad was there," managing director Richard Thewlis said.
