Matt Cranch, 23, of Newquay, Cornwall, plunged to the ground after being fired from a cannon at the Kent County Showground at Detling in April 2011.
He suffered multiple injuries when a safety net collapsed.
Kent Police said the case had been handed to Maidstone Borough Council to consider under health and safety laws.
Friends described Mr Cranch, who was originally from the Isle of Man, as "the definition of kindness".
Jacob Axtell said it was about the fifth time he had performed the stunt for Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show.
Stunts UK Ltd, which is based in St Just, near Penzance, Cornwall, cancelled a number of shows following Mr Cranch's death and said its stunt team was in "shock and grief" over his death.
Witnesses at the showground estimated he was launched up to 40ft (12m) into the air by the cannon before falling head-first into the safety net as it lay flat on the ground.
It is believed there were about 2,000 people in the crowd.
As well as the human cannonball stunt, the show also included pyrotechnics, motorcycle jumps and monster trucks.
