Eunice Lloyd and Olive Rowlands, from Ammanford, have been friends since they attended Nantygroes Primary School.
A joint celebration for their 100th birthdays was held at the Deri Arms in Llanedi on Tuesday.
The pair said it was more difficult than it used to be to visit one another, but they speak on the phone and attend a social group for the visually impaired together.
"I don't think we have had an argument," Mrs Lloyd said.
Mrs Rowlands said keeping active was her secret to a long and healthy life.
