888,246 poppies have been planted by people at the Tower since July this year, including politicians and members of the Royal family.
The exhibition was created by artist Paul Cummins and was created as part of the build up to Armistice day, to help remember those who fought in World War One.
Each ceramic poppy represents the life of a British or colonial soldier who died fighting in the Great War.
Martin went to visit the exhibition and find out why it has been so popular.
