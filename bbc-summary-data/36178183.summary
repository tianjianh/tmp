Dubliner Shiels won the Open race on his Cookstown BE Racing Suzuki and followed it up by taking victory in the feature event of the meeting.
Dunlop, 30, triumphed in the two Supersport 600cc races, aboard the CD Racing Yamaha.
Malachi Mitchell-Thomas came home first in the Supertwins and Magherafelt rider Paul Jordan enjoyed 125cc success.
The opening Supersport race, carried over from Friday, was reduced to five laps after Bolton man Mitchell-Thomas slipped off while holding second place, bringing the red flags out.
Dunlop added to his victory at Tandragee last week by taking the chequered flag from Manxman Dan Kneen, with Derek McGee from Mullingar third.
The Ballymoney man repeated the feat in race two, with McGee getting the better of Mar-Train Yamaha pilot Kneen to occupy the runner-up spot.
Sheils saw off the challenge of McGee in the Open race, with new road racing sensation Mitchell-Thomas completing the rostrum positions.
The 33-year-old former Irish champion made it a double by finishing ahead of team-mate Mitchell-Thomas in the main race of the day, with Kneen coming with a late charge to take third.
McGee, Dunlop and Waterford rider McCormack made up the top six.
