The Conference North side began talks with the X Factor contestant and I'm a Celebrity runner-up in January.
Quickenden, 26, who was a youth-team player for Scunthorpe United, has played at non-league level with Frickley Athletic and Bottesford Town.
Trinity chairman Richard Kane said a contract was possible if he impressed them at the pre-season trial.
Quickenden scored four goals last weekend when he played in a celebrity match to raise money for SwansAid, a Swansea City fund to encourage children and young people to become more active.
Mr Kane told BBC Radio Linconlshire the club is continuing to search for a striker.
"If he makes the grade we might give him a contract," he said.
"It is something we have talked about and something we have looked at.
"We watched him play in the celebrity match at Swansea where he scored four goals and if he does the same here, he might get a contract on the table."
His management did not respond to the BBC's request for a statement.
In January, Quickenden's management told the Daily Mail he had declined Trinity's offer and had been approached by other football clubs.
