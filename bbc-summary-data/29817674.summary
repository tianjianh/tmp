The incident happened at the shipping company it uses, Parcel Express, in the Moyraverty West Road area at the weekend.
The owner of Argento, Peter Boyle, said £80,000 of stock was stolen in the burglary.
He said the firm was due to launch the collection in its stores on Thursday.
It has offered £15,000 as a reward.
"We had a huge break-in at our shipping company Parcel Express in Craigavon. We had given them our Christmas stock to deliver on Friday night and unfortunately their warehouse was broken into some time between Friday and Sunday morning," he told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show.
"All of our Christmas stock has been stolen, some £80,000 worth of Pandora Christmas stock has gone. Most of the products have not even been released, so we are very upset and it is our biggest ever loss.
"We are hoping the reward may lead to some information for the return of the goods, that's what we are looking for.
"Effectively someone is stealing £1m of our sales or closing down one of our best stores."
