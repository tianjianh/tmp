[SN]TITLE[SN]
European Central Bank's Draghi hit by confetti protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A confetti-throwing protester has disrupted a European Central Bank (ECB) news conference, rushing on stage and screaming "end ECB dictatorship".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ECB chief Mario Draghi was delivering his opening remarks when a woman jumped on his desk, throwing paper and confetti at him.
She was restrained by security and the briefing restarted soon after.
Activists have previously targeted the ECB for its role in imposing austerity measures on some European countries.
Mr Draghi looked shocked during the incident, but later made light of it, joking he "would have to improvise" unless he found his script.
Sweeping confetti off his desk, he went on to say the eurozone economy was recovering thanks to a huge bond-buying plan.
