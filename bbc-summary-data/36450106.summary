Arsenal have made a bid for Jamie Vardy in an attempt to sign the England striker from Premier League champions Leicester City.

The offer is reported to be in the region of £20m and has triggered the release clause in his contract.
Vardy, who is currently preparing for Euro 2016, scored 24 goals for the Foxes as they were crowned champions in one of sport's biggest upsets.
The 29-year-old joined City in a £1m move from Fleetwood in 2012.
Vardy rose through non-league football after being released by Sheffield Wednesday at 16 for being too small.
Named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for 2015-16, he has scored three times in eight games for England since his debut in 2015.
Arsenal, who finished second in the league, have already signed Switzerland midfielder Granit Xhaka from Borussia Monchengladbach.
Former QPR winger Trevor Sinclair on BBC Radio 5 live: "I am a big believer in karma. He has won the Premier League, he is happy and has a great group of brothers around him. He is settled, so why move?
"When you are a striker you can be in top form but then go to a club, not hit the ground running and then it can gobble you up. I would stay where he is."
Ex-Everton winger Kevin Kilbane on BBC Radio 5 live: "When the big clubs come calling, they might not come again. I think you go.
"You want to test yourself against the best and with better players. Technically, Arsenal are a better side than Leicester."
