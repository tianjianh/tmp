Burton Albion have revealed an interest in Ross County's Liam Boyce but have not triggered a release clause for the Northern Ireland striker.

The 26-year-old was top scorer in the Scottish Premiership this season.
"He's a player that we are interested in, but that's as far as it has gone at the moment," said the Championship club's manager Nigel Clough.
He also told the Burton Mail that reports of his club triggering a Â£500,000 clause were inaccurate.
Boyce, who found the net for the 25th time this season in his country's 1-0 win over New Zealand this month, joined County from Cliftonville in 2014.
He still has a year left to run on his contract with the Dingwall club and manager Jim McIntyre said last month that they have no interest in selling the Northern Irishman.
Boyce, who spent a year with Werder Bremen in between two spells with Cliftonville, himself said he was in no rush to leave County.
If he was to join Burton, he would follow the path of Australia midfielder Jackson Irvine, who made the switch for an undisclosed fee last summer and who Clough admits they might struggle to hold on to.
Meanwhile, centre-half Ben Turner has ended speculation about his future by signing a new two-year contract with the Brewers.
The Birmingham-born 29-year-old former Coventry City and Cardiff City defender was brought to Burton by Clough a year ago in June 2016 on a one-year deal.
"We want to try to keep the nucleus and then add to it from there," added Clough. "It is important because it gives you that continuity and they know what we are about and what to expect in the Championship next season.
"It is important we add some different kind of players. The squad's still looking thin. We are certainly trying to get a few permanent signings in and two or three loans as well."
