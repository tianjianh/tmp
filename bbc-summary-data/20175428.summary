Danny McKay, 36, was shot dead at his home on Longlands Road in Newtownabbey last Thursday at 20:30 BST.
Before the murder, five masked men entered a house at Dunore Court in Belfast's New Lodge and forced the occupant to hand over his VW Bora.
At 20:50 BST the VW was found burnt-out in Ardmoulin Place in the Falls. Police believe the incidents are linked.
Detectives from the PSNI's serious crime branch, working with uniformed officers, returned to all three locations on Thursday to talk to local people and passers-by.
The officer leading the investigation, DCI John McVea, said: "We have made a number of arrests but this investigation will continue for some time. This was a brutal murder and we are asking for people's assistance."
He said they were also keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a dark coloured saloon car "being driven in a suspicious manner" in the Longlands area in the days before the murder.
"Our final appeal is about a man with a light-coloured top seen running away from the burning car at Ardmoulin Place. If you can provide information about this, we need to hear from you," he added.
A 25-year-old man was arrested by police on Thursday morning in north Belfast and is being questioned about the murder at Antrim police station. A number of other people arrested in connection with the killing have been released.
