FGM: UK police seek to block 'practitioner's' visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are asking the Home Office to prevent a "high profile" woman who allegedly carries out Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) from entering the UK.

The Met Police applied to the High Court for two protection orders to try to block the woman's visit.
Police barrister Zimran Samuel told the court the visitor had "high profile status" in her field.
But Mr Justice Holman rejected the applications on the grounds it was a matter for the home secretary instead.
The police applied to the court after being contacted by a victim of FGM in her 40s, who made them aware of the woman's intentions to visit the UK.
The country the woman is from still allows FGM operations to take place.
A spokesman for the Met Police said it accepted the court's decision.
He added: "[The force] is now liaising with the Home Office regarding what other options are available to prevent the entry into the UK of a person who may wish to carry out FGM."
What is the first thing you notice after FGM?
First ever FGM figures show nearly 6,000 new cases in England
FGM is child abuse, says UN Population Fund chief
Det Supt Wendy Morgan, from the police's sexual offences command, said FGM "constitutes child abuse".
"Police have a responsibility to act to protect vulnerable people and prevent people, especially the vulnerable, from becoming victims of crime. The Met will always to seek to follow the law to carry out this responsibility," she added.
The scale of FGM in the UK remains unknown because of a lack of reliable data, but the government estimates 170,000 women and girls have undergone the procedure.
FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and the law was strengthened in 2003 to prevent girls travelling from the UK and undergoing FGM abroad.
The World Health Organization (WHO) described FGM as "procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".
The procedure has no health benefits and the operations can cause severe bleeding, problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.
Africa, the Middle East and Asia are where the majority of FGM is concentrated.
Last week, a group of MPs published a report that said the failure to successfully prosecute a single case of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK was a "national scandal".
Only one FGM prosecution has been brought to trial since 1985 and both defendants in that case were cleared last year
