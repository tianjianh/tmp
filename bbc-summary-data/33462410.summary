The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found problems at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust raised in 2013 had still not been addressed.
They carried out their inspection in March.
The trust said it was "a fair judgement" and apologised, saying action was being taken.
Inspectors visited centres including Bradgate, Oakham House and Lakeside House.
While staff were praised for compassion and kindness, inspectors said "urgent action" was needed to address safety concerns including:
The CQC raised issues in 2013 over staffing levels, risk assessments and physical health care. Inspectors found some of these areas were still not adequate.
Trust chief executive Dr Peter Miller apologised and "fully accepted" some services still needed improving.
"Overall the service on the Bradgate unit requires improvement but has received a 'good' for being caring and compassionate, and that really means a lot to me," he said.
"But in terms of physical environments and getting staffing levels right, there is still a lot to do.
"What those staff do is work in very difficult circumstances with huge and growing demands... They work incredibly hard even in those circumstances."
