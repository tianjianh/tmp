Shaun Harrad volleyed home his third goal in as many games to give Wrexham the lead in the final minute of a poor first half.
Blair Turgott found himself unmarked in the Wrexham area to fire past Shwan Jalal and bring Bromley level.
But Gerry McDonagh secured Wrexham's win with 10 minutes remaining.
The Dragons, with Dean Keates and Andy Davies in caretaker charge, move up to 14th in the table while Bromley fall to 17th.
Wrexham caretaker manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "I couldn't be more proud of the lads.
"They've gone out and shown great character. It was about stopping the rote - the club's not been on a good run.
"It's just positive that we got the result and I'm over the moon for the lads. They've turned it around and got a 2-1 victory they fully deserved."
