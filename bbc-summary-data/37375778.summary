Alviro Petersen: Lancashire batsman to miss final match of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former South Africa batsman Alviro Petersen will miss Lancashire's final Championship game of the season and is returning home for personal reasons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Petersen, 35, has been with the county for two years and has the option to extend his stay in 2017.
He has scored 1,134 Championship runs this season, second only to 19-year-old Haseeb Hameed.
Ashley Giles' side need 11 points from next week's game against Warwickshire to ensure Division One survival.
