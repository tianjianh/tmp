Charlie Clapham: Southport chairman and vice-chairman stand down from club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport chairman Charlie Clapham has stood down with immediate effect, along with vice-chairman Sam Shrouder following National League relegation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clapham said his position had become "untenable" following criticism in the media and on social media.
The decision followed on from the news that three directors, including Shrouder, would step aside in June.
Director Nigel Allen will take on the chairmanship on an interim basis while new investors are sought.
Clapham added: "(Directors) Nigel Allen and Liam Watson are considering their positions, Nigel has agreed to act as Interim Chairman until the 30 June 2017 during which time the board will seek a meeting with the Trust in Yellow Board to establish their views for the future as the call for change has come from them following the Open Meeting.
"The board will urgently seek to establish any level of interest in bringing in investors who may wish to take a controlling interest in the ownership of the club."
After their relegation from the National League was confirmed following defeat by Dover Athletic, Southport beat promotion-chasing Forest Green Rovers - only their third win of 2017.
