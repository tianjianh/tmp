[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six people have been taken to hospital following a series of road accidents as severe weather battered Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three of those people were involved in a two-car crash in Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham.
Another person needed hospital treatment in Carmarthenshire following a crash, while in Welshpool a car overturned in tricky conditions.
Two cyclists needed treatment skidding on ice and fell from their bikes on the coastal path in Llanddulas, Conwy.
Elsewhere a gritting lorry overturned in difficult conditions and a school bus skidded on ice.
The lorry's two men onboard were not hurt. It ended up on its side on the B4299 between Trelech and Bryn Iwan on Tuesday night just before 20:00 GMT.
Carmarthenshire council's Colin Evans said gritters would still be out in force where needed.
"This incident will not have an effect any future gritting as we have reserve vehicles," he said.
"Gritters will remain on primary routes until conditions are judged to be safe. They will then divert to secondary routes on higher ground, although conditions are expected to improve rapidly as the morning progresses."
In Wattstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, a bus carrying six schoolchildren skidded and nearly hit a wall. No-one was hurt.
Angela Slee said: "The only thing stopping the bus sliding further down the hill were some rocks that the bus escort had put under the wheels."
Two other people needed hospital treatment a tornado hit their home.
