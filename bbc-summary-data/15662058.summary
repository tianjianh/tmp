Anni Dewani: Candlelit vigils for South Africa murder victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Candlelit vigils have been held a year on from the shooting of Anni Dewani during her honeymoon in South Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mrs Dewani, 28, died after the car she was travelling in with her husband, Shrien, 31, was hijacked in Cape Town.
The vigils were held on 13 November in Bristol, London, Cape Town and also Sweden where she was born.
South African authorities have applied to have Mr Dewani extradited over claims he was involved in her murder. He denies the charges.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo from Bothasig, Cape Town, has been jailed for 18 years for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice after agreeing a plea bargain.
Mr Dewani, from Bristol, faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing the administration of justice.
Mr Dewani's extradition was backed by Home Secretary Theresa May after a judge approved the move in August.
An appeal has been lodged with the High Court.
Mrs Dewani's uncle, Manoj Panchmatia, who helped organise the vigils, said it had been "a very difficult year for the family".
"We are all looking for some form of closure," he added.
Mr Panchmatia said the idea had come from users of Facebook who wanted to do "something special".
He said the family had received hundreds of emails from people saying they planned to light a candle.
The vigils, including one in Harrow, north London, where Mrs Dewani lived with relatives before getting married, were scheduled for 17:30 GMT.
Two other men, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, are also charged with murder, as well as kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances and will go on trial at the Western Cape High Court next year.
Mrs Dewani was shot after a cab the couple were travelling in was hijacked in the Gugulethu township.
Mr Dewani was released unharmed but Mrs Dewani's body was later found in the abandoned car.
