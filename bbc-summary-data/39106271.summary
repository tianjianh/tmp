The firm, which already has a base in Aberdeen, will open an office in Edinburgh with several partners and up to 20 staff.
The office will be based in Princes Street and focus on the firm's key sectors, including energy, financial institutions and real estate.
Bond Dickinson did not say when the new base would open.
Managing partner Jonathan Blair said: "We wanted a second office in Scotland to support our clients and Edinburgh was a natural choice, being at the heart of Scotland's central belt.
"The firm's growth strategy includes increasing our presence in both domestic and international markets where the opportunities to do more work for our clients exist.
"Our approach to growth and investment has always been in response to client demand.
"Over the past year we have heard from more and more clients that they are keen that we have an Edinburgh presence, so that we are on hand when they need us."
