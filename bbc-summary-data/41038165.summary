Snodgrass, 29, previously played under Villa boss Steve Bruce at Hull City.
Hull sold the Scotland international to West Ham for Â£10m in January but he fell out of favour at the London Stadium and has not played this season.
"I am delighted to join. I have had offers from other clubs but it was an easy decision to come here," he told Villa's website.
"You see the name Aston Villa with all its history, tradition, fan base and it's a place you want to come to.
"Seeing it in the Championship doesn't look right. I want to be part of that journey back up to the Premier League. I am raring to go."
Snodgrass, capped 24 times by his country, began his career with Livingston and had spells at Leeds United and Norwich City before joining Hull in 2014.
