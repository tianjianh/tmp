Tim Wiese: Bundesliga 'bad guy' set for WWE wrestling debut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's the classic sporting story: make 269 Bundesliga appearances, get banished from first-team football with three years left on your contract, hit the gym in your spare time and become a WWE wrestler.

Yes, former Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese will make his full World Wrestling Entertainment debut on Thursday night in Munich.
The 34-year-old has been on a strict diet and training regime, packing on 40kg (88lb) of muscle.
"I was a big WWE fan when I was a boy," he told AFP. "I kept track of it during my football career but never thought of myself as a wrestler."
Wiese won six caps for Germany between 2008 and 2012, and was part of the squad for the 2010 World Cup.
He joined Hoffenheim from Werder Bremen in May 2012 but, after being fined by Hoffenheim in 2013 for being thrown out of a party, he was exiled from the first team.
It at least gave him plenty of time to lift weights.
"I didn't take it seriously as first, then things became more concrete," he said.
"It's been a long time since I worked as hard as I did in the last few weeks."
Having seen out his contract, which ended this year, Wiese increased his training regime and is now eating more than 1kg of meat every day.
"This is Champions League. WWE is the biggest thing in wrestling, so I'm fully focused and blending out everything else around me," he said.
"I think I'll be playing the role of the bad guy - I'm being pushed in that direction, but that's OK.
"In football, I was already the bad guy who opposition fans would insult. It doesn't bother me. They can all hate me."
At 1.93m (6ft 4in) and weighing about 130kg (20st 6lb), Weise says he is not afraid of injuries in the ring.
"I don't care. I will hurt them, they won't hurt me. Anyone can have a go: I'm going to be unbeatable."
