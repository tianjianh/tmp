[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools goalkeeper Joe Fryer made an 11th-minute save to deny Brennan Dickenson, who also fired straight at Fryer midway through the first half.
Chris Porter had an effort disallowed for offside and Sean Murray's deflected effort whistled just over for Colchester, for whom George Elokobi came close to converting at the far post before half-time.
Pools striker Padraig Amond steered Brad Walker's curled ball into the area over from close range early in the second half.
But Colchester went ahead just after the hour mark when Kurtis Guthrie headed home Richard Brindley's cross at the near post after a fine attacking move.
Porter doubled Colchester's lead from the penalty spot with 12 minutes remaining after Guthrie had been fouled by Liam Donnelly in the area.
Pools halved the deficit four minutes later through Nathan Thomas, who burst into the area and planted a low shot past Colchester goalkeeper Sam Walker, but the hosts held on.
