Double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones says she will not make the same mistakes after Rio as she did four years ago when she suffered a dip in morale and form.

Jones successfully defended her title by defeating Spain's Eva Calvo Gomez in the -57kg category at Rio 2016.
The 23-year-old said she had found it hard to stay motivated after winning London 2012 gold.
"I've learnt a lot of lessons from London and I'm a lot wiser," she said.
"I know you have to take a good enough break to mentally refresh and just to have a bit of time to yourself and enjoy the success rather than get back in the gym."
Flint's Jones became the youngest British athlete to successfully defend an Olympic title following her 16-7 victory over rival Calvo Gomez.
Jones had already confirmed she wants to defend her Olympic taekwondo title at Tokyo 2020, where victory would secure her place in the sport's history books.
"No-one in taekwondo has ever done three Olympic gold medals," Jones told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It's amazing to be on the same page as [two-time Olympic champions] Wu Jingyu and Steven Lopez, they're legends in taekwondo.
"They'll be retired and I can do one better and get three gold medals. It definitely spurs me on to think I can do that."
Jones could be joined in Tokyo by her fellow Welsh taekwondo athlete Lauren Williams.
Williams won 67kg gold in her first senior major final at the European Taekwondo Championships in May.
"She's a great training partner in the gym and she really pushed me for Rio so she's really helped a lot," Jones added.
"She's only 17 and already such a talent so she's definitely one to watch."
