Nearly 10,500 - mostly sea trout and salmon - passed over the fish counter at Riding Mill in Northumberland in July.
This is 1,200 more than the previous record in 2010, the agency said.
Environmental monitoring officer Morton Heddell-Cowie said: "This is good news as it indicates healthy stocks and a healthy river."
The total number of fish returning to the Tyne in 2015 is 14,466, which is 800 more than the highest number previously recorded at the same time of year, the agency said.
