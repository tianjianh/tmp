Premiership: John Hughes not seeking Inverness talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager John Hughes insists he is not urgently looking for contract talks with his chairman despite being in the final year of his deal.

Hughes has been linked with the vacant Dundee United post and, after his sides's 2-1 win over Ross County, told BBC Scotland he does get frustrated at being unable to build a team.
"I'm content up here right at this moment in time," he said.
"I understand the way this club works."
Hughes continued: "My only frustration at his club at times is coming up against teams like Aberdeen and Dundee United and they've got Billy McKays and Graham Shinnies.
"You want to keep trying to build a team, that's my only frustration, but the part you play in Scottish football is if you produce then the bigger fish come calling and I'm delighted to give guys that stage."
When asked if that applies to managers, he answered, "100%, I can only give you, you're flattered to be linked.
"Until there's any contact with the chairman then I'll remain Inverness manager unless he sees different. If he says: 'come on, we'll sit down, get a contract worked out,' I'm easy.
"I really enjoy it up here; I love working with these guys. I think I can make them better.
"When you get a wee nugget like Miles Storey, maybe losing McKays and Shinnies, it makes it worthwhile."
Hughes was delighted with goalscorer Storey, who netted his fourth goal in five games since joining on loan from Swindon Town.
"Miles Storey is rapid quick," he said. "It's all credit to the chairman who came in with the name actually.
"Everything that a loan deal is meant to do: come up play football, stay injury free, score goals and go and take the platform. It's working for him.
"We were hanging in there for the last five minutes, but we've got that spirit.
"That's six unbeaten now and, with the injuries that we've got, I take my hat off to these boys."
County manager Jim McIntyre bemoaned a lack of concentration that cost his side the match as half-time approached.
"We've switched off for the first goal and took ourselves out of position too easily and then not fended a corner, which is unlike us," he said.
"You've got to look at the chance for Michael Gardyne after 18 minutes.
"I thought second half the players gave everything. We just didn't have the final piece of quality."
Goalkeeper Scott Fox was stretchered off after falling awkwardly with a clear diagnosis uncertain, but the suspicion is that he may have ankle ligament damage.
