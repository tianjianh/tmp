The 32-year-old Northern Irishman held off Graeme Thomas and Angus Groom in the single scull to move within one of the record held by Katherine Grainger.
There was also a fourth consecutive win for Moe Sbihi, while Heather Stanning, Helen Glover, Alex Gregory and Vicky Thornley enjoyed their third victories.
The results will help decide the crews for May's European Championships.
The event in Germany will also help determine which rower is in which boat for the Olympic Games, which take place in Rio in August.
"We still have some questions as we move towards our crew formation but we got good information from these trials," said performance director Sir David Tanner.
