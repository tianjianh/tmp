[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Foreign Office has launched a review into whether its overseas aid is being used "effectively".

It comes as the Sun reported thousands of pounds of Foreign Office aid was spent on a TV gameshow and on finding female mates for an endangered fish.
The Foreign Office said most of its aid promoted prosperity and stability, but the review would ensure every penny represented "value for money".
The UK government's total overseas aid budget last year was £12bn.
About 87% of the government's aid budget is managed by the Department for International Development, with the remaining money distributed by other departments - including the Foreign Office.
The government says international aid is used to help an estimated 1.4 billion people around the world living in poverty.
A list published by the Foreign Office showed almost £14,000 for its aid budget was spent producing a gameshow for Ethiopian television that aims to teach young people there about British values.
A project to measure the carbon footprint of the Dakar rally cost more than £13,000.
According to the Sun, almost £7,000 was used in an anti-litter drive in Jordan, while a project to promote "safe and responsible" use of Facebook in Laos, south east Asia, cost £970.
A project to help find female mates for endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in Madagascar cost £3,400, the paper said, while £5,000 was allegedly spent on workshops about Shakespeare's Hamlet, in Ecuador.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said a source close to the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told him there had "clearly been a lack of scrutiny on some expenditure".
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Foreign Secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCO's aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money.
"Building closer relationships with growing economies is important.
"The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show taxpayers' cash is being spent wisely."
In March, legislation was passed making it a legal requirement for 0.7% of UK's annual national income to be spent on international development.
The private members bill was originally tabled by former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore in the Commons and received Royal Assent on 26 March.
