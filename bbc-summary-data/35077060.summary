Flooding has affected some roads as well as rail services.
Natural Resources Wales has issued several flood warnings across mid and north Wales.
The Met Office said up to 6cm (2in) of rain could fall on Saturday.
The warning, from 08:00 GMT to 20:00, also said snow could fall on higher ground in north Wales.
At Capel Curig in Snowdonia there were gusts of nearly 70mph (112km/h).
Rail lines closed due to flooding
Arriva Trains Wales said it may be unable to provide a replacement bus service for Cambrian line travellers.
"Due to the situation with the roads, we cannot guarantee a service will be provided. We are strongly advising people not to travel unless absolutely necessary." said a spokesman.
Passengers are being advised to check if their trains are running before setting off.

Several roads have been closed due to flooding, including the A494 at Bala, Gwynedd.
There are also reports of flooding on parts of the A55 with one lane closed westbound between J14 and J12 near Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd.
On Anglesey, drivers of high-sided vehicles are being advised to avoid the A55 Britannia Bridge due to strong winds.
Conwy and Denbigh Castle tweeted that "severe weather" had forced them to shut temporarily, although their shops remain open.
The weather alert covers north Wales and Ceredigion.
The flood warnings cover the Lower Dee Valley, near Wrexham; Llanrwst and Trefriw in Conwy county; rivers Mawddach, Wnion and the town of Dolgellau in Gwynedd; and the Dyfi Valley north of Machynlleth, Powys.
