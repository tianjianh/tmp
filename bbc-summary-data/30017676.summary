The Ann Maguire Fund was started by her family in April to support young people in Leeds.
Sally-Ann Greenfield, chief executive of Leeds Community Foundation, has worked with the family and said: "The response has been incredible".
The fund will be open for grant applications by the end of November.
Mrs Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death in a classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April, as she held a Spanish lesson.
Sixteen-year-old Will Cornick has been told he must serve a minimum of 20 years in custody after he admitted her murder.
In a previous statement Mrs Maguire's daughters, Kerry and Emma, said: "Mum had a special talent for developing opportunities for young people and we hope the charity will do the same.
"She taught for 40 years and affected thousands of pupils' lives and we feel her legacy should be something that continues this work and what she gave to people."
Mrs Maguire's family has issued a statement thanking the public for their contributions to the Ann Maguire Arts Education Fund.
The statement said: "The family would like to express our thanks for all the messages of support and kindnesses shown to us and the wonderful tributes to Ann. They have been a great comfort to us and we are very grateful.
"This is a very difficult time for the family and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.
"We want to look for the good that can come out of this tragedy and focus on what was important to Ann. This was about helping others, especially young people, in developing their potential."
The fund is open to Leeds-based community groups who provide activities for young people. They can apply for a grant of up to £1,500.
