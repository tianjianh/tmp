The Britons, considered gold medal prospects at Rio 2016, were fourth in their semi-final, a race won by Poland.
Alan Campbell also failed to make the A final after finishing fifth in the single sculls in Brandenburg, Germany.
GB will have 13 crews in Sunday's A finals, which will be shown live on the BBC Red Button from 08:30 BST.
The competition schedule has been moved forward by an hour to avoid increasingly high winds at the venue.
Britain's chances of gold will be headed by Olympic, world and defending European champions Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the women's pair, and the men's four of Olympic champion Alex Gregory, Mohamed Sbihi, George Nash and Constantine Louloudis.
The men's and women's eight crews will also be aiming for success after strong showings in their heats on Friday where seven British crews qualified for the finals.
That includes 40-year-old Katherine Grainger, who is aiming to become Britain's most decorated female Olympian in Rio, as she lines up alongside Vicky Thornley in the women's double sculls.
A further six crews joined them from Saturday's semis which included a win for Stewart Innes and Alan Sinclair in the men's pair, a third place for John Collins and Jonny Walton in the men's double sculls, and good finishes from both Britain's quadruple sculls.
