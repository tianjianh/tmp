[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 0-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover Athletic did little to enhance their play-off prospects with a uneventful goalless draw against Solihull Moors at the Crabble Athletic Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
League-leading scorer Ricky Miller had a goal-bound effort saved by Solihull goalkeeper Nathan Baxter, while Dover defender Aswad Thomas also went close, with a strike cleared off the line by Liam Daly.
Matters scarcely improved after the interval, as Solihull worked hard to prevent Dover from finding space and breaking through their back line.
Ross Lafayette nearly won it for the home side late on, but Baxter tipped the effort over the bar.
