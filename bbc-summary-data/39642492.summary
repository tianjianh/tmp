[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Clark, 45, of Portland Road, Leicester, tried to get a child to engage in sexual activity and made indecent images of a child.
Recorder Stuart Sprawson sentenced him to a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years at Leicester Crown Court.
Clark resigned as the chief executive of The Mighty Creatives after the offences came to light in January 2016.

In October of that year, he admitted three counts of making indecent photographs of a child between March 2006 and October 2014.
Last month, Clark changed his plea to guilty to attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity between 18 April and 11 May 2012.
Clark, from the Clarendon Park area, served as the charity's boss for more than seven years.
In addition to the sexual harm prevention order, he was also given a community order for three years, told to attend a sex offenders programme and added to the sex offenders register.
In a statement, the Leicester-based charity said: "As soon as police alerted the organisation to the allegations against Mr Clark, immediate and appropriate action was taken, which led to his subsequent resignation.
"The police did not pursue any lines of enquiry in relation to the work of the charity."
Founded in 2009, the charity said it develops opportunities for young people to "fulfil their creative potential".
