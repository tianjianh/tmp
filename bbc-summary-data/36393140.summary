Leyton Orient ex-football director loses wrongful dismissal claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient's former director of football has lost his £100,000 wrongful dismissal claim at the High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mauro Milanese took up the post in July 2014 but was dismissed from the League Two club in January 2015 following claims of "serious misconduct".
The club cited the breaking of good faith as one of the grounds for the ex-Italian international's dismissal.
Mrs Justice Whipple upheld the club's dismissal ruling at a hearing in London earlier.
Of the six grounds given for sacking the 44-year-old, only one - described by the judge as "by far and away the most serious" - was upheld.
It related to his handling of an agreement involving an academy player, whose name was not disclosed to the court.
The judge ruled Milanese's involvement was a very serious breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, and constituted gross misconduct.
She said the other issues relating to the transfer of two players, setting up his own business, accepting secret profits in connection with a transfer deal and overspending on players did not constitute gross misconduct.
Justice Whipple said the former director of football was however entitled to £8,300 worth of damages from the club for accrued salary and expenses.
Milanese, who was not present in court, was ordered to pay £100,000 court costs.
