The hosts took the lead when John Brayford volleyed home from the edge of the box before Ryan Flynn doubled the Blades' lead with a fine solo effort.
Curtis Main forced Blades keeper George Long into a fine save and then nearly scored with a shot that hit the bar.
The hosts wrapped up three points when Brayford played in Billy Sharp who fired a powerful effort home.
The Blades, who this week released defender Neill Collins so that he could join US side Tampa Bay Rowdies, remain in 11th place in the League One table and are now six points off the play-off places.
Oldham, meanwhile, lie in 22nd place, three points off safety but with two games in hand on their relegation rivals.
Oldham Athletic manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We were flat. It's probably the flattest we've been since I came here. But I felt really good before the game because we've trained really well.
""I don't want to be on a downer too much. We've lost a game of football.
"We didn't deserve anything from it. It's a disappointing performance but hopefully it's a one-off."
