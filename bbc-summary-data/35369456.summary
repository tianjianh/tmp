Sadie Hartley, 60, was discovered with multiple stab wounds at her house in Rossendale, Lancashire on Friday night.
Katrina Walsh, 55, of Hare Lane, Chester, will appear at Blackburn Magistrates' Court later.
Sarah Williams, 34, of Treborth Road, Blacon, Chester, was remanded in custody on Wednesday by magistrates in Blackburn.
She is due before Preston Crown Court on 22 January.
Ms Hartley, who was the director of her own medical communications business Hartley Taylor, based in Knutsford, Cheshire, was last seen alive on Thursday at a conference in Manchester.
Detectives are continuing to appeal for help tracing several people seen near her home on Thursday evening, including the driver of a passing car.
Paying tribute, Ms Hartley's partner Ian Johnston said: "It is an utter tragedy that she has been taken so unnecessarily from us and will be sadly missed by all those who knew her."
