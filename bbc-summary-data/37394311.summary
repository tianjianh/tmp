[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in the last 10 minutes extended Falkirk's winning run to five games in the league and cup and helped them get the better of Ayr United.

They also move on to 13 points and a little closer to the teams at the top.
Daryll Meggatt's unfortunate own goal broke the deadlock and gave Peter Houston's men the lead.
And Lee Miller made sure of the three points when he latched onto John Rankin's pass and finished beyond Greg Fleming.
The first half just did not live up to the billing with Bob McHugh and Gary Harkins exchanging early shots at goal before Luca Gasparotto's header just scraped his own post.
Kevin Nisbet cleared a Luke Leahy header which might have forced a save from Ayr keeper Greg Fleming.
The visitors were much brighter at the start of the second period and Nisbet hit a stunning 25 heard volley which Danny Rogers tipped over.
Then Brian Gilmour was inches away from giving Ayr what would have been a deserved lead.
Both managers made changes to try and get the breakthrough, but it was the home side who took the lead when McCracken's effort was deflected past his own keeper by Daryll Meggatt.
Substitute Miller eased the home nerves with a terrific goal, taking a Rankin pass and turning his defender on the six yard line to side foot past Fleming for his fourth goal of the season.
Falkirk will play better and lose and result is more than a little harsh on Ayr.
