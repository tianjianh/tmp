Wasps' Elliot Daly has the potential to become the "next Jason Robinson", says England coach Eddie Jones.

Daly, 24, started on the left wing in England's 58-15 rout of Fiji on Saturday and scored his first try in his seventh international appearance.
"He does things you don't coach. We give him a roving role but he's got a good sense for the game," said Jones.
He's a public schoolboy, holds up the trophy, has beautiful manicured hair
"If you think back to the last England winger who was good like that - a bloke called Jason Robinson."
Robinson won 51 caps and scored a try for England in the 2003 World Cup final victory over Australia.
"He made England into one of the best attacking teams in the world because of his ability to go anywhere in the line and attack," added Jones.
"Elliot has got the qualities to be able to give us another attacking option that's very hard to defend against."
Daly won five caps as a replacement during England's 2016 Six Nations Grand Slam triumph but has been first choice this autumn, taking the place of Jonathan Joseph at outside centre against South Africa and was then picked ahead of Jonny May on the left wing for the match against Fiji.
Jones added: "Elliot has become a lot more serious about his rugby. He's been blessed with talent. He's a public schoolboy, holds up the trophy, has beautiful manicured hair."
