Curtis Davies turned in the opener from a corner and Robert Snodgrass made it 2-0 by heading home a Sone Aluko cross.
Mohamed Diame's long-range effort into the bottom corner and Aluko's strike sealed the win against the relegation-threatened Robins after the break.
Hull remain fourth, but are just three points behind third-placed Brighton.
The Tigers also have a game in hand on Burnley and Albion - who earlier drew a thrilling match against the Clarets at the Amex Stadium.
Bristol City, who remain six points clear of the relegation zone following Fulham's win over Milton Keynes, created several chances, but never looked like earning a fifth win in six away games.
Tigers keeper Allan McGregor made a couple of decent saves, Jonathan Kodjia had an effort ruled out for offside and substitute Luke Freeman hit the post late on.
But Hull, who have let in just six goals in 2016, the lowest tally of any Championship club, eased to victory.
Hull manager Steve Bruce:

"Look there's been nothing really wrong with the performances.
"We've had more attempts, more shots, more crosses, more final-third entries than any other club in the division.
"However, the one statistic which is the stand out one is that we haven't been able to score for whatever reason and that's been frustrating.
"Once we scored then there was a calmness about us which was good to see."
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
"I thought we were still in the game at 1-0, we looked slick on the break but inevitably we didn't get too many breaks in the game and unfortunately their quality was too much for us.
"The Championship is relentless and the games keep coming thick and fast so we just have to pick the boys up because we have a massive game on Tuesday and it almost becomes a cup final for us.
"Rotherham are in good form and (we were in) good form before today, it's two outstanding runs. It almost becomes one of those mini six-pointers.
