Huw Jones: Scottish Rugby keen on Western Province centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Rugby have enquired about bringing Western Province centre Huw Jones to Edinburgh or Glasgow Warriors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland cap Jones, 22, is contracted to WP until October and also represents Super Rugby side Stormers.
Edinburgh-born Jones scored two tries as Scotland lost 23-22 to Australia at Murrayfield on Saturday.
WP have been dealing with financial concerns, and recently obtained a court order for the provisional liquidation of their commercial arm.
The union, a 75% shareholder in their commercial arm, said at the time that WP's teams would continue to function as normal and that the contracts of players remain secure.
Warriors having tracked Jones' development since the centre was enrolled at the University of Cape Town in 2014.

Enquiries have been made regarding a possible transfer fee, paid by Scottish Rugby to WP to negotiate the early release of Jones, but the province are believed to be resistant to this route.
The player's agent has told BBC Scotland his client is "very happy" in South Africa while Scottish Rugby declined to comment.
The Super Rugby season begins in late February and ends in July, but under World Rugby Regulation 9, clubs must release selected players during international windows, meaning Stormers would be without Jones during the Six Nations Championship, should he be included in Scotland's squad.
Jones was Western Province's top try-scorer in this summer's Currie Cup, with seven. He earned his first Scotland cap as a replacement in the second Test of the June tour of Japan before making his maiden international start against the Wallabies.
