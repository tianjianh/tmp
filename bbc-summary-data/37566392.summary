York City boss Jackie McNamara says he will resign if the team fail to achieve a "positive" result in Saturday's National League game at Braintree.

The Scot met the club chairman on Wednesday following a 6-1 defeat at Guiseley the previous evening.
"Sometimes the easiest thing to do is to just walk away, hold your hands up and let somebody else come in," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
The former Scotland defender, 42, was appointed last November.
He was unable to save them from relegation out of the Football League last season and they are currently 20th in the National League table.
McNamara said it was his idea to release a club statement which indicated he was considering his position at Bootham Crescent.
"Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to stand up and fight and try and change it," he explained.
"I brought in a lot of players in the summer, to try and change things from last year. It does take time, some of them have come from a lower level, but I brought them here and I'll take responsibility for that and if it doesn't work then it's my fault."
The Minstermen have won only eight games since McNamara, who previously managed Dundee United and Partick Thistle, replaced Russ Wilcox as boss.
York took the lead at Guiseley through Matt Fry, but then fell apart in a game held up for 37 minutes following a floodlight failure.
A spectator later went on to the pitch to confront McNamara, who afterwards told the club website that his team had gone "into their little shells" and failed to handle "the pressure side of things with an intimidating atmosphere".
"Last night was unsavoury," added McNamara on 5 live. "But I think there has been a lot of things off the field, nothing to do with football, that have been quite personal that you have to face up to.
"Again that's part and parcel of being a football manager and being in the spotlight."
The earlier statement had announced: "It has been decided that, if the team fails to gain a positive result at Braintree Town on Saturday, the York City manager will tender his resignation.
"The manager will be looking for a passionate and committed reaction from the players after the capitulation at Nethermoor Park on Tuesday evening."
