The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, headbutted and punched PC Gwen Louden in the court's foyer on Thursday.
It is understood that the officer had facial injuries X-rayed at Dundee's Ninewells Hosptal.
The girl admitted a charge of assault to injury at a hearing on Friday.
The teenager had been thrown out of the building's main courtroom as a result of her behaviour while other cases were being heard.
She was then asked to leave the court entirely before confronting PC Loudon and another officer.
David Duncan, defending, said: "The only question here is her status between now and sentencing."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael granted bail and deferred sentence until February for social work background reports and an update on an existing community payback order
