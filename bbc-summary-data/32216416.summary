It's not easy growing up with famous parents and being compared to them, according to Demi Moore's daughter.

Twenty-six-year-old Rumer Willis revealed on Dancing with Stars that she was bullied as a teenager for not being seen to be as beautiful as her mother.
She said that people thought she looked masculine like her action hero father Bruce Willis and considered having plastic surgery.
Her interview had Demi Moore in tears in the audience of the show.
Rumer was starring in the 20th season of the dancing competition, which is a US version of Strictly Come Dancing, and safely got through episode three with partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy.
The actress said: "People would say I looked like a man or something called a 'buttaface', which means everything good but her face, or potato head was the big term that everyone used a lot, basically making fun of the way I looked.
"My mom, who is one of the most stunning women I've ever met and who everyone was comparing me to, saying that you look more like your very masculine father than your beautiful mom.
"For years I thought, 'Maybe I can get plastic surgery. If I change my face or get really skinny, that will be it, that will be the answer' and it's not.
"When you grow up with parents that are known worldwide and having so much attention from media and all of the tabloid magazines, it's really tough.
"When I was a teenager I was super-awkward, I don't think I really felt comfortable in my body or with how I looked and people were nasty."
Rumer has two younger sisters and has starred in films with both her parents.
