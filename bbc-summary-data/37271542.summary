The hosts dominated in a dour game as Northern Ireland played their first match since the Euro 2016 finals.
"I'm happy with a point - we showed great spirit when they put us under pressure in the second half," he said.
"The first half was good and we broke on the counter-attack but our final ball or run was disappointing."
Northern Ireland rarely threatened in a disjointed and sluggish display and only poor finishing from the Czechs saw O'Neill's side make an unbeaten start in Group C.
O'Neill is on course to achieve an early points target but he is concerned that some of his players are missing out on first-team club action.
"We said at the outset that we want seven points from our first four qualifiers," O'Neill told Sky Sports.
"This sets us on our way and we have to win our home games against San Marino and Azerbaijan.
"It showed in the second half that three or four players have not been playing club football.
"It would be great if we had players who were playing on a regular basis."
This group includes Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty, who struggled to make an impact and was substituted before the hour mark.
Jonny Evans was Northern Ireland's top performer in Prague, with the West Brom defender a formidable barrier against the Czechs.
"I'm satisfied to get a draw from the game - they had a lot of pressure near the end and we battled hard to keep a clean sheet," said Evans.
"You could see the effort we put in throughout the side and it's always important to take something from the opening game."
