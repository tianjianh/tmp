Carwyn Edwards, 39, has been in hospital in Tucson, Arizona, since the start of the year after an illness led to the partial amputation of both legs.
His family feared they could face potentially costly medical bills.
But Mr Edwards' brother Aled said insurers would keep funding treatment if he makes continuous progress.
At the start of September, insurance firm Cigna said they were looking into the case amid concerns they would stop paying the medical costs.
To try and resolve the situation, Aled Edwards flew out to be with his brother, who is originally from Bodedern but has lived in the USA for 13 years.
He said the latest news was "very unexpected" and added his brother had got "a bit better in the past week".
Meanwhile, a campaign to raise funds for him has already made Â£38,000 as the family explore ways of getting him back to the UK.
