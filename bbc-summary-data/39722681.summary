Prosecutors allege Mr Bashir, 42, and Ms Mason, 23, plotted to kill Mr Preston, also known as Craig Nelson, because he was an "annoyance" to their relationship.
They claim Mr Preston, who was also in a relationship with Ms Mason at the time, was tied up and then kicked, punched and stamped on before being bundled into a car boot and dumped near the Woodhead Tunnel on 21 August. His body was found the following day.
Under cross examination from Jason Pitter QC, acting for Ms Mason, he was asked: "So you played no part at all in any of the violence?"
He replied: "I did not play a part. That's true."
He said he had travelled to the lay-by in Rotherham were the attack took place alone and was "surprised" when two teenagers appeared from the bushes.
He said a third teenager, who arrived with Ms Mason and Mr Preston, had struck the first blow before the others joined in. He said he was struck with a stick during the attack.
Mr Pitter said: "So you position is that you were unable to stop what was occurring?"
Mr Bashir said: "After being hit by a stick I could not move my shoulder. I was in pain."
"Did you just stand there and watch what was happening?" asked the barrister.
"Yes," said Mr Bashir. "I did shout out. I shouted, 'Stop it'."
He denied then driving with Ms Mason to the Woodhead Tunnel to dump Mr Preston's body, saying that when he asked Ms Mason what had happened later she told him she had dropped Mr Preston back at his flat.
The trial of Mr Bashir and Ms Mason, both of Holme Park Court, Huddersfield, and the three teenagers, who cannot be named due to their age, continues at Sheffield Crown Court.
