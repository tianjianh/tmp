On-loan Burnley full-back Cameron Dummigan fired Oldham ahead with his first career goal after two minutes.
Peterborough, who have won just one of their past seven league games, levelled through Souleymane Coulibaly's header.
Oldham made it successive wins when Kelly scored on 73 minutes after keeper Ben Alnwick fouled Matthew Palmer.

Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was a good team performance against a good footballing side in a difficult place to come. It's full credit to the players to come out with three points from the game.
"It's a great strike from Cameron, he's finished well with his weak foot and it was a great start. He's got that in his locker and he's a great little player.
"I was disappointed to go in level at half-time, but I thought our second half performance was really good. We looked really strong and were pushing on to get a winner and we did."
