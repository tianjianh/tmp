Queens Park Rangers have reappointed Ian Holloway as manager, 10 years after he left the Championship club.

The 53-year-old, previously in charge of the R's between 2001 to 2006, has agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract at Loftus Road.
Holloway, who led Blackpool and Crystal Palace to the Premier League, replaces Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, who was sacked on Saturday after 11 months in charge.
He said he was "honoured, privileged and proud" to return to Rangers.
QPR are 17th in the table, six points above the relegation zone, after sacking former Chelsea and Netherlands striker Hasselbaink.
He oversaw just 13 wins from his 47 games in charge.
Holloway has been working as a television pundit since being sacked by Millwall in March 2015.
"It's a huge moment for me and I am delighted to be back here," said the former Bristol Rovers, Plymouth and Leicester boss.
"I feel like I'm back home now and I can't wait to get started.
"Does anyone know this club better than me? Probably not. Has it changed much? Maybe, but I know what it means to everyone out there.
"People would die for this club. My job is to try to help this squad improve and create an environment that the players can succeed in."
In his first spell in charge of QPR, Holloway led the club to promotion to the Championship in 2004 after missing out in the third-tier play-off final in the previous campaign.
He also had to contend with off-field issues at Loftus Road when Rangers were put into administration in April 2001.
Former midfielder Holloway, who spent five years at the club in the 1990s during his playing career, was suspended by then chairman Gianni Paladini in February 2006 because of speculation linking him to the Leicester job.
He joined Plymouth four months later after Rob Kelly became Leicester boss. Holloway eventually had a spell in charge of the Foxes in 2007-08 but the club were relegated to the third tier for the first time in their history.
Holloway will begin his second spell in charge of QPR at home to fifth-placed Norwich City on Saturday, 19 November.
Details of Holloway's backroom staff are yet to be announced.
Hasselbaink's assistant, Dave Oldfield, had been supervising first-team training since the Dutchman's departure.
