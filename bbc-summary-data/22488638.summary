The county council wants to introduce dog control orders in Llanelli, Burry Port, Cefn Sidan, Ferryside, Llansteffan and Pendine.
If successful the scheme could be extended to children's play areas, sports pitches, bowling greens and skateboard parks.
Public consultation will be carried out before any decisions are made.
The new dog control orders are planned to replace existing by-laws in Llansteffan and Cefn Sidan.
Jim Jones, the council executive board member for environmental and public protection, said: "We know there is a lot of public support for these orders in specific areas.
"However, it is important we try to balance the interests of dog owners who need to exercise their dogs, with the need for people - particularly children - to have access to safe dog-free areas.
"We are looking at carrying out a phased, common sense approach and we will soon be consulting with residents to get their views."
Failure to comply with the dog control orders could result in a fixed penalty notice for Â£75 or court prosecution where the maximum fine is Â£1,000.
