Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, which was travelling from Burkina Faso to Algiers, on Thursday amid severe storms.
Almost half of the passengers on board were French, including a family of 10.
The Briton is yet to be identified but the FCO said it was providing support to his family "at this tragic time".
Writing on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "deeply saddened" by the British man's death.
French President Francois Hollande earlier confirmed there were no survivors in the crash.
He said one flight data recorder had been recovered, after French troops reached the crash site near Mali's border with Burkina Faso.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said it was believed the crash was linked to the weather conditions, but said "no theory can be excluded at this point".
Burkina Faso authorities said the passenger list included 51 French people and 27 people from Burkina Faso.
The six crew members were Spanish, according to the Spanish pilots' union.
