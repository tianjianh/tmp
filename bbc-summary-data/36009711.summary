The three-month-old child was taken to hospital on Friday afternoon but died the following day, Dorset Police said.
Police were alerted by paramedics who were called to a flat in Carysfort Road, Boscombe.
A 33-year-old man from Bournemouth is being questioned by police, who say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death.
Det Insp Richard Dixey of Dorset Police, said: "I can confirm that the tragic death of this young boy is being treated as suspicious and a murder investigation, led by the Major Crime Investigation Team, has been launched as a result.
"I would appeal for the family to be given privacy at this extremely difficult time."
Police said crime scene officers had examined the Carysfort Road flat. A post-mortem examination is due to take place early next week.
