The 20-year-old Frenchman had been on trial with the Fir Park club following his release from Leicester City.
He is the eighth new arrival for manager Stephen Robinson, who says he is still looking for another defender and a striker.
"He's only 20 years old but his development is staggering, he is incredibly strong," said Robinson of Kipre.
Leicester paid Â£70,000 to take Kipre from Paris St-Germain in 2014.
"I managed to get a very good look at him over the past few weeks and it was never a doubt in my mind that we'd offer him a contract," Robinson told the club website.
