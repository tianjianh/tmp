[SN]TITLE[SN]
Odyssey developer Peter Curistan banned as company director for six years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The developer of Belfast's Odyssey Pavilion has been banned as a company director for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Curistan's disqualification follows the collapse of five companies that ran up losses of more than Â£12m.
Some of them operated entertainment businesses within the venue, which was formerly controlled by the 60-year-old businessman.
However, it went into administration in 2010.
Three years later, Mr Curistan, from Hampton Park in Belfast, was declared bankrupt.
His wife, Marian Anne Curistan, was also disqualified for two years over her involvement in some of the companies.
A business associate, Peter Holmes, from Dunblane in Scotland, was disqualified for four years.
In a statement, Mr Curistan said his disqualification can be traced back to action taken against him by the former Anglo Irish Bank, which he is challenging in court.
Should it succeed "there will be an opportunity to seek a rescinding of the disqualification."
