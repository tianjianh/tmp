[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 0-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sonny Bradley's second-half header was enough to defeat League Two leaders Doncaster Rovers as Plymouth Argyle triumphed in the battle of the top two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradley powered in the winner from six yards to earn a win which takes the Pilgrims to within three points of Rovers with seven games to play.
The hosts had more chances, with John Marquis' header and James Coppinger's volley well saved by Luke McCormick.
Tommy Rowe and Coppinger were denied by heroic Plymouth defending late on.
The defeat ends Doncaster's unbeaten home league record this season, with their previous league loss at the Keepmoat Stadium coming almost a year ago in the third tier.
Plymouth are now 13 points clear of fourth-placed Stevenage as they close in on automatic promotion.
