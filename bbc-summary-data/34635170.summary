Sri Lanka v West Indies: Hosts win in Colombo to take series 2-0

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sri Lanka's spinners conjured a 72-run victory over West Indies in the second Test in Colombo to take the series 2-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After rain had washed out day four, the Windies began on 20-1, chasing 244 to win and square the two-Test series.
Darren Bravo hit two sixes but fell for 61 as spinner Rangana Herath took two wickets in an over to leave them 125-6.
Spin trio Herath (4-56), Milinda Siriwardana (3-25) and Dilruwan Perera (1-37) prevailed as the Windies collapsed to 171 all out.
It was Sri Lanka's first series win in 2015 in any of the three formats.
The match had moved on apace after 11 wickets fell on each of the first two days before West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite proved an unlikely demon bowler, capturing a six-wicket haul on day three with his part-time off-spin.
Torrential rain at the P Sara Oval prevented any play on Sunday, but just as England were enduring a trial by spin against Pakistan in Dubai, Sri Lanka's three-pronged spin attack took all nine remaining Windies wickets on the final day as they were bowled out with 41 overs to spare.
Sri Lanka won the first Test in Galle by an innings. The sides now meet in three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals.
