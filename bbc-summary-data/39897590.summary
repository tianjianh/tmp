[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Hughes, 53, of Castle Douglas, struck in November 2015, leaving his victim in tears.
He had denied the offence, claiming the sex had been consensual, but was convicted of carrying out the rape at a house in his home town.
A judge told him: "Your treatment of the rape victim was cruel and degrading and was calculated to be so."
Johanna Johnston added that he had left the woman "traumatised".
During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow, a jury was shown footage of Hughes raping the woman.
In evidence he claimed that he did not rape her and the sex was consensual. He told the jurors he did not believe she was crying.
However, Hughes was convicted of raping the woman at a house in Castle Douglas.
The court was told he had set up a hidden camera in a TV cabinet. Footage played during the trial showed the woman weeping and wiping away tears.
At one point, Hughes was seen saying: "That was not so bad."
The jury also heard claims that Hughes threatened to put images of his victim on the internet.
The woman was asked during the trial if she had agreed to sex, and she replied: "Absolutely not."
Hughes had pled guilty before the trial to charges of voyeurism in respect of the rape victim and another woman.
Defence QC Murray Macara said: "He is willing to undergo programmes which are available in jail. He maintains the support of his son and daughter."
Hughes was also placed on the sex offenders register.
