[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Hanley killed himself in Bridge Road, Wallington, on 30 January after officers were called to a reports of a man armed with a firearm who was threatening to harm himself and others.
The 51-year-old died in spite of baton rounds and a Taser being discharged.
The IPCC said it was looking at the sequence of events up to his death.
The investigation will include looking at the decisions made by police officers and what impact they had, a spokesperson said.
Associate Commissioner Tom Milsom said background information regarding Mr Hanley's health would also be investigated.
Police were originally called to Mr Hanley's Wallington home at about 20:00 GMT but found him in possession of a gun in a nearby street.
Scotland Yard said officers entered negotiations with the Met civilian employee but after those failed, discharged one Taser and two baton rounds "to prevent the man from harming himself and others".
He was taken to St George's Hospital, Tooting, when he shot himself but died shortly after.
IPCC investigators were deployed to the scene immediately after the shooting.
Investigations are on-going as to where Mr Hanley got the non-police firearm from, the IPCC said.
