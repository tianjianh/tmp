Grimsby boss Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:
"Three good goals. I thought they were good play and we've had a goal disallowed, plus a couple cleared off the line.
"You just think is it going to be one of them nights and things going against you, but overall second-half I thought we were relatively comfortable.
"It keeps us that bit of a cushion at the minute. But there are a lot of teams still interested in the play-offs."
