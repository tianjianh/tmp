The 67-year-old, who was fearful of returning to his Gateshead home after the attack in January, has begun house hunting thanks to an online fundraising campaign that attracted donations of more than Â£330,000.
But Mr Barnes, whose collarbone was broken when he was knocked to the ground, told Look North's Peter Harris he was not yet ready to meet his attacker, drug-user Richard Gatiss, 25.
