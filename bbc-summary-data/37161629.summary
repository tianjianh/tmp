Liam Boyce will be recalled to the Northern Ireland squad for the World Cup qualifier with the Czech Republic, manager Michael O'Neill has confirmed.

The Ross County striker was edged out by Wigan Athletic forward Will Grigg for a place in the 23-man squad for the Euro 2016 finals in France.
"I went for Will but Liam will be back in the squad, he knew he would be," O'Neill told BBC Radio Scotland.
"Liam is in good form and he has a chance of being involved obviously."
At the turn of the year, Boyce's 17 goals for Scottish Premiership side Ross County looked to have secured his place on the NI squad.
But Grigg's 20-goal tally since January compared to his rival's return of three ultimately swayed O'Neill.
"He (Liam) was very unlucky to miss out on France. It was a toss of a coin between him and Will Grigg.
"He got a bad wrist injury and played poorly in the League Cup final even though County won the final, so his season fizzled out a bit after a strong first half, whereas Will Grigg finished strongly.
"I could only name 23 players for the Euros and I would typically name a 25-man squad."
O'Neill is set to announce his squad on Wednesday for the opening Group C qualifier against the Czechs on 4 September.
Among those included will be 36-year-old West Bromwich Albion defender Gareth McAuley, who has decided to extend his international career.
Derby County defender Chris Baird announced his retirement from international football last week.
