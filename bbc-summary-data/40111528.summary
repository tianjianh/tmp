The 25-year-old midfielder signed a three-year-contract to become Ibrox manager Pedro Caixinha's second signing of the summer.
Jack came through the youth ranks at Pittodrie but chose to leave the club at the end of his contract.
Caixinha has already secured the signing of Portugal defender Bruno Alves from Cagliari.
"It's an honour and a privilege to come to such a massive club and I'm grateful for the opportunity and looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead," Jack said.
"It's a huge club and the club is back in European football and a big support as well. It's always a great atmosphere when you play there. So all that and the package that comes with it, it's an exciting time.
"I'm really looking forward to it. It's a surreal moment but I'm delighted to be part of this club.
"I'm thankful to Aberdeen and to Derek McInnes, but I just felt it was time for a fresh challenge and it's one at Rangers that I'm really looking forward to.
"From what I've heard, the club are making a few signings and bringing in a good calibre of player, so it's exciting times and I know there are really good players already here as well."
Jack made his debut for Aberdeen against Rangers in September 2010 and went on to make almost 250 appearances for the club, scoring 11 goals.
He was appointed club captain by manager Derek McInnes at the beginning of the 2015-16 season.
However, he lost the armband ahead of the Scottish Cup final defeat to Celtic because of his intention to leave Pittodrie.
He was replaced as captain with Graeme Shinnie.
Alves became Rangers' first signing of Caixinha's rebuild after leaving Serie A and the Rangers manager was keen to make jack the second part of his recruitment strategy.
"I believe 25 is a great age for him to come here," the Rangers manager said.
"He had three years as captain of Aberdeen and has that experience. He also understands what it means to represent Rangers."
