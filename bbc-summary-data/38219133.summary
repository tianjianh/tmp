Millionaire accused of murder 'was seeing other women'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A millionaire accused of murdering his escort girlfriend had a history of using prostitutes and was seeing other women, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Morgan, 54, of Llanellen, Monmouthshire, is accused of strangling Georgina Symonds, 25, in January.
The father-of-two admits killing Miss Symonds but denies murder.
Newport Crown Court was told Mr Morgan had visits from call girls at his family home before meeting Miss Symonds.
He continued to see other women despite paying her Â£10,000 a month to work as his exclusive escort, the trial heard.
Dr Ajat Sanikop, a mental disorder expert who interviewed Mr Morgan after he admitted strangling Miss Symonds, said the millionaire began paying for sex in 2011.
He said: "[Mr] Morgan began using such services after he was showed how to use his iPhone for various things.
"He met Georgina a year later but he continued to use escort services. She had no major objections to him seeing other escorts.
"Then, in April 2015, his marriage broke down when his wife, Helen, came to be aware about him bringing escorts to the marital home."
Dr Sanikop also said Mr Morgan told him Miss Symonds was only in a relationship with him for money, but he was in love with her regardless.
He added: "I think he was quite clear that Georgina was with him because of the money and the lifestyle he gave her.
"But he said he loved her. He was quite aware that as long as he paid her she would stay with him, and if he stopped she wouldn't.
"He described it as a relationship, but it's difficult to classify it as one."
The court was previously told Mr Morgan strangled Miss Symonds at her home in his castle grounds in Llanmartin after hearing she planned to leave him and hid her body in farm buildings behind his family home.
He denies murder, saying he was suffering from diminished responsibility due to Asperger's syndrome.
Clinical psychologist Prof Simon Baron-Cohen said he was "in no doubt" that Mr Morgan had Asperger's syndrome.
He said Mr Morgan suffered from a "black-and-white" mindset which affected his decision-making in dealing with Miss Symonds.
"His accounts of his social relationships are not that of a typical person," he said.
The court heard that Miss Symonds threatened to send explicit videos and pictures she had of Mr Morgan to his family.
Prof Baron-Cohen said: "He felt he had to stop and frighten her. He felt quite trapped, and wanted to protect his children at all costs."
The trial continues.
