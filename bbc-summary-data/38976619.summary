San Bernardino: Gunman's friend will say he supplied weapons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The only person to be charged in the San Bernardino attack which killed 14 people will plead guilty to providing the assault rifles, say court records.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Enrique Marquez, 25, will admit that he lied to officials when he purchased the guns by claiming that they were for him rather than for a third party.
He will also admit to plotting a separate attack with one of the suspects who was his childhood friend.
Prosecutors say he could face 25 years in jail in exchange for the plea deal.
He is scheduled to enter his pleas before a judge on Thursday in Los Angeles.
US-born Syed Rizwan Farook and his Pakistani-born wife, Tashfeen Malik were both killed by police after murdering 14 of Farook's colleagues during a holiday party at the San Bernardino Inland Regional Center where he worked.
Police say the couple, who were married in Saudi Arabia in 2014, were inspired by Islamic extremism.
Officials say that Marquez provided the weapons, because Farook's Middle Eastern appearance would arouse suspicions.
The shooting rampage was one of the deadliest attacks on US soil since 11 September 2001.
Prosecutors acknowledge that Marquez did not have advance knowledge of the married couple's plot, but said his earlier co-plotting had helped to inspire the rampage.

"This defendant collaborated with and purchased weapons for a man who carried out the devastating December 2, 2015 terrorist attack that took the lives of 14 innocent people,  wounded nearly two dozen, and impacted our entire nation," US Attorney Eileen Decker said in a written statement announcing the plea deal.
As part of the agreement reached with prosecutors, Marquez will confess to conspiring with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to attack a community college which they had attended.
They had also discussed committing an attack on commuters stuck in traffic on a southern California motorway.
"While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center,'" Mrs Decker said.
As part of the agreement, the government is expected to dismiss immigration-fraud charges stemming from a sham marriage to a relative of Farook's sister-in-law.
Marqez and Farook first became friends in 2005 when the Marqez family moved next door to Farook's in Riverside, California, about 55mi (85km) east of LA.
