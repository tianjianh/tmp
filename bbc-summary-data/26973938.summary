Biomass plant plans for Anglesey Aluminium move forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a large biomass plant and eco park on the site of the former Anglesey Aluminium works near Holyhead have taken an important step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK government has approved design changes to the proposals by Chester-based Lateral Power.
Plans for a biomass plant at the site were first put forward in 2009 and a licence was granted in 2012.
The factory could create 400 new jobs with an extra 600 in the construction phase.
A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), which first granted permission for the plant in 2011, said ministerial consent had been given to allow for some technological changes to the biomass generating station at Penrhos Works.
The plant is expected to generate 299MW of electricity, which is enough to power about 300,000 homes.
Anglesey Aluminium smelting works shut in 2009 with the loss of nearly 400 jobs.
