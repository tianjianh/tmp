Moldova government dismissed by MPs amid bank scandal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moldova's parliament has dismissed the government, following a no-confidence vote - a move which intensifies the country's political turmoil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prime Minister Valeriu Strelet has been in office for less than three months.
The vote, triggered by socialist and communist opposition MPs, followed months of big anti-corruption protests.
Many Moldovans are furious over the disappearance of more than $1bn (Â£646m) from Moldovan banks. The protesters are demanding early elections.
A former prime minister, Vlad Filat, was detained earlier this month over his alleged involvement in the bank fraud - an allegation he denies.
The no-confidence motion was backed by 65 lawmakers in the 101-seat legislature.
Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries. The missing money is equivalent to an eighth of the ex-Soviet republic's entire GDP.
The scandal caused a rapid fall in the value of the national currency, the leu, hitting Moldovans' living standards.
Mr Filat was accused of theft from the state-run Banca de Economii. Earlier parliament had stripped him of immunity from prosecution.
