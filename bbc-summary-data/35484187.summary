[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are investigating allegations that prominent Muslims at Scotland's largest mosque have been threatened amid an ongoing internal dispute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven members of Glasgow Central Mosque executive committee resigned, saying their efforts to make reforms had been opposed by traditionalists.
They also said they and their families were subjected to threats and abuse.
No-one from the mosque was available for comment. Police said they were looking into the allegations.
The resignations from the executive committee were announced on the mosque's website.
The statement said: "A number of people have been undermining day-to-day operations, meetings and even sabotaging mosque property, alongside threatening physical harm to executive members including their wives and children.
"The following people are protesting against the backwardness displayed by a minority of people by resigning from the executive committee."
Commenting on the resignations, Glasgow-based lawyer Aamer Anwar said: "It is a real tragedy that those who bravely led the calls for equality and diversity at Scotland's largest mosque have resigned.
"The fact that they did so because of alleged threats of violence towards their families is abhorrent and criminal."
He said the committee had "the decency and courage to expose corruption, misogyny and racism" but certain people at the mosque had "tried to destroy them".
Mr Anwar said the situation at the mosque meant it was more difficult to tackle extremism.
He added: "Today is an extremely sad and shameful day for Scotland's Muslims, but it's time the silent majority spoke up."
At the weekend, Mr Anwar wrote an article for the Sunday Herald in which he was highly critical of practices and attitudes of senior figures at the mosque.
