British Championships: Scots trio beaten by Andrew Willis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's hopes of victory in the 200m breaststroke final at Britain's Olympic trials in Glasgow were dashed by England's Andrew Willis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Benson finished second and fellow Scot Ross Murdoch, the Commonwealth Games gold medallist, was third.
Compatriot Michael Jamieson, the 2012 Olympic and Commonwealth silver medallist, was fifth.
It means that Willis will qualify automatically for Rio, while Benson and Murdoch must wait for selection.
Adam Peaty, world record holder over 50m and 100m, led the field early on and was two seconds inside British record pace at one stage.
However, once the sprint specialist began to tire, fastest qualifier Willis took over to dominate the rest of the race.
Murdoch was the second quickest going into the final after winning his heat but was edged out by Benson.
Earlier this week, Murdoch finished second behind Peaty in the 100m breaststroke and is almost certain to join the world champion in that event at Rio this summer.
