Federer won 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 to reach his 11th Wimbledon final, having last won the title in 2012.
He will face Croatia's Marin Cilic after he beat American 24th seed Sam Querrey 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 on Centre Court on Sunday.
Cilic is into only his second major final after winning the 2014 US Open.
"It's unbelievable," said Cilic, "I've been playing really great tennis."
It is a record 29th Grand Slam final for Federer, and he becomes the second-oldest man to reach a Wimbledon final after the 39-year-old Ken Rosewall got to the 1974 Wimbledon final.
