Ralph Marchant is stepping down from the G4S-run Medway Secure Training Centre in Kent after severe criticism of its management.
His decision came after Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick urged the government to establish a commissioner to oversee the unit.
A team inspected the unit the day a BBC Panorama investigation was aired.
There are no allegations against Mr Marchant, whose role will be filled in the interim by the director of the immigration removal centres at Gatwick, Ben Saunders.
In a joint HM Inspectorate of Prisons and Ofsted report, Mr Hardwick urges Justice Secretary Michael Gove to establish a commissioner to "provide increased oversight, scrutiny and challenge of managerial arrangements in particular in relation to the safeguarding of young people" at the centre in Rochester.
"Managerial oversight failed to protect young people from harm," he said.
He also recommended body-worn cameras should be worn by staff who have regular contact with children at all institutions holding youngsters and they should "be expected to record all use of force incidents".
Inspectors said a small number of young inmates described staff using "insulting, aggressive or racist language" and also told them they felt "unsafe in areas not covered by CCTV".
"The concerns raised with us by a small number of children are consistent with the evidence presented by the BBC investigation which showed targeted bullying of vulnerable boys by a small number of staff in addition to the conditioning of new staff," Mr Hardwick said.
"There was also evidence in the BBC programme that a larger group of staff must have been aware of unacceptable practice but did not challenge or report this behaviour."
He also detailed the high level of staff turnover, said to be "in the region of 50% of the basic grade custody staff", but said inspectors were now satisfied "measures have been put in place to ensure appropriate staffing levels" at the unit.
Extra independent oversight was also being provided by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and Barnardo's advocates, according to Mr Hardwick.
Following the publication of Mr Hardwick's report, Mr Gove told the House of Commons an "independent improvement board" would be set up to examine whether the failings at Medway Secure Training Centre were being addressed.
The panel will investigate safeguarding arrangements, "oversee, challenge and support" G4S over its improvement plan and report to the justice secretary on its "confidence in the capability of G4S, Youth Justice Board and other organisations to meet appropriate safeguarding standards at Medway" in the future.
Analysis
So, the fall-out from the Panorama programme on Medway continues.
A resignation, to add to the five dismissals and four suspensions; an inspection report blaming failings in managerial oversight and a panel of experts to oversee improvements.
It's this development, announced by Michael Gove, which carries the most significance.
One of the panel's terms of reference is to report to the Justice Secretary by March on whether it has "confidence in the capability" of G4S and the YJB, among other bodies, to meet "appropriate safeguarding standards" at Medway.
That sounds to me like a last chance for the controversial private security company to prove that it's able to fulfil the terms of its contract to run Medway, a contact which was renewed by Mr Gove last year.
The YJB has warned G4S there will be "contractual implications" if its fails to "deliver the improvements required" at Medway.
It also confirmed that body-worn cameras will be worn at Medway, as well as the G4S-run Oakhill secure training centre in Milton Keynes, following Mr Hardwick's recommendation.
YJB chief executive, Lin Hinnigan, said the safety of young people was "paramount importance" to the board.
Peter Neden, of G4S UK and Ireland, said the firm was "committed to supporting" an independent review commissioned by the Ministry of Justice.
The allegations uncovered by Panorama relate to 10 boys, aged 14 to 17, and involve unnecessary force, foul language and a cover-up.
Five men are currently on police bail.
Kent Police said four of the men were arrested on suspicion of child neglect. A fifth person was held on suspicion of assault.
Five members of staff at the 76-bed centre, which houses young inmates aged 12 to 18, have been sacked by G4S.
Four other people have been suspended and one has been reinstated.
The firm said the person had been present when another member of staff was restraining an inmate but its disciplinary investigation cleared them  of "all fault or blame"
