[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who shook a one-month-old baby so hard the child suffered head injuries has been given a hospital order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ashraf Haydari of Lethbridge Road in Exeter, Devon, visited the family and was left alone with the baby for a few moments when he carried out the attack.
The baby had internal bleeding in the skull, Exeter Crown Court heard.
The 21-year-old, who has a history of mental illness, admitted causing grievous bodily harm. He will be sent to Langdon Hospital in Dawlish, Devon.
The attack happened in March 2014 and Eleanor Purkis, prosecuting, said: "She [the mother] heard her baby making a terrible noise and when she went back and picked up the baby she found its head was lolling, the arms were in the air and the fingers bent."
The child was taken to Bristol's Royal Hospital for Children where doctors diagnosed internal bleeding in the skull caused by violent shaking.
The court heard the child had recovered but it was too early to be sure there would be no long-term damage.
Mr James Rickard, defending, said Haydari suffered from schizophrenia and his family had spent thousands of pounds seeking treatment.
He said Haydari would not be released until a panel was satisfied he posed no further risk and that a care package was available for him.
