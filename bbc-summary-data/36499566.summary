Officers said further searches in Weybread were being carried out near the couple's Mill Lane home, where a bunch of flowers had been left outside.
The area around the house remains sealed off, with a police community support officer on guard outside the property.
The force said it would be "combing" fields near the house as part of an "ongoing search strategy" to locate Sylvia Stuart and any further evidence.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "We are continuing to work to locate Sylvia and to find Ali Qazimaj."
The couple's son-in-law Steve Paxman, 61 and from Leicester, was arrested on Sunday in connection with Mr Stuart's death, and released on police bail until 3 August.
