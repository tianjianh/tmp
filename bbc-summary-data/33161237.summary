Five-year-old Callum Smith is said to be one of only a handful of children in Northern Ireland with this form of the condition, called Duchenne.
His mother Laura has said the family had high hopes he would get the revolutionary treatment.
The Health and Social Care Board said they can't comment on individual cases.
Laura Smith told BBC Radio Foyle that she was horrified when she heard the news.
"We were told on Tuesday that his individual funding request to access the drug Translarna had been turned down.
"The treatment we need will only help a small percentage of boys with Duchenne because each case has a different mutation. Fortunately, Callum fits into this criteria.
"Effectively this drug will give him a longer quality of life. To have that last glimmer of hope taken away from us is heartbreaking."
In a statement the Department of Health said they were not involved in the assessment of the application.
A spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board said: "For Translarna, cost effectiveness has not yet been issued by NICE or the SMC. In this circumstance Translarna is not currently commissioned in Northern Ireland."
