[SN]TITLE[SN]
Polar bear to enter new Highland Wildlife Park enclosure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's only female polar bear has been allowed into her new enclosure for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria has been introduced to the Highland Wildlife Park as a potential mate for Arktos, who lives there with fellow male Walker.
Her presence at the Kingussie park has sparked hopes it may see the birth of a polar bear cub in the future.
Her custom-built enclosure features a pond and soft areas of ground, as well as space for her to explore.
Victoria's enclosure is completely separate from that of the males, mimicking the behaviour of polar bears in the wild who only come together to mate.
The female bear arrived from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark on 25 March. She was born in December 1996 at Rostock Zoo in Germany.
