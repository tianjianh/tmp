A policeman has been given a bravery award for helping save the life of an England fan who was attacked by Russia supporters during Euro 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Bache, 51, from Portsmouth, was assaulted ahead of England's match against Russia in Marseille on 11 June.
Mr Bache remains in a rehabilitation unit after suffering head injuries.
PC Stuart Dickerson, who was on attachment in France from Hampshire Constabulary, said he would never forget his "life-changing deployment".
He said he saw "about 150 Russian hooligans who were clearly trained in fighting", wearing boxing gloves and gum-shields, and carrying metal bars and other weapons.
"It was like a load of locusts going through a cornfield. They were just randomly assaulting any England fan that was in their path," he said.
"People have described the scene as [the zombie film] World War Z.
"I witnessed people being stamped on, bottles hitting over their head, iron bars across their head, chairs thrown at them."
PC Dickerson said he came across a French policeman performing CPR on Mr Bache and took over first aid, allowing the French officers to rejoin their unit.
He said he had to get officers to put a protective cordon around him with their shields.
"We didn't really think about ourselves at the time, it was more about helping Mr Bache," he said.
A friend of Mr Bache, Crispin Harwood, said he "only had admiration" for PC Dickerson and the French officers.
"Without them we may have been looking at a different outcome. On behalf of Andrew's friends and family, I thank them from the bottom of my heart."
He said Mr Bache was currently in a rehabilitation unit receiving physiotherapy.
"No-one wants to see anyone going through what he's gone through - he's working really hard and getting there slowly."
PC Dickerson has been presented with a Royal Humane Society commendation by Hampshire Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney.
She said he played a "key role" in saving Mr Bache's life.
The injured fan was reported to have suffered severe brain injuries and a cardiac arrest and had to be put in an induced coma.
The officer said he was glad Mr Bache was making "slow but steady progress" in his recovery.
