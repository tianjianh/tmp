The boy, who was going to the game for the first time, was treated in hospital for a hairline fracture to his face and has three teeth missing.
The 10-year-old was in a minibus of Rangers fans sitting in traffic at Cathcart Road, near Hampden Stadium.
A group of Celtic fans surrounded the bus and hurled abuse at the occupants.
Det Con Kenneth MacEwan said: "This was an appalling assault on the boy who was with his dad and fellow supporters going to his first Celtic v Rangers game.
"He never got to the match but instead was detained overnight in hospital and has a facial injury and teeth missing."
Det Con MacEwan said it appeared that the bottle was deliberately thrown at the minibus but the boy was not specifically targeted.
The man who threw the bottle was described as white, 5ft 11in tall and of heavy build. He was wearing green clothing and possibly a white beanie hat.
He and the men he was with continued along Cathcart Road and into Cathkin Park towards Hampden.
Earlier, police said 37 people were arrested for offences connected with the league cup semi-final, which Celtic won 2-0.
As well as minor public order offences, 12 of the arrests concerned alleged sectarian breaches of the peace.
Of those arrested, 23 people were due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court; 11 have been reported to the procurator fiscal and three were ordered to pay fixed penalty fines.
Match commander Ch Supt Andy Bates said: "As usual the vast majority of the 50,000 fans were here to enjoy the game and support their respective team; they deserve credit for their excellent behaviour.
"However, again, it is the minority of fans who spoiled the occasion by for example setting off flares and singing sectarian songs.
"We dealt with any incidents swiftly and with minimum disruption."
