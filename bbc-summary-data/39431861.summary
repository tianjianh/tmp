Glamorgan v Cardiff MCCU: Jacques Rudolph hits landmark ton in gloom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph made the 50th first-class century of his career as the Welsh county reached 342-7 in the gloom against Cardiff MCCU.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rudolph faced 230 balls, striking 15 fours and two sixes in his 142, as he showed more signs of a return to form.
Aneurin Donald hit a quick-fire 63 while David Lloyd (35) and Kiran Carlson (26) also contributed.
There were three wickets for the students' teenage Welsh seamer Oli Pike on first-class debut.
A lunchtime downpour wiped out the afternoon session, while murky conditions would probably have kept the teams off longer in a competitive match.
Rudolph timed the ball fluently on the drive despite the poor light, although he almost played on to Pike on 98, and the Glamorgan Academy teenager struck three times with the new ball to restrict the county's progress in the evening session.
Both teams will hope for better weather conditions on the third and final scheduled day.
Glamorgan have a two-day practice match against Nottinghamshire in Cardiff on Sunday 2 April, before opening their Championship campaign at Northampton on Friday 7 April.
The Cardiff students play their other first-class match against Hampshire in Southampton, starting on Sunday 2 April.
Glamorgan batsman Aneurin Donald told BBC Wales Sport:
"I was pretty pleased with how I played, it's always nice to get a first-class game under our belt before points and tables start coming into it- it was pretty dark but the pitch played well.
"More importantly it was nice to see Jacques get a big one early on, we all know he had a tough year last year but he's looking in great form.
"It was fantastic (playing club cricket in Western Australia), very lucky to get opportunities like that with a great batting coach, a good club and a family that looked after me.
"I made the most of my time there, made a few changes in my game and hopefully I can bring a few more runs than last year."
Cardiff MCCU bowler Oli Pike told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was a tough day, but I thought we held our own quite well. It felt pretty good (to get wickets on debut), the ball that got Chris Cooke, he couldn't have done much with it as it swung out and nipped back in.
"It's great to test yourself against some of the (senior Glamorgan) boys, especially Jacques who proved how good he is with that magnificent hundred.
"I hope to stay fit and play some nice cricket with the seconds, and I'm studying Geology at Cardiff Uni so it's a pretty full-on course."
