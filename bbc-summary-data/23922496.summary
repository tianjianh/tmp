David Frost: Your memories

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Veteran broadcaster Sir David Frost has died at the age of 74 after a heart attack while on board a cruise ship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir David's career spanned journalism, comedy writing and daytime television presenting, including The Frost Report.
Internationally, he will be remembered for his revealing interviews with former US President Richard Nixon.
BBC News website readers are sending their memories.
I was at Wellingborough Grammar School when David Frost joined it and although he was two years ahead of me our paths crossed in the school plays.
He was Banquo and I was - it was an all-boys school - Lady Macbeth. He brought tinned haggis for the banquet scene.
We also starred in an Agatha Christie play together called Alibi. There was a rule in the school that if a student was going for Oxford entry that year they were not allowed to be in the school play too. David was the first to break this rule.
He also clambered through the window of the make-up room because he was late to one rehearsal. He was unforgettable.
And I won the school's Public Reading Prize every year except the two I was up against him!
Although he was two years older than me he sat in the corner of our Latin class because he was behind with Latin.
It was all very friendly between us, not too competitive.
I have known Sir David for the past six years.
He helped me with a cancer charity I set up and introduced me to the Prince of Wales to support us - nothing was too much trouble.
We were working on charity projects that would have raised millions.
We were going to compile a book commemorating 250 of his greatest interviews, and he was going to tell the stories behind each of them.
There were also plans for an official portrait of him with some of his favourite interviewees.
He was a true gentleman, and this news has struck me like a thunderbolt.
He was my inspiration in so many ways.
He changed the way people could be interviewed and created an entirely new way of broadcasting.
He challenged politicians and kept them honest.  What he did was phenomenal.
He was the loveliest and generous person you could wish to meet, and he made you feel special.
Sir David changed my life the day I met him. It will never be the same again.
I met David Frost in Richmond. I told him he was marvellous on his shows.
David shook my hand and thanked me, I said he was better looking in real life.
Even though we had never met before he said: "So do you sir!" It made us laugh so much.
I felt I knew him for years and have never forgotten that moment.
David Frost will be greatly missed.
The overriding memory is simply what a genuinely nice man he was. He made no 'starry' demands.
I worked as a production manager on Through The Keyhole and not only was Sir David a true professional, he was always polite and courteous to everyone.
He was never difficult or temperamental as so many presenters are.
I'll never forget that in the bar after filming he made a point of acknowledging and thanking every single member of the crew.
It didn't matter what their role was, or how 'important' they were, he treated everyone with equal amounts of respect.
A very sad loss, not only to his family and friends, but also to the television industry.
