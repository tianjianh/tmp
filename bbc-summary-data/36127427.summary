A doctor who groped women during unnecessary clinical examinations in Hertfordshire 40 years ago has been jailed for 18 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Mohammad Haq, 74, of Parkstone Avenue, Hornchurch, east London, was found guilty at St Albans Crown Court last month of five offences of indecent assault on four women.
The offences took place at surgeries in Hatfield in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Judge Andrew Bright said he had abused the "total trust" of his victims.
The retired doctor was found guilty of fondling the breasts of a teenage girl and three women patients while he worked as a GP at the Burvil House Surgery and Hilltop Surgery.
During his trial, the court heard the youngest victim was 15 when she went to see the doctor because she had swollen neck glands.
When another woman went to Haq to find out if she was pregnant, he told her to strip and squeezed her breasts.
Haq told police he could not remember any of the women involved and would not have done anything inappropriate.
In an impact statement to the court, a woman who was pregnant at the time described how she was never able to have a "relationship" with a man after being indecently assaulted by Haq.
Passing sentence, Judge Bright told Haq his victims had placed total trust in him as their GP.
"It was complete and total trust and you abused that trust with all your victims including a 15-year-old who was in no position to speak up for herself," he said.
