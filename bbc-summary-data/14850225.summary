Paramedics called the teams to Afan Forest Park, Neath Port Talbot, where the man had a suspected arm fracture.
Western Beacons, Central Beacons and Brecon mountain rescue teams and the Search and Rescue Dog Association South Wales took part in a three hour rescue.
The man was stretchered to an ambulance and taken to Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend on Thursday night.
Western Beacons team spokesman Nick Collins said the call came through at 20:18 BST.
He said: "The man had been mountain biking around the well known trails near the [forest mountain centre] when he lost control of his bike and crashed, injuring his arm.
"Hill parties were quickly assembled and tasked to locate, give immediate first aid, and evacuate the casualty."
Mr Collins said the man had been cycling with friends and the rescue took place in darkness and "appalling weather conditions".
