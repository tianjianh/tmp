Ena Baxter of Baxters food empire dies aged 90

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ena Baxter - one of the driving forces behind the Moray-based Baxters food empire and the face of many of its adverts - has died at the age of 90.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Fochabers-based family business is famed for its soups and preserves.
A spokeswoman for the company said: "The Baxter family confirm with great sadness that Mrs Ena Baxter passed away on Thursday (15 January).
"The family respectfully requests privacy at this difficult time."
Mrs Baxter and her late husband Gordon - who died in 2013, aged 95 - built up the firm from a cottage industry into an international food group over a period of 50 years.
She was born near Forgue, brought up in Huntly, and studied at Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen.
