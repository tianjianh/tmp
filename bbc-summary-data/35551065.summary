Kyren Wilson: Centuries record is 'perfect antidote'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyren Wilson says his record-breaking feat during the "best match of my career" in the China Open qualifiers was the ideal response to his "gutting" display in the German Open.

The 24-year-old made four centuries, and Anthony Hamilton two, as the pair completed a record six consecutive tons when they met on Wednesday.
Wilson said he was "way below his best" as he got to the semi-finals in Berlin.
"But playing like that was the perfect antidote," he told BBC Sport.
"It's the best match I've ever played by far, and setting the record is brilliant."
The previous record of five was jointly held by Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry in the 2003 British Open final, and Stephen Maguire and Neil Robertson in the quarter-finals of the 2009 Masters.
World number 20 Wilson came from behind on three occasions to reach the last four at the German Open in Berlin but said having to "do it the hard way" finally caught up with him.
The Kettering man won final-frame thrillers against Rory McLeod, Michael Holt and Ryan Day but lost to Belgium's Luca Brecel 6-3.
"I was absolutely gutted with the way things ended in Berlin," said Wilson. "It will take a while to completely forget that one. I didn't play well and was just scrapping to get through.
"But I wasn't going to mope about. There has to be positives from reaching the semi-finals of a ranking event when you are not playing well. I showed a lot of bottle, but it was probably one match too far in the end. It took a lot out of me.
"I got back on the practice table as soon as I could. There's no way I want that to happen again."
The Kettering potter's response on his return to competitive snooker was emphatic. He hit breaks of 103 and 108 to go 2-1 up in the best-of-nine meeting with Hamilton.
The Nottingham man responded with a 137 and, after Wilson's 125, Hamilton made it 3-3 with a 123.
But Wilson hit a 100 for his fourth ton of an astonishing match, before closing out the win with a 68.
"I was actually gutted that I missed the last red in the final frame when I could have made it seven," he said.
