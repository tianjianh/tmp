The result lifts Rovers up to seventh in the Championship but they still have champions Hibs and in-form St Mirren to face before the endof the season.
The opener arrived in 28 minutes when Barr nodded home Craig Johnston's wicked delivery.
And Matthews' composed second-half finish sealed the three points.
Rovers did ride their luck at times as Morton's Ricki Lamie headed against the post in the first half while substitute John Scullion curled a sublime free kick off the upright in the second period.
The result leaves Morton without a win in their last six matches as they appear to be stumbling towards a place in the promotion plays-offs now.
Raith Rovers manager John Hughes: "We deserved the win and played some good football but they were warned to keep their concentration levels high for the whole game and they did that.
"It was only three points though and I still think we will need another couple of wins if we are going to be safe.
"That won't be easy as we go to Hibs next and they have deservedly clinched the league now but they won't take their foot off the gas and we can't afford to either.
"That was win great for everyone at the club and it is so important to build on that as we know how crucial it is to stay in this league."
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "The scoreline was a bit harsh on us as I can't remember our goalkeeper having too many saves to make.
"We hit the woodwork a few times today but at this stage of the season if you are not playing at your best then the little breaks don't go for you.
"But if anyone had said that we would be eight points clear with three games to go to get in the play-off we would be happy with that."
