The original 6ft (1.8m) high sculpture, called Voyage, was taken from its plinth on Hull's Victoria Pier by a gang of thieves in July last year.
The replica sculpture was cast in bronze by the original artist, Steinunn Thorarinsdottir, in Iceland.
Hull City Council spent £40,000 from its insurance reserves on the statue.
The council said it had spent an additional £5,000 on extra security measures to protect the replica sculpture, including CCTV cameras.
The original statue, a memorial to those who worked and died at sea, was a gift from the Icelandic fishing town of Vik and was erected in 2006.
It was believed to have been stolen for its scrap metal value, estimated to be between £1,200 and £1,800.
Two people were arrested in connection with the theft but were later released without charge.
The replacement statue will be unveiled by the Icelandic ambassador Benedikt Jonsson, alongside sculptor Steinunn Thorarinsdottir, British ambassador Ian Whitting and the Lord Mayor of Hull, Colin Inglis.
Mr Inglis said: "Civic and trade links with Iceland are very important to us, and we look forward to welcoming the Icelandic ambassador and businesses for the unveiling.
"We also look forward to strengthening our trade ties to help achieve the maximum business benefits for both regions."
