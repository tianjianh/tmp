The Cumbrians took the lead when a defensive mix-up allowed Derek Asamoah through to lob Posh keeper Ben Alnwick.
Carlisle were punished just before the break when defender Burgess rose to nod in Joe Newell's right-wing corner.
Burgess then headed in again, this time from Michael Smith's cross, to put the hosts into the draw for round two.
