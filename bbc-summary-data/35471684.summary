Campsite ban: Widow told 'singles not allowed' at Norfolk site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A widow says she felt like an "oddity" after she was told she could not stay in a motor home at a Norfolk holiday park because she was single.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Annette Gration, 58, was told she could not stay at Searles of Hunstanton, as the company had a policy against people staying by themselves.
Mrs Gration, of Skegness, Lincolnshire, was eventually allowed to stay after saying she would be joined by her son.
The company said the issue would be addressed at its next policy review.
Mrs Gration, whose husband Phil died from cancer last July, said she decided to speak out after failing to receive a response to her complaint to Searles.

She said she went to the camping site last November in her camper van with two friends who were travelling in their own van.
When she arrived she said she was told she was "was not allowed on because I was a single person".
"I felt I was an oddity and not welcome because of my marital status," said Mrs Gration.
"Why was I discriminated against as a single person? I'm quite angry."
Jean McQueen, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said she had also been told she could not stay as a single person at the camp site.
Searles issued two statements after the BBC contacted them in connection with the concerns.
The spokesman for the firm said they were "prepared to exercise discretion" on issues like single person bookings "if we feel it appropriate."
The "question of single occupancy on touring pitches" would be addressed during its next review of customer feedback, the company added.
