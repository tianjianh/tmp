[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manx National Heritage (MNH) has received 114 views in a public consultation on how to use its largest ever donation - a £1m bequest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colby resident John Donald Collister left his estate to the Manx nation following his death aged 93 in 2007.
He worked as a painter after serving with the Manx Regiment in Crete and north Africa during World War II.
MNH Director Edmund Southworth said the suggestions about how to put the money to use were wide-ranging.
He added: "We are delighted with the breadth of feedback received from across the island with suggestions ranging from the display of Mr Collister's World War II memorabilia to supporting community projects, gardening projects, building conservation and wildlife projects, amongst many other things."
MNH first became aware it had been mentioned as a beneficiary in 2011.
Mr Southworth said it had first heard the news in July when the administrator issued a claim in the High Court seeking the assistance of the court in the interpretation of Mr Collister's will.
"In many ways he was an ordinary man but this is an extraordinary story," said Mr Southworth.
"History books are all about kings and queens and the ordinary man tends not to appear, but we now have an opportunity to change that, so that Mr Collister will be remembered for what he had done for this island."
