Selby is now set for a world title chance in what will be only his 10th pro fight as he bids to join older brother Lee Selby as a world champion.
The 28-year old showed his full repertoire against Rosales and he had to, with the Nicaraguan dropping Selby in the first to stun the home crowd.
But Selby recovered and scored a wide and unanimous points victory.
In the co-main event, Matty Askin knocked out Cardiff's Craig Kennedy to claim the vacant British Cruiserweight title.
London 2012 Olympic silver medallist Fred Evans won on his professional debut on the undercard, defeating Najim Fennane 60-54 on points.
For Selby, already Wales' most decorated amateur fighter, there is now a chance to make history by winning a world title in just his 10th professional contest, though he will remember his ninth fight as by far his hardest to date.
A combination ending with a right hand that caught Selby stooping, right between his chin and his chest, saw Rosales make a perfect start, but he could not capitalise on his big moment.
Selby needed to show resilience and did, gradually boxing his way back into the contest as he did enough to catch the eye, winning by a wide margin on the cards, with two judges scoring it 117-110 and the other 118-109.
Selby said after the fight that he is confident of winning a world title, even though he "doesn't like boxing."
"I don't learn moves in the ring, it just comes naturally, to be honest, I don't really like boxing. If I did like it, can you imagine how good I would be?," he told Channel Five.
"I want to make money in life, so that is why I fight. At least I am honest.
"I've got a chance (to make money) because I will be fighting for a world title.
"Who likes getting punched in the face? I don't. I just like the cheques."
