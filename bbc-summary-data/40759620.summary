No player is level par or under after a gruelling day played in howling rain.
United States trio Tom Lehman, Steve Flesch and Billy Mayfair are tied with Langer on one over par, along with Argentine Mauricio Molina.
Rival 2010 Ryder Cup captains Colin Montgomerie and Corey Pavin are five over par, as is the best-placed Welshman, Phillip Price.
Defending champion Paul Broadhurst is seven off the lead, but well inside the cut mark.
