Yassir Ali, from Hall Green, was pulled over by officers on on Weoley Castle Road in February while driving a silver BMW 1 Series that was believed to have been stolen.
His passenger got out and then attempted to obstruct the police car as 30-year-old Ali drove off at high speed.
Officers followed and the footage shows Ali reaching speeds exceeding 80mph through the city's traffic.
He was eventually apprehended on Bristol Road when he drove on to a pavement and became wedged between a bollard and the front of a shop.
Ali, from Russell Road, was jailed for 14 months on 30 March for dangerous driving and driving whilst disqualified.
He also received a five-year driving ban.
