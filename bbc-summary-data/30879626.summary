Meghan Trainor has announced her first ever UK tour.

The US singer, known for just two songs, All About That Bass and Lips are Movin,' will perform four dates in April.
All About That Bass made chart history in the UK in 2014 by becoming the first track to enter the top 40 based on streaming alone rather than through downloads and physical sales.
The song then climbed to number one once it went on sale.
The 21-year-old's tour begins in Manchester on 9 April, before going to Glasgow on 10 April, Birmingham on 11 April and ending on 13 April in London.
Meghan Trainor's debut album, Title, is released later this month.
Tickets for her tour go on sale from 9am on Friday.
