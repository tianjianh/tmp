Maddock, 21, scored a spinning head-kick to beat the South Korean two-time world champion in the -49kg category.
"What a way to end the year," she said. "Over the moon with my performance".
Her fellow Briton Damon Sansum reached the men's -80kg quarter-finals but the 29-year-old world silver medallist lost 5-4 to Albert Gaun of Russia.
Two-time Olympic champion Jade Jones competes in the -57kg category on Saturday, as does Rachelle Booth. Bianca Walkden is in action in the +67kg category and Mahama Cho goes in the men's +80kg.
Earlier on Friday, GB Taekwondo received an increase in UK Sport funding for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic cycle.
