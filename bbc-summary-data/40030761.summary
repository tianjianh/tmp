Varela, 24, got the artwork on Monday - before Saturday's German Cup final - and his arm suffered an inflammation.
"The club cannot tolerate that a player would defy instructions," said sporting director Fredi Bobic.
"We'd been thinking about a loan extension. But that won't happen. He'll be suspended with immediate effect."
The Uruguayan, who joined United in 2013, has only made 10 competitive appearances for the Bundesliga side since joining them on a year-long loan last summer.
However, he had featured in the past five league and cup games.
Eintracht play Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal final at Berlin's Olympiastadion.
