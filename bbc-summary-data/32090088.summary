Hana Khan, 22 of Dollis Hill, north-west London, was convicted in February of two counts under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000 after supplying the money to 28-year-old Jafar Turay.
Mr Turay left the UK in July 2012 to join rebels fighting President Assad's regime.
At the Old Bailey, Khan was sentenced to 21 months, suspended for two years.
Mr Turay first travelled to Saudi Arabia and Egypt before crossing the border into Syria from Turkey in June 2013.
Judge Gerald Gordon said Khan's was an "exceptional case" because she had not been radicalised but had acted out of a misguided notion Turay was serious about making her his wife and setting up home in Turkey.
He said Khan was in "marked contrast" to other young women in the UK who have gone to join Jihadist fighters out of "conviction".
"You were blind to what should have been obvious - that fighting was the reason he was in Syria and at times in Turkey and Egypt also," he said.
Mr Turay, known as Joel Kelvin Daley before he converted to Islam, was wanted by police in connection with a serious assault before he fled the UK.
During the trial the jury heard that Khan and Mr Turay kept in touch via WhatsApp messaging.
The jury was also told Mr Turay sent pictures of children posing with weapons and of him posing with an AK-47 and heavy machine-guns.
In response, Khan told him: "You look beautiful," the court heard.
But he later contacted her saying he was marrying someone else and the judge told her Mr Turay was "cheating on you and lying to you for some time."
