[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien has been ruled out of the Six Nations clash with England on 27 February because of a hamstring injury.

Irish coach Joe Schmidt revealed O'Brien sustained a grade two hamstring tear in the weekend defeat by France.
Wing Dave Kearney is "very likely" to miss the game with a shoulder injury.
Mike McCarthy and Jared Payne are doubts but fly-half Johnny Sexton is set to be available after suffering a "whip-lash" injury in Paris.
Ireland's defeat, in a bruising Stade de France encounter, came with a high injury toll.
Kearney sustained an AC joint injury while McCarthy was stretchered off with concussion and will go through the return to play protocol.
Schmidt said the the Leinster lock will also be assessed by a specialist due to the "nature of the impact".
Ulster centre Payne has a grade one hamstring strain and will be monitored ahead of the Twickenham clash against the Six Nations leaders.
Sexton provided some good news for Schmidt, who said the Leinster player was "feeling a lot better" 48 hours after being forced off injured.
Schmidt added on Monday that he felt "huge disappointment and frustration" following the Paris loss which leaves the reigning champions in fourth place.
