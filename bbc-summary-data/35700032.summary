[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Augustin Dobre and Ionut Muti were caught on CCTV in a council probe into illegal dumping on Priory Road, Aston.
They were recorded dumping items including building rubble, heating pipes and 15 rotting sheep carcasses.
Dobre, 23, of Village Road in Aston, was handed a six-month prison sentence, while 24-year-old Muti, of Wood Lane in Handsworth, will serve 11 months.
The pair were found to have dumped 42 tonnes of waste over 15 visits between August and October last year.
Lisa Trickett, the city council's cabinet member for sustainability, said: "None of our neighbourhoods should have to suffer the misery associated with fly-tipping."
