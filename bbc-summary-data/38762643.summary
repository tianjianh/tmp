Police were called on Wednesday night to the city's south side after a gang ambushed the vigil.
Among the victims was the mother of the 20-year-old dead woman whom mourners had gathered to remember.
Last year the Illinois city recorded 762 homicides, according to police records.
Police spokesman Ron Gaines said the 12-year-old girl suffered a bullet-graze wound to her head, and is currently in hospital in stable condition.
"Another gang saw them on social media and came out and shot up the memorial," community activist Jedidiah Brown told the Chicago Sun-Times.
"No regard for life, they shot up anybody who was there."
A 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old woman are in hospital in a serious condition after suffering gunshot wounds, Officer Gaines said.
The other victims, ranging in age from 17 to 43, are in a stable condition.
No arrests have yet been made.
The attack came hours after President Donald Trump threatened to "send in the Feds" if Chicago officials are unable to stop the "carnage" of gun violence.
It is not clear what type of federal intervention Mr Trump had in mind for the city of 2.7 million people.
So far in 2017, 43 people have been killed in Chicago, according to the Chicago-Sun Times.
