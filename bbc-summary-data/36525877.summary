Chris May, 28, was last seen by family at his home in Kelvedon on 25 May 2015.
His case was formally declared a murder investigation exactly a year later.
A 35-year-old Braintree man has been arrested on suspicion of murder while a 25-year-man from Kelvedon was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

Mr May's abandoned Volkswagen Golf was found in the village of Fairstead, about 10 (16km) miles from Kelvedon on the morning he went missing.
Speaking last month, Det Ch Insp Marina Ericson said Mr May was a drug user who dealt in ecstasy, cocaine and mephedrone.
"There is a strong likelihood that Chris' involvement with drugs is linked to his death," she said in May.
As revealed by BBC News Online, police had reclassified the Chris May case from a missing person's inquiry to a homicide probe as far back as February.
Police withheld this information from the public as part of their investigation.
Essex Police said four letters from anonymous authors have been sent to police claiming to have information about what happened to Mr May.
At least two of them, police, say have been proven to be hoaxes.
