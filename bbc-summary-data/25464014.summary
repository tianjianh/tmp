The Duchy of Cornwall's plans for 800 homes, shops, a supermarket and a primary school have been given the go-ahead.

The project, known locally as Surfbury, will be based east of Newquay's town centre and is similar to the duchy's Poundbury development in Dorset.
The plans were approved by Cornwall Council's strategic planning committee.
However, some councillors are unhappy the development has not been able to deliver more affordable homes.
The Duchy of Cornwall - a major landowner in the south-west of England - owns most of the 218 hectare (538 acre) site, known as Nansledan.
The duchy is a private estate that funds both the charitable and private activities of Prince Charles, who holds the title of Duke of Cornwall.
Tim Gray, estate surveyor to the Duchy of Cornwall, said: "These latest applications are the heart and backbone of the scheme and will secure its future delivery and the wide range of community benefits that will flow from it."
Councillor Geoff Brown said the plans had received some local criticism over the amount of affordable housing.
"That is certainly one of the concerns that local councillors have got," he added.
"I think we are looking somewhere in the region of 27-30% which is significantly less than we would like."
A Duchy of Cornwall spokeswoman said: "The level of affordable housing provision has been agreed by the council, and the development also incorporates a wide range of community benefits.
"The project aims to boost the employment provision in the local area by delivering one job per household throughout the development."
