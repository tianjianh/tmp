The Northern Irishwoman birdied seven of her opening 14 holes before her only dropped shot of the day at the 16th.
Her seven-under-par total left her 10 behind American Brittany Lincicome who added a 65 to her opening 64.
Lexi Thompson fired a 12-under-par 61 to move with a shot of Lincicome.
The leader's round included a hole in one at the 12th.
The American-dominated leaderboard has Gerina Piller in third place, three shots off the pace, with former world number one Stacy Lewis a further stroke.
Meadow, 24, showed signs of a return to form in the latter part of 2016 and she is sharing 20th spot in a group which included England's Melissa Reid heading into Saturday's third round.
The Jordanstown woman finished a superb third on her professional debut at the US Women's Open in 2014 but then suffered tragedy a year later when her father died after a battle with cancer.
