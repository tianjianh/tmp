[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 4-1 St Mirren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Tidser scored two penalties to give Greenock Morton an early-season Renfrewshire derby win over St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both spot-kicks were conceded by Buddies defender Jack Baird, who was sent off after bringing down Bob McHugh for the second after 50 minutes.
Cammy Smith's wonderful 25-yarder had earlier brought St Mirren level.
Morton made the most of having an extra man with McHugh and Andy Murdoch adding further goals, both finding the bottom left-hand corner with low efforts.
It is an important psychological victory for the hosts, who were still smarting from the Paisley side beating them 4-1 on their Greenock patch in April.
One man unavailable to Ton a few months ago was Jai Quitongo because of a lengthy ankle injury.
He is back in the side now and caused St Mirren several problems here with his pace, strength and trickery.
The visitors felt he made too much of Baird's challenge that resulted in referee Willie Collum awarding the first penalty to Morton. Quitongo celebrated the judgement in the face of Baird and received a booking for doing so, as did Baird for the challenge and Craig Samson for protesting.
Samson could not complain about the quality of Tidser's penalty, which sent the Buddies goalkeeper the wrong way.
McHugh and Thomas O'Ware should have put Morton further ahead, and Jim Duffy's men were made to pay for their profligacy when Smith lashed a wonderful strike into the top corner from distance. Stewards had a tough time containing jubilant Saints fans pouring out of the away end.
Straight after the break Baird was in trouble again, bringing down McHugh, who had skilfully evaded the young centre-back following Quitongo's through-ball.
Baird received his marching orders and Tidser competently picked the opposite corner from his opener.
Quitongo snaked his way down the right to set up McHugh's composed finish from inside the box, before the striker turned creator for Murdoch's low drive into the same corner.
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "The turning point was not only the red card but also that we went in front at the same time. It meant the 10 men couldn't sit in for a point and we managed to capitalise on the space they left.
"I'm always a bit unsure whether the same guy [Tidser] should take two penalties in one game but he's a very good penalty taker and long may it continue.
"Bob McHugh and Jai Quitongo, as well as a lot of others today, did very well. We've worked with different combinations up front but we haven't had a pairing because of injuries. Today will help [Quitongo] because like any player he has to believe in himself and get the confidence back. He was shattered at the end because of the work he put in."
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "At the time I thought the first one looked like a penalty. I don't know but I don't think the player needs to make the challenge. When you go to ground you run the risk of giving away a penalty and it wasn't a sensible decision by Jack [Baird].
"I thought as a whole back four we were very poor today. Middle to front we were fine today and created opportunities. Cammy's strike is indicative of how he's been the last few weeks.
"It's very early in the season but there's a lot of things we need to do better."
