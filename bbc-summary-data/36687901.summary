[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US Attorney General Loretta Lynch says she will accept the findings of the FBI and prosecutors investigating Hillary Clinton's private email use.

She said she will move forward with the team's findings on whether to charge the Democratic presidential nominee.
Her comments come a day after it was revealed that she met privately with former President Bill Clinton, prompting strong criticism.
Ms Lynch described the meeting as "social".
She admitted, however, the meeting "cast a shadow" over how her role in the case would be perceived.
"[But] it's important to make it clear that that meeting with President Clinton does not have a bearing on how this matter is going to be reviewed, resolved and accepted by me," she told the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.
The FBI is investigating Mrs Clinton and her aides over whether they mishandled classified information on a private email server she used while serving as Secretary of State.
Ms Lynch, appointed by Democratic US President Barack Obama, will decide whether to prosecute Mrs Clinton after she has been briefed on the investigation's findings.
The Attorney General insists she will move forward with whatever recommendations are made.
Ms Lynch and Mr Clinton's meeting sparked public criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, who said it created an appearance of impropriety.
Ms Lynch has maintained that she did not discuss the email investigation into Mrs Clinton and instead discussed topics including grandchildren and golf.
She said the recommendations will be contained in a final report produced by the team of investigators and prosecutors and reviewed by Justice Department lawyers and FBI Director James Comey, who will then brief Ms Lynch on the findings.
"This case will be resolved by the team that's been working on it from the beginning," she said.
