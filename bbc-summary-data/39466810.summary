The 21-year-old, who was on loan earlier this season at Luton, where he played 33 games, will fill in for Ted Smith who has a wrist problem.
He made his debut for his parent club in a League Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur in October.
Walton, who joined the Seagulls from Plymouth in February 2014, is available for Saturday's game against Oldham.
"We expect Ted to be out for around seven-to-10 days," said Southend manager Phil Brown.
