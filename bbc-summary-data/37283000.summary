York City 0-0 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Tranmere halted their two-game losing run in the National League with a goalless draw at York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers had the better of the first-half chances, Andy Cook and Lois Maynard going close early on before Jeff Hughes had a close-range effort well saved by Kyle Letheren in the closing stages.
The game swung in York's favour after Hughes was sent off for a challenge on Richard Brodie in the opening minutes of the second half but Tranmere threatened again when James Norwood headed the ball against the crossbar.
Justin Johnson fired well over for York in injury time as they failed to make their numerical advantage count.
