Kesha sex claims: Dr Luke tries to bar allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Music producer Dr Luke has asked a judge to dismiss allegations that he sexually abused Kesha.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Attorneys for the 41-year-old argue the singer's claim that she was raped by her mentor is legally barred as she made it too late.
She sued Lukasz Gottwald last month claiming he emotionally and sexually abused her over a decade.
His team say the allegation should be thrown out as it could not have taken place within the past two years.
The producer's case says that in a statement to the court in 2011 (which had remained confidential until a judge revealed it last month) Kesha denied that Gottwald made any sexual advances.
Kesha's attorney Mark Geragos has said that Gottwald threatened his client saying he would harm her if she ever discussed the alleged rape.
Gottwald's lawyers also say a claim of "gender violence" has been made too late.
They may also try to get allegations including sexual harassment dismissed but that will wait until a later date.
"Dr Luke is hiding behind a legally flawed motion which we expect won't work," Geragos wrote in an email.
Kesha and Gottwald have competing lawsuits filed in Los Angeles and New York, respectively.
Dr Luke has worked with lots of major acts including Rihanna and Katy Perry.
He denies all the charges and attorneys say the case is an attempt by the singer to gain a more favourable contract.
The lawsuit states the abuse Kesha claims she suffered lead her to develop a severe eating disorder that required her to enter rehab earlier this year.
She is asking a judge to release her from contracts she signed with Gottwald.
