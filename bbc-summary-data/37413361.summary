Tendring District Council said the matter was raised by a father after visiting the beach at Holland-on-Sea.
His children failed to find any Pokemon Go characters at the beach that attracts thousands of visitors.
A council spokesman said inquiries revealed there had been no slight to the Essex coast.

Nigel Brown, spokesman for the council, said an officer carried out internet-based research into why Holland-on-Sea had no Pokemon Go characters.
"Our research found the locations of Pokemon Go characters is all down to Google traffic," he said.
"We did get the request as to why there were no Pokemon characters in Holland on Sea from a father who had been out with his children.
"Basically, the reason is that there's not enough people using Google along the beach and you cannot actually request characters."
The parent concerned has been informed of the council's findings.
Pokemon's PR firm was approached for comment but has not responded.
