A protester has bared all to show her objections to plans for an incinerator in Gloucestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anna Dart invoked the legendary Lady Godiva by mounting her white horse, dressed only in body paint, to call for a halt on the Javelin Park scheme.
She claims carcinogenic compounds could enter the food chain should the plant go into operation.
Gloucestershire County Council said it was unable to comment.
The incinerator project  attracted strong opposition and was only approved following a public inquiry.
Ms Dart, from Minchinhampton, began her ride, with her face disguised as a Mexican "Day of the Dead" character, as part of a "Toxin Free" rally at the Cross in Gloucester.
She said: "I was terrified the night before, but it went well and there were about 100 people there.
"I wasn't too uncomfortable thankfully, although it was quite cold.
"I feel strongly about this because it's completely irresponsible and burning waste, especially plastics, creates dioxins and furans, two of the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds known to man.
"Incinerator filters regularly fail, and some of these particles cannot be filtered at all so they are breathed in and also passed from grazing animals into the food chain."
Sarah Lunnon, who is stepping down from her role as Green county councillor for Stroud on Thursday, said the scheme was a waste of taxpayers' money.
She said: "It will reduce recycling locally and is a really dirty way of producing electricity."
On its website contractor Urbaser Balfour Beatty said: "The Gloucestershire Energy from Waste plant now under construction will massively reduce the council's dependence on landfilling, whilst recovering value from the waste in the form of electricity, and recyclable metals and aggregate."
Barry Kirby, deputy leader of the Labour group on the county council, said: "The incinerator has been pushed through without common democracy.
"It's been 10 years in procurement and technology has moved on, we should not be closed to new options that use the best technology available."
Conservative councillor for Hardwicke, Tony Blackburn, who is standing down from his post, said there was a lot of feeling against the incinerator locally and he had tried to fight it from within the group.
He said: "It's the wrong process and the wrong scheme."
The Liberal Democrats have been asked to comment.
