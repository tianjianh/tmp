Scowen, 24, who made his first-team debut at the age of 17 with Wycombe, joins on a free transfer having turned down a new contract with the Tykes.
Enfield-born Scowen played 44 games to help Barnsley to a 14th-placed finish in England's second tier last season.
He moved to the Oakwell club for an undisclosed fee in January 2015.
