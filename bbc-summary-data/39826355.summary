Neither of the Britons has yet been beaten in the tournament.
They progressed to their semi-final meeting with Poland via 3-0 victories over China, Italy and Austria.
"Getting to the final and winning every match gives us a lot of confidence," said Reid.
"We expect a much tougher challenge tomorrow but we are ready to step up our level and do our best to achieve what we came here for - to win the title."
