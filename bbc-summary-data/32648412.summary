Election 2015: Lib Dems lose all London MPs bar one

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats have lost all but one of their seats in London, including those of high-profile members of the party such as Business Secretary Vince Cable.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Cable lost to Conservative rival Tania Mathias by more than 2,000 votes.
The party's deputy leader, Simon Hughes was also among those who lost out, along with Energy Secretary Ed Davey.
London mayor Boris Johnson is back in parliament as Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.
Mr Johnson won 22,511 votes, ahead of Labour's Chris Summers, who achieved 11,816 votes.
And Tottenham Labour MP David Lammy, after continuing to hold his seat, said he was interested in running for mayor but it was too early to call.
Liberal Democrat Tom Brake was the only party member to hold his seat in London, in Carshalton and Wallington, beating Tory rival Matthew Maxwell Scott by 1,500 votes.
Mr Cable, 71, had been the MP for Twickenham since 1997 and was made Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in 2010.
"Unfortunately, this has been a terrible night for our party all over," he said following his defeat.
Mr Hughes, who lost to Labour's Neil Coyle in Bermondsey and Old Southwark, had been an MP since 1983 and was described as a "legend" by the party's leader Nick Clegg. He achieved 17,657 votes to Mr Coyle's 22,146.
In his speech, Mr Hughes said it had been his mission to ensure individuals, families and community groups knew there was "somebody there who will fight for them to the end of the earth to make sure they get what they deserve - I think that is a legacy that cannot be undone".
Mr Davey lost out in Kingston and Surbiton to the Conservatives' James Berry, who won 23,249 votes to the Lib Dems' 20,415.
The parties didn't see it coming, the pollsters didn't see it coming and the pundits didn't see it coming.
What an extraordinary night in the capital as some of its leading politicians were sent packing.
Squeezed by the Tories in their south west London heartlands and by Labour in their inner city seats, the Lib Dems were left with just one London MP; punished, they believe, for their role in the coalition government.
Barring that seat, our city is now red and blue, with Labour picking up four seats from the Tories, but not winning four others it had hoped to.
Still, on a terrible night for Labour nationally, they were at least winning seats in the capital.
And as Boris Johnson won in Uxbridge to secure a return to Parliament, thoughts will turn to his current day job because with the ballot boxes barely packed away, the election for London's next mayor is just a year away.
Who will be brave enough to predict that outcome?
Although it was a difficult night across the country for the Labour Party, it easily held on to Holborn in central London with new MP Keir Starmer achieving a majority of more than 17,000.
Labour also gained a seat from the Liberal Democrats, in Hornsey and Wood Green, where Catherine West defeated Lynne Featherstone, securing a majority of more than 11,000.
The party's MP for Tottenham David Lammy also held his seat.
The party also gained in Ealing Central, Brent Central, Ilford North, Hornsey, Bermondsey and Brentford.
Voters in London's marginal seats have been talking to the BBC.
In Finchley and Golders Green, long-time Liberal Democrat supporter Lee Glover said he had turned against the party to vote for UKIP, after the Lib Dems joined the Tories in government.
"What have I got to lose?" he said.
And in Ealing Central and Acton, professional musician Christine Hankin said the economy was a key factor in her decision.
"I don't think you can do anything if you are broke. Everyone has been giving away things that they can't possibly deliver," she said.
