[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man - who has not been named but is thought to be in his 60s or 70s - was found late on Friday evening on Austin Close in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.
Fire ripped through the home on Wednesday which made the building dangerously unstable and had to be dismantled to search for the occupant.
Police and the fire service are investigating the cause of the blaze.
Neighbours said a man lived in the house with two dogs.
It was the second death in the same week in Nottinghamshire after a man was found dead in a fire in nearby Hucknall on Wednesday.
It prompted the fire service to carry out safety advice sessions.
