The 20-year-old hooker, who has won three caps, has previously spent time in the development squad of Super Rugby side Crusaders.
"We have one or two injuries in the hooker position," Quins director of rugby John Kingston said.
"He came on to our radar when we trained with Samoa recently. I'm sure he will make a valuable impact."
Elia featured as a replacement in Samoa's matches against France and Georgia in November, and made his first start against Canada on Saturday.
