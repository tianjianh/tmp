Drivers have reported engines problems after buying diesel from a Tesco filling station in Dorset.

The supermarket said it was "urgently investigating" problems encountered by at least 20 customers at its store at Branksome, Poole.
Customers have complained of damage running into thousands of pounds being done to their vehicles.
Tesco said a first round of tests on fuel sold in Poole had been inconclusive.
The supermarket said more samples had been taken for testing and told customers to continue to take receipts to the store where fuel was bought.
Jonathan Waddington-Jones said his Ford car broke down when being driven to Weymouth by his wife after she had bought diesel at the store.
He said the breakdown had caused a "great deal of inconvenience" to his family.
Robbie Studwick from Bournemouth said he smelt a "plastic, toxic smell" from his exhaust after filling up on Thursday.
He has been told Â£5,000 of damage has been done to his Toyota and faces problems in running his wedding photography business.
Among customers complaining to Tesco on Twitter, @johnpenfold tweeted: "car is ruined after filling up at Branksome branch. I've no car with 3 kids"
@lincnew tweeted: "New Van ruined long journey big Â£Â£."
Tesco said anyone experiencing problems after buying diesel at the Branksome filling station in the last few days should contact the store.
