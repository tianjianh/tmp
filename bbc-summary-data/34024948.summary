Wolves sealed their first home league win of the season and put an end to Charlton Athletic's unbeaten start thanks to Adam Le Fondre's late goal.

Johann Gudmundsson gave Charlton the lead in the second half with a powerful shot drilled under keeper Carl Ikeme.
Wolves equalised soon after when Dave Edwards coolly poked the ball home on the rebound after his shot was blocked.
And Le Fondre gave Wolves all three points when he fired Benik Afobe's low cross into the net.
Wolves almost took an early lead when Afobe laid the ball on to the onrushing James Henry, who curled the ball just wide of the post.
Ikeme kept the scores level when he caught Chris Solly's free-kick, while Wolves almost found a breakthrough but Edwards failed to latch onto Henry's cross.
The visitors were in front after the break through Gudmundsson's low shot and they could have doubled their lead when Zakarya Bergdich fired wide after stealing possession off Matt Doherty.
After a delay in play following an injury to Nouha Dicko, Wolves restored parity when Henry's low cross was stabbed past Charlton keeper Nick Pope at the second attempt by Edwards.
The hosts marked their first home league win of the season when Afobe's low cross deceived the Charlton back line to find its way to Le Fondre, who made no mistake from close range.

"I felt it was a deserved win. I thought we passed the ball very well and some of our play was excellent but we couldn't get that final ball or take the chances up and around the box in the first half.
"We went a goal behind slightly unluckily then I was delighted with the character of the team to come back after that.
"After two recent losses it was great to get three points going into the international break."
Charlton manager Guy Luzon:

"Of course I am very disappointed because I am pleased with our performance especially in the second half.
"We played well and played positive football, we moved the ball well. We scored one and had a chance to score the second.
"In the second half we had an influence on the game and took possession. I changed the tactics a bit and played with three in the midfield and we played better. So I am very disappointed because I think that we deserved more then zero points. But it is part of the game and we continue."
