[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Aberdeen crossing name selected as Diamond Bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new crossing over the River Don in Aberdeen is set to be named the Diamond Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£22m road bridge - which is expected to open next month - will link the Bridge of Don and Tillydrone.
Diamond Bridge was selected following a vote by local schoolchildren.
Councillors will be asked to approve the name, which is in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, as well as Aberdeen's links to the naval destroyer HMS Diamond.
The aim of the project is to improve access in the north of Aberdeen.
