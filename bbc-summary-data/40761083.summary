Chesterfield 1-3 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield's new-look team crashed to a defeat against Grimsby with both sides having a man sent off at the Proact Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nathan Clarke and Sam Jones gave Grimsby a two-goal interval lead and, although Kristian Dennis replied, Ben Davies scored from the spot with Ian Evatt and Zak Mills dismissed in the closing minutes.
Chesterfield fielded seven new faces and started well but missed chances before Grimsby scored in the 33rd minute. Clarke headed in a corner at the back post and Kelly made it two after Siriki Dembele's strong run six minutes later.
Joe Anyon brilliantly saved from Clarke in the 53rd minute and Chesterfield's pressure told when Dennis fired in from a corner in the 82nd minute - only for Grimsby to seal victory moments later.
Evatt brought down Harry Cardwell and was given a second yellow before Davies fired in the penalty and Grimsby had Mills sent off for a clash with Dennis.
