[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman whose body was found in the sea off the Isle of Man likely "spent a significant period" in the water, a coroner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joanna Dabrowska, 33, was  was pulled from the water by members of the public on 5 July last year.
Coroner John Needham said it was likely that the body of the company director from Poland had drifted from Ireland.
Recording an open verdict at Douglas Courthouse, he said he could not determine the cause or place of death.
The court heard that Ms Dabrowska's body, which had been in the sea for "several weeks", was identified by DNA and dental analysis.
Mr Needham said she had been "enjoying a well-deserved break" after working for a period in Germany.
He added: "She liked to travel and was on holiday living on her savings- it seems she kept herself to herself and was a bit of a loner".
Ms Dabrowska, who had been renting a room in a private house in Dublin, was reported missing at the beginning of June 2015 by her landlord.
On 5 July, her body was found by two members of the public about a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) from Douglas beach, on the east coast of the island.
Two men, on a private boat, removed the body from the sea before calling the coast guard and taking the body ashore.
Isle of Man police said Euros and a supermarket receipt found in a rucksack attached to Ms Dabrowska's body indicated she had been in Ireland but there was no evidence to suggest she had ever visited either the Isle of Man or the UK.
Coroner Needham said: "It is likely that she arrived here by her body drifting in the sea- I find she did not enter the water from the Isle of Man.
"Police enquiries have thrown no light on how, where and when Joanna's body entered the sea but there was no disease and no traumatic injuries to the skull.
"I'm not in a position to determine place of death- it would be wrong to speculate.
"It is notoriously difficult to estimate the time of death after a significant period of immersion, which the pathologist estimates to be several weeks.
"The date of her death would have been between 27 May and 25 June".
