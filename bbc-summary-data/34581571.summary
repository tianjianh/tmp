A lorry bearing the slogan "Intelligent Logistics" crashed into the building in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, on Monday.
The driver is thought to have missed the warning sign on Ney Street, which is unsuitable for large vehicles.
Haulage firm Dachser said an investigation was under way.
A warning sign which reads: "Do not follow SAT NAV - next left" was placed on the road after previous crashes.
Nick Lowe, UK managing director, said: "Obviously, the driver clearly didn't see the sign. It doesn't excuse anything, but I understand it's the third time the house has been hit.
"The fact is, we have hit it now and we shouldn't have done. We are investigating what happened and there will be lessons learned from this."
The owner of the home, which was left with large cracks across its front, had been contacted by the company, he said.
Nobody was inside the property at the time and there were no injuries.
