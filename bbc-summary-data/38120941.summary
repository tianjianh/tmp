At the scene of their promotion to the Football League a decade ago there was no sign of an upset for Stanley, who were helped along the way by the dismissal of Cards midfielder Charlie Carter in the 36th minute.
Dennon Lewis scuffed a great chance wide for Woking in the second minute after being played through by Gozie Ugwu, before Paddy Lacey struck a free-kick narrowly wide for Accrington.
The visitors broke through after 34 minutes when the home defence failed to deal with Matty Pearson's cross and the ball broke for Kee to score.
And within a minute Woking were down to 10 men when Carter was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Seamus Conneely in the Stanley penalty area.
Accrington took complete control by doubling their lead three minutes before half-time when Pearson's low ball was swept into the bottom corner by Kee's first-time effort.
And in what was a comfortable second half for John Coleman's men, John O'Sullivan added a third just after the hour mark by planting a superb header into the net from Jordan Clark's cross.
