[SN]TITLE[SN]
Genoa 3-0 AC Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AC Milan missed the chance to go top of Serie A as they were heavily beaten away against Genoa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Nikola Ninkovic and Leonardo Pavoletti as well as a Juraj Kucka own goal condemned 10-man Milan to defeat.
Defender Gabriel Paletta was sent off in the second half for a wild two-footed lunge on Genoa's Luca Rigoni.
A win would have moved Milan above leaders Juventus and second-placed Roma - who both play on Wednesday - but Vincenzo Montella's side stay third.
