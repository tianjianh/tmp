Council mergers delayed as deal agreed to pass bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bill to pave the way for local government reform has been passed after Plaid Cymru agreed a deal with the Labour Welsh government to back it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No council mergers will now take place before the 2016 assembly election.
Plaid Cymru said it had stopped Labour's "centralisation agenda" and pledged to let the 22 councils work together as combined authorities.
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said each party could now set out its proposals at the election.
He thanked Plaid Cymru for its "constructive approach".
"It is clear that status quo is not an option for local government, and an important part of the framework can now be put in place for much needed reform," he said.
"It is now down to each political party to set our their proposals in the coming election."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood claimed her party had "stopped Labour from enforcing their map for local government reorganisation through the back door before plans are put to people".
"Large scale changes to local government structures should not be decided by politicians with no mandate but should be decided by people in an election," she said.
But Conservative shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders accused Ms Wood of "astonishing hypocrisy".
"Barely 72 hours after criticising Labour, Plaid's leader has happily cosied up and done a deal with them," she said.
Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black called the agreement "humiliating stuff".
He said: "Plaid have sold out, but received absolutely nothing in return.
"It's bizarre."
