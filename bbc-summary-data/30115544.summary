Swansea Bay was launched as Wales' first "city region" to boost investment, regeneration and jobs.
Sir Terry said there are huge opportunities for the area, which covers Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire.
The meeting was held at the TWI Technology Centre-Wales, Port Talbot.
Referring to the job loses at Murco in Milford Haven, Sir Terry said there was "no reason why Pembrokeshire cannot attract jobs in the software sector".
However, Carmarthen Town councillor Alun Lenny voiced concerns about the effects of the Swansea Bay City region on the rest of west Wales.
He fears the rest of west Wales will miss out on grants as they will be filtered through the Swansea Bay City Region.
