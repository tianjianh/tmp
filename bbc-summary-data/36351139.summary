Gerard Quinn, 24, died after being assaulted in Milldale Crescent on Saturday night. It is understood he was at a house party.
His twin brother also received injuries to his head, but they are not believed to be serious.
Police were contacted at about 22:30 BST. Mr Quinn was taken to hospital by ambulance where he later died.
A post-mortem examination will take place on Monday and have appealed for witnesses.
Det Ch Insp Michael Harvey said: "At this time, it is my belief that there was some sort of altercation in the Milldale Crescent area and another man was also assaulted though his injuries are not life threatening."
SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said it was "awful news" that a man had been murdered in the city.
"This morning a family is coming to terms with the death of a son in the most horrific of circumstances," he said.
"The loss of a young man in any circumstances is absolutely tragic but to have had someone with their whole life in front of them murdered like this will be particularly devastating for his family and his community."
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Christopher Jackson said there was "shock in the community on hearing this news".
"My thoughts and prayers are with this young man's family at this time and I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward to the PSNI," he said.
