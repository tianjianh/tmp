[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of India Chipchase, 20, was found under sheeting on a mattress at a house in Stanley Road in Northampton, on 31 January.
Home Office pathologist Michael Biggs told a Birmingham Crown Court jury she had "bruises around the neck consistent with pressure being applied".
Edward Tenniswood, 52, of Stanley Road, Northampton, denies murder.
The defendant, who worked as a bookkeeper, also denies raping Miss Chipchase.

Dr Biggs told the court the injuries were mainly bruises and scratches, some of which may have been caused by Ms Chipchase falling over after drinking alcohol.
The 20-year-old's blood alcohol level was about three times the drink-drive limit, the court was told.
But the jury also heard she suffered from blunt force trauma to her face and neck, consistent with assault.
A post-mortem examination concluded the cause of death was pressure on the neck.
Earlier, the court heard Mr Tenniswood turned up outside NB's cocktail bar in Northampton in the early hours of 30 January
He "led, steered or escorted" the social care student and part-time barmaid to a taxi, took her to his rented terraced house in Stanley Road and then "raped and throttled" her, the jury was told.
The trial continues.
