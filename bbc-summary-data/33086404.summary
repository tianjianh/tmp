Telford councillors say 24-hour A&E; at the Princess Royal is 'not negotiable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Telford have said they are not prepared to negotiate over the continuation of 24-hour accident and emergency services at the Princess Royal Hospital.

The hospital trust, which also runs the Royal Shrewsbury, has previously said it would be "unrealistic" to assume both hospitals would keep the service.
The council called on the health secretary to decide A&E's future.
But the government said the decision would be made locally.
Telford and Wrekin Council's deputy leader Richard Overton said a 24-hour A&E was "essential" to the borough.
"We are committed to continuing to put pressure on the new government to ensure that 24/7 accident and emergency services are retained at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford," he said.
"We are calling on the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ensure a final decision confirming this is reached as soon as possible."
He said Mr Hunt or the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) had so far refused to give "any reassurances these services will be protected".
"We have made clear that keeping 24-hour A&E services is our line in the sand that we feel is not negotiable," he said.
However, the Department for Health said the assurance was not Mr Hunt's to give.
"This is a decision that will be made locally," it said.
The Telford and Wrekin CCG said it was, "working to develop robust, high-quality and sustainable services that met the needs of the local population".
David Evans, chief officer of the CCG said: "I should like to reassure [councillors] that each of the ways we are considering will deliver sufficient and appropriate high-quality care for the people of Telford and Wrekin.
"That includes the needs of those who have accidents and emergencies".
