Seaton Carew redevelopment 'not de-railed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Regeneration plans for a seaside town will not be de-railed by the decision to block the compulsory purchase of an "eyesore", the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hartlepool Council wanted to demolish the Longscar building on the Seaton Carew seafront, which has been empty since 2009, and create a market space.
However, a Compulsory Purchase  Order (CPO) was turned down in October.
The council has now approved plans for an outdoor leisure park to the north of the building.
It will include children's play equipment and water jets, as well as beach huts along the promenade.
There will also be improvement to the Grade II listed clock tower and bus station and the surrounding area.
Councillor Kevin Cranney, chair of the regeneration services committee, said: "Although we were bitterly disappointed with the government's decision not to confirm the CPO, we want to send out a clear message that we remain fully committed to the regeneration of Seaton Carew.
"The re-phased masterplan still provides us with an opportunity to bring about some significant redevelopment that builds upon recent improvements to the sea defences and promenade and benefits the local economy."
