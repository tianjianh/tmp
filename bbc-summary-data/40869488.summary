Super 8s: Wigan Warriors 18-4 Huddersfield Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan won a scrappy, error-strewn tussle with Huddersfield to keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish in the Super League Super 8s.

Anthony Gelling cancelled out Jermaine McGillvary's try for Warriors, before Liam Farrell's score put them ahead.
The second half saw both sides cough up good ball, but Sam Powell's penalty goals gave Wigan an eight-point lead.
Sam Tomkins' last-second score added insult to injury for the Giants, who ran out of time.
Only points difference separated the two teams before kick-off, meaning the game had a feel of a shootout to stay involved in the top four race.
Defeat means the Giants are eighth, five points behind Wakefield in fourth, but there are surely too many teams in the mix for them to make up the difference.
The filthy conditions and some sterling defence helped keep the scoring down, as both teams ran aground on huge efforts around the goal line.
Wigan had just enough execution to break Giants down, notably through Sam Powell who came off the bench to have a big impact for the Challenge Cup finalists.
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane:
"Our defence was miles better. You have to remember Huddersfield have been flying, beating teams and scoring lots of points.
"They have some great attacking players in their team, so to defend that way was great. They were difficult conditions. Our attack at times was good, the score could have easily been 30 points if Joe Burgess had caught the ball a few times.
"It's been a really tough week for everybody and it will be another one this week."
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone:
"I think the opposition were a bit better to be honest. They were a bit hungrier and keener.
"We had our chances, we were closest enough if we were good enough. We needed to execute a bit better.
"We threw enough bullets at them, but they defended pretty well on their goal line and they were a little bit more intense than us and had more desire in their carries and defence."
