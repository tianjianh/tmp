Queens Park Rangers 1-1 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City stretched their unbeaten run to five Championship games as they drew at Queens Park Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both goals came from first-half corners as first Lukas Jutkiewicz headed the visitors in front before an unmarked Steven Caulker levelled for QPR.
Adam Legzdins saved from Tjaronn Chery after the break as QPR failed to win for a fifth game in all competitions but ended their three-match losing run.
Birmingham, unbeaten away from home so far this term, remain in the top six.
Having gone 28 months without a goal before scoring his stoppage-time winner against Sheffield Wednesday, Jutkiewicz found his second goal in two games to give Blues the lead as he nodded in from close range after Michael Morrison's header.
He had forced a good save from Alex Smithies early on, as Birmingham - who were without striker Clayton Donaldson through injury - started brightly.
All 11 of QPR's league goals so far this season have come from set-pieces and the result keeps them 16th in the table.
Both sides pushed for a winner in the second half but Idrissa Sylla missed the target for the hosts after his team-mate Nedum Onuoha had blazed well over.
QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"Our display was very good. We had a setback when they scored but it didn't affect us and that was really pleasing to see.
"In the second half there was only one team in it and we did very well. Unfortunately for us their keeper made good saves.
"But I must say I am happy with that performance and we need to put that kind of performance in regularly.
"If you can make a string of these kind of performances then you will win games and that is what we now need to do."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett:

"Ryan Shotton lost his man. He apologised to the other lads at half-time. He just switched off for a second and didn't get tight.
"We knew QPR, given that they're under pressure after recent results, might go a little bit more direct and put balls in to make us defend.
"I felt we were fairly comfortable, and we scored, but it was very disappointing that we then allowed them to get into an area to get a corner and then score."
"In the second half we had to weather it a bit. It was a combination of QPR's desperation to get that win they're looking for and us being poor."
