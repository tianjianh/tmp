Angharad Rees: Family demand answers after her death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a woman who died during a horse and trap fun day have demanded answers about the suitability of the course.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2012, Angharad Rees, 18, was thrown from the trap her horse was pulling. She hit her head on a tree and sustained a fatal injury.
She was not wearing a helmet.
A coroner declared her death "accidental" but concerns were raised about the suitability of the route.
Now her family have demanded the event organisers are prosecuted.
The event, called the Marathon, took place on 27 May 2012 at Afan Argoed Country Park in Port Talbot.
The inquest heard how there were difficulties in getting medical help to her due to the location of the accident and she later died in hospital.
At the time, a report into the incident by Neath Port Talbot council's environmental health team raised serious questions about the route's suitability.
And after a three year battle, the family have reiterated their demands for the organisers of the event to be prosecuted.
Miss Rees's father Gavin said the route that had been chosen was unacceptable for the event.
"I've walked it on numerous occasions and in my opinion to take a horse and trap down there is beyond belief," he said.
"I'm not saying it couldn't be done if you're a cross country rider... but not on a fun day event."
But the organiser of the event, British Driving Society (BDS), said it had been a tragic accident which they say was supported by the coroner's verdict of "accidental death".
It said around 10 others had descended the slope without incident before Miss Rees and participants were clearly warned that the tracks were single-track, and to expect uneven terrain and tree roots, plus uphill and downhill slopes.
The society added that participants of the event were advised to wear hard hats but Miss Rees had chosen not to. At the inquest, the coroner said that it was unclear whether the outcome would have been different if she had been wearing one.
The coroner also wrote to the society suggesting hard hats be made compulsory for participants at similar events but BBC Wales understands that no change has been implemented for those who are more than 14 years of age.
The family's solicitor Peter Davies said there were more questions to be answered.
"A number of issues have issues have come to light since the inquest and I am wondering, had that information been made available and the proper questions asked, whether the verdict would have been the same?" he said.
Although the family knew another inquest was not a possibility, Mr Davies said they still wanted answers.
Neath Port Talbot council said it would be restarting its investigation and would not comment on the matter.
The CPS told the family on Friday it would not be pursuing two of the three potential offences it had been asked to consider but would continue to review a third.
