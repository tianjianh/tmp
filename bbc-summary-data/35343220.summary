The 25-year-old prop, who has won 37 caps for England and featured at last year's World Cup, was captain of the club during the 2014-15 season.
The Premiership side have not disclosed the length of Marler's new deal at the Twickenham Stoop.
"When he develops into the player he can be, he will become one of the great loose-head props in world rugby," director of rugby Conor O'Shea said.
"I am staggered that Joe is still only 25. He already has a wealth of experience. This is a massive re-signing for us."
Marler has scored six tries in 131 appearances for the south-west London club since making his senior debut in 2009.
"After a tough 2014-15 season, both personally and as a team, I took some time to think about my future," Marler said.
"It quickly dawned on me that this is exactly where I want to be."
