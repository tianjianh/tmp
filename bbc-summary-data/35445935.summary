A 15-year-old boy from Northern Ireland arrested in connection with the TalkTalk hacking attack has settled his claim for damages against Twitter.

The County Antrim boy's privacy action was resolved on confidential terms, with no admission of liability by Twitter.
Meanwhile, his lawyers are seeking High Court permission to serve proceedings on Google at its headquarters in the United States.
Google is resisting the move.
It is believed to involve a world-first attempt to sue it for negligence.
An application for leave to issue a writ out of the jurisdiction has been adjourned until March.
Separate lawsuits are also continuing against three national newspapers over the publicity surrounding the teenager's arrest.
The three newspapers defending the action, The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun, have all given undertakings aimed at protecting his identity pending the outcome of the case.
The boy was arrested last October. He was later released on bail.
An order prohibiting the publication of any material that could lead to the boy being identified remains in place.
