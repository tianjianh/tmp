The fire broke out at about 23:00 BST on Sunday at JWS Waste in Frederick Road and was tackled by 40 firefighters from six fire stations.
About 25 firefighters were still at the scene during the morning and fumes from the fire could be smelt more than three miles away.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said the cause was not known.
Firefighters are still damping down pockets of fire at a holding building, 195ft (60m) by 96ft (30m) in the plant, which deals with "general household waste".
The fire crews found a large blaze and lots of smoke when they arrived, said Jon Aspinall, Group Manager for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.
Mr Aspinall said: "I would like to ask local residents to keep their windows and doors closed until further notice.
"In addition to fighting the fire, we are also conducting an environmental plan to make sure that any water used is disposed of safely."
Frederick Road, has reopened, after being closed both ways between Lissadel Street and Seaford Road to allow firefighters to take water from the River Irwell.
