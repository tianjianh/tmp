Osaka, 18, fought back from 5-0 down in the second set but world number 28 Wozniacki wrapped up her 24th career title in just under two hours.
The Dane, 26, has now won a tournament in every season since 2008.
"I'm enjoying it at the moment," said Wozniacki, who received treatment for a thigh injury during the final.
"Injuries happen and you never know when you can be taken out of the game, so I'm just savouring every minute."
