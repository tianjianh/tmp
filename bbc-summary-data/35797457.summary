Barbara Henderson, from Newcastle, was 18 in 1971 when she knocked on the door of the record company's London offices.
"It was 10 o'clock at night and amazingly he answered the door," she said.
Auctioneer Fred Wyrley-Birch said: "The market for anything Beatles-related is very strong and, as time goes on, there is more and more interest."
The 16 Apple Corps pictures to be auctioned include images of The Beatles, John Tavener, James Taylor, The Radha-Krishna Temple, Mary Hopkin, Yoko Ono and Jackie Lomax.
The company's security guard had taken Ms Henderson and her friend around the building and given them photos and albums, she said.
"I don't really want to let them go but they're gathering dust," she said.
"They're so rare - I have never seen them anywhere else and I'm always looking for Beatles pictures."
The auction is due to take place on March 23.
