[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A waxwork of Coronation Street's Ken Barlow at Madame Tussauds in Blackpool has been removed over fears of it being damaged, a spokesman has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Roache, the actor who plays the ITV soap character, is facing two charges of rape of a girl aged 15 in Lancashire between April and July 1967.
A Madame Tussauds spokesman said it has been removed because of "inappropriate behaviour" by some visitors.
ITV is yet to comment on what is described as a "temporary" move.
Madame Tussauds said it "never comments or moralises on the character or specific activities of those figures we include".
A statement said: "Our figures are chosen because we, and our visitors, believe that they have made a significant impact/contribution to the world around them or in their chosen field - good or bad - or they earn their place through visitor demand, as in this case.
"We make no judgements on recent events, which are in any case far from clear, but over recent days we have received a number of comments relating to the continued inclusion of the figure, but even more importantly witnessed some unacceptable behaviour from a very small number of visitors."
It continued: "We have therefore decided to temporarily remove the figure from display, and we will review this decision in the light of future events."
The spokesman would not expand on what the "inappropriate behaviour" was or on whether the waxwork had been damaged.
The Coronation Street set in the attraction on the Promenade features a number of characters from the soap, which was formerly Louis Tussaud's Waxworks before reopening in 2011.
