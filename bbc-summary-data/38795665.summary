The 28-year-old former Portsmouth and Bristol City forward has scored four goals in 31 games this season, with just one of them coming in League One.
His best goalscoring campaign to date was in 2010-11, when he netted 12 times for Rotherham in the fourth tier.
"He's a striker that takes the ball in - he'll take us up the pitch," Pilgrims boss Derek Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"He's experienced, he's won promotion out of this league and he's played the last five games for Oxford, so he comes in and he's ready to go."
Meanwhile, Adams says he hopes to sign a winger from a Championship club before the transfer window closes.
"It's been going on for a number of weeks now, and we're just waiting to hear back," the 41-year-old added.
