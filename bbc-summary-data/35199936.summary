Steve Absalom, 64, from Neath Abbey is the chair of Dyffryn Clydach Volunteers.
The group of up to 40 local people helps renew footpaths and manage woodlands.
Projects have also included creating canal-side fishing for disabled people and an outdoor classroom in Coed-y-Craig Woods at Longford.
The group, which has expanded its work across Neath Port Talbot, has increased the number of rare flowers called the Deptford Pink from 40 to over 400.
"I'm obviously delighted to receive the award which is a recognition of all that our volunteers have done over the years," said Mr Absalom, a former welder and refinery worker.
He dedicated the honour to three late members, Ron Jenkins, Brian Williams and Don Bater "who did a tremendous amount" and brought practical skills ranging from engineering to carpentry.
"The Clydach valley is an area the local community can be proud of, with a green wedge between two areas of housing," he added.
The New Year Honours also saw actress Sian Phillips, originally from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, become a dame.
There are OBEs for Carolyn Kirby, president of the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales and chairman of Cancer Information and Support Services in south-west Wales, and Bruce McLernon, Carmarthenshire council's director of social care, health and housing.
Another OBE goes to Swansea-based Dr Alan Willson, until recently director of the 1000 Lives Improvement Service at Public Health Wales.
Other MBEs include Terry Bravin, for work with the air cadets in Swansea; Erika Walker, who runs a community cafe in Ammanford, and Lyndon Jones, deputy chairman of the Welsh Conservatives and chairman of Gower Conservative Association.
NFU Cymru's former director Mary James, from Llandeilo, also received a MBE after 37 years working for the farming industry.
"I was not expecting this but I'm very pleased," she said.
BEMs include British Heart Foundation cardiac nurse Wendy Churchouse, who is based at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.
Wendy, who lives in Llandeilo, said it was her family's experience of heart disease that led to her specialising in cardiac treatment.
"My father died from heart disease so this inspired me to focus on cardiac care."
