The players had refused to do any media or commercial activities while a dispute over financial, commercial and equality issues was ongoing.
However, the two parties have come to an agreement in what a players' statement called "a historic moment" on the way to "achieving equality".
"We're delighted it's over," Lauder told BBC Scotland.
"It means now we can really concentrate on the Euros, which both the women's national team and the SFA are both really looking forward to."
Scotland Women are preparing for their first appearance at a major tournament, the 2017 European Championship, which kicks off in the Netherlands next month. The dispute had, however, threatened to overshadow the build-up to the event.
Lauder is glad to be able to focus on football again after the first collective agreement between the women's national team and the SFA ended the row and, as the players' union said in a statement, took Scotland's Women a "major step" closer to parity with the men's game.
For Lauder, who first represented Scotland at under-19 level 10 years ago and has since earned 82 senior caps, running out a major finals would be the realisation of a dream.
"It has been a long wait," said the 27-year-old Glasgow City midfielder.
"I've been involved for many years now and had a few near misses, like getting put out in play-offs.
"It's what we've worked hard for since we were young girls and now the chance is there, so hopefully we go and take it."
Ahead of the announcement on Tuesday, Lauder is hopeful she has done enough to make it into boss Anna Signeul's finals squad.
"I wouldn't say I'm calm, I think there's always a bit of trepidation going into it," said Lauder.
"But, like I say, it's out of our control now.
"We've trained hard and put ourselves in front of Anna to showcase what we can do, so it's up to her now."
After Glasgow City's 2-0 win over Celtic on Sunday, head coach Scott Booth gave his backing to Lauder and her team-mates Jo Love and Lee Alexander, who are all in with a chance of making the Scotland squad.
"I'm looking forward to seeing Hayley and Jo and Lee, all these players that have given so much to the national team over the years, get the chance to go and do it on the big stage," said Booth, who was in Craig Brown's Scotland squad at Euro 96 and the World Cup in France in 1998.
"It's nice when you're there because you know that there are only certain players in the world that are still playing football competitively at that time, and the reason why they're still playing is because you're at a major tournament.
"That's a nice feeling that you're one of the ones that are there, so I'm hoping that they feel that.
"I'm delighted for them and I'm looking forward to seeing them myself."
