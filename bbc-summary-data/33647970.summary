Public disturbances in the spotlight in China

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All kinds of people have been "disturbing public order" this week in China. It almost, but not quite, makes you feel sorry for Big Brother.

Could China's security forces ever have predicted the "Spartans", a sales force of 100 half-naked foreign male models with ripped torsos and leather hotpants marching through the streets of Beijing?
Far from protesting subjugation of their rights in a militarised society or defeat by an invader army, the "Spartans" were chanting an advertising slogan for a salad restaurant. Some "Spartans" ended up pinned to the ground by police, some were even detained briefly.
Whether you're selling rocket leaves or real estate, renting white foreigners has become a fashionable way to get publicity in China. And I know marketing people say all publicity is good publicity.
But I'm not sure that's true in China and this particular bright idea definitely triggered a lot of attention from people other than those likely to buy salad.
Back to the serious stuff. Forget trials in court, it's been a week of trial by TV confessional.
Two weeks since the detention and interrogation of more than 200 people over human rights defence including lawyers and their staff, the flow of invective from Chinese state media goes on and the Ministry of Public Security has announced charges against key figures for "disrupting public order" and "violating trial proceedings".
The objective seems to be a warning loud and clear that from now on, sensational human rights cases publicised through clever social media campaigns will no longer be tolerated as a way of tackling China's injustices and social problems.
State media focused their fury on the director of Beijing's Fengrui law firm, Zhou Shifeng. The Xinhua news agency said he had "admitted guilt" and pleaded for a "second chance".
But it is impossible to assess his "confession" since his whereabouts have not been disclosed nor has he seen a defence lawyer.
Instead the state built its case against him by broadcasting the TV allegations of a former colleague, Huang Liqun (also in detention whereabouts unknown) who claimed that Mr Zhou "had inappropriate relationships with at least five women".
"Inside the court, he put pressure on judges. Outside the court, he hired professional troublemakers to hold banners and shout slogans. This is his ulterior political motive. He also made money out of it."
Mr Huang said that Zhou considered himself the "Song Jiang" of the legal profession.
Song Jiang was a 12th-Century Chinese outlaw and folk hero in the "take from the rich to give to the poor" Robin Hood mould.
Mr Zhou had indeed represented many impoverished and marginalised clients including the families of children who were poisoned by contaminated milk powder in 2008.
The state accused him and others of greed and venality but the human rights lawyers who are not behind bars this week retort that they'd have an easier life and earn much more money if they stuck to commercial law.
State media say the rule of law is not served by the methods of these human rights defenders. The latter say the rule of law is not served by an assault on lawyers.
What is not in doubt is that the extraordinary media barrage is designed to destroy the credibility of rights defence lawyers in the eyes of the public and to warn off anyone who might follow in their footsteps.
Early this month, the Dalai Lama celebrated his 80th birthday, prompting a discussion of questions surrounding his mortality and re-incarnation.
But death delivers as many ironies as life and in the event, it was another Tibetan religious figure who died, triggering a storm of protest.
Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a 65-year-old monk, had been serving a life sentence in a Chinese prison, accused of terrorism and separatism.
Human rights groups had long campaigned for his release, saying the charges were politically motivated because of Chinese unease about his social welfare work and opposition to illegal mining and deforestation.
His death triggered protests in his home area calling for the return of his body for traditional Tibetan rites. Instead his body was cremated, members of his family were detained and his ashes were reportedly confiscated from Tibetans who were carrying them home.
State media said Tenzin Delek Rinpoche had died of a heart attack, adding: "It is common around the world for a long-term prisoner to die of illness in jail."
But now protests by Tibetan students have spread to Chinese consulates in New York and San Francisco, and in Australia, police arrested eight protesters who stormed the Chinese consulate in Sydney, including one who climbed a flagpole to pull down the Chinese flag.
In the absence of meaningful dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Beijing, climbing flagpoles and confiscating a monk's mortal remains is how the two sides communicate with each other. Imagine what it might look like when the 80-year-old Dalai Lama himself passes away.
Time to lift the gloom for a moment. China's air may be improving. The average density of damaging PM2.5 particles dropped perhaps 16% in some areas in the first half of 2015.
This improvement is partly due to weather conditions for which the government can take no credit, but partly due to slowing economic growth and efforts on energy-saving and emissions reductions. Look up in China and some nights, you might even see the stars.
More good numbers for Beijing: stock markets are up. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen finished the week with a strong rally and the number of suspended companies down to under a fifth after the carnage of two weeks ago.
At the height of the crisis, Beijing made big players promise not to sell shares until the Shanghai index climbs back to the 4500 mark.
It seems to be heading back in that direction and when it gets there it will be interesting to see whether confidence is back to stay.
