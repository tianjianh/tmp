Bieber missed out on the Christmas number one after his single Love Yourself was knocked off the top spot by the NHS Choir's A Bridge Over You.
But his track returned to the summit in the first chart of 2016 while the NHS Choir's single dropped to number 29 - a new chart record for the biggest fall from the top spot.
Adele's album 25 remained at the top of the album chart for a sixth week.
Last week saw Bieber urge his Twitter followers to buy the NHS Choir's charity single, to help them secure the Christmas top slot. He tweeted:  "For 1 week it's OK not to be #1. Let's do the right thing & help them win. It's Christmas. "
This week, both Bieber's Sorry and What Do You Mean climbed one place to number two and number four respectively, with Adele's single Hello also shuffling up a place to number three.
Forever Young, the single by X Factor winner Louisa Johnson, surprisingly slipped out of the top 40 completely on its third week, despite having been expected to be a contender for the Christmas chart.
The record for the biggest drop from the top of the chart had been jointly held by McFly and Elvis Presley.
The boyband achieved the unwanted honour in 2007 when their double A-side Baby's Coming Back/Transylvania plummeted from number one to number 20 on its second week.
In early 2005, a series of limited edition Elvis Presley re-releases topped the chart and one of these - One Night/I Got Stung - also dropped from number one to number 20 as shops ran out of stock in the second week.
In the album chart, Adele remains well ahead of her closest rival in the album charts, Elvis Presley's If I Can Dream - at number two.
Bieber's album Purpose remains at number three, Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh is at number four and One Direction returned to the top five with Made In The A.M rebounding three places.
Chart favourites Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and James Bay all re-entered the top 10 in the album chart at eight, nine and ten respectively.
