A 25-year-old pedestrian was hit by a blue Volkswagen Golf while crossing Stanningley Bypass on Monday night.
The pair tried to recover the broken registration plate but left when they saw witnesses approaching, police said.
Detectives said the men made no attempt to check on the pedestrian and issued an urgent appeal to trace them.
The man was hit as he was crossing the bypass near to the old Bramley fire station just before midnight and was pronounced dead at the scene.
Det Supt Nick Wallen, said the car, registration LC07 NNX, is believed to be linked to the Bradford area and that the occupants were described as Asian.
He added: "We are urgently appealing for anyone who knows the whereabouts of the blue Volkswagen Golf or who knows who was in the vehicle at the time of this incident.
"The car will have significant damage to the front of it and a smashed windscreen."
