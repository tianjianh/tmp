Karl Buchan, 23, and Michael Shepherd, 27, are believed to be from the Faversham area.
Friends and family have posted messages of condolence and tributes on social media.
The crash happened near the Dover Castle Inn in Teynham at around 01:20 GMT on Friday.
Mr Buchan's aunt, Lisa Murphy, told the BBC: "I would just like to say how shocked we are by what has happened and to thank everyone for their kind tributes to my nephew Karl at this time of great sadness.
"Our thoughts are with the family of Michael Shepherd."
Mr Buchan's friends described him as a "lovely lad who everyone loved" and someone who "always knew how to put a smile on everyone's face".
Mr Shepherd's father, also called Michael, left a message which read: "Can't believe you're gone son. You never wanted to grow-up, now you won't have to.  I'll always love and miss you."
One tribute to both men read: "Think it's safe to say the whole of Faversham will be feeling down today. We lost two really loved lads. The town will not be same without you in it."
The car had been travelling from the direction of Faversham towards Sittingbourne, police said.
The two men were rear-seat passengers in the car.
The male driver and female front-seat passenger were taken to a London hospital with serious injuries.  Both are now believed to in a stable condition, police said.
Anyone who witnessed the crash or the events leading up to it is asked to contact police.
