The victim, from Buckinghamshire, was being tended to by pub and ambulance staff in Bournemouth when her black cockapoo, called Sophie, was taken.
Police have issued an image of a woman they want to speak to over the theft at the Moon in the Square pub in Exeter Road late on Sunday 27 November.
Anyone with information is urged to contact police.
The theft happened while the victim, in her 50s, was being treated following a "medical incident" at the pub at about 23:30 GMT.

"I am appealing to anyone who knows the woman pictured to come forward as she may hold vital information that can assist with the investigation.
"If you know the whereabouts of the dog or have any information about the incident, please contact police."
