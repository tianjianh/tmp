Ben Turner: Burton Albion defender loses FA racial abuse charge appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion's Ben Turner has lost his appeal against a Football Association racial abuse charge and will miss the first five games of next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turner was charged after an incident involving Brentford's Nico Yennaris in the Championship match in December.
An independent panel found the 29-year-old defender guilty as his language "included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality".
Tuner will have to attend an education course and pay an Â£8,000 fine.
He had "strongly denied" the charge and the club were "extremely disappointed" by the commission's original decision.
