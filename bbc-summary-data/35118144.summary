Mark Webster is hoping to give himself an early Christmas present by earning a place in the second round of the PDC World Darts championship.

The 32-year-old from St Asaph - the BDO World Champion in 2008 - plays his first round match on Friday.
He does not know his opponent, but with the next round starting on Boxing Day, is keen to claim a victory.
"You want to get through so you can sit down on Christmas Day knowing you're still in the competition," he said.
"I don't tend to look too far ahead because with there being a Christmas break after round one it's like you're playing in separate competitions.

"But it's nice to get through because I've been out of the tournament on Christmas and that's not a good feeling."
Webster faces the winner of the the preliminary round match between Qiang Sun of China and Ireland's Mick McGowan.
The tournament gets underway on Thursday, with Welshman Jamie Lewis from Cardigan facing Daryl Gurney of Northern Ireland.
Webster is looking for a return to form after what he admits has been "a couple of lousy years on the main circuit".
He added: "At the back end of this year I've had some positive results. I've made a semi-final and a quarter final in major events so hopefully I can build on that."
If he can rediscover his best form, Webster could face a quarter final showdown with 14-time champion Phil "The Power" Taylor.
But the Welshman says he is not looking that far ahead, and believes the man to beat is World No1 and reigning champion Michael van Gerwen of Netherlends.
