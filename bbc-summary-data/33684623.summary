Sophie Maguire died two years ago after picking up an infection at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.
At an inquest on Friday, a doctor admitted she could have survived had she received antibiotics earlier.
A spokesperson for the hospital said: "It is not advisable to give antibiotics as a preventative measure."
Sophie's mother, Leanne, told BBC Radio Foyle she was stunned by the doctor's admission during the inquest and she is now calling on the hospital to change its policy on administering antibiotics.
"My heart just sank. To think that we could have had her with us if she was given an antibiotic," she said.
"A part of me never wants it to happen to another family.
"I think that we have got our answers. It has been horrendous but we managed to get there."
Sophie was sent to London for surgery after being born with blood flow problems around her brain.
A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said: "Judgements about when to routinely administer preventative antibiotics in such complex patients rely on a number of complicated factors.
"As the coroner confirmed, Sophie died from a complication of a necessary medical procedure.
"Following Sophie's death, we conducted a full audit of our protocols for routine preventative antibiotic administration for this procedure to see if they needed to be reviewed.
"This confirmed that it is not advisable to give antibiotics as a preventative measure due to the low risk of infection and risk of resistance.
"We would like to extend our condolences to Sophie's family again for their loss."
