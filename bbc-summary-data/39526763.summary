The incident happened near a church between 17:00 and 18:00 on Wednesday 29 March.
The 30-year-old woman was taken to hospital for treatment to what police described as a minor injury.
Police Scotland said they want to trace a man who is in his 40s, about 5ft 5in tall and of a slim build.
He was described as having short dark hair and was wearing a light grey top.
The woman, who was wearing a red jacket and dark jeans, had a two-figure sum of money taken from her.
Det Con Sophia Ross, of Police Scotland, said: "We understand that there would have been people in the area at the time who would have witnessed the incident.
"I would therefore ask if anyone remembers seeing an incident in the area last Wednesday, involving a female as described, to contact us with any information they have."
