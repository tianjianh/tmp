However, Stuart Bannigan, Gary Fraser (both knee), Jason Banton (groin), Ryan Scully (shoulder) and Sean Welsh (foot) remain out.
Rangers midfielder Emerson Hyndman could miss the remainder of the season with a foot injury.
But fellow January loan signing Jon Toral hopes to return from rib trouble.
Lee Hodson (ankle), Lee Wallace (stomach), Rob Kiernan (calf) and Philippe Senderos (knee) are all still missing but long-term casualty Niko Kranjcar (knee) has resumed light training.
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "Is it a good time to get them? They've just lost five goals to their biggest rivals, so they'll be hurting and I know they're going to come out and have a real go against us.
"We need to make sure we're at our best. We were terrible against them two weeks ago, so I don't think they'll be too worried about coming to Firhill.
"There are only two points we've not taken points off (this season) - Rangers and Aberdeen. We desperately want to take points off them, and we'd like to do it at Firhill as well.
"We all know we missed an opportunity the last time they came here, I thought we deserved at least a draw, and some poor defending meant we got nothing. Hopefully we go one better and we need to put a real performance on for the fans as well."
Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha: "I'm having good expectations regarding that and I hope the boys can have a very good reaction (to defeat to Celtic).
"We have a lot of players that cannot contribute because they are injured, but even so the players that we have, we know that they are going to be at their very best and the very best at this club is always looking for a win and by the end getting three more points."
