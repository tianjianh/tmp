The 20-year-old beat Carlos Berlocq 6-0 6-4 in the clay court tournament.
The victory could move Edmund back into the world's top 100 and comes before GB face Belgium on clay in the Davis Cup final in Ghent from 27-29 November.
Dan Evans was selected ahead of James Ward and Edmund in the singles for GB's semi-final win over Australia.
