Bovington in Dorset became the home of the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps in 1916, shortly after tanks first appeared at the Battle of the Somme.
An event on Saturday will include the first public appearance of the Army's latest armoured fighting vehicle, Ajax.
The Tank Museum will also drop 250,000 poppies over a battle re-enactment.
The event is one of several commemorations marking the first use of tanks on 15 September 1916 in World War One.
Tanks first arrived at Bovington in October, moving from a smaller training camp in Suffolk.
Author and broadcaster Kate Adie said they arrived in secrecy, with local people being ordered to "pull down their blinds and sit in the back room" while the vehicles went by.
Writing in 'Fighting On the Home Front', she said: "One local shepherd, name of Patience, was reported to have refused to abandon his sheep, grazing in an adjacent field.
"Soldiers therefore built a fence of hurdles so that the secret weapon might pass unseen."
But historian Chris Copson said the secret was apparently short-lived.
"The story is that the tank did what tanks do best and broke down in the middle of Bovington High Street," he said.
As part of Saturday's commemorations, the Army will publicly unveil its Ajax armoured reconnaissance vehicle for the first time.
The head of the Army, General Sir Nick Carter, has said the 589 Ajax vehicles will be at the core of the Land Joint Strike concept, a tactic for use in difficult terrain and in densely-populated urban areas.
