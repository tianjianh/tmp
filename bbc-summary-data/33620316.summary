The two-and-a-half minute clip - which sees Daniel Craig reprise his role as the superspy for a fourth time - gives a closer look at the film after a teaser was released in March.
Featuring car chases, exploding planes and shady crime organisations, it bares all the hallmarks of classic Bond.
Spectre will be released in UK cinemas on 26 October.
The new trailer begins with a first look at Ralph Fiennes in his new role as MI6 boss M, questioning Bond about a rogue mission to Mexico City.
The spy is then seen in Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra - played by Monica Bellucci - the widow of an infamous criminal.
After a suggested quick tryst with Sciarra, Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the crime organisation known as Spectre.
Having previously only seen him as a shadowy character in the teaser clip, Christoph Waltz is also finally revealed as Bond villain Franz Oberhauser.
There is also a first glimpse of Sherlock star Andrew Scott, who stars as Max Denbigh, the new head of the Centre for National Security.
Fans on Twitter were quick to give their reaction to the new trailer and many noted it featured some of the theme to 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
"This looks absolutely stunning!" Ben Peyton wrote, while Rene Friedrich said it was "so much better than the teaser. Finally, how it should be: a blend of iconic, new, fast, quotable".
However, Dekan Apajee said: "As trailers go this is more of a spoiler."
