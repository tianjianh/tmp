The substance was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) list of prohibited substances on 1 January 2016, with five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova failing a test at the Australian Open later that month.

For a substance to be added to Wada's prohibited list involves a three-stage consultation process, which lasts several months and includes input from Wada experts, its health, medical and research committee (HMRC) and its executive committee.
According to Wada, a substance may be "considered" for the prohibited list if it meets two of the following three criteria:
A substance can be added to the prohibited list without first featuring on the watch list.
Meldonium - or mildronate as it was known to 28-year-old Russian Sharapova - is no longer on the 2016 watch list, but several other substances remain on it.
Some are monitored only during competition, some outside of competition and some both in and out of competition.
Stimulants
Narcotics
Glucocorticoids - anti-inflammatories
Telmisartan - used for high blood pressure
