A competition winner was mugged for his prize snooker cue - just a day after he used it to play in an exhibition match alongside Ronnie O'Sullivan.

Stuart Craig was given the cue, and a case, at the Snooker Legends show in Plymouth after he partnered with the ex-world champion in a doubles game.
It was signed by O'Sullivan and fellow snooker stars Ray Reardon, John Virgo, Jimmy White, and referee Michaela Tabb.
But it was stolen from him when he was walking in the city the next day.
The cue, won on Saturday night, was taken from Mr Craig on 23 August when he was walking from his mother's house after showing her his prize.
He told police he was approached by a stranger on Ferrers Road in the St Budeaux area at about 17:40 BST, and the cue was snatched after a short conversation.
The man demanded Â£20 for its return but fled towards St Budeaux Square after Mr Craig handed over the cash.
Det Con Rob Gordon, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "We are appealing for witnesses, but would also like to hear from anyone locally who has been offered the chance to purchase this unique cue and case.
"It has been signed by a number of snooker legends and is a unique piece of sporting memorabilia; we are desperate to reunite Stuart with his prize."
The man who stole the cue was white, 5ft 8ins (1.73m) tall, of slim build and wearing dark glasses and a hoodie, police said.
