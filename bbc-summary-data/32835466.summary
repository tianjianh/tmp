[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a £2.6m hydro-electric scheme to harness the power of the River Taff in Cardiff and generate renewable energy will start next month.

The Radyr Weir scheme will channel water through two turbines and use it to generate energy that can be fed into the electricity grid.
It should be able to provide enough energy to power 550 homes and raise £140,000 a year for Cardiff council.
Construction work on the project is scheduled be completed by March 2016.
