A locum doctor has been jailed for two years for sexually assaulting a male patient he was treating in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manav Arora, 37, from Birmingham, performed oral sex on the man, who had limited movement, while inserting a catheter.
The married father of three was convicted at a trial at Norwich Crown Court in September.
He was working at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the incident happened in September last year.
Arora was also given a sexual harm prevention order prohibiting him from working in any medical capacity with access to patients for 10 years.
The victim, who cannot named to protect his identity, said he was assaulted behind a curtain on a busy hospital ward as five other patients lay nearby.
In sentencing at King's Lynn Crown Court, Judge Guy Ayers said: "There is a high level of trust between doctor and patient and you betrayed that trust.
"The victim was incapable of much physical movement, as he was in great pain, and was in no position to prevent what was happening."
The trial also heard from two men who claim they were assaulted in the same way by Arora at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, four years earlier.
After the verdict, prosecutor Andrew Shaw said Arora had also been suspended in 2005 after a similar accusation was made at a hospital in Portsmouth.
Indian-born Arora also received a caution from West Midlands Police after being caught engaging in a sex act with another man in Sandwell Valley Park near West Bromwich less than two weeks after the incident in Norwich.
Alan Jenkins, for Arora, said he would be struck off by the General Medical Council, and added it was highly unlikely he would ever work in the medical profession in this country again.
