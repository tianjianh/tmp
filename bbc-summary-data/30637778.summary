As well as her work outside Ysgol Y Traeth in Barmouth, Sheila Davies has also helped out in the school canteen.
It was her love of children that made her try for the job and she is still going strong at the age of 80.
She said she decided to accepted the honour for the school "for giving me such a happy life."
She added: "The children to me are great as they don't see me as someone who grows old each year.
"I'm on equal level with them and it's such a lovely thing. They treat me as one of themselves and I think it is absolutely lovely."
Also on the New Year Honours list is Edward Baker from Rhos on Sea who has also been given a BEM for voluntary service in Colwyn Bay, Conwy.
He has done extensive work over the past 40 years and has held several roles at Colwyn Bay Cricket Club where he helped to secure Â£250,000 of sponsorship for junior cricket.
Another Conwy recipient of the BEM is William Blyth McKenna from Llandudno for voluntary service to the NHS in north Wales and Stockport, Greater Manchester, and to Blind Veterans UK.
