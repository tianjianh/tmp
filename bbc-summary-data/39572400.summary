Former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan says Welsh flyweight Andrew Selby could fight for a global crown by the end of 2017.

Selby, 28, is unbeaten in eight bouts since ending his amateur career and turning professional in September 2015.
Selby next faces Cristofer Rosales, a Nicaraguan boxer ranked seven by the WBO.
Selby and Rosales meet in Cardiff on 26 May and promoter McGuigan thinks "it's a distinct possibility" he will fight for a world title this year.

But the Northern Irishman expects "big things" of the "multi-faceted fighter" Selby.
"What he's done already in his eight-fight career is pretty amazing," said McGuigan.
"He's a sensational talent and is going to go on and do big things.
"He has to do it piecemeal, bit by bit, but when you look at it, he's only had eight professional fights and look where he's at.
"He's number eight in the world in the WBC, number seven with the IBF after eight professional fights."
McGuigan added: "Selby admits himself he's naturally cocky and naturally flashy - that's just his style.
"He can really fight, this kid."
The Barry-bred flyweight won European Championship gold medals in 2011 and 2013 and claimed a silver medal at the 2011 World Championships.
There is a possibility that the WBO could upgrade the contest to a world title eliminator fight as both boxers are ranked in their top ten, with Selby listed eighth.
Selby's last win came in February against Ardin Diale of the Philippines.
