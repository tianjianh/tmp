The adaptation of Julian Barnes' Booker Prize winner will also star Emily Mortimer and Harriet Walter.
It sees Broadbent take the leading role as Tony Webster, a retired divorcee who sets out to retrieve a bequeathed diary from an old girlfriend.
It is the first film adaptation from acclaimed playwright Nick Payne.
Barnes' 11th novel explores childhood friendship and the imperfections of memory. Booker judges described the novel as "exquisitely written, subtly plotted and reveals new depths with each reading".
"We thought it was a book that spoke to the humankind in the 21st Century," said Dame Stella Rimington, chairwoman of the 2011 judges, when it won the Booker prize.
'Remarkable book'
Filming of the adaptation, which begins this month, will take place over seven weeks on location in London and Bristol, under the direction of Ritesh Batra.
"We are really excited about making this film, based on Julian Barnes' remarkable book," said producer David Thompson.
"Ritesh is a major directing talent, as shown by his wonderful film The Lunchbox that had such sensitivity and emotional punch.
"We're thrilled also to be working with Nick Payne on his first feature film script - he has a startlingly original voice."
Earlier this year, Rampling won the best actress award for her role opposite Sir Tom Courtenay in 45 Years at the Berlin Film Festival.
Joe Alwyn, who plays the eponymous star in Ang Lee's upcoming Iraq War drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, is also among the cast.
