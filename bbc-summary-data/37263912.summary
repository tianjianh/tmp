[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callum Wilson's superb late goal earned Bournemouth victory over West Brom, their first Premier League win of the season.

The striker connected with Adam Smith's cross with a deft flick to put the ball just inside the post with 11 minutes remaining at the Vitality Stadium.
The home side had dominated the first half, with Wilson forcing West Brom keeper Ben Foster into a double save.
Matty Phillips hit the crossbar as West Brom improved after the break.
West Brom are 13th in the table, level on four points with Bournemouth but one place higher.
Wilson's goal was his first for almost a year, following a six-month lay-off with a medial knee ligament injury.
Bournemouth keeper Artur Boruc denied Saido Berahino and Gareth McAuley with instinctive saves from close range early in the second half.
England midfielder Jack Wilshere came on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Bournemouth, his first appearance since joining on loan from Arsenal.
Wilshere's unexpected move to the south coast grabbed the headlines on the final day of the transfer window but, while he sat on the bench, Bournemouth's record signing Jordon Ibe caught the eye.
The 20-year-old ex-Liverpool forward was a constant threat on Bournemouth's right wing, especially during the first half with a succession of shots and crosses.
He looked to have the better of West Brom's Brendan Galloway, also 20 and making his second Premier League appearance at left-back following his arrival on loan from Everton.
Galloway improved and even had a chance of his own after the break, driving a close-range shot from a tight angle at Boruc.
Ibe faded before being replaced by Wilshere just after the hour mark.
The appearance of Wilshere helped Bournemouth get back on to the front foot, and he roamed the pitch trying to assert his influence.
Wilshere, 24, has not completed 90 minutes in the Premier League since 13 September 2014, and made two substitute appearances this season before leaving Arsenal.
At times on Saturday he pleaded for the ball, with one subtle touch inside the box to set up Junior Stanislas a reminder of his talent.
How Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe uses Wilshere will be one of the most interesting sub-plots of this season.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "It's a massive day for us. In the first half we were totally dominant.
"There's such small margins between teams at this level. We had to be very patient, but it was a great goal by Callum Wilson.
"I'm really pleased for him. Players go through highs and lows. He's had a severe knock with his injury but he always shows enthusiasm and brightness and you could see from his celebration how much this meant to him."

West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "For over a season Saido has been wrapped up in where he's going and he's playing in the top league in the world. You have to be mentally prepared - you can't just switch it on and off and he needs to understand that.
"In the 20 months I've been here he was a talisman for the first six months, but then we've lost him for the last year. It's been difficult.
"It's been an interesting club to manage. The way it's run is different, but also dealing with a player that has for two thirds of that period not doing really what he should be has been difficult."
Bournemouth visit leaders Manchester City, where they lost 5-1 last season, on 17 September at 15:00 BST. West Brom face West Ham at the Hawthorns at the same time.
