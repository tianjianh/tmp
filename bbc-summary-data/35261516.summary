Marie Logie's body was found in her first-floor flat in Green Gates, Leven, at 20:00 on Tuesday. She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day.
Police said she was the victim of a "brutal and horrendous attack" and had sustained head injuries.
Her family paid tribute to the "beloved mother, grandmother and friend".
Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church.
The Reverend Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: "The whole community is shocked.
"There are many church members here who will be alarmed such a thing could have happened within the community at Leven."
Mr Nisbet said Mrs Logie was an active person and only recently gave up driving.
"We do lunches on a Tuesday and Friday at the church and she came every week," he added.
"It is very strange and we cannot imagine why this has happened."
Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive, but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in "a brutal" way.
She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year.
Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend.
When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again she went to investigate and found her dead in her home.
