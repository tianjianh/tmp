Pet shop snake thief Scott Goodison appears in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man stole three snakes from a Perth pet shop by hiding them in a rucksack, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Animal collector Scott Goodison, 20, was captured on CCTV leaving Perth Pet Centre, which was closed at the time, after taking three corn snakes.
Goodison was originally also charged with stealing a quantity of reptiles, a spider, electrical equipment and money.
Prosecutors at Perth Justice of the Peace court accepted a reduced plea of stealing the snakes.
Goodison, of Perth, admitted a charge of theft on 18 February this year.
The court was told that Goodison, who stays in a flat close to the pet shop, had a number of "issues". Sentence was deferred for reports.
