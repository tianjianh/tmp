Fears over hundreds of tax office jobs across Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are fears hundreds of tax office jobs around Wales could be at risk.

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is to give staff details about its sites in Cardiff, Swansea, Wrexham and Porthmadog on Thursday.
Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth wants urgent clarification over speculation that the service will be centralised in Cardiff.
He says the Wrexham office employs about 350 staff with 300 in Swansea and 20 in Porthmadog.
A HMRC spokesman said: "We have been clear for some time that this will mean fewer, but larger and more modern offices that will help us to deliver better services to our customers and bring in more tax revenue for public services.
"These changes are part of an ongoing modernisation programme begun several years ago and will take place over the next 10 years."
Mr ap Iorwerth said the closure of offices would be "a major blow to Wales' economy".
He added: "The UK government must give urgent clarification if these rumoured closures are to take place.
"Successive UK governments over the past decade have been intent on closing tax offices and these latest closures would show the complete failure of this current government to understand Wales.
"Hundreds of people work in the offices in Wrexham, Porthmadog and Swansea and it would be unrealistic and unsustainable to expect all of them to relocate to Cardiff - this would be a very severe blow to the economies of these areas and of Wales as a whole."
