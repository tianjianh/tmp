Operation Stack was implemented on Tuesday with lorries waiting to cross the Channel queuing on the carriageway.
Industrial action by MyFerryLink workers saw blockades at Calais port and the Channel Tunnel in Coquelles.
Thousands of migrants in France took advantage of the action and tried to board Kent-bound lorries.
On Wednesday police found 350 migrants hiding in vehicles at the French port in the wake of the chaos.
Later in the day, 10 people were found in the back of a lorry in Folkestone.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "They were all fine and taken by police to Dover Immigration Centre and are now under their care."
Another seven suspected migrants were arrested after climbing out of lorries at a service area on the M1 in Bedfordshire.
David Cameron described the scenes at the French port as "totally unacceptable".
The Prime Minister said Britain was considering the possibility of sending more UK officers and sniffer dog teams to Calais, and more fences were being installed at the port as well as around the entrance to the Channel Tunnel.
The Foreign Office has warned travellers to keep their car doors locked in slow-moving traffic heading back to the UK.
