York withdraws automatic Lendal Bridge fines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers in York using Lendal Bridge and Coppergate during restricted times will no longer face automatic fines.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City of York Council said it was waiting for further legal advice after a traffic adjudicator ruled the restrictions were not "legal".
However, the authority warned drivers breaching the restrictions that they could still be fined at a "later date".
A traffic adjudicator ruled last month that the roads did not qualify as bus lanes and the signage was inadequate.
General traffic is banned from Coppergate between 07:00 and 19:00, and from Lendal Bridge between 10:30 and 17:00.
More than 57,000 drivers have been issued penalty notices for driving over Lendal Bridge since the restrictions were put in place, on a trial basis, in August 2013.
Darren Richardson, director of city and environmental services at the council, said: "Following supportive legal advice on the trial, restrictions will remain in place and recordings will be taken of any breaches of the restrictions along both Lendal Bridge and Coppergate.
"Fines will not be issued upon these recordings until further legal process. Drivers are urged to continue to adhere to the restrictions in place."
Nigel Rhodes was fined for driving on Coppergate on 21 August but appealed against his Â£60 fine for "being in a bus lane".
Ruling in his favour at a tribunal, adjudicator Stephen Knapp concluded the authority had "no power" to issue penalties.
The Labour-run council has always insisted traffic restrictions on both Lendal Bridge and Coppergate are lawful.
