Laura Whittle, third at the British trials, joins compatriots Steph Twell and Eilish McColgan in the 5,000m.
Hammer throwers Mark Dry and Chris Bennett have also been granted selectors' picks for places in Rio.
It is the highest Scottish representation in track and field since the 1908 London Games, with GB sending an 80-strong team to Brazil.
Twell and McColgan were among eight athletes from Scotland who booked their places at the trials in Birmingham last month, with three marathon runners selected in April.
Just five Scottish runners made it to London 2012.
Team GB will be looking to improve on a haul of six medals from four years ago.
