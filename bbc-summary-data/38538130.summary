[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets fly-half Rhys Patchell has been ruled out for three months with an ankle injury.

The 23-year-old suffered a high-ankle sprain during the win over his former club Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day.
Patchell has scored 147 points in 16 appearances since arriving at Parc Y Scarlets this season.
The injury will rule the fly-half, called up to play full-back for Wales against New Zealand last summer, out of contention of the Six Nations.
"It's a blow because Rhys has been one of the leading lights for us over the last few weeks with a good run of form," said Scarlets team manager Mark Taylor.
"We are massively disappointed but also disappointed for Rhys. He has grown in confidence with every game this season."
