'Extend Kingsway barriers' call from accident victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was knocked down on The Kingsway in Swansea nine months before a police officer died there after being hit by a bus has claimed new safety barriers do not extend far enough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea council put the barriers up on Sunday, two weeks after the death of off-duty Sgt Louise Lucas.
Sue Mann said the barriers should continue into Dillwyn St as the same traffic system was in operation.
The council is meeting on Tuesday to consider changes to the road system.
At present traffic travels in one direction on one side of the dual carriageway, and in two opposite directions on the other.
Ms Mann, 48, from Killay, was on her way out to meet a friend in the city centre when she was hit by a taxi as she tried to cross the two-direction side of the road.
She said: "The road was completely desolate and no traffic. Next thing I knew a taxi just suddenly was there and all I can remember is my head was on the bonnet of the taxi."
She needed stitches and suffered from shock following the incident.
Ms Mann thinks the barriers do not go far enough and would like to see them extended.
"Maybe they have put them up because of that poor policewoman, but I doubt they have put them all the way around to Tesco," she added.
Sgt Lucas was the second person to die on the Kingsway in two years. In 2013, Daniel Foss, 37, was killed after also being hit by a bus.
The coroner investigating Mr Foss's death said the road had a "serious design issue" and called for urgent action.
