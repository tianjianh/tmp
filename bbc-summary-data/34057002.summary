A test flight by Aerosense - a joint-venture created by Sony and the robotics firm ZMP - shows the plane-shaped drone taking off vertically.
The firm says it can reach a top speed of 106mph (170km/h), more than twice as fast as other commercial drones.
It is designed to carry objects and could be used in industrial applications as soon as next year.
But one expert has raised safety concerns.
