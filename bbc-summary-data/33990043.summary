[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen councillors refuse special Countesswells home conditions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have decided not to approve special conditions which would allow construction work to start on a 3,000-home development in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stewart Milne Group, Heron Property and IDJ Properties have permission to build at Countesswells
The council heard concerns the developers had failed to reach agreement on infrastructure delivery.
Officers had recommended an overarching legal agreement between the three be replaced by individual agreements.
They said the proposal would be lawful but highly unusual.
However deputy leader Marie Boulton said any disagreement between developers was not the council's problem.
She said if they did not sign the original legal agreement to contribute to schools, healthcare and roads, there would be no development.
