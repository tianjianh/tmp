Doctor's surgery to close in Bicester 'due to new GP contract'

An Oxfordshire doctor's surgery has announced it will close because it says changes to the national GP contract have made it "financially unviable".

The North Bicester Surgery, in Bure Park, is planning to shut permanently on 30 September.
A spokesman said the decision was also taken because two of its partners were due to retire.
Patients will have to register at one of the town's four other GP practices before the surgery closes.
In February the government agreed a new contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) for GPs, which gave them a 1% pay rise.
Dr Andrew Gibson, senior partner at the surgery, said: "The decision to close the practice has not been taken lightly.
"We would like to thank our patients for the loyalty they have shown us and the good relationships we have built with them over the years."
He added that the surgery first started in 1993 and moved from prefabricated structures into a purpose-built NHS building in 2000.
Julie Dandridge, head of primary care and localities at Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said she understood some patients may be worried about the closure.
She added: "We are positive that they will continue to receive good treatment from one of the four other GP practices in the Bicester area or wherever they choose to register."
Debra Elliott, director of commissioning for NHS England (South Central), said the body would try to ensure the smooth transfer of patient care and records.
