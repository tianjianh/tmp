[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Batchelor, 46, of Wallington, attacked her as she made breakfast in her house in Purley on 11 May.
He admitted rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, actual bodily harm and intent to commit a sexual offence at Croydon Crown Court.
Batchelor was given a custodial sentence of 12 years, with an extended licence period of eight years.
The rapist tapped on the pensioner's window at the back of her house and she indicated him to leave her garden, which he did.
But moments later he knocked on the front door and when she answered he forced his way in, police said.
He punched her in the face before raping her and taking her money.
When he was arrested he told police: "I'm sorry, I never done anything like this before, I swear to God I've messed up, I'm sorry."
Previously Det Insp Keith Ward praised the victim's "bravery" through the "horrific ordeal" and the investigation.
