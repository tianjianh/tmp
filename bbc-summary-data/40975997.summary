The 32ft-high exhibit - made of bags, bottles and other single-use items - is part of a campaign to encourage people to use less plastic.
It follows independent research by Sky Ocean Rescue which found 87% of Britons are concerned by UK plastic usage.
Sandy Luk, of the Marine Conservation Society, said it highlighted "huge issues" facing British seas.
More than 65% of the 2,000 people questioned as part of the Sky Ocean Rescue-commissioned research said they were willing to see a 5p charge, similar to that made for plastic bags applied to other single-use plastics, such as straws, bottles and cups.
The whale, unveiled by former Olympic rower James Cracknell, was in Cardiff Bay until 15:00 BST on Sunday.
