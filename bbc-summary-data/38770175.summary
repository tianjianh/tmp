The Pirates Of The Caribbean star arrived for the launch of the Laurus Trust at Cheadle Hulme High School in Greater Manchester.
The trust aims to get students to explore and enjoy drama.
Bloom said: "Studying the art of performance changed my life forever, opening the door to the career I love."
The workshops were run by Bloom's former acting coach Patsy Rodenburg and he was joined by stage star Paapa Essiedu.
Bloom added: "I believe that every student, regardless of where they went to school, deserves the chance to learn these skills and it's fantastic that Patsy and the Laurus Trust are placing such importance on this area.
"The focus on core areas like presence, rhetoric and performance is really giving these students the tools to succeed, whether its acting on stage or competing for the best jobs and university places."
Patsy Rodenburg - who taught both Bloom and Essiedu when they were drama students - worked with the education team from the Royal Shakespeare Company to run a series of  sessions at the school.
Head teacher Linda Magrath said: "This was a fantastic occasion for all the students. It's not every day that stars like Orlando and Paapa drop into our school!
"We are proud that Cheadle Hulme High School sits at the very heart of the Laurus Trust, which has big, exciting plans to really drive excellence in education in the North West.
"Our students and teachers already achieve outstanding results. This new approach and investment will take us to the next level."
