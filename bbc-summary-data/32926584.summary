[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Firefighters were called to the scene on the A1 between Wallyford and Tranent in East Lothian at about 18:00 on Thursday.
They found a well developed fire on board the vehicle, and extinguished the  blaze.
The 10 people, including the driver, who had been on board had left by the bus by the time fire crews arrived.
The road was closed for a time due to the large amount of smoke crossing the carriageway.
An investigation is under way to establish the cause of the fire.
