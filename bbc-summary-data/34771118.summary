Leah Washington said she had been sent "upsetting" messages online, including by people saying they would be prepared to "lose a leg for Â£1m" compensation.
The 18-year-old from Barnsley was one of five people who suffered severe injuries on the Smiler ride on 2 June.
Ms Washington also fractured her hand in the crash at the Staffordshire park.
Speaking to Capital FM, she said: "I don't think people understand how much my life has changed.
"People say 'Oh, I'd lose a leg for millions of pounds', but they wouldn't because they don't understand everything else that comes along with it - the pain, the physio, the learning to walk again.
"It is so much and so not worth the money."
Ms Washington, who was on the front row of a car when it crashed into an empty one in front, said she had also been sent messages by people saying they could not wait for the ride to re-open.
"It's upsetting to think that people want to go on the ride after what's happened to us, just because it is more of a thrill," she said.
"It is quite upsetting when you are getting messages on Twitter saying 'Oh I can't wait for it to re-open'.
"If they think that, let them think that, but don't message us. What we've been through is enough."
Three other front-row riders sustained serious leg injuries, while a fifth person was treated for internal injuries.
The park's owners, Merlin Entertainments, said up to 190 jobs could be lost following a drop in revenue as a result of the crash.
