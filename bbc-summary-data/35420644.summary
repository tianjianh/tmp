[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Students at Cardiff University are being breathalysed before they are allowed into union bars.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trial is part of an effort to cut down on binge drinking, but the students' union said it cannot be the only reason to refuse entry to someone.
A spokesman said the union was "happy to support any campaign that promotes and encourages responsible drinking".
Random breathalyser tests are carried out on night-time events and the scheme is being run with South Wales Police.
A Students' Union spokeswoman said: "Commercial impact, either positive or negative, had no bearing whatsoever on the Students' Union's decision to be involved in this trial scheme."
