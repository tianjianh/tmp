A new Â£37m stadium for York City FC will not be operational until the spring of 2017, York City Council said.

Initially due to open in August 2016, the 8,000 capacity stadium will be home to the football club and the York City Knights rugby league club.
In July, York City had said it did not believe the stadium would be ready until December 2016.
The Conservative-Liberal Democrat run council has blamed the previous Labour administration for the delay.
Councillor Nigel Ayre, Liberal Democrat executive member for leisure, said: "It remains immensely frustrating that so little progress was achieved under Labour. They failed to lay a brick in the ground and left behind a project with a number of flaws.
"These included a fractured relationship with the York City Knights and an overly complex procurement process which has meant the project couldn't be delivered in time for the 2016-17 season."
Mr Ayre said the scheme remained on budget and construction on the site, at Jockey Lane, Huntington, would begin in early 2016.
The Labour group said given the size of the scheme it was bound to be complex and the ruling group on the council was trying to deflect attention from the latest delay by blaming Labour.
Deputy leader, Councillor Stuart Barnes, said: "Let's be crystal clear about the facts behind today's announcement from the Tories and Lib Dems. What's been announced is a major delay.
"Labour left the community stadium project having secured planning approval and with an accurate business plan including the budget."
York FC will continue to play at Bootham Crescent until the new stadium is finished.
