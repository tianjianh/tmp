[SN]TITLE[SN]
Treasury dept refuses to back Guernsey schools plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Education proposals which will see costs rise by "nearly Â£3.5m a year" will not be backed by the treasury department, a minister has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Treasury Minister Deputy Gavin St Pier said the plans would "substantially add costs to running the education system".
He also criticised the lack of measures in place to evaluate the scheme.
The Education Department's plans include scrapping the Eleven Plus exam by 2019, and creating a single States high school across four sites.
Deputy St Pier said he did not think the four-site model offered best value and "it would be better to build a larger school at La Mare".
The proposals are due to be debated next month.
