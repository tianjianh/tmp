Rotherham sex abuse trial: Arshid Hussain 'had sex with child 100 times'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alleged victim of child sexual exploitation has said she was forced to have sex with Asian men against her will in houses, a park and churchyard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, who cannot be named, told Sheffield Crown Court she was given heroin in exchange for sex and beaten up when she tried to leave a house.
The woman said Arshid Hussain, one of seven defendants, had sex with her about 100 times from the age of 11.
All seven defendants deny the range of charges they face in court.
The woman said she was introduced by Mr Hussain to 10 or 11 other men for her to have sex with.
The witness said that when she was 14 and living in a children's home, she was visited by Mr Hussain who had climbed up a drain pipe to her room to see her.
She said she "begged him to go", but he refused to leave until she went with him.
The woman said she was taken to a house in Masbrough, Rotherham, and was made to have sex with Mr Hussain and another of the defendants, Sajid Bostan.
Prosecutors said that while in care as a girl she was invited to a house in Rawmarsh owned by Karen MacGregor.
She was allowed to come and go at first, the court heard, but the situation changed when Ms MacGregor and another defendant, Shelly Woods, began bringing Asian men to the house and said she had to have sex with them "in order to repay them for looking after her".
The woman said she was given heroin and on an occasion when she tried to escape, Ms MacGregor caught her and she was beaten.
The court heard at the age of 20, she was persuaded by Mr Hussain to go to a room above a pub in Rotherham where she said she was raped by him while Mr Bostan held her ankles down on the bed, following which he raped her.
Arshid Hussain, 40, of High Street, East Cowick, Goole, faces 30 charges, including five counts of rape.
Qurban Ali, 53, of Clough Road, Rotherham, faces four charges, including rape and conspiracy to rape.
