Hull City scored two first-half goals to ease to victory over Brentford in the Championship.

The hosts went ahead when Harry Maguire's long pass found Andrew Robertson, whose cross was turned into his own net by Harlee Dean.
Adama Diomande saw his penalty saved by David Button five minutes later after Alex Bruce was fouled by Jake Bidwell.
Mohamed Diame put away his own rebound from close range to secure the win, as Brentford rarely threatened.
The action was overshadowed by protests from the Hull supporters calling on owner Assem Allam to quit the club.
A section of supporters held up red cards and chanted for Allam to leave, with the latest unpopular move being the introduction of a membership scheme for next season.
Fourth-placed Hull, who now have a three-point lead over fifth-placed Derby, had the better of the opening stages and Diame curled a shot wide, while Robertson saw his 22-yard effort saved by Button and also had a shot come back off the bar.
At the other end, Marco Djuricin shot wide after a quick Brentford counter-attack.
The home side had chances for a third with substitute Chuba Akpom heading wide before firing straight at Button.
The result extended the sequence of no draws between the two sides to 17 matches, with Hull now winning nine compared to Brentford's eight.

"The one thing that disappoints me is all the protests and red cards. At the end of the day the chairman, at the moment, is not well at all and this will not help him.
"He's put Â£70 million of his own money into the club. He's obviously upset and disappointed but just be careful what you wish for.
"I can't see many more people round here who will bail out Hull. When I first met him he bought the club for the community. He has built cancer hospitals.
"It's been the best five years in the history of the club and it will be remembered for the membership scheme and the name change."
Brentford head coach Dean Smith:
"We played three games in March and eight in April. The Premier League and FA Cup seem to take precedence over the Championship now.
"We were organised behind the ball and made it difficult for them. We got caught out by a big diagonal ball and Harlee has put it in his own net.
"It was very difficult to get back in the game after then. The second goal just on half-time made it too much of a mountain to climb in the second half.
"I've got some bodies at home who are feeling a bit tired. It's too many games in too short a period."
