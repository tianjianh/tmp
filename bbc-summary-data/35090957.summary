Jones was at Sandy Park on Saturday to watch the Chiefs' stunning victory over Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne in the European Champions Cup.
"No doubt we will discuss tonight's performance," Baxter told BBC Radio Devon after the match.
"We'll discuss our English qualified players and how he wants to do things in the future with England."
He added: "I'm really looking forward to meeting him, I think it'll be very interesting and you're always pleased to have these kind of meetings off the back of a good performance."
Exeter had three players in England's squad for this year's World Cup - Jack Nowell, Henry Slade and Geoff Parling, who moved to the Chiefs after the tournament from Leicester.
The victory over Clermont, who have reached the final of Europe's top competition twice in the past three seasons, put Exeter level at the top of Pool Two alongside Ospreys.
It came three years after Exeter were crushed 46-12 by the French side in the Heineken Cup at Sandy Park.
"There's definitely progress by us," said Baxter, whose side are second in the Premiership.
"At the same time it wasn't quite as strong a Clermont a side as we played and I think they would say that as well.
"There were a few very good international-quality players missing, but this is still the squad that is top of the Top 14.
"We've got a few injury issues ourselves and it's a massive credit to the players that played today."
