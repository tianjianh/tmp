County Championship: James Tredwell and Sam Northeast stand cannot stop Essex win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Tredwell and Sam Northeast's huge stand was not enough to stop Essex from securing victory as they moved above Kent to go top of Division Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tredwell hit a career-high 124 as he and Northeast (166 not out) shared Kent's best-ever eighth-wicket stand.
Their 222-run partnership was broken when Matthew Quinn removed Tredwell and Kent were soon all out for 370.
Needing just nine runs to win, openers Nick Browne and Alastair Cook combined to seal victory for Essex.
Northeast's unbeaten knock, which lasted seven hours and 45 minutes, added to his scores of 191 and 70 not out in his previous Championship game against Derbyshire.
Tredwell and Northeast's partnership beat the previous best eighth-wicket stand of 177, shared by Geraint Jones and Yasir Arafat against Warwickshire in 2007.
