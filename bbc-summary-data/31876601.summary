The 21-year-old has scored hat-tricks in his last three matches for the Tigers' development side.
The U's, who have won just one of their last 10 games, are currently 17th in League Two, eight points clear of the relegation zone.
Margetts could make his professional debut in their home match against play-off hopefuls Stevenage on Saturday.
