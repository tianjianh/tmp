[SN]TITLE[SN]
US trade deficit surges 43.1% on high imports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US's trade deficit rose 43.1% to $51.4bn in March, its highest level since October 2008.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The resolution of a labour dispute in key West Coast ports and the strength of the US dollar pushed imports up.
The dollar, which has risen around 12%, also had an impact, as it makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive.
Food, capital and consumer goods' imports reached record highs in March, while petroleum imports fell to the lowest level on record.
US imports jumped 7.7% while its exports rose by less than 1% in March.
