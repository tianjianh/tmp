IQE will develop new technology for smart phones, tablets, healthcare and biotechnology.
The partnership has the potential to create thousands of jobs in Wales, the company said.
Vice-chancellor Prof Colin Riordan said the centre would put the university "ahead of our competitors".
The UK government announced in March it was backing a new semiconductor research foundation at the university with a £17m investment, on top of £12m from the Welsh government.
Last autumn, the university also announced it was ploughing £300m into new research and innovation facilities in the city.
