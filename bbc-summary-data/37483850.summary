Scottish Borders Council advised not to oppose Fallago Rig expansion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council has been advised not to oppose plans to expand a wind farm which was the subject of a six-year opposition campaign.

Developers want to build another 12 turbines at Fallago Rig near Lauder.
Opponents to the original 48-turbine scheme had to admit defeat when the Court of Session rejected their bid for a judicial review of its approval.
Planning officers have advised the council to tell the Scottish government it does not oppose the extension.
Developers also want to extend the life of the current wind farm as part of their application.
It would allow the entire 60 turbines to run for 25 years if the second phase became operational.
A report to the council has recommended that, on balance, it should not object to the scheme, subject to a string of conditions.
It said that due to the location and design of the turbines and their integration with the existing wind farm, the proposals would meet the local authority's planning policies.
Planners added that extending the life of the current wind farm was "pragmatic" and should also not be opposed.
However, a community council in the area expressed "outrage and disbelief" at the recommendation.
Lammermuir Community Council chairman, Mark Rowley, said it seemed "incredible" given the council's previous opposition to the wind farm.
"This is a unique case where planners are not being asked to consider hypothetical plans but, to consider re-consenting a wind farm that can be seen and visited," he said.
"We are urging our councillors to visit the area, to assess the effects themselves and then maintain SBC's previous position that a wind farm here is unacceptable and to see the additional adverse effects it would impose on the Southern Upland Way and iconic viewpoints such as the Twinlaw Cairns.
"There is simply no need for an additional wind farm here or for the existing one to be extended."
