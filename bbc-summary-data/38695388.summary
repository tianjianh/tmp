[SN]TITLE[SN]
Delays-hit Wick campus handed over to Highland Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new school campus in the Highlands has been handed over to Highland Council after a series of delays in completing the construction of it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At a turf cutting ceremony in 2014 marking the start of construction on the Wick Joint Campus it was said the site would open this summer.
But since then the council's contractor has on several occasions had to push back the completion date.
Highland Council said there was still some work to be finished.
The campus has been handed over by contractor Hub North Scotland to the local authority.
