[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea Market has been closed for the day after it was evacuated because of a fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze is believed to have started on one of the stalls at 14:10 GMT Thursday, with hundreds of people leaving as it was tackled.
Traders returned at 15:00 but a Swansea council spokesman said an investigation into its cause needed to take place before it reopened to the public.
Fire officers were also making sure it is smoke free.
