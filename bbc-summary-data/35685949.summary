Drivers are calling for increased safety measure on the roundabout at the Vendee Drive junction near Bicester.
It is currently being considered as a link to a proposed new road between the M40 and Bicester.
Oxfordshire County Council said it has been monitoring the situation since opening a Â£3.5m park-and-ride near the roundabout in November last year.
Bicester town councillor Nick Cotter said there was a near-fatality a few years ago and called the site "an accident waiting to happen".
"What we all want to avoid... is anyone dying on that roundabout."
One motorist, Kevin Rayner, said he believed the roundabout was dangerous as it is on a bend in the road and not immediately visible.
He added: "What they [Oxfordshire County Council] need to do is dig it all up, and put [the road] in straight."
The council, which is in charge of most major roads in Oxfordshire, has said it is monitoring the situation.
Member for transport David Nimmo-Smith said there were no current plans to change the junction's layout.
