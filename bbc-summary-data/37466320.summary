North Tyneside Council said the first step will be to restore Spanish City's grade-II listed Dome built in 1910.
The former funfair building has been empty since 2000. Its restoration is part of a £36m regeneration of the town's seafront.
Initial works will see the first floor ceiling removed to open up the rotunda area as well as the demolition of a disused building.
North Tyneside mayor Norma Redfrean said: "So many people have happy memories of time spent there and I know they will be keen to watch the work progress over the coming months and witness the changes as they take shape."
Previously removed historic features such as loggias, cupolas and an internal balcony will be rebuilt while Edwardian-style shopfronts, doors and windows will be installed.
Modern extensions will be added at either end of the building and there will be a new rear entrance with a lift to the upper floor.
The Plaza area outside the Dome is being reshaped to make it more accessible and pedestrian-friendly, linking Spanish City to the wider changes taking place along the seafront.
The first phase of work is expected to be complete in autumn 2017 when the building will be handed over to Kymel Trading Ltd to run as a leisure, wedding and conferencing venue.
