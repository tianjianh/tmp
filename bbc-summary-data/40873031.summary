The Spanish football federation has until Thursday night to send the necessary documents, according to the LFP which runs France's Ligue 1.
If the deadline is missed, Neymar won't play for PSG at Guingamp on Sunday.
LFP has told BBC Sport "an official procedure" is being launched with Fifa.
But Fifa says it has not been contacted by French authorities about Neymar.
The Spanish football federation is yet to comment.
Brazilian Neymar, 25, has already had to miss Saturday's Ligue 1 win over Amiens.
Transfers between clubs in different countries must include Fifa's International Transfer Certificate (CIT). It is this document that the French football authorities are yet to receive.
"The Spanish federation of football has until Thursday night to send the CIT to the French federation of football, who send it back to the French professional football league, and then Neymar can play with PSG this weekend", an LFP statement said.
Neymar's move to France has been troubled since the release clause in his contract was triggered.
Spain's La Liga believes PSG are violating Uefa's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules and Barcelona previously said they would report the French club to European football's governing body, Uefa, for a FFP breach.
PSG believes La Liga is acting unlawfully, while the LFP said it was "surprised" and urged the Spanish federation to "abide by the Fifa rules".
