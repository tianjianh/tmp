[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall secured a play-off place and narrowed the gap on second-placed Burton Albion to three points as they beat League One strugglers Shrewsbury.

The Saddlers led 2-0 at half-time after Kieron Morris' low 11th-minute right-foot shot was followed by a deflected strike from Rico Henry.
Former Saddlers defender Mat Sadler headed home Andy Mangan's cross on the hour to pull one back.
But, despite an improved second-half display, Town remain at risk.
With two matches left, they could still be overhauled by two of the bottom four clubs - Blackpool and Doncaster Rovers.
Saddlers boss gets right reaction
Walsall interim boss Jon Whitney made four changes following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at Bradford City, the Saddlers' biggest of the season, dropping Liam Kinsella, Andy Taylor, Sam Mantom and Jordy Hiwula.
It had the right effect in a much improved first-half display capped by two goals - both rewards for surging runs.
Morris glided along the edge of the box before turning to plant a low right-foot shot into Jayson Leutwiler's bottom-right corner.
His third goal of the season - and second in three games - was followed on the stroke of half-time by Henry's jinking run inside from the left flank, before his shot took a big deflection and bobbled over the line beyond the despairing Leutwiler. It was also his third goal of the season but his first since September.
After Sadler headed powerfully home from Mangan's superb hanging right-wing cross, substitute Ian Black's deflected shot then looped off Henry onto the top of the bar - but Shrewsbury got no nearer
The final shake-up
In the battle for the second automatic promotion place, Burton are up next at home to faltering Gillingham, before Walsall host Fleetwood in a televised lunchtime game on Bank Holiday Monday.
On the final day, the Saddlers are at Port Vale, while Burton are at relegation battlers Doncaster.
Shrewsbury's final two matches are at home to managerless Peterborough this Saturday before a final-day trip to Swindon.
Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC WM:

"It got a bit tense but we deserved to win overall. These players can handle pressure. I believe in them.
"We were so disappointed on Saturday but we're resilient. We showed character and we're still in with a chance of automatic promotion.
"It would have been a lot easier for Burton if we'd got beat tonight, but we've made it a bit more nervy for them now."
Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"I was disappointed with the first-half performance but I take responsibility for that. I pick the shape and the personnel.
"We need to manage the fuel tanks inside their heads. A few looked a bit chuggy but the big positive on the night was the energy we added. The second half was miles better.
"We looked a real threat after the break and we can count ourselves a little unlucky not to get something. But we move on now and get the lads ready for a massive game on Saturday."
