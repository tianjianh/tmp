Fermanagh island tribute to 'men who returned from hell' in World War I

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Soil from the battlefields of Flanders has been brought to an island in Fermanagh in memory of 11 local soldiers who fought in the First World War.

They lived on Cleenish Island on Upper Lough Erne as part of a project that became known as "homes for heroes" for ex-servicemen who survived the Great War.
All but one of the homes were abandoned as the soldiers struggled to adapt to island life and returned to the mainland.
For many years, the houses stood derelict, their slate roofs and stone walls slowly being taken over by vegetation, and the lives of the men who once lived in them were forgotten.
Almost a century later, their relatives have been traced by a local history group.
They returned to the island to plant a commemorative oak tree with soil brought from Messines Ridge where the Irish regiments fought.
Flemish Diplomat Nic van der Marliere said it was important to remember "the men who returned from hell and then lived here together in these beautiful and peaceful surroundings.
"For them, the war didn't end in 1918. The consequences endured for many years after that."
Marion Maxwell from Bellanaleck local history group which has been researching the soldier's stories said: "When we first found out the names of the men, they were just names on a page.
"As we have researched each one I would say one of the things we have found out is that there wasn't one of them who hadn't had some traumatic experience during the war."
Jenny Crawford's grandfather, Francis Suttle, lived in one of the houses on Cleenish Island, said it was "very moving" to meet the other families.
"There is a bond and you could feel that bond with them and it was really lovely and I was very privileged to be here," she said.
Neil Armstrong, curator of the Inniskilling Regimental Museum at Enniskillen Castle, only discovered a few weeks ago that he had a personal connection to the Cleenish Island project.
One of the servicemen was his great, great uncle, Henry Carruthers, and he had mixed emotions coming to the island for the first time.
"You look around and we have got the most beautiful idyllic landscape that you could ever imagine. Yet what a contrast from the hell that he must have experienced and the loss of his two brothers as well."
