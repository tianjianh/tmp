The Great Scottish Run on 1-2 October includes a 10K, a half marathon and Super Saturday - a family fun day.
Running motivation: Keen hill walker John Mulgrew almost lost his life while out climbing in Kintail in the north west of Scotland in 2009.
A few errors led to a wrong route and a fall, and the 69-year-old was left unconscious. He always kept in touch with his family when he was out walking and they raised the alarm when they couldn't reach him.
When John was discovered by mountain rescue teams he had been unconscious for seven hours, his temperature had dropped to a dangerous level and he was in a critical condition.
Although suffering hypothermia, the only other injury John suffered was a broken bone at the bottom of his back.
Now fully recovered, John is running a half marathon to raise funds for one of the organisations which saved his life.
John says: "SARDA (Search and Rescue Dogs Association) was one of the teams that saved my life. I simply wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the rescue dogs and the brilliant work of all the mountain rescue teams.
"I want to do as much as I can to raise funds and awareness for them."

Running motivation: Kirsten Koh, 36, thought she'd never walk again after a cycling accident. Five years ago the keen triathlete was training in her native country Singapore with her partner Orla Gilmore when she was hit by a lorry.
She was dragged underneath its chassis and broke her pelvis, both femurs, and several other bones. She spent three months in hospital and a further seven months in a wheelchair.
As her body gradually got stronger she kept challenging herself to swim longer and cycle further. Her first 'race' after her accident was the Singapore Sundown Marathon in 2012, which took her 10Â½ hours to walk.
Despite now walking with a limp and dealing with ongoing pain, Kirsten says she is pretty fit and healthy.
She now works to help injured athletes and people who have faced life-threatening illnesses.
She says: "I have come back strong and I am grateful for that.
"Because of my experience, I have a different perspective on life and death and now I want to give something back."
Running motivation: When former army officer John Owens had his first stroke he was in his early 20s and he thought it was a hangover. But when he was 38 he suffered his second stroke.
A blood clot had become lodged in his brain, and further tests confirmed it was as a result of a hole in his heart, which he had been born with.
John was left with a brain injury, which can make processing information more difficult. He also faces the possibility of further strokes.
At his lowest point, he was walking on crutches, and thought he'd never walk properly again. After being discharged from the army, he also had to adjust back into civilian life.
Now 42, he enjoys running, which has helped him get out of the house and make new friends.
John says:  "I needed to find something to get me motivated and keep me going, because you could easily find yourself getting secluded in your own house.
"Nothing is stopping me from doing what I want to do. My problems have been identified and I have strategies to cope.
"But having a positive mental attitude definitely helps. What's happened has happened, I don't mope about it, I just want to get out there."

Running motivation: At his heaviest, Robert Fleming weighed just over 20 stone.
After the death of his gran when he was 18, he became the full-time carer for his mum, who has learning disabilities.
Robert, who also has learning disabilities, found himself battling depression. He stayed indoors, ate badly, played on his computer through the night, and slept most of the day.
However, something clicked after the death of his dog - a collie called Max - and he decided things needed to change.
In 2013, he rehomed seven-year-old black labrador Tiki. He met other dog walkers, made friends and started to love his life.
Then, after being inspired by runners at the London marathon, he started running. He now trains with Forfar Road Runners and ran his first marathon earlier this year.
Over the past three years, Robert has lost 9st. He still has bad days due to depression and he gets support from mental health charity Penumbra.
He says: "I keep all my old photos and when I look at them I think - where's that person?
"It's like I have a new life, and if I have had a bad day I look at them and think I've come too far to go back there.
"I've managed to sort my life out and getting Tiki was a huge part of that. I'd be lost without him."
