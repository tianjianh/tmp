The Flybe service, which launched in May, will begin operating on Saturdays from November.
The daily service is Dundee Airport's first non-chartered international route.
It is the fourth route Flybe has announced under the UK government's ??7m regional air connectivity fund.
A  spokesman for Dundee Airport operator HIAL said: "The plan is to move to seven days a week in November with the introduction of a Saturday flight.
"They are flying six days a week at present, following the introduction of the Sunday service three weeks ago, and the team are delighted with the response from the public to the additional flights.
"Dundee Airport manager, Derrick Lang, and his team are always open to adding new services and are in regular contact with partners and airlines to explore opportunities to bring more flights to Dundee."
