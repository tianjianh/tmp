The 27-year-old has spent his whole career with the Red Rose county and has taken over 100 first-class wickets in the past three seasons.
He made his only England appearance in the last Test of the 2013 Ashes series.
"He is a senior figure in the dressing room and has significant importance both on the field and off it," said director of cricket Ashley Giles.
Kerrigan told the club website: "I really want to find the form that got me an England call-up in 2013 and put in match-winning performances for the Red Rose, not only in our next two games this season, but in the future."
