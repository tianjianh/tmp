A so-called loyalist supergrass is to stand trial for a catalogue of murders and paramilitary crime, a judge has ordered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Haggarty faces a record 202 charges, including five terrorist killings.
He appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court amid heavy security.
The 44-year-old suspected Ulster Volunteer Force commander-turned police informer showed little emotion as the allegations were set out.
Mr Haggarty, who is believed to be living at a secret location in England, was brought into court under police guard.
Dressed in a dark grey suit and wearing a poppy, he stood in the dock with his arms by his side throughout the preliminary enquiry hearing.
The north Belfast man has signed an agreement to become an assisting offender under the terms of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) back in 2010.
In a prosecution case running to 12,000 pages, the charges against him cover a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007. They include the following murders:
Mr Haggarty is also accused of a litany of other terror-related offences including:
Asked if he understood the charges Mr Haggarty, whose address is listed as c/o the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said: "I do."
Prosecution lawyers submitted that Mr Haggarty had a case to answer.
During the hearing, the defendant was given the change to respond to the allegations, give evidence or call witnesses.
On each occasion, he said: "No, not at this time."
The judge then granted the prosecution application. She said he will be returned for trial at Belfast Crown Court on a date that has not yet been decided.
Mr Haggarty was released on continuing bail.
