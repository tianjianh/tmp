Why is America bombing Syria and will Britain join in?

As the US begins targeted strikes against jihadi fighters in Syria, this is your Newsbeat guide to why it's all happening now.

American military forces carried out a series of strikes in Syria against Islamic State (IS), a group of violent militants who are responsible for brutal attacks on minority groups and the murders of three western hostages.
The US raids were mainly focused around Raqqa, the area where IS militants are strongest.
Cruise missiles were also fired into the area from two US ships in the Red Sea.
These attacks in Syria follow 190 air strikes targeting IS in Iraq since August.
No, this military action has the support of Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, but we don't think these nations have contributed any military firepower at this stage.
The Ministry of Defence said discussions over Britain's involvement in air strikes in Syria are "ongoing" but there has been no decision "yet".
David Cameron is expected to get MPs together on Friday and ask them to approve British involvement in air strikes against IS forces.
Yes, but in 2013 the debate was about using military force against President Assad.
That followed chemical attacks on civilians, blamed on Syrian government forces.
The UK government lost a vote on whether to join any US-led air strikes and a few days later America also decided not to intervene.
So on that occasion Britain was considering air strikes to help rebel forces, like the Free Syria Army, in their fight against Assad. Now it's considering strikes on anti-Assad forces.
The difference is Islamic State fighters want a lot more than the end of President Assad's regime.
IS fighters want to keep control of a huge area of land across Syria and Iraq and they are using brutal methods to get their way.
IS has released videos showing dozens of Iraqi troops being killed and ancient religious buildings being destroyed.
Children and women have been kidnapped.
Civilians have been threatened with crucifixion.
The group has murdered three western hostages since August: American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.
Because IS fighters knew these strikes were coming, the key question is how much have they adapted and prepared for the onslaught.
US military officials have already said the raids, which targeted training camps, supply depots and vehicles, were "very, very successful".
Shashank Joshi, an expert on military strategy at the Royal United Services Institute, said: "Given IS's headquarters and most of its wealth-producing assets are in Syria, it's extremely important that they are targeted across both countries [Syria and Iraq].
"In order to weaken and eventually defeat IS you have to take them on on both sides of what is a very porous border."
Opinion on Facebook is divided as to whether Britain should help the US and its allies.
Anthony Skelton posted: "We should stand up and fight this evil. Like a fire, we should stub out this horrible evil before it spreads like a wildfire and threatens us all."
Michael Doherty disagrees. He commented: "We can't afford to go war... Acts of war should be public vote."
Phil Rothera also opposes British intervention. He wrote: "Fed up of policing the world. This is not a conflict we want to get involved in."
Ryan, 22, from Cheltenham texted Newsbeat to urge the government to approve action by UK forces.
He wrote: "I think intervention in the Middle East is a must, our country is under a direct security threat from IS and terrorism.
"I don't agree with war but the threats are too great to ignore, I think there's enough grounds to start bombings.
"We wouldn't ignore it if it was our doorstep would we?"
