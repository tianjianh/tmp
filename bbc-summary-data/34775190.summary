It is also the occasion for celebrations by Jains and Sikhs as well as Hindus.
The word Diwali comes from the Sanskrit word dipavali, meaning "rows of lighted lamps" - houses, shops and public places are decorated with small oil lamps called diyas.

Ayshah has been to the Curve Theatre in Leicester to meet a dance group practising for their special festival performance.
