The 49-year-old, a former international player, will take up his role in early January on a four-year contract.
Wong is currently women's singles coach to the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM).
He has previously worked with world number one Lee Chong Wei and his wife, Wong Mew Choo, the two-time Commonwealth Games silver medallist.
He has also worked for the last three years with world junior champion Goh Jin Wei, and bringing through Scotland's brightest youngsters will be a big part of his remit.
Badminton Scotland's chief executive Anne Smillie said: "It has been a long process but it was crucial that we took our time and found the right person, someone with the credentials and capability to develop our youngsters into fully-fledged internationals.
"In Tat Meng we believe we have found the person to do that. We have been fortunate in recent years to produce Olympic squad members and World, European and Commonwealth medallists and we want to continue that success story over the next four years and beyond."
