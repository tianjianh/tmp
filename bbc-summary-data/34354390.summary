West Brom and England goalkeeper Ben Foster's return from a knee injury has been delayed until December.

The 32-year-old had cruciate-ligament surgery in March and was expected to be back by October.
"It'll be Christmas time I think," said Albion boss Tony Pulis. "We've got to make sure we're careful.
"He had a little setback which pushed him back a little bit. He's up and running again now so fingers crossed he'll be ready to go before Christmas."
In Foster's absence, Burnley's Tom Heaton and Stoke's Jack Butland have broken into the England squad.
Foster will hope he can force his way back into Roy Hodgson's thinking for next summer's European Championship.
Pulis, though, says the former Manchester United player should focus on his club before contemplating more England caps.
"I think, having spoken to Ben, the most important thing is for him to get fit and start playing for West Brom again and if the Euros come for him then brilliant," said the Baggies boss.
"The most important thing is he's got to get fit and get back into the team."
