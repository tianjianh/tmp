Freddie Hussey from Bristol was killed in 2014 when a trailer towed by a Land Rover came loose and hit him.
The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has produced an online guide, showing motorists how to check trailers are safely secured before setting off.
In May Freddie's parents successfully pushed for new safety guidelines.
The advice from the DVSA includes checking brakes, lights and the height of the coupling, as well as how to use a breakaway cable, before towing objects such as caravans, horseboxes and boats.
Transport minister Andrew Jones said he was "shocked and saddened" by the boy's death in Bedminster in January 2014.
"It is absolutely essential that drivers carry out a few quick and simple checks to make sure their trailer is safe so we do not see a repeat of this awful tragedy," he said.
DVSA chief executive Gareth Llewellyn said: "There is no excuse for not being informed.
"Even a short journey with an insecure or unroadworthy trailer puts lives at risk."
Following Freddie's death the driver of the Land Rover Defender, Tony Davies, from Hallen, was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service for causing death through careless driving.
He was also disqualified from driving for six months.
