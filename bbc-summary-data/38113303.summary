The hosts had the better of the chances against their League One rivals and were denied three times by the woodwork in the second half.
Chances were in short supply during the first half. Shrewsbury's best opportunity in the early stages fell to Ivan Toney but the Newcastle loanee's header from a Louis Dodds cross was comfortably saved by Alex Cairns.
Dodds then had a close-range effort blocked as Shrewsbury, who reached the fifth round last season before bowing out to Manchester United, pushed for a breakthrough.
Fleetwood midfielder Bobby Grant's overhead kick cleared the bar before visiting captain Nathan Pond's header from Kyle Dempsey's free-kick was acrobatically saved by Jayson Leutwiler, diving low to his right.
Shrewsbury hit the same post twice within a minute early in the second half. A low shot from Dodds beat keeper Cairns but came out off the inside of a post before Junior Brown's flick from a Dom Smith cross also struck the woodwork.
The Shrews continued to look the most likely side to break the deadlock and Toney's 25-yard free-kick clipped the top of the bar before Grant hammered a late shot from distance narrowly wide for Fleetwood as deadlock ensued.
