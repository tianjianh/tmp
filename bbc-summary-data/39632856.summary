[SN]TITLE[SN]
Devon and Cornwall Police officer sacked for having sex on duty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been sacked for repeatedly having sex on duty over a two year period.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed officer had sex with two women he met during the course of his duties with Devon and Cornwall Police.
A private hearing was held at the force's headquarters in Exeter last month.
The hearing heard how on one occasion he had sex with a vulnerable witness whilst on duty.
He also gave out confidential information and was dismissed for gross misconduct and breaching confidentiality.
The Police Misconduct Panel found the officer "had breached the standards of professional behaviour of the police," in particular those pertaining to confidentiality, duties and responsibilities, orders and instructions, honesty and integrity and discreditable conduct.
A statement said: "The officer had breached those duties in 2012 - 2014, on numerous occasions by engaging in sexual intercourse whilst on duty, including on one occasion with a vulnerable witness."
The panel concluded his actions amounted to gross misconduct and immediately dismissed him.
Five months ago another officer was sacked for carrying out a sex attack on a woman.
