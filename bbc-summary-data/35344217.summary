[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers have signed full-back Lee Vaughan on a deal until the end of the season after Cheltenham Town cancelled his contract with them.

The 29-year-old joined Tranmere on loan in December and has started seven games for the club so far.
Vaughan began his career at Birmingham City before joining Walsall, AFC Telford United and Kidderminster.
"Lee is an experienced defender and has settled into the squad very well," boss Gary Brabin told the club website.
"He gives us plenty of energy down the right flank and I'm really pleased that we've been able to prolong his stay here at Prenton Park."
