[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who killed a man when she lashed out with a kitchen knife while being attacked has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victim Robert Taylor and two friends had been looking for Kieley Davis's boyfriend over a threat made to Mr Taylor's daughter.
They attacked Davis instead after she came out of a flat in Lincoln brandishing a kitchen knife.
Davis previously admitted a charge of manslaughter.
Judge Michael Heath accepted Davis, of Woodfield Avenue, was attacked when she left the flat, but said "the case illustrates what can happen when a knife is introduced".
Sentencing Davis, 29, Judge Heath told her she was "unwise" to arm herself with a knife, but accepted she had done so because she was scared.
Mr Taylor died in hospital after being stabbed on 17 April.
Lincoln Crown Court heard Mr Taylor and two other men had gone to a flat in Walnut Place, off Lincoln High Street, looking for Bradley Taylor, the boyfriend of Davis.
Bradley Taylor was previously jailed for stabbing Robert Taylor, who was no relation, in 2012.
Prior to the stabbing by Davis, the court was told Bradley Taylor had threatened Robert Taylor's daughter.
James House, prosecuting, said Robert Taylor and two of his friends - armed with two wooden chair legs - then went looking for him.
When they arrived at the flat Davis was there with a friend, but Bradley Taylor was not present.
Robert Taylor, 39, then became involved in an altercation with the friend of Davis, before she emerged from the flat brandishing a kitchen knife.
According to an eye witness, she was hit three times with a piece of wood.
At some point during the melee she lashed out with the knife, fatally wounding Robert Taylor.
Phillip Shears QC, mitigating for Davis, said she had shown "consistent remorse" for what happened.
