[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Averies Recycling (Swindon) Ltd had operated the waste centre at Marshgate since July 2008.
The fire was finally put out after 3,000 tonnes of waste was removed to give firefighters access.
The Environment Agency (EA) estimated the cost of tackling the blaze, which burned from 21 July until 15 September, at Â£500,000.
In November the EA revoked Averies' licence as a waste carrier.
The revocation notice came into force on 11 December. Averies has until 15 April to remove all waste from its Marshgate site.
Averies Recycling (Swindon) Ltd also runs a skip hire site in Brindley Close, Cheney Manor. It has until 4 March to clear that area.
The BBC has been unable to contact Averies for a comment but in a previous statement posted on the company website managing director Lee Averies said: "I'm very sorry that this fire has had such a significant effect on so many people, and I regret any discomfort or inconvenience that residences or businesses may have suffered."
