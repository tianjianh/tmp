Jay Risbridger said the move was for "personal reasons relating to his family and business commitments".
The Bath PPC said the "unexpected timing" prevented him from being able to fully commit to the campaign.
Both seats are currently held by the Conservatives but have previously been Lib Dem strongholds.
Paddy Ashdown was Yeovil's MP for 18 years - between Jun 1983 and Jun 2001; Don Foster was Bath's MP from 1992 to 2015.
In a note to the Bath and North East Somerset Lib Dems, Mr Risbridger said he would commit what time he has to campaigning hard "to elect his Lib Dem successor as Bath's next MP".
The "unexpected timing of this snap election" prevents him "from being able to fully commit myself to the campaign to win Bath".
On Monday, Yeovil PPC Daisy Benson said the "snap election" had come at "precisely the wrong time".
Ms Benson said it would be unfair to her constituents as she "would not to be able to devote 100% of my time to campaigning" as she was in the middle of buying a house.
