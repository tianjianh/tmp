[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, are jointly accused of murdering Owen Creaney at Moyraverty Court, Craigavon, in July 2014.
On Tuesday, the court heard transcripts of police interviews conducted after they found Mr Creaney's body in a bin.
In them, she described the moment when Mr Hughes told her he had died.
Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park, Banbridge, said she was shocked, "gobsmacked" and described going into the room to look at his body.
It was "pure yellow", she said and she could not look at him.
In the interviews, she repeatedly denied having anything to do with putting Mr Creaney's remains into the bin.
The investigating officer asked how she felt and she replied: "Disgusted. "
Owen Creaney was her friend, she said, and she would not like that done to her son.
Mr Creaney, a disabled man who used a walking aid, was assaulted in the hallway of Mr Hughes's Moyraverty Court home in the early hours of 3 July, 2014.
It took two days for him to die. His body was then dumped into a recycling bin.
Both Ms Boyle and Mr Hughes, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, have admitted being present during the attack.
However, both have denied murder and have blamed each other for the violence.
The murder trial at Belfast Crown Court continues.
