Shauna Hoare told the court Nathan Matthews also stabbed himself with a fork in anger,  dragged her by the hair across a bed and made her beg for food.
But Ms Hoare told Bristol Crown Court there had been both "good times and bad times" in their relationship.
Ms Hoare and Mr Matthews deny murder and conspiring to kidnap Becky.
Ms Hoare told the court Mr Matthews would scream and shout at her, and also on one occasion pushed her against a door.
Ms Hoare described the experiences as terrifying.
"He would be shouting, clench his fists and would step forward and throw something, but he wouldn't actually hit me," she said.
Ms Hoare also described an incident in which Mr Matthews lost his temper at a doctor's surgery and punched a wall - breaking his fingers.
She said she had talked to a friend about leaving Mr Matthews but could not go through with it.
"I had nowhere to go. I had no-one else. He would find me. It would just go back to normal if he found me," she told the court.
She denied watching pornography with Mr Matthews and said she did not know anything about a pornographic film found on his laptop about the rape of a young girl.
Asked about her boyfriend's attitude to teenage girls, Ms Hoare said it was not just teenagers but was "mainly people younger than him".
She said Mr Matthews would occasionally make inappropriate comments about them, such as "I would give them a go".
Mr Matthews, of Hazelbury Drive, Warmley, South Gloucestershire, admits perverting the course of justice, preventing lawful burial and possessing a prohibited weapon.
Ms Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, denies murder and conspiracy to kidnap, a weapons charge, perverting the course of justice and preventing a burial.
Two other men, Donovan Demetrius, 29, and James Ireland, 23, deny assisting an offender.
The trial continues.
