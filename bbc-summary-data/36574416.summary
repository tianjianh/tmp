[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derry footballers to face Dublin or Meath in All-Ireland qualifier

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry will face the losers of the Leinster SFC semi-final between Dublin and Meath at home in the second round of All-Ireland football qualifiers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damian Barton's side beat Louth on Saturday in Owenbeg and have again drawn Leinster opposition in Round 2A.
The losers of the Ulster semi-final replay between Cavan and Tyrone will be at home to Carlow in the qualifiers.
The Ulster rivals drew at Clones on Sunday and face a replay on 3 July - causing a possible fixture backlog.
The Round 2A qualifiers are scheduled for Saturday 2 July but the Cavan/Tyrone v Carlow game cannot now take place until 9 July, meaning the Ulster semi-final provincial loser will enter the qualifiers on the back of a six-day turnaround.
Times and venues for all the back-door games will be confirmed by the Central Competitions Control Committee on Monday afternoon.
