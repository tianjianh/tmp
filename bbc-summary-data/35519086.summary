Japan's Hideki Matsuyama won his second PGA Tour event by beating Rickie Fowler of America at the fourth play-off hole of the Phoenix Open in Arizona.

Both players had four-under rounds of 67 to finish on 14 under and matched each other with two pars and a birdie on the first three extra holes.
But Fowler drove into the water on the 17th, as he had also done in his round, allowing Matsuyama to win with a par.
"Rickie opened the door for me, and I was able to walk through it," he said.
After Saturday's world record attendance of 201,003, a crowd of 65,330 on Sunday pushed the week's total to a record 618,365, shattering the mark of 564,368 set last year.
They saw Fowler, who had led by two shots with two holes to play, bogey the 317-yard par-four 17th after sending his drive through the back of the green and into the water.
He followed that with a nine-foot birdie at the last though to force a play-off after Matsuyama finished with two birdies.
In the play-off, after playing the 18th twice and then the 10th, Fowler tugged a three-wood from the tee short and left into the lake - the ninth time he had found water on that hole in his career.
That left Matsuyama with the luxury of two putts from five feet to win at Scottsdale - the 23-year-old's previous PGA Tour victory in 2014 also needed a play-off.
"This one hurts," admitted Fowler, who won the European Tour's Abu Dhabi Championships two weeks ago and was chasing a fourth PGA Tour victory.
"I felt like I had it. The hard part is having all my friends and family and grandpa and my dad who haven't seen me win."
New Zealand's Danny Lee, who led by three overnight, dropped three shots in his opening nine holes as he faded with a two-over 73 to finish on 11 under.
American Harris English hit a five-under 66 to climb to third on 12 under while Ireland's Shane Lowry signed for a final-round 68 to finish tied sixth on nine under.
