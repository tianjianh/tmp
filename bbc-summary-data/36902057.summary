Det Ch Insp Stuart Smith said: "We have taken this decision to safeguard motorists in Essex while these offenders remain outstanding.
"Our victims have told us that the suspects are purporting to be police officers and are wearing body armour to further enhance this deception in order to steal these vans.
"Anyone who is signalled at to stop by someone in a car which may appear to be an unmarked police is asked not to stop but to call 999 immediately to verify whether the vehicle and its occupants are genuine."
