One of the world's largest and smelliest flowers has blossomed for the first time in 12 years in Devon.

The titan arum, known as the corpse flower because it has an odour like rotting meat, opened on Thursday at Paignton Zoo.
It can grow up to 9.8ft (3m) high and is classed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants.
Giles Palmer said the opening of the flower, which is from the rainforests of Sumatra, was a rare sight.
"There are about 100 collections in the world where you can see the plant and they can go for years without flowering" the curator of plants and gardens said.
The flower is green and bright red, with ribbed sides and a frilled edge.
