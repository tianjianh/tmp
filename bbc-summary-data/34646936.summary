Ford's net profit was $1.9bn (Â£1.2bn) in the July-to-September period, compared with $1.1bn for the same quarter in 2014.
The strong revenue growth came mostly from sales in North America, where the F-150 truck and Explorer sports utility vehicle helped drive the increase.
Other markets were not so successful, Europe and South America both saw pre-tax profits decline.
Shares of Ford were up 1.18% ahead of the market opening.
Despite a pre-tax loss of $182m Ford's market share in Europe grew by 30%.
Market share was also up in Brazil, where a slumping economy has made it difficult for the company to turn a profit.
The profit from US truck and SUV sales is a positive sign for Ford, which spent heavily on boosting truck production and preparing for the launches of new SUVs.
