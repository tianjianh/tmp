[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is facing a jail term after he admitted fatally stabbing his father.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Montgomery, 32, attacked Alan Montgomery during a row at his father's flat in Parnie Street, in Glasgow city centre, on 4 August last year.
The 56-year-old refused medical attention and was found dead days later, having died of blood poisoning.
Montgomery admitted culpable homicide and another charge of assaulting his partner. Sentence was deferred and he was remanded in custody.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Montgomery, from the city's Royston area, had an argument with his partner, Lorraine Greer, at their home on 19 July last year and he hit her on the head with a knife.
She contacted neighbours to phone the police who alerted paramedics but no treatment was needed.
The court also heard that on 31 July, Montgomery was staying at his father's flat due to bail conditions that prevented him going to his home address.
Ms Greer and Montgomery's brother, Andrew, were also in the flat on the same day.
Montgomery's father pushed him to the floor after which Andrew Montgomery got between them.
Montgomery then took two knives from the kitchen unit and the two men were seen to lunge at each other.
During the scuffle, Mr Montgomery was stabbed to the left side of his abdomen.
Montgomery was described as crying "hysterically" and his father said he did not need medical treatment.
Days later Mr Montgomery collapsed unconscious on the kitchen floor an an ambulance was called.
A post-mortem examination showed five injuries on the stomach consistent with being cuts or deep grazes, a stab wound on the left finger and knuckle "consistent with being a defensive injury", and a stab wound to the abdomen.
The cause of death was found to be blood poisoning as a result of a delayed complication of the untreated abdominal stab wound.
Police trawling CCTV identified Montgomery as a suspect and he was later arrested.
