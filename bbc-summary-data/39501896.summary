[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are appealing for information to help trace a German tourist who has been reported missing in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Claudia Philips was last seen leaving the house, in Crail, where she was staying, at about 13:00 on Tuesday.
At that time she was heading towards Anstruther along the Fife coastal path.
Police Scotland said the 51-year-old had failed to return to the house and concern was now growing for her welfare. They are appealing for information.
Ms Philips was described as white, 5ft 2in, of slim build with grey, wavy, collar-length hair.
Insp Neil McKenzie, of Police Scotland, said: "Claudia is on holiday in Crail, so is unlikely to know the north east Fife area well and as such we are keen to trace her as soon as possible.
"Anyone with information that can help us locate Claudia should contact police immediately."
