Labour's governing body has upheld complaints by MP Angela Eagle that she and her staff were subjected to homophobic abuse and intimidation by local party activists.

The MP for Wallasey, who mounted a leadership challenge to Jeremy Corbyn, said a brick had been thrown through her constituency office window.
Ms Eagle said she was pleased that the National Executive Committee (NEC) had supported her claims.
Those responsible could face expulsion.
Ms Eagle's constituency staff complained about abusive calls and threats after she resigned from the shadow cabinet and announced she was going to challenge Mr Corbyn.
Ms Eagle later withdrew her candidacy in favour of her colleague Owen Smith, who was beaten by Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest.
A meeting of an NEC sub-committee on Tuesday considered a confidential report and upheld her complaint of abuse and intimidation by Labour activists in Wallasey.
According to the Liverpool Echo, a leaked copy of the report says of the brick incident: "It's highly likely that the brick thrown through the window of Angela Eagle's office was related to her leadership challenge. The position of the window made it very unlikely that this was a random passer-by." It said that claims it could have been targeting another company and Ms Eagle was "lying" about being targeted are "categorically untrue".
After the meeting, Ms Eagle said: "I am proud to have been the Member of Parliament for Wallasey for 24 years and to have had a good relationship with most local Labour activists for all of that time.
"The report by national party officers comprehensively explains what happened earlier this year and the NEC has accepted the findings.
"I am grateful that Jeremy took the unusual step of both attending and speaking in the meeting and that he expressed sincere sympathy for both me and for my staff."
She added that it was "now clear and accepted by the NEC that homophobic abuse was perpetrated by some members of the local Party", saying: "I will simply not tolerate it and I know I have the backing of both Jeremy and union leaders when I say that there is no place for it in the Labour movement either."
Labour has suspended the Wallasey Labour Party indefinitely.
Meanwhile, a man has pleaded guilty to sending death threats to Ms Eagle.
Steven King, of Mirin Wynd, Paisley, Renfrewshire, told police he was "venting his anger" and would not have acted on the threats which included a reference to an "IRA sniper or bomb", the Liverpool Echo reported.
King was given an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.
Speaking after the court hearing, Ms Eagle's spokesman said the death threat had been "credible and frightening" and had led staff to fear for their safety.
