Georgina Harwood took to the sky above Cape Town, watched by her family and friends.
She did the skydive to raised money for charity.
"It was definitely a very special, exhilarating experience", she said.
It's not the first time Georgina has jumped out of a plane.
She did her first skydive in 2007 when she was aged 92.
Now she's planning on going diving with sharks as her next adventure.
