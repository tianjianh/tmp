Rose Polge, 25, who worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, has not been seen since 12 February.
A woman's body was recovered from the sea east of Portland Bill headland in Dorset on 1 April, police said, but it has not yet been formally identified.
Dr Polge's family have been informed said the Devon and Cornwall force in a statement.
The doctor's car was found in February at Ansteys Cove near Torquay, the town where she worked.
In a statement, the force said: "Police are currently working on the belief that the body is that of 25-year-old missing person Rose Polge, from Torquay.
"Devon and Cornwall Police are working with Dorset Police and the Coroner's Office on this matter, and await the results of the formal identification."
The BBC understands that a note found in Dr Polge's car related mainly to personal issues, but included a passing reference to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
It is understood Dr Polge had been an active campaigner against plans to change working hours and conditions for junior doctors, and in January posted a new Facebook profile picture, featuring the hashtag #NotFairNotSafe.
