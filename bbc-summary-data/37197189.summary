[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome remains third in the Vuelta a Espana as Belgian Jonas Van Genechten won stage seven.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Van Genechten sprinted home first in the 158.5km stage from Maceda to Puebla de Sanabria with Daniele Bennati second and Alejandro Valverde third.
Froome was caught up in a crash inside the final kilometre but was awarded the same time as his rivals.
The Team Sky rider was unhurt in the incident and remains 32 seconds behind race leader Darwin Atapuma of Colombia.
Spain's Valverde, who began the stage in second, closed the gap to Atapuma by four seconds thanks to the bonus seconds earned with his third-place finish.
Froome is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Vuelta and Tour de France in the same season.
