James Young rode the Raptor rollercoaster at Cedar Point amusement park and then jumped over a fence to get his phone when he was hit.
A coroner confirmed he was looking to retrieve his mobile phone. The park confirmed Young's death in a statement.
"At 5pm, a guest entered a restricted, fenced area of Raptor and was struck by the ride," Cedar Point tweeted.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family."
Young was 45 years old, said Phil Frost of the Sandusky Police Department.
"He jumped over a fence into a restricted area under the Raptor and was looking for his items," Mr Frost said during a press conference.
Cedar Point is located near Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio, and considers itself one of the best theme parks in the world.
