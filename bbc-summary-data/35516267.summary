Photographs and film footage of the national park will then be showcased online.
Spokesman Andrew Mitchell said he was "intrigued" to see how people had recorded their experiences.
Mr Mitchell said the material would complement the park's library, which includes photographs depicting school visits and bicycle racing.
"It's fun to review the images, but they also provide a fascinating record of how the natural landscape and how we interact with it has changed and stayed the same over the 60 years."
All images featured will be credited to the contributor.
Attractions within the park include the Cheviot Hills, Kielder Forest and Hadrian's Wall.
Material can be emailed to 60years@nnpa.org.uk or posted on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag #NNP60.
