[SN]TITLE[SN]
Meet Lauren Child, the new Children's Laureate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Author Lauren Child is the new Children's Laureate. She was presented with her medal at a ceremony in Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The writer of the Charlie and Lola series and the Clarice Bean books said she wanted to "focus on building stronger links between the world of children's literature and other art forms such as fine art, film, music, television and design."
Lauren Child has previously worked with famous artist Damien Hirst and is known for turning her books into other types of content - such as television programmes.
She says she wants to encourage children to "celebrate random acts of imagination".
So, what is the Children's Laureate?
The poet Ted Hughes and children's writer Michael Morpurgo came up with the idea.
They thought it was a good way to celebrate great work for children but also say 'well done' to writers and illustrators who had done really good work.
What do they do?
Their job is to get children excited about books, reading and writing, but they can also make it whatever they want. Previous Children's Laureates have worked to promote poetry, illustration, books for disabled readers and even drama.
The Laureate does things like visit schools, appear on TV programmes and give out awards. Basically, they go to events all over the country saying how brilliant children's books are.
Previous Laureate Chris Riddell said his job was to "go out and talk about children's book as loudly as I can." He also said he wanted to promote libraries and encourage children to draw every day.
What do we know about Lauren Child?
You might have read her books, how much do you know about the woman behind the stories?
Find out all about Lauren's imaginary pet, how she came to own 16 guinea pigs, and what she does to get ideas for her stories.
What do you think of the new Children's Laureate?
Lauren is the tenth Laureate dedicated to children. In the past Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson had the job, while in 2005 Dame Jacqueline Wilson took on the role.
She will stay as Children's Laureate until 2019.
