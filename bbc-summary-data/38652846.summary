Cikos, 28, started his second spell in Dingwall at the start of the season, having been loaned to County by Slovan Bratislava in 2014.
However, he made only seven appearances this season and last featured in November.
"We'd like to wish Erik well with the next stage of his career," manager Jim McIntyre told the Staggies' official website.
"An exciting opportunity came up for Erik that allows him to pursue more first-team football and we didn't want to stand in his way."
Capped twice at senior level, Cikos has played for three clubs in his homeland and also had loan spell with Wisla Krakow in Poland.
