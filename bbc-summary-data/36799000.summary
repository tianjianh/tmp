Stephanie Meadow: NI woman handed Olympic Games place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The withdrawal of two Dutch golfers from the women's competition at the Rio Olympics has handed Stephanie Meadow a place at next month's Games.

Anne Van Dam and Christel Boeljon made the list of 60 golfers eligible for Brazil but they did not meet the Dutch Olympic Committee's qualifying criteria that they be in the world's top 100.
Meadow was one of the next two golfers on the 'reserve list' for the Games.
"Pretty pumped I'll be representing Ireland in the Olympics," she tweeted.
The Dutch Olympic Committee are not putting forward Van Dam or Boeljon for Rio, with only Joost Luiten competing for the Netherlands in the men's competition.
Meadow, 24, looked to have missed out on an Olympic place after the International Golf Federation published its list of qualifiers for the event earlier this week.
Cavan amateur Leona Maguire has also secured an Olympic spot for Ireland.
Northern Irishwoman Meadow finished an impressive third behind winner Michelle Wie at the US Women's Open two years ago but has struggled for form over the past year following the death of her father.
