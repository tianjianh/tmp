The 17-year-old boy was attacked as he walked along a ginnel between Dixon Lane and Henry Avenue in Wortley, Leeds, on Monday.
West Yorkshire Police said the attack was "frightening" and "particularly cruel".
The force has appealed for witnesses to come forward.
The suspect is described as white, aged 19 to 20, slim and about 5ft 11ins (1.8m) tall, with a spotty complexion and a scruffy beard.
He was wearing a black coat with a hood, black tracksuit bottoms and had a black rucksack with a white Newcastle United logo.
Det Con Grant Lee said: "The victim is currently undergoing treatment for leukaemia and has been left understandably distressed at being targeted in this way.
"The phone was given to him by a children's cancer charity to support him during his treatment, so for it to be taken from him in such frightening circumstances is particularly cruel."
