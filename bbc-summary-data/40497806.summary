Japan's Matsuyama leapfrogged McIlroy in the rankings after finishing in a share of second place at the US Open while Rahm is the world number 11.
The trio, who will start at 13:20 BST on Thursday, are the highest-ranked players in the Portstewart field.
McIlroy is ranked fourth after Jordan Spieth's recent move up to third spot.
Matsuyama, the highest-placed Japanese golfer in the history of the world rankings, is making his debut in the Â£5.4m event in his first ever journey to Ireland.
The Japanese player has won four times on the PGA Tour including his successful defence of the Phoenix Open title this year.
Matsuyama's Japan Open triumph last autumn started a remarkable run of four wins in five starts which included the World Golf Championship HSBC Champions event in Shanghai and the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.
"When you look at what he has achieved, not just last year and already this year, but over the past few years it is impressive how he goes about his business," said McIlroy.
"He is a very hard worker and anytime you are on the practice range he always seems to always be there and it is the same scenario when you are on the practice putting green.
"I heard he was interested  in playing some links golf ahead of the Open, so we got in touch with his management team saying that would love to have him compete at Portstewart and we would do anything to help in getting him to the tournament."
Last year's Masters champion Danny Willett will be in the next three ball off the first tee on Thursday at 13:30 with fellow Englishmen Matthew Fitzpatrick and Ian Poulter.
World number 22 Tyrrell Hatton will start 10 minutes before McIlroy alongside Lee Westwood and emerging Irish star Paul Dunne.

The 2011 Open champion, Darren Clarke, is also among the afternoon starters after being paired with 2015 Irish Open winner Soren Kjeldsen and England's Andrew 'Beef' Johnston.
Graeme McDowell has a morning tee time as he tees off from the 10th at 08:20 with Olympic champion Justin Rose and Sunday's French Open winner Tommy Fleetwood.
Padraig Harrington will start 10 minutes later alongside another veteran, Miguel Angel Jimenez, and European Ryder Cup player Andy Sullivan.
Jamie Donaldson, the winner at Royal Portrush in 2012, will play alongside another previous Irish Open champion Mikko Ilonen while Offaly man Shane Lowry will have European Ryder Cup players Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Thomas Pieters for company over the opening two rounds.
The 1990 Irish Open champion, Jose-Maria Olazabal, will be partnered by recent BMW International Open winner Andres Romero and American Peter Uihlein.
Last year's BMW PGA Championship Chris Wood has pulled out of this week's event because of a wrist injury but hopes to play in next week's Scottish Open.
