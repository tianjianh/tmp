Wasdale Head power line work to keep lights on

Work to secure power supplies to one of England's most remote locations - and once home to Britain's biggest liar - has begun.

Cables at Wasdale Head are being replaced by Electricity North West in the Â£584,000 project.
It follows previous work in 2012 to reduce the area's propensity for power cuts.
In the 19th Century, Wasdale Head publican Will Ritson was labelled Britain's biggest liar.
Ritson, who ran the Wasdale Head Inn, became notorious for telling tall-tales about the areas to his visitors and an annual lying competition is held in Cumbria each year in his memory.
Wasdale Head is a collection of homes and farms sitting at the head of Wastwater, England's deepest lake.
Jane Fleetwood, from Electricity North West, said the area's remoteness made the works challenging.
She said: "This was a really tough job back in 2012 due to the incredibly remote location and sensitive area.
"The time is now right to proactively replace other sections of cable, to help prevent faults in future.
"The local community were very patient while we worked out the best solution for the area then and we'll be working closely with them too to minimise disruption during the work to help keep the lights on for years to come."
