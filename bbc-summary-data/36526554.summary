Madejski stated McDermott "should have been given longer" as new boss Jaap Stam was unveiled on Monday.
"I thought that was a remarkable statement even by Sir John's standards," Howe said.
Ex-Manchester United and Netherlands defender Stam, 43, has joined the Championship club on a two-year deal.
His appointment follows McDermott's dismissal after just six months of his second spell at the club.
Sitting alongside Stam, Madejski said he did not agree to parting company with McDermott following a 17th-place finish last season.

"I respect the shareholders' decision, although I didn't agree with the decision that Brian shouldn't have stayed longer," the former owner said.
Howe defended the managerial change and stressed the Thai consortium which owns the club are learning from previous decisions.
"We know Sir John has a tendency to be a bit off the wall at times," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"But, I think because he wasn't involved in the selection process (to appoint Stam) and isn't involved in the day-to-day running of the club, he probably felt he might want to vent himself.
"He was given a platform to do so. Certainly, I'd have hoped he'd have picked a different forum."
Reading's owners have made three managerial changes since taking over the club in September 2014, dismissing Nigel Adkins, Steve Clarke and McDermott.
"They're going through a bit of a learning curve", Howe added. "They've made decisions they certainly would do differently now with hindsight.
"They're trying very hard to get it right and that's all you can ask."
