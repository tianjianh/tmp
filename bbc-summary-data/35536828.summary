A man who staged a drug-fuelled roof-top siege after breaking up with his partner has been given a suspended prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Frost, 27, barricaded himself into his girlfriend's flat in Princetown on Dartmoor on 18 January.
He was arrested two hours after breaking through the roof, Plymouth magistrates heard.
Unemployed Frost admitted two charges of causing criminal damage and two of threatening behaviour.
Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to Oakery Crescent, in Princetown, after the siege began following the break-up the day before, magistrates heard.
People in the area were evacuated and cordon was put up around the scene while officers pleaded with him to come down.
Frost, of no fixed address, was jailed for a total of eight weeks suspended for 18 months and ordered to pay a total of Â£650 compensation.
Stephen Walker, defending, said Frost was a "sensitive, intelligent" man who had "mental health issues".
The siege had sprung from a "desire to free himself from a situation that had spun out of control".
Mr Walker said: "It was a miracle he did not come off the roof and kill himself."
