The 23-year-old scored two goals in 38 league matches during his one season with the Scottish Premiership side.
Azeez previously found the net 14 times in 98 appearances for AFC Wimbledon, helping them win promotion out of League Two in 2016.
"I've driven down from Scotland with a big smile on my face because I'm really excited to move to Cambridge," he said.
"There has always been a really good feel about this football club whenever I have played here in the past.
"As soon as I had a conversation with (head coach) Shaun Derry and other staff from the club, I knew that this was the right place to come."
