Gone are the days of balloons and a Victoria sponge. If your baby is having a birthday, there's only one way to celebrate: with a cake smash.

The craze started in the US, and over the past few years, parents across the UK have been joining in.
A cake smash is where a one-year-old gets very messy with a cake and a professional photographer captures the moment.
After that, there is often a bubble bath, which is also caught on camera for posterity.
A cake smash party can cost Â£800.
