[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denis Donaldson murder: Patrick Gillespie granted bail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly man charged with withholding information about the murder of ex-Sinn Féin official and MI5 informer Denis Donaldson has been granted bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The east Belfast man was shot dead at a remote cottage in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland in April 2006, months after he was exposed as a spy.
Patrick Gillespie, 74, from Craigvar Street in Glasgow, was granted bail at Dublin's Special Criminal Court.
He must comply with several conditions and live at a County Donegal address.
The bail conditions imposed on Friday include a requirement to surrender his passport; observe a night-time curfew and sign on every Saturday at a Garda (Irish police) station in Letterkenny.
Mr Gillespie is not allowed to leave the jurisdiction and must provide a mobile phone contact number to police.
Two women have agreed to freeze a surety of 15,000 euros (£12,600), which will be forfeited if the defendant fails to comply with bail conditions.
Mr Donaldson. who once held a senior position in Sinn Féin, was expelled from the party a decade ago after he admitted being a paid British spy for 20 years.
