[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who murdered a pensioner in an unprovoked knife attack while on bail has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Telfer, 25, was captured on CCTV stabbing 76-year-old John Baker in June 2016 as the pensioner walked home from a night out in Glasgow.
Mr Baker, who had recently been given the all-clear from cancer, later died in hospital.
Telfer was told he would have to serve at least 21 years in prison before being considered for release.
The High Court in Glasgow was told that Telfer stabbed his victim twice in the back days after being given bail at Glasgow Sheriff Court for an assault and attempted robbery charge in Shettleston Road.
After being given bail, he went on to rob two women at knifepoint - one outside Glasgow Central Station and another in the Trongate area before murdering Mr Baker.
Referring to the murder as a "senseless act", judge Lord Matthews said: "Your appalling conduct was caught on CCTV and that chilling footage showed you engaged in the most cowardly of behaviour, targeting women and then stabbing Mr Baker in the back.
"He had the guts to turn and face you before you made off as if nothing had happened."
The court heard that shortly after the stabbing on 29 June, Mr Baker stood in the middle of the road and flagged down three council cleansing workers who were in a lorry.
He told them: "I've been stabbed".
By the time the three workmen got out their lorry, Mr Baker had collapsed and was saying: 'I have a bad heart', I can't breathe right'."
It emerged that Mr Baker had recently been given the all clear from cancer, but died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary hospital from massive blood loss.
Defence counsel Thomas Ross told the court that Telfer had a "miserable childhood" and "difficulties as a result of maternal shortcomings" resulted in him growing up in care homes.
Telfer also claimed that he had taken valium and vodka on the day of the murder and could remember very little.
Mr Ross added: "In a moment of madness he ended one life, lessened the quality of one life and completely ruined his own."
Speaking outside court, Mr Baker's niece Carol Baker-Longshaw said: "Whilst we recognise it won't ever compensate for the loss of our gentle Uncle John, we feel that justice has been served.
"I think listening to the mitigation that Telfer had a damaged upbringing, it might be a reason for his behaviour but is certainly no excuse to kill in cold blood, an elderly, innocent, vulnerable gentleman."
She added: "We lost our mum last year, he was our last living relative and Peter Telfer robbed us of our mentor and confidant."
