Flood warnings remain for parts of Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parts of Scotland are still being warned that flooding is likely, with rivers expected to peak later.

The Met Office has issued amber "be prepared" warnings of rain for much of north east and central Scotland on Saturday and Sunday.
They cover Grampian, Tayside, central Scotland and Fife until 21:00 on Monday.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) currently has 23 flood warnings in place and three alerts.
They are mostly for the Tayside, Angus, and Dundee areas, as well as Aberdeen and Ballater in Aberdeenshire.
The warnings come as Scotland continues to clean up after Storm Frank hit on Wednesday.
The RNLI was drafted in on Saturday evening to help restore electricity supplies to Ballater which has been without power since the storm.
Despite heavy winds and driving rain, Aberdeen RNLI volunteers Bill Deans and Calum Reed used rockets to fire a power line across the River Dee at the Cambus O' May at the A93.
Scottish Hydro engineers were then able to connect up the wires and restore some power to the area.
Insp Simon Reid said there were likely to be some road closures but said it was difficult to predict where they would be.
"We would ask the public to be mindful of road closures," he said. "If roads are closed they are closed for a reason. They  are there for safety. Please be sensible, adhere to them and don't put yourselves or others at risk."
A cable damaged by Storm Frank led to the loss of the telephone service, including 999 calls, in Braemar and Crathie.
Work has been carried out to repair the cable and BT and the Red Cross have provided temporary cover through communication vehicles in those areas.
The vehicle in Braemar was set up in the square in Marr Road and in Crathie the cover was provided in the main car park near the church.
Ch Insp Richard Craig said: "Police are continuing to visit vulnerable people in Braemar, Crathie and Ballater and have officers within Braemar Police Station.
"Anyone requiring the emergency services is advised to speak to an officer at the police station or utilise the communication vehicles.
"We will continue to have officers patrolling in these areas and maintain contact with vulnerable people until the telephone lines have been fixed."
Police are advising people to stay away from already flooded areas.
Due to the weather warnings, Aberdeen City Council closed Duthie Park car park to vehicles on Saturday and people were asked to park vehicles away from areas near rivers.
The A93 between Ballater and Braemar remains closed after part of the road was washed away and the Invercauld Bridge is expected to remain closed to vehicles for a number of weeks.
Aberdeenshire Council is working to return residents to their homes in Ballater after they became flooded.
Police have warned people who are thinking of going out on rivers that water levels remain high in some areas and it is likely that debris from the recent flooding is still in the water.
Ch Insp Richard Craig said: "We are continuing to work with other agencies following the impact of Storm Frank across the Grampian region, particularly in Ballater, Crathie and Braemar and are also preparing for further rain and potential flooding.
"Due to the warnings in place, we are asking people to stay away from rivers and already flooded areas so you don't put yourself in danger or place further burden on communities that have been impacted by the flooding."
He added: "Additionally, we are advising people to park their vehicles away from areas close to rivers and to park on higher ground where possible.
"We also ask that motorists do not ignore road closure signs and avoid driving through flood water as there will be unseen dangers, including lifted man-hole covers.
"The closures are there for a reason and are to protect your safety. By ignoring these closures you put yourself at risk as well as the emergency services."
Aberdeenshire Council's duty emergency response co-ordinator Ritchie Johnson said: "A concerted effort is taking place to respond to the weather situation in Deeside and across Aberdeenshire in light of warnings in place from Sepa and the Met Office and working closely with partners, colleagues and the community.
"There are access issues into Braemar and we are working with Police Scotland and neighbouring authorities to ensure access south remains in place with the aim of protecting the road.
"We are also working on remedial action across the area with sandbags and floodgates being issued to protect roads and properties as well as preparing responses to any rising river levels across Aberdeenshire."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon attended a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience committee on Saturday to be updated on the latest weather forecasts.
Environment Minister Aileen McLeod said: "Scottish government ministers and officials are in constant contact with emergency services and other relevant agencies.
"We will ensure that everything possible is done to support the affected communities and that people and businesses are as prepared as they can be."
A kayaker and a canoeist died in separate incidents in northern Scotland after the storm hit.
The Met Office warned that some areas of Scotland could see as much as 20cm (8in) over the weekend and into Monday.
It added: "Given the saturated nature of the ground there is a greater risk of surface water and river flooding that might normally be expected."
Wednesday's heavy rain and gale-force winds left many people stranded, in temporary accommodation and without electricity, and also prompted the most severe "danger to life" flood warnings to be issued.
