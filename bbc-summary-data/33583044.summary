Local media reports say the 74-year-old was suffering from a trapped nerve and has had back surgery at the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo.
Pele, a three-time World Cup winner, was treated for a urinary infection eight months ago after having kidney stones removed.
He should be released in the coming days, according to reports.
Mirtes Bogea, a press officer for the Albert Einstein hospital, said she was not allowed to say when Pele was re-admitted or why.
Pele, who was named Fifa's Player of the Century, scored a world record total of 1,281 goals in 1,363 games during his 21-year career, including 77 in 91 appearances for Brazil.
He has only one kidney, having had one removed towards the end of his playing career.
Pele played in 14 games at World Cup finals, scoring 12 goals, and was awarded the Fifa Golden Ball as the best player at the 1970 tournament.
