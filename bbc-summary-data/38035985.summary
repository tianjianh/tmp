[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Premiership: Heart of Midlothian 3-0 Motherwell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Bjorn Johnsen set Hearts on the way to a convincing win over Motherwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The American striker rounded goalkeeper Craig Samson from Arnaud Djoum's through ball after half an hour.
Johnsen had another chopped off before heading the second from a Robbie Muirhead free-kick.
Djoum was the creator again as Jamie Walker fired the third to seal a victory that lifts Hearts to within a point of third-placed Aberdeen.
Hearts had gone into the game without a win in their last four games, but a fine display should ease any mounting fan pressure on head coach Robbie Neilson.
When Johnsen arrived at Tynecastle in the summer, not too many fans knew anything about the USA-born striker.
At 6ft 6in, he certainly is an imposing character, but up until now he had failed to set the heather on fire.
But the combination of the 24-year-old alongside Djoum certainly clicked against Motherwell.
It was Djoum's inch-perfect pass just after the half-hour mark into the path of Johnsen that allowed him to round the goalkeeper and roll the ball into the empty net.
Only the flag of standside assistant referee Alastair Mather denied Johnsen a second before the break - Djoum again providing the cross into the box.
Number two for Johnsen came shortly after half-time. Muirhead floated a corner into the box and Johnsen rose unchallenged to send a header into the net.
Walker has been in the Hearts set-up from a very young age, but his progress has stuttered due a number of serious injuries.
However, when fit and available, the winger can certainly turn on the style.
The pace of the 23-year-old caused problems for the Motherwell defence all afternoon and, when slipped through on goal by the impressive Djoum, Walker fired the ball low into the bottom corner to secure all three points for the home side.
Mark McGhee's side had arrived in the capital after victory over Partick Thistle had taken them into the top six.
However, when the Fir Park side found their way to goal, they encountered a Hearts defence who were determined to keep a clean sheet.
Scott MacDonald and Ben Heneghan were both denied by goal-line clearances by Faycal Rherras.
John Souttar also came to Hearts' rescue when it looked as if the Lanarkshire side would get themselves back into the game.
A change in formation from a back three to the more traditional back four helped in the second half, but it was too late to save a point for the Steelmen.
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: "I thought we started really well with good energy. We passed the ball well and quickly and it was a pleasing performance all round. We get the first goal and we think we have a second that gets chalked off and that was disappointing but we score and kill the game off.
"Arnaud Djoum is a top player and we had him linking with Johnsen. I thought Robbie Muirhead did really well out on the left. He gave us that balance that we have been looking for. I thought we also defended well apart from set plays but we managed to see them out."
(On the game against Rangers on Wednesday) "It's going to be a fantastic day for everyone. Tynecastle under lights is a different ball game altogether. It's going to be a full house, it's going to be rocking. It's important that we prepare now for Wednesday, play well and have a right good go at them."
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: "We were well beaten. We had chances cleared off the line but that's pretty irrelevant. They were more aggressive than us, passed the ball better, had more quality in possession. They carved out chances better than us.
"It was a difficult day for us. We have to do better than that. They had worked hard against the shape we had and we surrendered the first half to them.
"We changed it at half-time but that is the most disappointing thing because I think the shape was then fine, but to lose the second goal from a set piece was particularly disappointing. We have a couple of big centre-halves and we expected someone to head it but we lost the goal direct from the corner which in effect ended the game."
