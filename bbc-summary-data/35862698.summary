[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff baby sale investigation dropped by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation into allegations that a six-week-old baby was sold for thousands of pounds has ended with no charges brought, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two Spanish citizens, a couple in their 20s, were arrested in Rumney, Cardiff, last October after the claims surfaced.
The mother of the baby - born in the Spanish city of Zamora in September 2015 - was arrested at Bristol Airport.
All three were released from bail on Monday, with no further action planned.
Det Con Vince Jones said an "extensive police investigation" involved the Crown Prosecution Service, social services and the Spanish authorities.
But he said it concluded that no offence had been committed in the UK.
