Steve Shingler's two penalties sent the Blues in with a three-point lead at the break while they went ahead when Aled Summerhill scored the game's first try.
Francis Saili touched down as the visitors rallied late on, with Rory Scannell kicking a drop goal.
Conor Oliver crossed for the visitors late on to seal victory.
The defeat means Cardiff Blues' hopes of a top six finish suffered a blow as they remain in eighth in the Pro12.
Munster move up to second thanks to the win and are now a point behind Ospreys, with Leinster still to play Scarlets on Saturday.
The hosts' task could have been made much harder when Willis Halaholo was sin-binned for a high tackle on Andrew Conway just after the break, but Summerhill crossed moments later.
With Wales retaining their Six Nations players in hooker Kristian Dacey and wing Alex Cuthbert, Matthew Rees and Summerhill stepped up with the latter making an impact in the second half.
