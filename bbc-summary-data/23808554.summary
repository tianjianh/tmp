Tourists visiting the area in its busiest season have been told to leave and homes nearby have been evacuated.
The fire's been burning for a week and has tripled in size in the last twenty-four hours.
A state of emergency has been declared around the area.
The fires have not yet reached Yosemite and park officials say it's still open.
But the blaze has forced part of a motorway that leads to a park entrance, to shut.
In the state of Wyoming, wildfires have been burning near Yellowstone National Park.
