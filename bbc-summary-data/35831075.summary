Bolton Wanderers interim manager Jimmy Phillips has confirmed he will remain in charge for the rest of the season.

The 50-year-old, who heads the club's academy, was placed in charge after Neil Lennon left on Tuesday.
Wanderers are bottom of the Championship and 11 points from safety, with nine games remaining this term to try and avoid relegation.
Dean Holdsworth's Sport Shield consortium took over the club last week and chose to part company with Lennon.
"It was a surprise. I got the phone call from Dean Holdsworth on Tuesday," Phillips told BBC Radio Manchester.
"He said 'I'd like you to take the team for the remainder of the season' and I said 'no problem.'"
Bolton-born Phillips had a previous stint as caretaker for three games in 2012 before Dougie Freedman took charge, but is unsure if he will be considered for a permanent role.
"Obviously we've got a new consortium coming in," he added. "I think because of the nature of the club they're having to take things very steadily and they will have a full business plan behind their actions.
"I don't think it's a case of whether I want to put my name forward, I think they've got a plan and hopefully I will be part of their plans in the future.
"Whatever shape that takes, time will tell."
Phillips has also confirmed that they will not be selecting midfielder Jay Spearing for the rest of the campaign.
It is understood the 27-year-old has a clause in his contract that would mean a further payment to Liverpool if he plays another game in the Championship.
Spearing spent the second part of last season on loan at Blackburn because of the clause.
