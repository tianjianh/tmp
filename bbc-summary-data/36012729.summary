[SN]TITLE[SN]
Odyssey complex in Belfast closed due to 'major' power failure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Odyssey complex in Belfast will be closed on Monday because of a "major power failure".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Power is not expected to be restored before 17:00 BST.
Adrian Doyle, from the Odyssey Trust, said the failure happened at about 02:30 BST and specialist contractors are working on the problem.
He said: "We would ask any groups who are booked to attend W5 this morning not to travel as the building will not be able to open.
"The car park will operate manually today."
