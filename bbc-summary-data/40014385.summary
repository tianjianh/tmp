[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guinea picked up their first point at the Fifa under-20 World Cup after a 1-1 draw with England in Jeonju, South Korea, on Tuesday.

England took the lead in this Group A encounter after 53 minutes when Lewis Cook's 25-yard effort found the back of the net.
But a comical own goal from Fikayo Tomori saw the two sides share the points.
Unaware that goalkeeper Dean Henderson had strayed from his goal, Tomori, who is owned by Chelsea, played a blind back-pass which rolled into an empty net.
It was Guinea's first ever under-20 World Cup goal.
The African side missed a glorious opportunity to take all three points when Alseny Soumah found himself clean through but was denied by Henderson.
The English have four points from two matches and will next face the South Koreans on Friday.
Guinea will face Argentina.
In the other group match, Argentina lost their second straight game to South Korea 2-1.
