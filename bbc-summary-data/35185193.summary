Australia v West Indies: Hosts dominate second Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four Australia players made first-innings centuries as the home side took firm control of the second Test against West Indies in Melbourne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Steve Smith (134 not out) and Adam Voges (106 not out) reached three figures on the second day after Usman Khawaja (144) and Joe Burns (128) had done likewise 24 hours earlier.
Australia declared on 551-3 before reducing West Indies to 91-6.
The hosts won the first of three Tests by an innings and 212 runs.
Smith and Voges resumed on Sunday with Australia 345-3, and their partnership was only ended on 223 when Smith declared.
The captain's 134 saw him replace England skipper Alastair Cook as the leading run-scorer in Tests this year, while Voges moved past 1,000 runs in his first year as a Test player.
The Windies had reached 35-0 for tea but lost six wickets for just 48 runs on the resumption, with James Pattinson, Nathan Lyon and Peter Siddle taking two apiece.
Siddle dismissed Denesh Ramdin and Jason Holder for ducks off successive deliveries at the start of the 41st over but Carlos Brathwaite kept out the hat-trick ball before guiding his side to the close alongside Darren Bravo.
