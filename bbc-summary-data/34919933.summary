Care home closures: Health minister open to new admissions at state-run homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's health minister is to consider allowing new admissions to state-owned care homes after a major private provider announced it is to close seven of its facilities.

Four Seasons Health Care's closures affect 254 residents and 393 staff.
In response, Mr Hamilton halted the possible closure of 10 statutory homes.
He said he was "open to the idea" of new admissions to state-run facilities "in the context of a reduction in places across the independent sector".
Four Seasons made the announcement on Tuesday, saying the homes had been "operating at a loss".
In total, eight of its 69 homes in Northern Ireland are set to shut, with the closure of Drumragh Care home in Omagh, County Tyrone, having been announced previously.
Mr Hamilton told BBC Radio Ulster's The Stephen Nolan Show that he was "well aware of pressures that are existing in the independent sector".
But he added that the Department of Health had "no indication of closure of any other homes".
He said: "We want to get these 254 residents into the most appropriate accommodation for them, whether that's in the statutory sector or the independent sector.
"It's important that we get them, with the minimum amount of disruption, into the new accommodation as quickly as we possibly can.
"There are some homes that had been earmarked for closure that are going to be kept and reopened for new admissions."
Roberta Shannon, whose husband is in the Four Seasons's Victoria Park home in Belfast, said she was "absolutely devastated".
She received a letter from the company telling her the home would close in February, leaving her with what it described as "plenty of time" to find an alternative accommodation.
She said that had been "an insult".
"It's not a matter of finding a bed, it's a matter of finding a place that's suitable to cope," she said.
"My husband has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's - that upheaval sends [that] into a further level and we never get that back. This is going to affect his health.
"There's no-one addressing any of this."
Kathy Barenskie, whose mother Bridie has lived in Hamilton Court care home in Armagh for 10 years, said a meeting with Four Seasons management on Tuesday provided her with little information on the closure.
"I don't know how they can do this," she said.
"Nowadays, to make a profit out of a home it needs to be a bigger home.
"I said to my mum: 'Do people not matter any more?'"
Evelyn Hoy, the chief executive of the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, said there would be difficulties relocating all 254 residents at one time.
"We'd be keen that lots of discussion now takes place with residents and their families, friends and carers about what the alternative provision is," Ms Hoy said.
"That provision has to be as good as or better than what they have been provided with up to now."
She said that the health minister should consider that Northern Ireland's population is aging and "work now to plan for a good mix of choices for people in the future".
