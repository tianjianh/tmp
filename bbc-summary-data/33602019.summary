His Fiorucci brand pioneered stretch jeans and was famous for using bright and fluorescent colours.
His clothes caught the attention of the 1970s "jet set" and clients included Andy Warhol and Bianca Jagger.
Italian news agency Ansa, quoting relatives, said Mr Fiorucci had been in good health but may have succumbed to a sudden illness.
Elio Fiorucci opened his first store in Milan in 1967, selling fashions and other items inspired by London's Carnaby Street. A few years later he adopted the Fiorucci brand's distinctive two angel logo.
The Milan shop became a focal point for youth culture and stores in London and New York later followed.
Mr Fiorucci sold his company in 1990 to a Japanese firm but 11 years ago founded a new brand, Love Therapy.
