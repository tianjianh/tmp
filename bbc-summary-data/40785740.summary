Steve McCabe, who said he had given a statement to police, said he was "nursing a very sore and swollen face" after he was injured on Monday night.
The Labour member for Birmingham Selly Oak later tweeted pictures of two motorcyclists allegedly involved, both wearing helmets.
"Sure somebody recognises these two," Mr McCabe said.
"All I need are names & addresses. Send them to me anonymously & I'll do the rest with the police."
MPs from his own and other parties sent messages of sympathy to Mr McCabe, who said the attack took place in Greenford Road, in the Kings Heath area of Birmingham.
Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner expressed her shock.
