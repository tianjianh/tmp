About 1.4in (35.6mm) of rain fell in the space of 30 minutes on Tuesday evening, causing disruption to roads and public transport services.
Many homes have been damaged and flood warnings were in place on the River Leen in Bulwell, following the thunderstorms.
Thurgarton village remains waterlogged after the nearby brook burst its banks, trapping people in their homes.
Emergency services in the county said they had been inundated with calls about flooding during Tuesday evening.
On Mansfield Road in Nottingham some cars were left stranded and in Sherwood one woman was trapped in her vehicle after it became stuck in a manhole.
Maura Housley, who lives in Sherwood said: "It was awful. I looked outside and the water was coming over the pavement.
"I told my eldest son to get all the towels he could and we put them under the doors and windowsills in the house.

The heavens just opened and they did not stop. The flooding has affected various areas of Southwell.
Some people in Easthorpe have taken doors that have been pulled off their hinges and put them in front of their front doors to stop the water getting in.
Others have ripped up carpets and left them on railings at the front of their houses.
There is a big thick brown sludge  on the road. The after effects of what happened here are quite clear.
It really has caused absolute chaos and will take weeks, if not months, to clear up.
"I was about an ankle deep in water so I took my children upstairs and by the time my husband got to us he was waist deep at the road level."
She said it took about 10 minutes for the downstairs of her house to flood, adding that her five-year-old son was in "floods of tears" because he was so frightened.
Fabio Milone, who lives in Thurgarton village, said: "There's damage to the carpets and we have no electricity, no telephone.
"Our business as well [has been affected] because we work from home."
Flood water also affected the corridors at Nottingham City Hospital, prompting a call for visitors to stay away for the night.
About 100 homes were hit by flooding in Southwell and many roads had to close.
In Arnold, a community centre's wall collapsed and shops and businesses on Front Street could not prevent flood water from entering its buildings.
Nottingham city councillor Jane Urquhart said: "It was incredibly intense rain over a short period of time that caused manhole covers to come off and surface damage to highways and delays to trams.
"It happened so quickly - there will be some long-term repairs to do because the intensity of the water has caused some considerable damage to road surfaces."
Sarah-Jayne O'Kane of Severn Trent Water said: "The drains are not designed to take that amount of rainfall all in one go.
"When we get weather like this, when it is so dry beforehand and the ground is really compacted so the rain doesn't sink in, it runs straight off the top and into the drains and overwhelms them."
The county was the wettest place in the UK, according to BBC Weather.
