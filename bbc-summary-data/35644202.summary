[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some jobs at the Cardiff-base of medical products company GE healthcare could be moved to China.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm, which employs more than 350 workers at its Whitchurch site, said it was consulting on plans to consolidate all its paper-conversion activities in Tonglu, in east China.
It said the move could result in "some redundancies" but did not say how many.
GE said in a statement it would try to "minimize the impact" on those affected.
The company's paper conversion team performs the final manufacturing step on cellulose and glass-fibre membranes that go into products used by scientists.
"Our Cardiff site remains a manufacturing centre for other parts of our portfolio and for R&D in cell therapy technologies," GE added in the statement.
"GE Healthcare very much regrets the loss of any job and this action is no reflection on the performance of our teams on the site, who work with the utmost professionalism and care for their customers."
GE has worked with the Welsh government as one of its anchor companies - global or international organisations which have formed a strategic relationship with Cardiff Bay.
