Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has chosen a white dove on a red background as the design for his official Christmas card.

The picture also spells out "2017", if one takes stands a certain distance away and stares at it for a while.
Mr Corbyn's minimalist selection contrasts with cards sent by Prime Minister Theresa May and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who both opted for pictures by children in their constituencies.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon went for cartoon character Oor Wullie.
Mr Corbyn's card bears the message "With warmest wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year", the dove often being used as a symbol of purity and peace.
The Labour leader's offering last year showed snow-covered bicycles chained to a rack next to a red telephone box. The traffic light in the photograph was also on red.
This year, her first as prime minister, Theresa May has sent three different Christmas cards, bearing pictures of Downing Street by children in her Maidenhead constituency.
Mr Farron also featured a drawing by a youngster from his Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency, in which a dog lies asleep on a crescent moon (also sleeping), both wearing Santa hats.
Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones chose a design by a schoolboy, showing a red dragon pulling Santa's sleigh over a Christmas tree, with a mountain range in the background.
And Ms Sturgeon's features Oor Wullie - the comic-book character celebrating his 80th anniversary this year - whom she described as a "much-loved national treasure adored by both children and adults across Scotland".
