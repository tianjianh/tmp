Amazon is recalling parts of the power chargers packaged with its tablet computers because of a risk of electrical shocks.

The call-back affects adapters used to make the chargers work with UK and Republic of Ireland plug sockets.
It says the affected kit was included with 7in-display Fire and Fire Kids Edition tablets sold since September 2015.
It is the latest in a series of tech companies to announce such a move.
Apple recalled power charger adapter plugs of its own in January, and Microsoft withdrew power cords for its Surface Pro tablets the following month.
Amazon has advised its customer to charge their tablets via a USB cable attached to a PC while they wait for replacement parts.
"Customer safety is our top priority, and we are proactively offering to replace these power adapters with a new adapter, free of charge," it said in a statement.
"Power adapters sold in other countries and power adapters shipped with Fire HD and Fire HDX tablets are not affected and need not be exchanged."
The firm has notified the UK's Trading Standards office about the problem.
