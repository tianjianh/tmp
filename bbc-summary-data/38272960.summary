[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 2-1 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln beat Tranmere at Sincil Bank in a meeting of the National League's top two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nathan Arnold nudged the Imps in front inside three minutes when Sam Habergham's long throw was flicked into the midfielder's path by Matt Rhead.
The visitors levelled on the half hour when Callum Howe checked Andy Mangan in the box, and Jeff Hughes converted the penalty.
Lincoln were 15 matches unbeaten and Tranmere 10, so it was no surprise that the two sides tried to hold determinedly on to their successful sequences.
But Tranmere eventually yielded in the final 10 minutes, Rhead and Arnold combining to set up substitute Adam Marriott to smash home Lincoln's winner.
