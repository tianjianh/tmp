The 24-year-old forward moved to Easter Road on loan from Dundee in January 2015, making the move permanent in the following summer.
Boyle scored nine goals this season as Hibs won the Championship and promotion to the Premiership.
"He can play in a variety of positions and always gives 100%, and his pace is a great asset to have," said manager Neil Lennon.
"His game isn't just about pace, he can also score goals, lay on assists and is able to help us transition from defence to attack."
The news comes the day after Hibs confirmed that defender Liam Fontaine is staying on for another season.
The 31-year-old former Bristol City centre-back has been at the club since 2014 and has played 98 games, including last year's Scottish Cup final triumph.
