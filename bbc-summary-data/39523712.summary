[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 2-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Dagnall scored his ninth goal in 10 games as Crewe fought back twice to earn a 2-2 draw with Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dagnall cancelled out Adam Campbell's early opener for the Magpies, who extended their unbeaten run to five games.
Skipper Michael O'Connor restored the visitors' lead with a second-half finish against his former club, but their hopes of recording a fifth straight win were dashed when James Jones made amends for gifting County their early lead.
Jones' loose pass was seized on by Campbell who drove a low shot into the bottom corner after nine minutes.
Goalkeeper Ben Garratt came to Crewe's rescue when he turned veteran striker Shola Ameobi's first-time effort around a post.
Dagnall then raced clear to slide the ball under Adam Collin to level in the 39th minute.
Notts County emerged strongly after the restart and after Garratt pawed Carl Dickinson's free-kick over the crossbar they were back in front in the 51st minute when Jon Stead laid the ball off for O'Connor to tuck home.
But Crewe secured a share of the spoils in the 66th minute when Dagnall's shot was blocked and Jones volleyed in the looping ball.
