The entertainer died last month aged 85, having been diagnosed with a suspected form of motor neurone disease.
A service for family and friends was held at the St John the Evangelist Church near his home in Shirley, Croydon, south London.
After the service, Sir Michael said the service "hit exactly the right note".
He added: "It was the least showbizzy funeral I've been to.
"He wasn't a very showbiz person in that sense. He was unaffected by fame and recognition. It didn't bother him."
Four candles burned at the back of the altar - a reference to the famous Two Ronnies sketch, Four Candles/Fork Handles.
Sir Michael described Corbett as "modest, self-effacing, a brilliant comic."
"What you saw was what you got," he added. "And as a guy to be a friend of he was just unbeatable."
Corbett's daughter Emma paid tribute to her father during the service, saying: "My dad was truly loved. Yes, by the world - and as a family we have felt that with so many kind gestures and flowers and thoughts - but however today is not about Ronnie Corbett the national treasure - it's about Ronnie Corbett the husband, the father, the grandfather and the friend.
"He was loved and cherished and it is an enormous honour to be his daughter. His integrity, kindness, style and grace were ever present and never left him, even in death," she said.
She went on to joke about his height, adding: "For someone known for being short, he would stand next to me seven foot tall."
Canon Arthur Quinn conducted the service and said: "In all those years, he told me one joke which I'm not going to repeat. He was really a very serious man. We talked about all sorts of things, including religion."
After the funeral, the cortege moved on to a local crematorium.
Barry Cryer, who worked with the Two Ronnies and first met Corbett 50 years ago, said: "I can't think of him without smiling... I'm here and tipping my hat to him."
Rob Brydon, who also worked with Corbett and did impressions of the star, said: "People's faces would light up when they saw him, he just brought happiness."
The funeral service concluded with a recording Corbett made of a song called Up's the Only Way to Go.
A small group of fans gathered outside the church to pay their respects.
Tarbuck also paid tribute, saying: "He was much loved. Very correct guy, very funny fellow.
"Disciplinarian - I think that was because he was an officer in the RAF. But he was great company.
"I mean, he was a terrific laugh. Dreadful giggler. He used to get me at it when we worked together."
He added that Corbett was "much loved, and should have been knighted".
Corbett was one of the UK's best-loved comedians whose double act with Ronnie Barker was one of the most successful of the 1970s and '80s.
His most memorable solo projects include the sitcom Sorry! and the game show Small Talk. He most recently starred in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom When the Dog Dies.
