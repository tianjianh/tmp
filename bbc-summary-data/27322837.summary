[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury's Dana prison could be converted into hotel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a former prison in Shrewsbury could be converted into a hotel under plans revealed by a local businessman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
HMP Shrewsbury was put up for sale by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in February.
Nightclub owner Martin Monahan's bid is one of many under consideration to buy the Grade II listed building.
The agent organising the sale, GVA, said further discussions are needed before a buyer is chosen.
The former prison, which is known as The Dana, closed on 28 March 2013 as part of a programme of prison closures aimed at saving the MoJ Â£63m.
Mr Monahan, who owns four nightclubs and a restaurant in Shrewsbury, also wants to create business start-up units and a leisure complex at the site.
Any alterations would require the permission of the Shropshire Council because it is a listed building.
The property agents said there had been a "handful" of bids for the prison, which were discussed with the MoJ on Wednesday.
But it needs to ensure there is "substance to the proposals" and while the MoJ had a duty to get the best price for the buildings, it also had a responsibility to consider its heritage and ensure it would be developed responsibly.
The MoJ is in the process of selling off a dozen of its sites around the country.
A decision on the sale is expected next week.
