County are 11 points from safety and have won 1 of their last 20 matches.
"It was a massive opportunity to get ourselves off the bottom but we've left ourselves lying firmly at the bottom with a really abject display," he said.
"We have to take a long, hard look at ourselves and ask 'did I do everything I could do to win that match today?'"
He continued: "It's a devastating defeat for us. Not just the result but the manner of the performance because if you measure a performance in terms of fight and desire and hunger and appetite we were very low in all those commodities."
Westley admits relegation is now looking a more likely prospect, but says he won't give up without a fight,
"There was always going to be a lot of work to do, nothing changes in that regard - win, lose or draw today there was always going to be a lot of work to do," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I can justify myself, I inherited a team that was losing and right at the bottom of the league and to date, I've not been able to turn that around.
"I am the person who has to take the responsibility and flak."
Orient, who came into the game off the back of three consecutive League Two defeats, moved to within five points of safety themselves after beating the Exiles.
"I can't start thinking in a negative way. These moments are moments when strong people stand up and are counted," Westley added.
"Leadership is about being strong when others doubt you. We need to muster a reaction to today and next week is a great chance to do that.
"We need an incredible run of results and will need a hell of a performance to get out of this.
"We are down on the floor, people are kicking us and think we are dead and maybe we are, but next weekend, no one will go onto that pith who does not think there is life in us."
