Wales' Bradley Dredge will take a one shot lead into the final round of the Made in Denmark event.

The Welshman has an excellent record at Himmerland, finishing second in 2014 and sixth last season.
His one over par round of 72 left him 12 under, a shot clear of Thomas Pieters, David Lipsky and Adrian Otaegui.
"I've been up there a couple of times this year, you know I want to win, that's what I play golf for," he said.
He continued:  "It was not my best day today.
"I really struggled with the driver which has been a big strength of mine in the last two days so it was a tough day and I just had to try and make the most of it to stay in there and hopefully I'll play better tomorrow.
"I always believe that if you want to win a tournament you've got to go out there and win it, so for me I try and play aggressively off the tee and into the pins."
Dredge got into trouble on the 12th when he made a double-bogey after twice finding the heavy rough down the left and taking a drop, and that brought him back towards the chasing group.
Dredge, whose last win came at the 2006 European Masters, began the day three clear.
Though he lost his tour card in 2012, Dredge is experiencing a career renaissance having earned 687,099 euros (Â£586,713) in 2016 and victory in Denmark would push him further into Race to Dubai contention.
Belgium's Pieters, a wildcard contender for the European Ryder Cup team, could clinch his spot in Darren Clarke's side should he topple Dredge tomorrow.
The captain's picks are made on Monday.
