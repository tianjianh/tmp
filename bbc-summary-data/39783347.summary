Matthew Bryce, 22, was described as being "extremely lucky" to have stayed alive for so long in such cold water.
But how does his achievement compare with other stories of survival at sea?
In January 2014 Mr Alvarenga was rescued by people living in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, suffering from severe dehydration, back pain and swollen joints.
He said he had survived more than a year at sea, covering an area of 8,000km (5,000 miles) in a fibreglass boat by catching fish, birds and turtles with his bare hands.
His ordeal apparently began when he left Mexico for a fishing trip in December 2012 and was hit by a storm, which sent him off course.
An accompanying fisherman, Ezequiel Cordoba, died while they were stranded at sea.
Mr Alvarenga said that he stayed alive by drinking urine, rainwater and the blood of birds. However in 2015 he denied claims in a lawsuit filed by Mr Alvarenga's family that he committed cannibalism by eating his crewmate to stay alive.

Jesus Eduardo Vidana, Lucio Rendon and Salvador Ordonez were  found, emaciated, by a Taiwanese fishing vessel on 9 August 2006 in south Pacific waters.
The three men said they set out on a shark-fishing expedition from the Mexican Port of San Blas - some 8,000km (5,000 miles) away - the previous October.
The said their 8m (27ft) boat had been caught by strong winds and dragged out to sea. They later ran out of fuel and were left at the mercy of the currents, surviving on raw fish, birds and rainwater.
The trio said that two other crew members died because they were not able to stomach the diet, and their bodies were thrown into the sea. They denied allegations from some people that they may have been trafficking drugs or had resorted to cannibalism.
When asked why they seemed to be in such good health after such an ordeal, they replied that the tuna fishermen who had rescued them had treated them very well.
Lapahele Sopi and Telea Paa from Samoa in the South Pacific survived for four months adrift at sea in a small metal boat.
The pair were rescued in 2001 in Papua New Guinea - 4,000km from their homes.
A local doctor treating the two survivors said it was a miracle that they survived. Two other men died of thirst and starvation during the ordeal.
Mr Sopi, 36 at the time, told local media they survived by eating fish and drinking rainwater. Mr Sopi and Mr Paa, were rescued by a villager in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, who paddled his canoe out to them after they had fired off their last flare.
