[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former UKIP councillor Dave Small questioned by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor expelled from UKIP over allegations about racist and homophobic Facebook comments has been questioned by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Small was voluntarily interviewed by officers from West Mercia Police after they were alerted to "concerns" over his social media posts.
A property in Redditch was also searched, police said.
The force stressed Mr Small was not arrested but it would pass an evidence file to the Crown Prosecution Service.
Mr Small, who sits on Redditch Borough Council, was expelled from UKIP on Wednesday.
He was initially suspended after allegedly calling African migrants "scroungers" and Clare Balding and Sir Elton John "perverts".
In an interview with BBC Hereford and Worcester he denied being racist but admitted he was homophobic.
