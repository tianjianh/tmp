An exhibition of new works by artist and film-maker Steve McQueen - his first since his success at the Oscars - is to be held in London this autumn.

The exhibition will open at Thomas Dane Gallery from 14 October, coinciding with the Frieze Art Fair.
At the heart of the exhibition is Ashes, a film shot on super 8 with sound, designed for projection in a gallery.
Ashes is being premiered as a single artwork in Tokyo later this month.
In London, it will be joined by a number of other new creations which the gallery says "further extends the range of McQueen's enquiry into the image and image-making".
The exhibition marks the tenth anniversary of McQueen's solo show Into This World, his inaugural exhibition at the Thomas Dane Gallery in 2004.
Filmed in the West Indies, Ashes is McQueen's first new work since 12 Years a Slave won three Academy Awards in March - best picture, best supporting actress for Lupita Nyong'o and for John Ridley's adapted screenplay.
Born in London in 1969, McQueen studied at Chelsea School of Art and Goldsmith's College, London, where he first began making artworks using film and video.
He won the Turner Prize in 1999, was named official war artist to Iraq in 2003 and represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2009.
McQueen's work appears in collections around the world including London's Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Art Institute of Chicago, and Musee National d'Art Moderne, Paris.
As well as 12 Years a Slave, McQueen directed Hunger (2008), about IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, and sex addiction drama Shame (2011). All three films starred Michael Fassbender.
