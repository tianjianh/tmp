[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, in his 30s, went into cardiac arrest following a suspected robbery in Holloway Road, north London, and died later in hospital.
Officers found the man detained by members of the public after being called at around 22:45 BST on Thursday.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The man, aged in his 30s, was handcuffed by police but not placed under arrest and was identified as being unwell."
London Ambulance Service took the man to hospital, where he died shortly after 00:10 BST on Friday.
The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards had attended the incident and the IPCC would investigate the contact police had with the dead man, Scotland Yard said.
Detectives believe they know the identity of the man and next of kin have been informed, but he has yet to be formally identified.
