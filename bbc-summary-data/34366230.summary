First-half goals from Lee Angol and Jon Taylor put the Posh ahead, but after the break headers from Byron Webster and Tony Craig saw Millwall level.
Quick-fire efforts from Chris Forrester and Conor Washington had Posh back in control before a Mark Beevers header gave the Lions a glimmer of hope.
Peterborough made sure of victory late on as Taylor rocketed in his second.

Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC London 94.9:
"I thought the game could have finished 9-8 either way, we scored three goals and could have easily scored eight or nine goals."
"Every ball they put in our box or shot they had goes in our net and I won't accept it."
"We defend as a team, we score goals as a team so we take collective responsibility, but defensively it wasn't good enough.
"I thought we were terrific at times with the ball, but I'm not prepared to have a team that's great going one way and not the other."
