Machetes, a knuckle duster and axes were recovered as part of a probe into the rival gangs, known as "Moorclose" and "Mandem" in west Cumbria.
Cumbria Police said it had "nipped the problem in the bud" but still needed help to arrest more suspects.
It set up Operation Rodeo to tackle the disorder in Workington and Whitehaven.
Forty-three people have been arrested, aged between 13 and 40, who are all going through the court system, police said.
Det Insp Dan St Quintin said: "The criminality our communities have experienced is totally unacceptable and police have nipped this in the bud.
"I would like to reassure the public that we have a team of dedicated detectives working full time to detect and prosecute anyone found committing criminal behaviour."
