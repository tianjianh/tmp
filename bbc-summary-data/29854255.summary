Patricia Anne Durrant: Man in fear of demons slashed partner's throat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man cut his partner's throat to save her from a "fate worse than death" because he thought demons were about to break into their home in Llandysul, Ceredigion, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Hamilton, 60, denied murder but admitted the manslaughter of Patricia Anne Durrant, 65, on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Swansea Crown Court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
The prosecution accepted his plea.
Hamilton has been detained under the Mental Health Act without a time limit set.
The court was told he had developed a "tremendous fear" that demons were about to break into their house and to kill him and Ms Durrant "in a particularly unpleasant way".
After delivering the fatal knife wounds, he then tried to take his own life.
The court was told that he had been receiving treatment for a mental illness in 2002, and responded well. But he had stopped taking medication and had lost contact with the mental health services, the court heard.
Huw Rees, prosecuting, explained how on 2 March neighbours had seen Ms Durrant, a seamstress, working at her sewing machine making a red dress.
It appeared she was killed very shortly afterwards, said Mr Rees.
The following morning Hamilton dialled 999 and a police officer found him sitting on the stairs covered in blood while in the kitchen there was "a scene like something out of a horror film".
Ms Durrant was dead, having suffered "catastrophic" injuries to her neck and with at least eight defence wounds across her arms.
Hamilton later told police he had approached Ms Durrant from behind as she sat on a chair in the kitchen killed her.
He said he believed demons were about to go on a killing spree.
After the killing, he stabbed himself in the neck and stomach and lay down next to Ms Durrant. He thought he was going to die but he awoke a short time later.
He said he spent the rest of the night "wondering what to do" before dialling 999.
Psychiatrist Dr Roger Thomas told the court he had "absolutely no doubt" that Hamilton suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, but since his arrest and subsequent treatment he had shown significant recovery.
Hamilton's barrister, Geraint Walters, said the killing of Ms Durrant had been "a tragedy that no-one saw coming".
Judge Keith Thomas said Hamilton had thought of leaving the property to escape the demons but that would have "left her unprotected and the entities would have got her and a fate worse than death".
