[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 2-2 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City slipped from the top of the Championship table after Fulham's Chris Martin scored a second-half equaliser against his former club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Dorrans put Norwich ahead from the spot after Scott Malone brought down Jacob Murphy in the area.
Malone gave away another penalty when he pulled Cameron Jerome down and Dorrans scored his second spot-kick.
Stefan Johansen deflected the ball home before Martin secured a point for Fulham with a superb solo finish.
The result meant Norwich dropped to second in the Championship behind Newcastle United, who earned a 2-0 win away at Barnsley.
Despite battling to win a point, Fulham slipped a place to 12th after Queens Park Rangers beat Bristol City.
The Canaries seemed to be in control after Dorrans' second penalty of the night, but the visitors were revived by a slice of luck when Martin shot at goal and the ball cannoned off Johansen and into the net.
Norwich have now not managed a clean sheet in their last five games, and have conceded in every match at Fulham since January 1986.
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "What did I say at half-time? Nothing special, be professional and work together. Look to score one goal and after we can score more.
"We made big mistakes but after we went 2-0 down it was a better performance. We were more solid and started to play good football.
"Today we conceded two penalties, against QPR we missed two penalties, in two other games we finished the game with 10 players - we make so many big mistakes.
"I am frustrated about many things but if the referee says it is a penalty, it is a penalty."
Norwich manager Alex Neil: "We lost concentration for 15 minutes and didn't defend well enough to absorb the pressure we were under.
"It's really frustrating because Fulham's tactics didn't change - we knew what we were up against. But the players are angry with themselves because they know how much it means.
"It doesn't matter as long as you are in and about the top at Christmas. You don't want anybody getting away from you."
