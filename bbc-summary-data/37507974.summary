[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kate Bush to release live album from 2014 show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Singer Kate Bush is to release a live recording of her Before the Dawn concert - with no post-show tinkering.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
According to her PR, "nothing on the record was re-recorded or overdubbed".
Bush performed 22 sold-out concerts at London's Hammersmith Apollo - her first live performances in 35 years - between 26 August and 1 October 2014.
The live album - attributed to "The KT Fellowship" rather than the 58-year-old alone - will be available on a 3-CD and 4-vinyl set on 25 November.
Divided into three acts, Bush's stage show combined renditions of such hits as Running Up That Hill with song cycles from her Hounds of Love and Aerial albums.
The album - released on Bush's Fish People label - includes Never Be Mine, a song that featured during rehearsals but was not included in the final show.
