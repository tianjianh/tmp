[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rail bridge in Swindon is being demolished and replaced while no trains are running on Christmas Day.

The work is expected to begin at about 05:00 GMT and continue for several hours, with "acoustic screening" provided to minimise noise.
Network Rail said it would be safer to work while nothing is running below.
Stratton Green bridge on Swindon Road is being upgraded as part of a major rail electrification programme between London and Cardiff.
It was shut in November and will remain closed until Spring while the bridge is raised to make room for the new electrification equipment.
Across the UK, some 20,000 rail workers will spend Christmas Day at work.
