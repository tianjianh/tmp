In July, the government's airports commission recommended the expansion of Heathrow to increase the UK's aviation capacity.
Sir Howard Davies's report said it would have to come with severe restrictions to reduce the environmental and noise effects.
The government is due to make a decision by Christmas.
The recommendation has been criticised by competing airport Gatwick which proposed a second runway and by London Mayor Boris Johnson who has argued for a whole new airport.
He said earlier at the Conservative Party Conference: "If we are going to build new airport capacity let's not bodge it with one runway in the wrong place in a short-termist, old, failed, tired and environmentally disastrous solution."
A Heathrow statement said expansion plans had been designed around the passenger, the environment and the local community.
"That's why it's supported and that's why it will create up to 180,000 jobs and Â£211bn in economic benefits for the UK economy," it said.
