Huddersfield Town fans to benefit from £100 season cards thanks to 2010 pledge

Thousands of Huddersfield fans will be able to watch the club's Premier League home games for just over £5 each thanks to a pledge made by the club's chairman seven years ago.

Dean Hoyle said in 2010 that fans who had held season cards during his time as chairman would pay £100 for the card if the club reached the top flight.
"Over 4,000 Town fans will receive mail from the club," a club statement said.
"This week, that pledge has been rolled out."
Huddersfield reached the top flight for the first time since 1972 by beating Reading on penalties in the Championship play-off final at Wembley last month.
Fans who qualified have the option to have a partial refund on their season card - which only cost £199 if bought by 6 April, a voucher worth £110 to spend in the club's shops, or donate their £99 refund to the Town Foundation charity, with Hoyle adding an extra £26 donation to top it up.
