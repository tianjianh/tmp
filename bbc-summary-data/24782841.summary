The Ivorian stabbed home from close range early on after a series of errors and doubled his tally by firing a pacey shot past Trevor Carson.
Pompey's Gavin Mahon was sent off for elbowing Filipe Morais before David Connolly's 71st minute tap-in gave the vocal visiting fans hope.
Joe Devera and Danny East both had late chances to level but Stevenage held on.

Portsmouth manager Guy Whittingham speaks to BBC Radio Solent:
"We're out of the FA Cup and that's very disappointing having been far the better side. I think everybody here would say that.
"We suffered to a couple of clinical finishes that they had in the first half and that's what you've got when you go a step up into a league above, but I think over the whole game we've created far more.
"I'm extremely proud (of the players). I think the energy levels were fantastic. We kept going at them, we wouldn't let them rest. I think to come here and do that against a Stevenage side that have picked up of late and show the spirit that we've shown and the bravery shown on the ball, very proud of the performance altogether.
"They had two clinical finishes in the first half that cost us goals, but apart from that I thought we played the much better football."
