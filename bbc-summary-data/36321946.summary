The grey Audi A4 failed to stop on the A1 near Catterick and sped north to Scotch Corner then back south on Tuesday, said North Yorkshire Police.
It weaved in and out of traffic and hit several other vehicles before it was stopped after being boxed in by police cars near Boston Spa, West Yorkshire.
A large quantity of cannabis was found and two people arrested, said police.
A man aged 31 and a woman aged 22, both from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, remain in police custody.
The girl is being looked after by social services, said police.

It was about 16:30 BST on Tuesday when officers started to follow the car and a police helicopter was involved in the pursuit.
Subsequent house searches also led to the recovery of more drugs and the investigation is ongoing, said police.
The force tweeted the picture of the car having come to a halt.
No one was hurt in the incident and police are appealing for witnesses.
