The event, known as The Worlds and staged at Glasgow Green, was won by Northern Ireland's Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band.
The runners up were Inverary and District Pipe Band and third place went to the St Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band from the Republic of Ireland.
The competition featured 300 performances and drew 30,000 people.
It is the fourth year in a row the Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band have won the title.
Based in Lisburn, County Antrim, the band was founded almost 70 years ago.
David Scott of the Pipe Band Association of Northern Ireland said Field Marshal Montgomery's latest success was a landmark.
"This is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the Premiership title in football.
"Field Marshal Montgomery have won their fourth consecutive title and their 10th world championship title."
He added it was a "big achievement for a pipe band from Northern Ireland to take on the world".
Ian Embelton, chief executive of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, said: "Every year we see pipers and drummers putting in thousands of hours of practise in a bid to set new standards for themselves and their bands and the people who have been here over the last two days have enjoyed some terrific competition."
Glasgow lord provost and chieftain of this year's competition, Sadie Docherty, said: "Glasgow has just played host to the best Commonwealth Games ever and now we've welcomed the world's best pipers and drummers for what has been a sensational championships.
"It's been an incredible summer marked by the people of Glasgow and their incredible warmth, humour and hospitality."
