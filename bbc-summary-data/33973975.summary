[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture (DARD) was hit with a £2m bill from HMRC because it did not pay vets' national insurance contributions.

DARD hires the services of private vets to test for tuberculosis in cattle.
The arrangement has been in place for years, and until April 2014, DARD officials believed they only had to pay the vets' fees and VAT.
However, HMRC has told them they should have also paid national insurance. It issued the £2m bill, backdated to 2009.
A DARD spokesperson told the BBC that department officials were still negotiating with HMRC on the matter but added that they have now paid the requested arrears "on account without prejudice" while the talks continue.
Ulster Unionist Robin Swann has accused DARD of making a "serious mistake" and said he was "shocked" when details of the £2m HMRC bill emerged during a recent meeting of Stormont's agriculture committee.
He is a member of the committee that holds the department and its minister, Michelle O'Neill, to account.
"This is money that the department can ill afford and it is also concerning that the minister had not highlighted this additional charge before now," the UUP MLA said.
"It is clear that a serious mistake has been made somewhere along the line in regards to what the department's obligations were in paying for the services of private vets."
Bovine TB is an infectious disease of cattle that affects about 6% of herds in Northern Ireland.
DARD runs an EU Commission-approved eradication programme focused on the detection of diseased or high risk animals and for years, it has been hiring private veterinary practitioners (PVPs) to carry out the TB tests.
"Until April 2014, DARD understood that it had a contract with PVPs to provide a service for which a fee and VAT was paid," a DARD spokesperson said in a statement.
"HMRC then advised DARD that, in its opinion, the PVPs are office holders under the department's legislation. This means that for some PVPs, (depending on employment status within the veterinary practice) DARD is also responsible for making national insurance contributions on fees paid.
"HMRC have claimed retrospective national insurance for these PVPS back to 2009 which, with interest, came to £2.01m.
"The department secured funds for the arrears in the 2014/15 year and it was paid 'on account without prejudice' to HMRC while the issue is still under discussion," the statement added.
