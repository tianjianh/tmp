The 20-year-old has been capped 21 times at various youth levels for England, including the Under-23 side.
"The plan was always to bring in another keeper to add competition," boss Willie Kirk told the club website.
"Sophie is an extremely hard-working goalkeeper, who is technically very good and has strong distribution."
