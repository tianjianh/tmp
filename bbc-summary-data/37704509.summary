The private chartered aircraft was travelling from Istanbul in Turkey when it was diverted to Budapest, Hungary.
A second plane was sent from Istanbul to pick the team up from Budapest and take them to Manchester.
The Turkish side play United at Old Trafford at 20:05 BST.
The club said on Twitter there was "nothing alarming" after the incident.
United tweeted in reply: "Wishing you a safe trip for the rest of your journey to Manchester. See you soon!"
Fenerbahce, who are ninth in Turkey's Super Lig, are top of Group A of the Europa League, a point ahead of third-placed United.
Fenerbahce's team includes former United striker Robin van Persie and ex-Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel.
