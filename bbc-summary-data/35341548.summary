Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said: "This case is another that has been launched by Operation Doublet, an investigation into Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) that arose following the 2011 investigation into CSE in Rochdale.
"To date, 83 people have been arrested, 15 have been interviewed under caution and prosecutions have been launched against 25 people.
"The sexual exploitation of children and young people is the absolute priority for Greater Manchester Police and its partners."
