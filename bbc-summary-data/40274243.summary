[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lost street names in Swansea could be reintroduced as part of Â£500m plans to regenerate the city centre.

Historical names dating back to Victorian times, like Wassail Street, Orange Street and Frog Street, could be brought back by the council.
The proposed changes form part of its plans to redevelop the St David's site - with the first phase of regeneration approved last week.
The council said it would put "heritage at the heart" of the development.
New street names recognising people who have made "an outstanding contribution" to Swansea would also be considered.
Council leader Rob Stewart said: "Our plans for the development site will transform the city centre's retail, entertainment, leisure and recreational offer, create jobs for local people and benefit our existing businesses through significantly increased footfall and spending.
"But while looking to the future, we're also very mindful of Swansea's history, which is why heritage and architectural studies formed part of the outline planning application that's now been approved."
