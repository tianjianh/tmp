[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people who were travelling on the microlight are feared to have died.
The Ikarus C42  disappeared after leaving City of Derry Airport for Scotland on Thursday.
Wreckage, including the tail fin, was discovered by a Dublin couple who were on holiday in their yacht, 1km off the coast.
The search was called off on Friday night due to poor visibility, but has now resumed.
Insp Michael McDonnell said: "PSNI are co-ordinating the operation to recover the missing microlight aircraft from the sea off Glenarm.
"PSNI officers and members of a community search and rescue team are involved in the operation."
