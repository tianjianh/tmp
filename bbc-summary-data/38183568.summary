The 29-year-old Belgium international, whose old deal ran until 2018, has made 179 appearances for the Premier League club since his 2012 move from Ajax.
"It's a big relief. The future looks great so I'm very happy to be a part of it," he said.
"This is an unbelievable group of talent. There's a great buzz around Tottenham."
Vertonghen's new deal comes a day after striker Harry Kane signed a contract until 2022.
