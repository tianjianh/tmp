A Swansea pensioner has joined a gym, working out three times a week, in a pledge to reach his 100th birthday.

George Evans, 92, signed up on the advice of a young neighbour who saw him using bricks as weights outside his home in Skewen.
Mr Evans, a widower, has attributed his long life and fitness to never smoking, hardly drinking and good eating.
"My instructor can't get over it. They say I'm marvellous and they don't know how I can do it," he said.
"Most of my friends are either dead or walking around on sticks, so I must be doing something right."
He added: "Hopefully I will still be going when I'm 100. I will aim for that anyway."
