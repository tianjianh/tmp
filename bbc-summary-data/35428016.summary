The 23-year striker has been prolific for the second-tier title challengers, amassing 74 goals since the start of last season.
McLellan played in the Blues and Preston North End youth teams before joining Portadown in 2012.
A spell with Ballymena United was followed by his switch to the Welders in 2014.
McLellan will provide competition in the Blues attack for Andrew Waterworth, Paul Smyth and Guy Bates.
He is the second transfer window arrival at Windsor Park following the loan signing of Swansea City winger Stephen Fallon.
"I am delighted that Michael has chosen to join Linfield as there were a few other clubs interested in him," said Linfield manager David Healy.
"I have seen him play and am encouraged by what he wants to achieve, while the scouts also speak very highly of him," Healy told the Linfield FC website.
