African champions Mazembe also won the prestigious annual fixture between the winners of the Champions League and the Confederation Cup in 2010 and 2011.
Etoile, who won the 2015 Confederation Cup, have also won the competition twice.
Ghanaian striker Daniel Nii Adjei scored twice to set up Mazembe's win.
He opened the scoring for Mazembe after 20 minutes when he powered his header off a Jean Kasusula cross from the left beyond goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi.
27-year-old Adjei doubled his tally in the 45th minute, when he acrobatically finished off a lovely attack after he was set up by strike partner Jonathan Bolingi.
The Tunisian 'Red Devils' pulled a goal back in first half stoppage time through Mohamed Msekni, who stabbed home from inside the box after a goalmouth scramble.
In a game played under hot and humid conditions, Msekni led Etoile to chase the game after Mazembe took the lead when he fired wide from the top of the box.
Tunisia international striker Ahmed Akaichi also came close minutes earlier, but Ivory Coast international goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo combined with his defenders to concede the first corner of the encounter.
In the 42nd minute, Bolingi saw his shot from outside the box narrowly miss the target.
Mazembe's towering central defender Salif Coulibaly crashed his header into the side netting in the 58th minute as his team piled on the pressure to increase their lead.
The African champions continued to fight to extend their advantage, bringing on Most Valuable Player from the recent African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda, Meschack Elia, to add some firepower to the attack.
In the 76th minute, goalkeeper Gbohouo produced the save of the day when he dived to block a goal-bound header by Alaya Brigui.
Mazembe held on to record another international triumph in front of their jubilant home fans.
