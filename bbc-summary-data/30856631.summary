[SN]TITLE[SN]
Five bids made to save Perth City Hall from demolition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five bids for the redevelopment of Perth City Hall have been submitted to the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council had previously voted to demolish the listed building to make way for a new city square.
However councillors agreed to market a 125-year lease for the former concert hall to settle whether a realistic alternative exists.
With the closing date for applications now past, the five proposals received will be evaluated.
The authority has taken on independent commercial property expert Jones Lang Lasalle to establish whether any of the bids set out a credible and financially deliverable business case for the redevelopment of the hall.
The building has sat empty since the opening of Perth's new city concert hall opened in 2005.
Proposals previously mooted for the building include converting it into a luxury hotel or a food hall.
