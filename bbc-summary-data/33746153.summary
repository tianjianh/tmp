Police have identified what they believe to be a "mortar-type device" during a security alert in Strabane, County Tyrone.

A PSNI spokesperson said the device was now being examined and made safe but the operation would take some time.
Searches began overnight after reports that a device had been left in the Townsend Street/Cemetery Road area.
A number of elderly people have had to leave their homes and a graveyard has been closed for most of the day.
Officers had issued a public warning at 02:50 BST on Saturday, advising the public that the area was being searched and asking people not to touch any suspicious objects but to call police immediately.
The day-long security operation caused significant disruption for local residents.
In a statement on Saturday evening, the PSNI's district commander said: "We would like to thank the local people who have been inconvenienced by this operation for their patience and understanding and we are working to get them back into their homes as soon as possible.
"The blame for the disruption, however, rests with those individuals or groups who appear determined to pursue an agenda of violence and destruction which can only be to the detriment to all in our community," Supt Mark McEwan added.
"I would continue to appeal to everyone to work with us to reduce the threat these people pose and to keep people safe."
Earlier, local resident Deirdre Harkin told BBC Radio Ulster she was "disgusted" at claims that a device had been left near a cemetery.
"A place so sacred - my own mother and father are in that graveyard and I think it just should be an area that is respected," she said.
"Throughout all the Troubles, that graveyard has never been touched and I would hate to think that now somebody would think it's a good idea to plant something in it."
The Townsend Street resident said her elderly neighbours had been worst affected by the disruption.
"An 83-year-old woman had to get out of her house today, which just wasn't on.  She lives alone and she was quite frightened.  Her daughter-in-law had to come and get her."
Ms Harkin said another elderly neighbour, who is sick, had to take shelter in a nearby church building while the police searches took place.
She said the local priest has opened St Patrick's parish hall to accommodate the affected residents.
