'Opportunities' available for UK fishermen after Brexit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huge opportunities could be available to UK fisherman following Brexit, according to a Scottish fishing leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) wants control of waters in the UK's Exclusive Economic Zone to be returned to Britain after Brexit.
Research by the North Atlantic Fisheries College said only 42% of fish caught in these waters between 2012 and 2014 were caught by British fishermen.
The other 650,000 tonnes was caught by vessels from elsewhere in the EU.
SFF chief executive Bertie Armstrong said there was yet to be any negotiation over control of the waters and it was a matter of historic rights which would undoubtedly lead to arguments with other nations.
Mr Armstrong said: "The UK and Scottish governments must take heed of the startling figures contained within this report and work together as a team to ensure that the best possible deal is reached for our hardworking fishermen.
"It would be a monumental betrayal of our coastal communities if this opportunity was traded away in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations."
