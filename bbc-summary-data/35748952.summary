David Ungi, 24, is accused of killing Vinny Waddington, 18, in July 2015.
The teenager was found with gunshot wounds following a crash between a car and a scrambler bike in Banks Road.
Suspects from Liverpool, London, Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham are also wanted. Several were involved in drugs-related offences.
Merseyside Police said David Ungi is the son of David Ungi Senior, who was killed in a notorious gangland shooting in the Toxteth area of Liverpool in 1995. The killing prompted a spate of other shootings in the city.
Also on the list of suspects, drawn up by the National Crime Agency and Crimestoppers, is alleged murderer Shane O'Brien, 28.
He is accused of killing Josh Hanson in front of his girlfriend in the RE Bar in Hillingdon, west London, in October 2015.
A Â£10,000 reward is on offer for information leading to his arrest and conviction.
Officers are also looking for Shazad Ghafoor, 29, who allegedly stole a car from a Land Rover dealership in Manchester in August 2013 using a false name, sparking a high-speed police chase with his wife and children in the car.
The pursuit ended with him rolling the car in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before police found up to Â£100,000 in cash in the vehicle.
He is accused of a string of offences for the chase, and supplying cannabis.
David Walley, 40, is alleged to have smuggled MDMA and cocaine into the UK in parcels delivered to Manchester.
Ahmed Dervish Omer, 45, from Nottingham, is wanted after fleeing in the middle of his trial for drugs offences in November last year. He was found guilty in his absence and sentenced to 10 years.
The remaining suspects are Michael Moogan and Robert Gerrard, both 52 and from Liverpool, who are accused of being part of an international drug trafficking ring; and Mark Liscott, 55, from Birmingham, who is wanted for allegedly dealing drugs while out on licence for a jail term for dealing cannabis.
Convicted rapist Rezgar Zengana, 33, is also on the list for posing as a minicab driver in Glasgow in 2006, and picking up a 25-year-old woman who he attacked. He was convicted for rape but has yet to be sentenced.
There were 904 arrests under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) between 2009 and 2015, data from the National Crime Agency reveals.
Spain accounted for the most arrests overall in that period, 245 in total, with 49 in 2014-15.
The Netherlands saw 129 arrests of people wanted by the UK since 2009.
The most common reason for arrest was drugs trafficking, with 154 for such offences.
The Metropolitan Police, the biggest force in the UK, made the most arrests abroad under the EAW in 2014-15, with 16 out of 161 arrests that year.
Dave Allen, from the NCA, said: "Those who believe they can use the Netherlands to evade capture or continue illegal activities soon find out that it is not a safe haven."
