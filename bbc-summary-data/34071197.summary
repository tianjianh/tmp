[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The PSNI chief constable has said it is "unacceptable" that some families of those killed on Bloody Sunday have not heard from the investigation in over a year.

George Hamilton was speaking at an event in Londonderry called Uncomfortable Conversations.
During the event, Mr Hamilton was challenged by Kate Nash, the sister of one of those killed on Bloody Sunday.
He said he would raise the matter immediately.
Mr Hamilton said it was "unacceptable" they had not been given an update on the status of the Bloody Sunday investigation.
"What I heard tonight was families who appear not to have been communicated with. I don't doubt their honesty around that and I'm disappointed that they're not as up to date as I am.
"I have agreed to look at that, to review the communication between the investigation team and the family and the investigation team will be in touch.
"We'll make sure that the families are up to date with the progress or lack of it."
Kate Nash, whose brother died after soldiers opened fire on civil rights marchers in Londonderry in 1972, said she would be happy to hear an update.
"I don't need to have a private conversation, I think what George Hamilton should be doing is coming to meet the families en masse. All we need is justice."
Most of the team investigating Bloody Sunday was laid off last year because of budget cuts.
Police resumed their investigation into the killings in January. The unit was set up to replace the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).
