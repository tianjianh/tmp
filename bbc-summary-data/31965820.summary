Pharrell Williams: Everything is inspired by something

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pharrell Williams is warning that the entertainment industry could become "stifled" after the Blurred Lines copyright lawsuit.

In his first interview since being sued by Marvin Gaye's family, Pharrell said it could mean other musicians face similar legal action.
"The verdict handicaps any creator out there who's making something that might be inspired by something else," he says.
"This applies to fashion... anything."
He continues: "If we lose our freedom to be inspired we're going to look up one day and the entertainment industry as we know it will be frozen in litigation.
"This is about protecting the intellectual rights of people who have ideas."
Last week a court in LA ordered Pharrell, and Robin Thicke, to pay $7.3m (Â£4.8m) in damages to the family of late soul singer Marvin Gaye.
The judge agreed with the family's claim Gaye's Got To Give It Up was copied by the pair's Blurred Lines hit.
"Everything that's around you in a room was inspired by something or someone. If you kill that, there's no creativity," Pharrell told the Financial Times.
He says he and Robin Thicke are considering their "next steps", but didn't say whether they'll appeal against the verdict.
Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013, selling millions of copies worldwide.
