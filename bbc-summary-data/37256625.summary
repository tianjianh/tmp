Caroline Glachan, 14, was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996. The killer has never been found.
Her mother, Margaret McKeich, will feature on the Crimewatch appeal, which is due to be broadcast on Monday night.
Det Supt Jim Kerr will be in the studio in a bid to generate fresh leads.
Last week, the detective appeared at a news conference with Mrs McKeich and Caroline's friend, Joanne Menzies, who was one of the last people to have seen her alive.
In a clip released by the BBC ahead of the Crimewatch broadcast, Mrs McKeich said: "I looked out the window and there was a police officer with a police woman and I knew. I just knew. I got this unbelievable pain, which I can still feel, just a pain in my heart. I just knew it was her.
"They came up and they asked about her and the clothing that she had on. I told them and they said that they believed that it was her but they would have to identify her.
"Of course by this time it is my birthday so life didn't begin at 40. For me, it basically ended."
Mrs McKeich, 60, said she believes locals know who is responsible for her daughter's death and appealed for them to contact detectives.
She said: "I would urge anybody to come forward, just to give me that peace and to give me closure.
"There's two questions I need answered - who and why."
Caroline, from Bonhill, was heading to meet her boyfriend in Renton, having spent an evening with friends, and took a short cut from shops along Dillichip Loan towards The Towpath and the Black Bridge.
On the Crimewatch programme, her friend Ms Menzies returned to the area where they parted for the final time.
Urging those with information to come forward, she said: "Caroline was only a child, she was only 14.
"These people should now stand up and actually finally be counted as a human being and not hiding a sickening secret."
Police Scotland's Homicide Governance and Review team have begun a fresh investigation and forensic scientists are re-examining more than 300 items collected at the time of Caroline's death.
Speaking at last week's press conference, Det Supt Jim Kerr appealed to the local community to break the "wall of silence" surrounding Caroline's murder.
He also urged a man in a hooded top, who was seen near where Caroline's body was found, to come forward.
"There's people in this community that know exactly happened. I feel as if it's a black cloud over Renton and Bonhill and we need to get it lifted," he said.
