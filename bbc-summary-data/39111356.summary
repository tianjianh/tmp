[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham City v Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City remain without Clayton Donaldson and Michael Morrison for the visit of Wigan Athletic to St Andrew's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donaldson is back in training following a lengthy lay-off with a heel injury which has kept him out for the whole of Gianfranco Zola's 16 games in charge.
Wigan have lost Sam Morsy, who starts a two-game ban after being booked for the 10th time this season at Blackburn.
They are also waiting form a verdict on the severity of fellow midfielder Shaun MacDonald's knee injury.
MacDonald went off early at Ewood Park, but the Latics are hopeful he has not suffered ligament damage.
Boss Warren Joyce could be back in the Wigan dug-out having watched from the stand on Saturday after undergoing minor surgery.
