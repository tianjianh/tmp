[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 0-1 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul McShane's late winner for Reading consigned Rotherham to a seventh straight defeat as Kenny Jackett lost his first game in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McShane finished well after Lee Camp kept out Roy Beeren's shot.
Jackett, who replaced Alan Stubbs on Friday, saw his side start well, as Richard Wood's close-range header was superbly saved by Ali Al-Habsi.
Camp saved Garath McCleary's penalty and John Swift's shot hit the bar as Reading finished strongly.
The Royals, who were without a win at Rotherham since September 2000, had 80% of possession in the first half without mustering a shot on target.
Rotherham have conceded more goals than any other Football League side, 33 in 14 matches, but they carried the greater goal threat for the first hour with Al-Habsi denying Danny Ward when clean through.
The Millers remain five points adrift of Wigan at the foot of the table, while Reading's first win in five moved them up to eighth.
Rotherham manager Kenny Jackett:
"I felt the work-rate, effort and commitment of the players was very good. We went toe-to-toe with Reading. We had a good number of chances and were a threat from set-pieces. We couldn't convert them.
"We are disappointed to lose the game, but the players have to keep up that effort, work-rate and attitude, and not get too disappointed.
"There is a lot today we did well as a group. There is enough of the season to get things going.
"Yes, I definitely feel I can keep them up. Taking six points out of 39 takes its toll on players. But they can't be disappointed."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"It is a good way to bounce back. You want to win every game, (but) we knew it was going to be very hard, with their new manager with a different style of play.
"In the chances that we created we should have at least scored one. It was a very difficult game, they made it difficult in how they played.
"They played very direct, got balls into the box because they know we are not the most physical side. That is how certain teams need to play against us.
"They made it difficult for us, Ali Al-Habsi made some very good saves for us. We created some very good chances in the second half, we should have scored more than one."
