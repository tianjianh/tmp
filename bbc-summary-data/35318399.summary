Sheffield off-centre road markings to be repainted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Off-centre road markings on a Sheffield street are to be repainted following a petition from residents claiming they were dangerous.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lines on Sandygate Road were painted last year after the road was resurfaced.
Sheffield City Council said the lines were introduced for safety reasons, including improving the safety of cyclists riding up the hill.
The authority said the lines would be changed "as soon as possible".
In a statement, Labour councillor Tony Downing said: "Following the introduction of the new road markings last autumn, we listened to comments made by the public and agreed to carry out a Road Safety Audit on this part of the scheme instead of waiting until June when the whole scheme for the zone has been completed.
"The audit recommended that the central road markings should be restored.  There were issues mainly around vehicles parked on the downhill section of the road, visibility and the increased likelihood of opposing vehicles coming into conflict."
Marie Biggs, who ran the campaign to have the lines re-painted, said she was "very pleased".
She said: "If it's not broken then why fix it? It worked perfectly well with the lines in the middle all the years that I've lived here, so why change it?"
