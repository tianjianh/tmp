Interest-only mortgage numbers falling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of outstanding interest-only mortgages is falling but more work is needed to ensure people are not left unable to pay, a lenders' group says.

Interest-only deals mean borrowers pay the interest on the loan, then pay the capital when the mortgage term ends.
At the end of 2014, there were about 2.4 million outstanding home loans of this type, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said.
This was 460,000 fewer compared with a year earlier.
About a quarter of these had come to the end of their term, but others have seen borrowers moving on to "safer" deals.
However, at the end of the year, a total of 16,000 loans had matured but not been repaid. The CML said that in many cases homeowners would be in the process of paying the lump sum, so not all would be in difficulty.
Earlier this month, Citizens Advice warned that 934,000 owners on interest-only deals did not have a plan for how to pay back the money at the end of the mortgage term.
Banks and building societies have been told by regulators to write to their customers to warn them that they could be in financial danger.
The first sizeable wave of repayment problems is expected to appear in 2017-18, when endowment mortgages sold in the 1990s reach their peak period of maturing.
A decade later, in 2027-28, the surge in interest-only mortgages taken out from the early 2000s reaches a high point. The final peak comes in 2032 when the wild lending to people who could barely afford the interest, just before the credit crunch, has to be dealt with.
In some cases those facing difficulty have converted interest-only mortgages into Lifetime Mortgages, which allow borrowers to stay in their homes though retirement, paying interest if they can. The debt is paid off when they die or have to move out.
The CML said that progress was being made in preparing people for a potential financial hit.
"The continued decline in interest-only mortgages outstanding confirms our perception that many borrowers are firmly on top of this issue, and successfully making plans to manage their loans to ensure they are not faced with a payment shortfall at maturity," said Paul Smee, CML director general.
"As an industry, we clearly still have work to do to trigger more borrowers to respond to their lenders' attempts to understand their intentions and help them plan ahead for the maturity of their loans."
Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: "There is no great surprise at the decline in number of interest-only mortgages.
"The changes made by many lenders were draconian, with some of the biggest banks scrapping interest-only in the wake of the financial crisis in an effort to deliver immediate change to the business mix."
