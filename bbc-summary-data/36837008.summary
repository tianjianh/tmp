The woman had withdrawn her pension from a bank in Altrincham on Monday before heading into the Iceland store.
While shopping she was approached by a woman who grabbed her trolley and demanded her money.
Not willing to give up without a fight, however, the octogenarian hit the woman over the head with the bacon before the would-be thief fled empty-handed.
Greater Manchester Police said while the 86-year-old was "safe and well", she was "shook up about the incident".
Update 20 July 2016: A video of the incident obtained by Altrincham Today and released later revealed the incident was less dramatic than previously reported by Greater Manchester Police.
