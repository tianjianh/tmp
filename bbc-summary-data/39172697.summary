[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham manager Dean Keates has confirmed defender Mitchell Lund will return to League Two side Doncaster Rovers when his loan deal expires.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lund joined the National League side on a month's loan in February and has played in four games for the Dragons.
The 20-year-old was an unused substitute in Wrexham's 2-1 win at Braintree Town on Saturday.
"I think it's a case of having a look at our own players now going forward" Keates said.
"We're grateful with what he's done. He's come in, got some minutes, and he can go back to Doncaster now and play a part in their promotion push."
Wrexham came from behind to beat Braintree and claim consecutive away wins for the first time this season.
Keates' side are 10th in the National League and eight points off the play-off places with 10 games remaining.
