Glasgow has lowest life expectancy in UK, figures suggest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow has the lowest life expectancy of any area in the UK, official figures have suggested.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2015, the city recorded 1,448 deaths per 100,000 of population, according to the Office for National Statistics.
That figure is 56% higher than neighbouring East Dunbartonshire, which had 926 deaths per 100,000.
Scotland as a whole had the poorest life expectancy of any of the UK nations - 1,177 per 100,000, compared to England's rate of 989.6.
Mortality rates for men in Glasgow stood at 1,787, while West Dunbartonshire had the poorest life expectancy for women with a figure of 1,246 per 100,000.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said: "The substantial variation in mortality rates between different local areas reflects underlying differences in factors such as income deprivation, socio-economic position and health behaviour."
The figures were in line with other publications which have shown wide differences between local authority areas.
But National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures covering 2011-13 suggested that both men and women were living longer.
Those figures said life expectancy was 76.8 years for men and 80.9 years for women.
