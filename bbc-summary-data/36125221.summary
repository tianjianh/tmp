Sofiane Feghouli's Valencia career hangs in the balance despite the club lifting the Algerian winger's suspension amid reports he refused to take part in a warm-down after his team's league match two weeks ago.

Feghouli, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has not featured for Valencia since coming on as a substitute during their 2-1 win over Sevilla on 10 April.
He returned to first-team training on Wednesday, but was omitted from their squad for the game against Getafe.
I do not know if he [Sofiane Feghouli] will ever wear the Valencia shirt again
"I do not know if he [Sofiane Feghouli] will ever wear the Valencia shirt again," Valencia coach Pako Ayestaran told the Spanish media ahead of Sunday's game.
"It depends on the day to day and what the team needs."
Voted the best African player in La Liga last year, Feghouli joined Valencia in May 2010 from French side Grenoble Foot 38, but was sent on loan to UD Almeria, returning after they were relegated at the end of the season.
Since then, the Algeria international has been a regular starter and an important player for Valencia.
Feghouli, a former French youth international who scored on his Algeria debut in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifying win over Gambia in February 2012, has made 39 appearances for his country, scoring 11 goals.
He played for the Desert Foxes at the 2013 and 2015 Africa Cup of Nations tournaments as well as the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
