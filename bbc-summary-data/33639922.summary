The Frenchman, 25, died on Friday from severe head injuries suffered in last year's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka.
Brazilian Massa suffered a fractured skull during qualifying in Hungary in 2009 after a spring hit his helmet.
"I don't think anything changes. When you close your visor, you want to be the best," said the Williams driver.
"I had my accident and when I pass that place I don't remember it.
"I don't ever think 'I have a mother or father or son or wife'. You just think about your job."
Bianchi had been in a coma since crashing his Marussia into a recovery vehicle at last October's rain-hit race.
Massa, who says he expects to stay with Williams in 2016, is "not completely against" closed cockpits in Formula 1 "if it's best for everyone and doesn't change the aspect" of the sport.
The 34-year-old, who attended Bianchi's funeral in Nice on Tuesday, said he would "have Jules on my mind all the time" when he is not racing in Hungary.
He added: "It was so difficult to be there in church. It was so sad but I am sure he is in a good place now and looking here at all of us."
