The boy was given a 12-month referral order at Dolgellau Youth Court earlier this month after he admitted attacking the girl of the same age in 2012.
Gwynedd council said its review will see if there are "lessons to be learnt" now the legal process has concluded.
The boy will be on the sex offenders list for 30 months.
A Gwynedd council spokesperson said: "As soon as this serious allegation was brought to our attention the matter was immediately referred to North Wales Police for investigation.
"Now that the legal process has been concluded, we will be working with North Wales Police and other relevant partners to carry out a detailed review of the incident to identify whether there are any lessons to be learnt."
He said safeguarding the welfare of the county's children was a "key priority" and when an allegation that a young person may have been the victim of a crime is received, the authority has detailed processes in place in accordance with child protection procedures.
