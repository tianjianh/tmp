Jerome Valcke: Sacked Fifa general-secretary's football ban cut to 10 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifa's former secretary-general Jerome Valcke has had his ban from all football-related activity cut from 12 to 10 years on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Valcke, 55, was fired in January over allegations of misconduct over World Cup tickets sales and TV deals.
Other acts of potential misconduct arose during the inquiry concerning travel expenses and regulations.
Fifa's appeals committee ruled its own ethics judges were too severe with Valcke over the World Cup TV rights.
The appeals panel ruled that "mitigating factors had not been fully assessed" by the original hearing in regard to the sale of Caribbean TV rights to Fifa events.
Valcke, who is the subject of a separate criminal investigation by Swiss prosecutors over alleged "various acts of criminal mismanagement", can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
