A five-figure sum of money was taken by two men who threatened G4S security staff with weapons inside Santander on West Princes Street, Helensburgh.
The cash transfer robbery happened at about 00:30 on Wednesday.
Police want to trace people who were in the public car park in Sinclair Street between 00:00 and 01:00.
Det Insp Douglas Wilson, who is leading the investigation, said: "We understand now that there were a number of people in the public car park in Sinclair Street around the time of the incident, which is just off West Princes Street where the attack took place.
"I would like to appeal to those people who were in the area between 12 midnight and 1am as they may have information which could assist with our inquiries.
"No matter how insignificant it may seem, please contact us with any information you have. Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the areas of West Princes Street or Sinclair Street, and similarly did you see any vehicles nearby acting suspiciously?"
The suspects are described as being of medium height, of medium build and were wearing blue overalls at the time of the robbery.
