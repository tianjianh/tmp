Roger Federer says his desire for more titles can only be helped by a four-set defeat to Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final.

The Swiss 17-time Grand Slam winner missed the chance to win a record eighth Wimbledon and has not won a major since beating Andy Murray at the All England Club in 2012.
"For me a finalist's trophy is not the same," the 33-year-old said.
"I am still very hungry and motivated and a match like this is very helpful."
Federer, who was bidding to become the oldest Wimbledon champion in the professional era, has won only one of the last 22 Grand Slam events.

After losing to Djokovic in five sets at Wimbledon last year, Federer again found the world number one too tough as he lost 7-6 (7-1) 6-7 (10-12) 6-4 6-3.
"I lost against the world No. 1 at the moment," he said. "That's the kind of guy you probably can lose against. I'm not going to accept it and say it's normal. It's not.
"But I've beaten him a few times. I'm one of the few guys that's gotten a chance. I think I was able to show that on the court today.
"I'm right there. My game is good. I played on my terms. Things are all right."
The world number two, who beat Andy Murray in straight sets in Friday's semi-final, turns 34 before the US Open starts in August.
Serb Djokovic, 28, will be looking to add a 10th Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows and said after his win he is hoping to be fighting for many more titles.
"He's clearly making a big name for himself, having won as many times now as he has in these different slams," Federer said.
"Staying injury-free now for him is crucial. Clearly he's going to be one of the top guys.
"Where, we'll still have to wait and see. I'm sure he still has many more great years ahead of him."
