Callum Paterson - the subject of interest from Wigan Athletic - nodded the visitors ahead from Sam Nicholson's first-half corner.
Thistle levelled after the break when Liam Lindsay's header crossed the line after hitting the bar.
But, with time running out, striker Watt lashed a shot into the net from a tight angle.
English clubs have already determined that Hearts' right-back Paterson is ready to move south - it is only differing opinions about his value that have prevented a move so far.
Wigan may eventually raise their bid from the Â£700,000 rejected last week, but it is clear why Hearts are looking for more.
Physically strong, a powerful runner and commanding in the air, Paterson's goal from Nicholson's corner was an emphatic header.
He also plays an important role in Hearts' style. The team's shape is asymmetric, with Arnaud Djoum tucking in from right midfield and Nicholson playing wide on the left, requiring Paterson to provide width on the right flank, which he covers tirelessly.
If the Scotland cap leaves this window, Hearts will sorely miss him.
There was much to admire about both teams - their organisation, energy and ability to move the ball swiftly in crisp passages of play or directly. The coaching work of Alan Archibald and Robbie Neilson was evident, but personalities still shone through.
Watt carries the ball deftly and has vision and clever instincts. Those qualities are all matched in Thistle's Chris Erskine, whose jinking, skilful runs were a feature throughout.
He almost made a goal for Ade Azeez in the first half and it was his wing play that led to the corner that delivered Thistle's equaliser. Erskine took the set piece, too, swinging the ball in for Lindsay to score with a header off the underside of the bar.
Sometimes managers can just allow individual ability to shine and Hearts were rewarded for leaving Watt on when he struck the winner.
Neilson's starting line-up contained eight players who were called up for international duty last week, but it was the talent on their bench that set them apart.
The Hearts head coach was able to bring on Bjorn Johnsen and Jamie Walker in the second half and, after Partick Thistle equalised, the visitors stepped up their tempo and pressure.
That paid off in the end, but under different circumstances they might have brought on club captain Alim Ozturk, experienced midfielder Prince Buaben, young defender Liam Smith or attacker Robbie Muirhead.
What Archibald would have given for those options.
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "It was a sore one to take, but I thought we defended well in the second half and limited Hearts' chances. We were very unlucky with the outcome.
"Our front four all did really well when we got the ball to them. They made things happen. I was going to take Chris [Erskine] off, but I thought he maybe had a goal in him or an assist late on.
"If the window shuts [without making signings], it's not the end of the world, because there are still good players out there. But I'd like to get at least one in before then."
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: "We brought on [Jamie] Walker and Bjorn [Johnsen] to give us a lift, because we had an idea of the scores from other games.
"[Strength in depth] is a huge advantage for us. So to have the option of changing it during the match like we did makes a huge difference.
"You saw the quality of Tony Watt at the end. That's the reason we kept him on.
"I wanted to give Tony that opportunity because I knew he would create something. His finish was top drawer."
