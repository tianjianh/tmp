Through the "Tradewatch" scheme, second-hand retailers will alert each other and police when they suspect someone is handling stolen goods.
The police said thieves often try to sell stolen goods for profit through second hand and antique shops.
Under the new agreement, shops will instantly and readily share information on any suspicious customers.
Shopkeepers will also be provided with a smartwater technology lamp, which will help them establish whether the goods have been stolen.
The police said tackling housebreaking and robbery was a priority in Edinburgh.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Houston, of Police Scotland, said: "Those responsible for acquisitive crime will often attempt to sell on stolen goods for profit and regularly attempt to utilise second-hand retailers to dispose of valuable items.
"However, we have an excellent and long-standing relationship with these businesses in Edinburgh and staff regularly assist our search and recovery team in reuniting stolen property with its rightful owner as well as helping us identify those responsible for the thefts.
"With the launch of 'Tradewatch', these premises will instantly and readily share information on any suspicious customers so that items that have been acquired illegally are not bought and sold within their stores."
