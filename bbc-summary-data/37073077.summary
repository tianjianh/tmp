The new Premier League season began with a shock defeat for champions Leicester before new Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola made a winning start in the English top flight.

There were wins for West Brom and Swansea, while the three other opening-day games all ended in 1-1 draws.
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool start their campaigns on Sunday, with Chelsea playing on Monday.
In Scotland, Rangers earned their first Premiership win of the new season.
Ninety days after the curtain came down on a season full of surprises and drama, the English top flight returned.
Led by the arrival of former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach Guardiola, there are new faces in the dugout, on the pitch and some new rules to grasp.
The Spaniard, 45, watched his City side nick a late win 2-1 against Sunderland as just 14 goals were scored in seven matches on the opening day.
Other than City's £47.5m defender John Stones, none of the biggest-money signings were in action.
Arsenal's £35m enforcer Granit Xhaka and Liverpool's £34m forward Sadio Mane could make their debuts on Sunday. Meanwhile Manchester United's record £89m midfielder Paul Pogba will not feature because he is suspended.
The most significant rule change sees red cards being issued to players who confront match officials. It was noticeable that none of the Hull City's players surrounded referee Mike Dean when Leicester were awarded a contentious penalty in the opening game.
Hull 2-1 Leicester
Burnley 0-1 Swansea
Crystal Palace 0-1 West Brom
Everton 1-1 Tottenham
Middlesbrough 1-1 Stoke
Southampton 1-1 Watford
Man City 2-1 Sunderland
United, crowned English champions on a record 20 occasions, go to Bournemouth as new manager Jose Mourinho looks to guide them to a first title since 2013.
Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, who finished as runners-up behind Leicester last season, host Liverpool at Emirates Stadium.
Chelsea also have a new manager in the shape of former Italy coach Antonio Conte as they aim to improve on a disappointing 10th-place finish last term.
The four-time Premier League champions host London rivals West Ham on Monday.
Rangers, who have won a record 54 Scottish titles, are back in the top flight after a four-year absence following financial trouble.
After drawing 1-1 in their opener, first-half goals from Harry Forrester and Kenny Miller earned their first league win of the season at Dundee.
In the English Championship, relegated Newcastle United, managed by former Real Madrid, Liverpool and Chelsea boss Rafael Benitez, continued their losing start with a second successive league defeat, while Aston Villa clinched their first win in more than six months in their first season outside the top flight since 1987.
Benitez watched his Newcastle side lose 2-1 against Huddersfield Town in front of 52,079 supporters at St James' Park.
