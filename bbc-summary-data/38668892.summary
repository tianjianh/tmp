The 21-year-old has made two senior first-team appearances so far for QPR.
He has also previously had loan spells at Accrington and Morecambe.
"With Kelle Roos having been recalled by Derby and Steve Mildenhall still injured, it was important we recruited a keeper to provide competition and cover," said manager Darrell Clarke.
