The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard Paul-Iulian Dicu "panicked" after discovering the patient at Hassingham House Care Centre in May 2016.
The NMC conduct panel heard that by the time paramedics arrived at the home in Hingham, Norfolk, after 45 minutes, the patient was dead but "still warm".
Mr Dicu, who admitted two failings, was given a three-year caution by the NMC.

He was accused of failing to call 999 and failing to administer CPR.
The panel heard he should have followed the care home's "death of a resident" and "basic life support" policies which included attempting to revive the patient and calling 999 immediately.
Instead, Mr Dicu phoned the care home manager, the resident's next of kin and the NHS's 111 service.
It was after telling other staff about the resident that the emergency services were called to the care home.
Ioana Balan, representing Mr Dicu, said he had "panicked" on finding the patient and could not remember what he "needed to do".
She said he "fully acknowledged" his actions "represented a failure to follow the correct procedures".
The NMC said Mr Dicu continues to work at the 44-bedroom home, which is part of the Forest Healthcare group.
The care home said in a statement: "This sad death of a resident with very complex medical issues was not preventable but Mr Dicu fully accepts and deeply regrets that proper procedures were not followed.
"As a result, we immediately investigated the circumstances and took appropriate disciplinary action.
"With retraining, supervised practice and a robust action plan in place, Mr Dicu returned to work and continues to be a valued member of our team.
"The NMC committee acknowledges the steps taken, and recognises that there is a very low level of risk associated with his continued practice, particularly with these measures in place.
"We continue to carry out positive work at home level to learn from this, addressing any and all issues as part of our ongoing commitment to best practice."
