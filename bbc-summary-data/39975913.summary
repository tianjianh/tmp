[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steve Stannard, 37, died of multiple stab wounds at his Norwich flat in Bowers Avenue on 5 November last year.
Hassiem Baqir, 20, of Howberry Road, Thornton Heath in south London, had denied his murder but had admitted dealing drugs from Mr Stannard's home.
The jury at Norwich Crown Court found Baqir guilty on Thursday. He has been given a life sentence.
Judge Anthony Bate, sentencing, said Baqir had "showed a callous indifference to Steven's fate after he had been stabbed".
"You left him bleeding to death on the ground and made no attempt then or later to summon help."
He said the sale of drugs was "an evil trade that blights and ends live".
The court had earlier heard how Mr Stannard was stabbed twice in the back and three times in the front. The wounds perforated his lung and his heart.
His dog, a border collie called Trixie, was also stabbed.
