The teams were drawn together in Group G, along with Portugal and Ghana.
"This is special - we worked together for two years," Low, who was Klinsmann's assistant at the 2006 World Cup, told BBC Sport.
The 49-year-old USA coach joked: "I don't need to make a team scouting report on Germany."
Klinsmann, who won the World Cup as a player in 1990, added: "We probably have one of the toughest, if not the toughest group.
"We not only face Germany [their final group game], but also Portugal, who have Cristiano Ronaldo, and Ghana who are always an issue for us [Ghana knocked USA out in 2010 to reach the quarter-finals].
"We also have worst travel schedule of all the teams - we have to go to Natal, then travel to Manaus in the Amazon and then we fly four-and-a-half hours to the next one.
"But it is what it is - the World Cup is about taking on a challenge and making the best of it."
Low added: "It's going to be incredibly humid and hot. We must get used to it, in training and preparing."

Meanwhile, Schalke midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng said he was looking forward to competing against brother Jerome Boateng when Ghana play Germany in the second Group G game, on 21 June.
The siblings faced each other at the 2010 World Cup, when Germany defeated the African side 1-0 in the group stages.
"I'm happy with that," Boateng told Sport Bild. "You can see that dreams can come true.
"I am looking [forward] to another game against my brother at the World Cup.
"And also against my team-mate Jermaine Jones [of the USA] - he's simply great."
