Charlie Jones and James Wilson, both of Redhill, Surrey, and Joseph Noye, of Petworth, West Sussex, were all previously found guilty at Guildford Crown Court of multiple sex offences.
Police said Jones started the abuse and invited the other men to join in. Their victim suffered internal injuries.
Jones was jailed for 20 years and the other two were jailed for 10 years.
Surrey Police said the woman was "systematically sexually abused over a prolonged period" at a residential property in Redhill in October 2014.
Officers said Jones got into the property under false pretences, became controlling and then committed a series of sexual offences against her.
Over the following days he invited other men in who also committed serious sexual offences.
Police said the woman gained the courage to call them on the fifth day of her ordeal.
After the trial, Det Con Ben Andreas, from the Sexual Offence Investigation Team, said the victim had shown "great strength" in coming forward and the offences committed by the men were horrific.
He said: "Although the sentences passed today will never take away the trauma the woman experienced, I hope they go some way to help her move on with her life."
Jones, 29, of Honeyrock Lane, was convicted of five counts of rape and two other sex offences along with assault and criminal damage.
Noye, 27, of Midhurst Road, was found guilty of oral rape and sexual assault. Wilson, 36, of Portland Drive, was convicted of two counts of oral rape.
A fourth man, Ross Noye, 22, of Plaistow Road, Billingshurst, West Sussex, was found guilty of theft after the victim's mobile phone and tablet were stolen during her ordeal.
He was jailed for 26 months at an earlier hearing after activating a suspended sentence originally imposed for dangerous driving.
