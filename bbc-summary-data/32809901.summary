Consumer group Which? says it has uncovered more examples of misleading deals in UK supermarkets.

It said it had found examples of offer prices being on the shelves for longer than the "normal price".
It also found a case in which the price of a box of tea bags increased despite there being fewer bags in the box.
Last month, Which? called on the regulator to act over "confusing and misleading" supermarket prices, by launching a "super-complaint".
This legal move means the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) must respond within 90 days.
Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: "Retailers are continuing to pull the wool over shoppers' eyes.
"Our super-complaint has the backing of tens of thousands of concerned shoppers and is calling on the regulator to take action to put an end to misleading pricing practices."
Industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has challenged the super-complaint, claiming there is no systemic problem in pricing.
Government guidance says that special offers should not be misleading, and any higher price should be genuine.
