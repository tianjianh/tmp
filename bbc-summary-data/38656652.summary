[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Susan Ashworth, 47, was discovered at her home in Farfield Court, Garforth, on 29 April 2014.
Her husband, Martin Ashworth, 48, who had been released from a mental health unit 13 days before the fire, died in hospital after suffering serious burns.
Coroner David Hinchliff recorded an open verdict on his death following the inquests at Wakefield Coroner's Court.

Mr Ashworth's mother Barbara had previously told the inquest her son had been sectioned after attempting suicide a month earlier as his marriage deteriorated.
She said he had been released from the Becklin Centre in Leeds on 16 April because the unit "needed beds".
The inquest also heard Mr Ashworth was controlling and emotionally abusive to Mrs Ashworth, with her mother telling the court he had "tried to impose control and power over Susan".
She also said Mrs Ashworth has asked for a divorce while her husband was in hospital.
The inquest heard she was only told of his release on the day and she had little choice but to allow him to return home.
At the time of the fire, West Yorkshire Police said the cause was being treated as suspicious, but they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.
Following the coroner's ruling, Anthony Deery, of Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said he was "satisfied that we acted appropriately both in terms of the care provided to Mr Ashworth and the safeguarding referrals made on behalf of Mrs Ashworth".
