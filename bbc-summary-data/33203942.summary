The organisers of FilmG said its addition to the annual contest could encourage more entries.
Last year FilmG had 79 submissions, its highest number of entries since the contest first launched in 2008.
Entrants to the new category must shoot at least 70% of their footage on a mobile device.
The call for entries to the latest competition was made at BBC Scotland's headquarters in Glasgow.
This year's theme CliÃ¹ means prestige, fame or reputation.
