Scotland: Kieran Tierney will do 'whatever it takes' to face England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kieran Tierney will do "whatever it takes" to line up for Scotland against England at Hampden on 10 June, claims his coach at Celtic, John Kennedy.

Tierney may need to wear a special gum shield after having two teeth dislodged by Aberdeen striker Jayden Stockley's flailing arm in the Scottish Cup final.
Kennedy said: "Kieran will do whatever it takes to play. That's the type of character he is.
"If someone gives Kieran the go-ahead to play, he will be out on the pitch."
The left-back had to leave the Scottish Cup final pitch with blood gushing from his mouth and went straight to hospital.
But he was back at Hampden to collect his winner's medal and Kennedy has tipped him to return to the national stadium for the World Cup qualifier against England.
If he is fit, he is likely to play again at right-back, just as he did against Slovenia in March, with Hull City's Andrew Robertson the probable left-back.
The 19-year-old joked after the final that winning the cup was worth a broken jaw, while manager Brendan Rodgers revealed the defender might need an operation to fix his mouth.
But Tierney remained in Scotland's new-look 24-man squad after five players were cut on Monday, although one of them, Hearts goalkeeper Jack Hamilton, has been reinstated after Hull's Allan McGregor failed to shake off a thumb injury.
"He's fine, he is away having a short break just now in the sunshine, so he will meet up with Scotland as normal," added Kennedy.
"And all going well with the medical team giving him the go-ahead, he will be happy to step on the pitch, whether he has got an injury or not. You know what he's like. It's a big boost for Scotland if he is able to play as well."
Pictures have emerged of Tierney running across the Hampden car park with his boots on as he got back just in time to receive his medal and lift the cup on the podium.
Kennedy said: "I was pleasantly surprised because before that I had heard he was in hospital getting his face fixed.
"It would have been a shame for a boy who has grown up watching the team go through some tough times and some good times, and then the opportunity comes in the very last game of the season when you get to win that third trophy and it's going to go down in the history books.
"If he had missed that it would have been a crying shame. I think he had that in his head from the minute he turned up at hospital: 'Make sure I get back there in time for the trophy'. It was great to see him there."
