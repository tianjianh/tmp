Buddies manager Danny Lennon told his club's website that the proposed deal for the 22-year-old had fallen through.
"His club have put a stop to the move," said Lennon, who hopes to bring Paul Dummett back for a second loan spell.
"It's a little bit strange after his club initially wanted him to go out on loan, but we will move on and focus our attention elsewhere."
Dwyer said on Twitter: "To everyone at St Mirren, thank you. Unfortunately, a loan could not be completed, not at any fault of St Mirren. Enjoyed it.
"Wish St Mirren all the best through the rest of the season! It was a pleasure."
Newcastle United full-back Dummett joined the Paisley club in August and has been a regular in Danny Lennon's side, scoring in Sunday's 4-3 win over Dundee United.
"In this loan agreement, Paul has played his last game," explained Lennon, who this week signed .
"He is on his way back to Newcastle United as they are short of defenders, but he was always returning to Newcastle for a week after his loan deal expired so they could assess him.
"We are still confident that we are in with a good shout of getting Paul back, so hopefully that will work out okay for us."
Dummett tweeted following Wednesday's draw with Kilmarnock: "Gutted we didn't win in my last game for St Mirren today. Hope to be back soon."
Meanwhile, 19-year-old midfielder Mark Lamont and 18-year-old defender Jason Naismith have completed loan spells at Dumbarton and Morton respectively.
"Jason is back at the club after his loan and Mark has been released," added Lennon.
