Inverness-based creative industries conference and festival, XpoNorth, has announced the films to be screened during the two-day event in June.
Held annually, XpoNorth shows feature-length and short films made in Scotland, elsewhere in the UK and abroad as part of its wider programme.
This year's festival received almost 3,000 entries from a total of 112 countries.
The films will be screened during the event, which will be held on 7-8 June.
Scottish films to be shown include two documentaries by Highlands-based filmmakers.
Caithness-based David Graham Scott's The End Of The Game tells the story of a journey from Caithness to Africa.
Scott, a committed vegan, made the journey in the company of his neighbour Guy Wallace, a former big game hunter.
Tristan Aitchison, who lives on the Black Isle, was also inspired by Africa for his documentary.
His film, Sidney & Friends, explores growing up living as an intersex or transgender person in what he described as "one of the most conservative and intolerant regions in the world".
Other Scottish entries include Woman Up by Katrina Brown, of Aviemore.
Her film follows Eilidh, who before discovering she had a talent for mountain biking, would describe her feelings about doing sport in front of others as like "standing on a stage naked under a spotlight".
Also from Scotland is Greg McCarron's The Old Croft, an animated film about the construction, ruin of and later rebirth of a 150-year-old croft house in the Shetland Islands.
The international films to be shown include Sweden's Fomo Sapiens, Turkish-made Fastaqim, USA entry A Slice of Life, German-made Kaska and French film Half Time.
