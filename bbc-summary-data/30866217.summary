Developers Urbaser Balfour Beatty (UBB) had successfully appealed against a council decision to turn down plans for the Javelin Park site.
Opponents highlighted issues including the size and cost of the 30-acre site and the environmental impact.
UBB said the plant would stop waste going to landfill and generate enough electricity to power 26,000 homes.
It said the project would bring employment opportunities, boost the local economy and make a "positive contribution to the effects of climate change".
However, David Drew, Labour candidate for Stroud, said he believed it was the "wrong decision".
"We can still stop it... we've got to keep the argument going, it's the wrong technology.
"It's the wrong site and we owe it to our children and grandchildren to stop this monstrosity," Mr Drew said.
In 2013 county councillors voted to turn down plans for the facility, a decision which went against a recommendation by the council's own planners that it be approved.
Gloucestershire County Council had already signed a contract with UBB to build the energy-from-waste plant.
The company appealed to the Secretary of State's office and following a planning inquiry the government inspector decided the energy-from-waste plant could go ahead.
