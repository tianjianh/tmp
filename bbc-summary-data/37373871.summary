Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he is confident the funding will safeguard the airport's future growth.
Details of the financial support have yet to be revealed, but Mr McGuinness told BBC Radio Foyle a multimillion pound deal has been signed off.
On Tuesday, it was confirmed Ryanair was to drop a number of services from its 2017 schedule.
"What we are trying to do is reach a stage where City of Derry airport is sustainable financially," the deputy first minister said.
Mr McGuinness said supporting the airport with executive funds was the "right thing to do."
He said the funding would allow future growth at the Derry airport.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, has also confirmed his department is considering a submission by the airport to operate a public service obligation (PSO) service to London.
He told the Commons on Thursday he recognised the importance of the submission.
"I think good connectivity to Northern Ireland is and remains and will be very important," he said.
Mr Grayling was responding to a question from Foyle SDLP MP Mark Durkan.
