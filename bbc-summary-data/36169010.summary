Crewe Alexandra have given manager Steve Davis full backing to carry on as manager next season in the wake of relegation from League One.

Speaking at a fans forum at Gresty Road, chairman John Bowler promised Davis a budget for next season on a par with the one he has had this season.
"We're not cutting back. We're putting in money that's sensible," said Bowler.
"We're finalising the budget but there is scope to bring in three quarters of the experienced players we need."
Bowler added: "In football, you have to realise that it's a results business and nobody is happy with this year. But we are setting ourselves out to be successful in League Two.
"We know what we've got to deliver and Steve has to lead that from the front. He says he's prepared to take on that challenge.
"I'm assuming that, if Steve's not happy with the support the board is giving him, then he'd look for another job."
Crewe, who have only won six league games this season, go into the final two games of the season eight points adrift at the foot of the table.
In his backing for Davis, English football's sixth longest-serving manager, Crewe chairman Bowler did issue a couple of cautionary directives.
Bowler made it clear at the fans' forum that Davis's position will be reviewed if the season does not start well.
He has also suggested that this summer's new arrivals, which may include popular former Alex striker Ryan Lowe, if he turns down the offer of a new deal at Bury, must prove more effective than last summer's.
In pointing out that recruitment "hasn't been as good as it needs to be", Bowler will back Davis, while "at the same not jeopardising the stability of the club".
"Signings haven't had the impact we thought they would," Davis told BBC Radio Stoke. "I'd hold my hands up to that. But the squad is now the youngest we've ever had. We have players with potential. I have to get that out of them.
"I know I've got the full confidence of the board and I'm grateful for the opportunity to restore a bit of lost confidence among the fans.
"When I was brought in we were 18th in League Two. I am still the right person. I know the circumstances if we don't start well but, if we can build some momentum early on, we can have a good season."
