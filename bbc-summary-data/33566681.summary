[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Robert Rigler, 98, served with the Dorsetshire Regiment in France after D-day in 1944 and also earned a Mention in Despatches at Arnhem.
He was presented with the Legion d'Honneur medal at his nursing home in Hamworthy, Poole.
He said: "I can still see one of my mates we had to leave by the wayside."
He added: "It's wonderful to have all my friends and family here."
Maj Nick Speakman, of the Keep Military Museum in Dorchester, said: "A number of survivors of the Dorsets who fought in Normandy have been awarded the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government and rather sadly they arrived in the post.
"So with the help of Dorset House and the Keep Military Museum where much research on Bob Rigler was carried out, we arranged today's presentation.
"As a regiment we wanted to make sure Bob had a good parade in front of all his friends and a number of old comrades and members of staff from the Keep and we're pleased to support him in this way."
Mr Rigler has previously been awarded the Dutch Order of the Bronze Lion for his actions at Arnhem when he twice crossed the river under heavy fire taking part in the rescue of two boat loads of Airborne soldiers.
