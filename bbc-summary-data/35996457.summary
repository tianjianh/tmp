[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arshad Latif, 34, of Haydon Road, Aylesbury, was found guilty of trying to kill his former partner following a trial at Reading Crown Court.
The woman, 29, was left with a 7cm (3in) wound to her neck and other injuries after the attack last August.
Latif fled the scene and evaded officers for more than two weeks afterwards, Thames Valley Police said.
"There is no doubt that Latif could have killed his former partner when he attacked her with an axe at her home in Aylesbury," Det Con Jayne Green said.
He was sentenced to a further five years on licence once he is released.
