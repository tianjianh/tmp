Adrian Greenwood, 42, was found dead at his four-storey Oxford house in April. He had been stabbed and stamped on.
Michael Danaher, 50, took a photo of the facial injuries he sustained in the struggle, Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC told Oxford Crown Court.
Mr Danaher denies murder, saying he killed Mr Greenwood in self-defence.
Mr Saxby said the theft of the victim's wallet suggested Mr Danaher had "checked out the pockets of the dead or dying man on the floor in the hallway".
He told the jury that the blood pattern analysis indicated Mr Greenwood had "lost or was losing blood as he moved along the hallway - you remember he had a stab wound to the back.
"He ended up on the ground in the hallway, and the attack continued.
"And before he left, the defendant washed off the blood he got on him while attacking Adrian Greenwood."
The prosecutor added that after the attack Mr Danaher, of Hadrians Court, Peterborough, called his 15-year-old son and told him an "utter fiction" about being attacked by two men who stole his sat-nav.
The court has heard that the motive centred around a plan to steal a first edition of Wind in the Willows worth £50,000
The accused had written Mr Greenwood's name on a list of "people of means", which also included Kate Moss and Jeffrey Archer, who he wanted to rob or kidnap in a bid to make money, the jury has been told.
The barrister said after the killing, Mr Danaher drafted a letter to the wife of venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who he had previously unsuccessfully tried to rob.
"He set about writing a letter to Mrs Beecroft, saying 'hey, watch out. What happened to Adrian Greenwood, that could happen to you'.
"That's the way his mind is thinking.
"To say that he's got no remorse about what happened doesn't even begin to scratch the surface."
He said Mr Danaher demanded £90,000 in Bitcoin virtual currency or he and his "associates" would makes her family's lives "very interesting".
Mr Saxby also said the copy of the Wind in the Willows was put up for sale on eBay at the "knockdown price" of £2,000.
