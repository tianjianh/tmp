US election 2016: Your daily dig from campaign trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With just 20 days to go until Americans go to the polls, millennials suggest they'd rather die than vote for the two main parties, while Canadians try to keep their neighbours' spirits up.

The third and final debate is upon us but Donald Trump has shown little interest in ditching the campaign trail for prep sessions.
Speaking at a rally in Colorado on Tuesday, he told supporters he was "gonna take back the White House" and "deliver real, real change". And, for a real, real change he even mentioned some policy, saying he wanted to end government corruption and "drain the swamp in Washington DC". We've spoken to some transparency advocates about his plan and you can see what they think here.
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has disappeared from the public eye to prepare. Once again, her ability to focus will be tested by Mr Trump, who is reported to have invited two interesting guests to the show: President Barack Obama's Kenyan-born, Trump-supporting, half-brother Malik; and Pat Smith, the mother of a US officer who was killed in the Benghazi attack in September 2012.
Polling in recent days has suggested that voters are finding the increasingly fractious campaign a bit of a turnoff, meaning we could see a decline in turnout come 8 November. One group that is particularly exasperated with the candidates appears to be younger voters, with one survey finding that many of them would rather see a giant meteor destroy Earth than vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.
"Obviously we don't think that they're serious," Joshua Dyck, co-director of UMass Lowell's Center for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey, told Reuters. But it "tells you something about the political disaffection that is being shown by American youth," he added.
Perhaps sensing this moment of misery, some cheery folk across the border in Canada have launched a campaign to #TellAmericaItsGreat. Their uplifting video has had nearly a million views in the last couple of days, winning praise from Star Trek star George Takei, who tweeted: "O, Canada! My ears are moist seeing these. Thank you. This election has been exhausting us all." It sure has.

Not much going on... Apart from the most exciting debate since the last one, obviously.
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton take part in the final presidential debate at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. It will be hosted by Fox News presenter Chris Wallace and kicks off at 21:00 ET (01:00 GMT).
While they do or don't spend most of the day doing debate prep, their running mates will be out on the road. Tim Kaine is holding rallies for the Clinton campaign in the battleground states of Ohio and North Carolina, while Mike Pence will be pushing the Trump message in Colorado.
Although neither VP candidate can compete with the candidates' daughters. Ivanka Trump will be speaking at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit in California while Chelsea Clinton campaigns in Arizona.
