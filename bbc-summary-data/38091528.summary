County Championship: Glamorgan to host day-night match in pink ball trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan have been chosen to host one of the experimental day-night Championship games using pink balls during the 2017 season.

A full round of four-day fixtures will be staged under floodlights for the first time.
The Welsh county take on Derbyshire in Cardiff, starting on Monday, 26 June.
Glamorgan took part in the only previous day-night Championship match, beating Kent by eight wickets in September 2011.
The experiment is designed to help England players adjust to the conditions before the first day-night Test in the UK, against the West Indies in August 2017.
It is also hoped to attract more supporters to Championship games in mid-summer, with most T20 matches in Cardiff now played under lights.
"The pink ball has probably come on a fair bit since we played in Canterbury 2011. The ball was in its infancy, it was pretty cold, a pretty forgettable experience to be honest" said Glamorgan wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, who hit a fifty in that match.
"When we played back in 2011 it was hard to see the ball, the colour wasn't quite right but I think they've sorted that out now, they've done a lot of trials and testing.
"Initially it's bizarre, it messes with your body clock but it's something that certainly has a future in our game, we'll be playing a lot more of it."
Glamorgan begin their Championship season away to Northants on April 7, after a first-class warm-up against the students of Cardiff MCCU on 28 March.
They play three four-day games before moving on to the One-Day Cup, with the 50-overs One-Day Cup competition now being played in a block between 27 April and 14 May.
Another six Championship games follow before the T20 Blast starts in its new 43-day block, beginning on 7 July.
Glamorgan stick with the same level of cricket at Swansea and Colwyn Bay as in 2016.
They face Kent in the One-Day Cup at St Helen's on May 14, and Durham in the Championship on 26 May.
The annual visit to Colwyn Bay starts on Monday 28 August, with Sussex the visitors to the Rhos-on-Sea ground.
Glamorgan will make a rare trip to Chester-le-Street starting on 19 June, after Durham were relegated to Division Two on financial grounds.
After the expansion of the division to ten teams and the cut to 14 matches, Glamorgan will not play Sussex or Nottinghamshire, but they will face Sussex at Arundel in the T20 Blast on 9 July.
The venue for their away match against Middlesex on 10 May is yet to be confirmed.
