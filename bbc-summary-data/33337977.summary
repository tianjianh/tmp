Fears British students trying to enter Syria

Two brothers from Leicester are among seven British students whose families fear may be trying to get into Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria.

The men, who are both medical students, flew from Sudan to Turkey last week.
In March a different group of nine British medical students from the same college in Sudan also disappeared after going to Turkey.
One of the men in that group later appeared in an Islamic State (IS) propaganda film.
The students from both groups attended the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum, Sudan and the latest group flew to Istanbul last Friday.
The brothers feared missing, Ibrahim and Mohamed Ageed, are aged 20 and 22 respectively.
Their mother, Nawal Salih, spoke to the BBC from her home in Leicester and said she was "very worried and very upset" because her sons had suddenly left in the middle of taking their exams.
She said she did not understand the reasons for their behaviour, and confirmed that her husband, who is also a doctor, had travelled to Turkey to try to get them back before they crossed the border.
Ibrahim is a Manchester United fan who started his studies in Khartoum in 2012. His elder brother Mohamed was due to graduate this month.
Dr Ahmed Babikir, a dean at the fee-paying university, said the brothers were joined by five other British students.
Sudanese social media reports suggest they may have travelled as part of a larger group of students, including an American from the university.
There are claims in the Sudanese press that some members of the group have been detained in Turkey, although that has not been confirmed officially.
A man claiming to be the father of one of the British students has used social media in a bid to stop his son falling into the hands of IS.
He claimed that one of the group was a 20-year-old woman believed to be from south London.
The departure of the students has raised concerns that their university has become a hotbed for Islamist extremists.
The group that left in March included Ahmed Sami Khider, who graduated in July 2014. Within weeks of leaving he appeared in a propaganda film produced by IS urging more British medics to join him in Syria.
In the film, and wearing a stethoscope around his neck, he says: "Here I've found a great cause and I ask you all to join this cause".
In the sleekly produced film, which includes footage of what is claimed to be state-of-the art IS medical facilities, Khider directly addresses Muslims in the UK - especially specialist doctors - urging them "to leave the land of England and make the hijra (migration) here and help your brothers and sisters".
"There is a great cause being fought here and the caravan is leaving," he adds.
Addressing the camera he then says: "Use your skills and come hereâ€¦ We are always in desperate need of doctors."
