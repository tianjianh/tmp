Sir Steve Redgrave and Katherine Grainger attended Marlow Rowing Club after it received the sum from the Iconic Facilities Olympic legacy fund.
The club, on the Berkshire side of the River Thames, has been fundraising for a £2.5m boathouse since a fire in 2011.
A spokesman said the money would allow the club to rebuild the clubhouse and extend the facilities.
The event, which began at 15:00 GMT, was also attended by Home Secretary Theresa May.
Marlow Rowing Club is where Sir Steve started his career.
Sixty boats and treasured memorabilia were lost in the blaze in August 2011.
The club spokesman said the new facilities could also be used by other water sports clubs, including Marlow Canoe Club, Henley Open Water Swimming Club, High Wycombe Triathlon Club and Longridge Canoe Club.
It is hoped the new centre, on the Berkshire side of the River Thames, will open by 2014.
Sport England is investing more than £1bn of National Lottery and Exchequer funding between 2012 and 2017.
