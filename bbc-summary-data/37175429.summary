The ex-Coronation Street, EastEnders and Emmerdale actress confirmed to the BBC she was considering putting her name forward to become the Labour candidate.
Mrs Cox, who was MP for Batley and Spen, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire on 16 June.
The Labour Party said it had not yet begun the selection process.

Ms Brabin, 55, who was born in Batley, played Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street between 1994 and 1997. She later appeared as Roxy Drake in EastEnders and as Carole in Emmerdale.
She has also had roles in Holby City and Doctors and appeared alongside David Jason and Stephanie Cole in the 1989 series A Bit Of A Do.
Speaking at Mrs Cox's funeral, Ms Brabin said the people of Batley and Spen had been "extraordinarily lucky to have her as their MP".
She said: "She was an extraordinary woman. Super bright, an extraordinary humanitarian.
"She was hilariously funny to be around, massively energetic."
According to tradition, the Chief Whip of the political party whose MP held the vacant seat will begin the procedure for a by-election in a process known as 'moving the Writ'.
A new Writ is generally moved within three months of the vacancy occurring.
The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP have all said they will not be fielding a candidate in the by-election.
However, Liberty GB and English Democrats have both announced they will contest the seat.
Labour said no date had been set for the by-election.
Thomas Mair, 52, has been charged with murder in relation to the death of Mrs Cox and is due to go on trial in November.
He has also been charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
