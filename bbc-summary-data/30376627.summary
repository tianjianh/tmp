Midwife facing unborn baby drugs charges: Hearing postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hearing for a midwife facing charges of administering drugs which led to the lowering of the heartbeats of unborn babies has been postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hearing was due to decide if Ms Stewart can practice again.
Kirsteen Stewart was working at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary when the incidents took place between October 2007 and March 2010.
In 2010 Ms Stewart was suspended for 18 months by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
The NMC said she administered drugs which contributed to the foetus of one or more pregnant women experiencing a condition that caused a slow heart rate.
The ruling came after Grampian health board said it was investigating the care of 22 mothers and babies at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital over a two-year period.
