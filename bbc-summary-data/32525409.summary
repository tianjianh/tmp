England batsman Joe Root is destined to captain his country and will be an "ideal" skipper, says Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon.

Yorkshire's Root, 24, averages 57.11 after 29 Test matches and scored an unbeaten 182 in England's recent Test win over the West Indies.
"Joe has all the skills required for the role," Moxon told BBC Sport.
"When he does become captain of England, it will be for a sustained period of time, barring injury."
Alastair Cook currently skippers the England Test side, while Eoin Morgan led the one-day team in the World Cup earlier this year.
Former England spinner Graeme Swann thinks becoming captain could take the edge off the "cheeky Yorkshireman".
But Moxon said: "Rooty would take the captaincy in his stride.
"He captained Yorkshire at the end of last season in the absence of Andrew Gale and did a fantastic job.
"He will be an ideal England captain. It's a case of when, not if."
Root made his international debut in all three forms of the game during the 2012-13 tour of India.
In addition to the Test matches, he has played 54 one-day internationals and nine T20s.
"Joe had a fantastic start to his international career, but it is just the start," said Moxon, speaking at the Sporting Directors' Summit in Manchester.
"He will be aware of that. He has an old head on young shoulders and he won't slacken off and believe he's made it.
"He's capable of being a successful player in all three forms of the game - and as captain - for the foreseeable future."
