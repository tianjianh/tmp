The judge instructed the panel to seek unanimous verdicts in each case.
The burglary, which took place over the Easter weekend last year, saw jewellery and valuables worth an estimated Â£14m stolen.
It was described during the trial at Woolwich Crown Court as the "largest burglary in English legal history".
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield, John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
