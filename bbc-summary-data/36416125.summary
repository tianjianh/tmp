Albarn and the choir will both open the festival's main Pyramid Stage.
Other new additions include Australian rockers Tame Impala and French singer Christine & The Queens.
The bill also revealed headline slots for singers Cyndi Lauper and Billy Bragg, rock band New Order and children's TV star Basil Brush.
Albarn, who headlined Glastonbury with Blur in 2009, will be accompanied by Africa Express musicians and The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians for the first set on the Pyramid Stage on 24 June.
Christine and The Queens, the stage name of singer Heloise Letissier, appear in the Friday line-up on the festival's second stage, the Other Stage, sandwiched between rising stars Blossoms and Scottish folk rocker Frightened Rabbit.
New Order headline there the following day, while dance acts Disclosure and LCD Soundsystem  take the stage's other two top slots.
Tame Impala will be the main support ahead of Adele's Saturday night headline set, while indie rockers Foals and American singer Beck take the same slots before Muse and Coldplay's bill-topping appearances.
Lauper is one of a number of big names playing away from the festival's two main stages and will close on the Acoustic Stage on 26 June.
That stage will also see sets from American folk pioneer Art Garfunkel, former Squeeze and Mike and the Mechanics singer Paul Carrack and Welsh rockers The Alarm.
Brush is one of a number of non-musical names to appear on the bill, which also includes Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in conversation, poets John Hegley and Murray Lachlan Young, and comedians Dane Bapiste, Josie Long and Stephen K Amos.
