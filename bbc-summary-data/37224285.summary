The Scot, 29, beat Rosol of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-2 6-2 and will play Spain's Marcel Granollers in round two.
Murray joined compatriots Dan Evans and Naomi Broady as a winner on day two, with Kyle Edmund and Johanna Konta already into the second round.
Heather Watson and Aljaz Bedene both suffered first-round losses on Tuesday.
Struggling with illness, Watson lost 6-2 7-5 to Dutch qualifier Richel Hogenkamp and has now failed to reach the second round at Flushing Meadows in six attempts.
Bedene was beaten 6-4 6-4 6-4 by Australian Nick Kyrgios.
Broady had earlier beaten compatriot Laura Robson 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 6-4 to claim only the second Grand Slam main-draw win of her career.
Evans began Tuesday's run of British success as he saw off American Rajeev Ram 6-2 4-6 7-5 6-1.
Murray has been labelled the tournament favourite in some quarters after a superb run, coupled with injury doubts over world number one Novak Djokovic.
The Briton confirmed against Rosol that he has retained the form which took him to Wimbledon and Olympic titles this summer.
A break of serve in the sixth game set Murray on his way and the match was as good as over when Rosol double-faulted three times to fall 3-0 down in the second set.
"I served very well," said Murray, who hit 11 aces and made just 17 unforced errors. "It was a tough start to the match and once I got the break up, I started to relax and play well."
"I don't think I had any break points against me, which was good, I had good variation on the second serve as well.
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller said: "Rosol threw everything at Murray in the first half a dozen games, but once his defence was breached for the first time the Wimbledon and Olympic champion proved unstoppable.
"Murray was razor sharp. His serve, in particular, caught the eye. A routine, but high quality, win was completed in under two hours."
There was a lot on the line for both women in the all-British clash on court 13, and it was Broady who proved the stronger at the end of a tight contest.
The 26-year-old from Stockport fought back from a set down to claim her second victory at a major - the other coming at Wimbledon two years ago.
Robson, 22, had hoped to claim a first Grand Slam win since the US Open in 2013, since when her career has been derailed by a serious wrist injury.
"I will get over it and probably think that overall this was a pretty good tournament but right now it sucks," said Robson.
Broady served superbly under pressure, saving eight of nine break points and firing down 16 aces.
Asked about any possible ill-feeling on court, Broady said: "I think I was just getting annoyed because she was doing the ball tosses a lot of times.
"I am sure she is upset to lose. I don't expect that she is going to smile at me at the net when she has just lost in three sets, so I'm sure she'll be fine tomorrow."
Broady now faces fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in round two.
Leon Smith, GB Davis Cup captain, told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "Naomi is probably more match tight and confident, Laura is still getting the belief back.
"But it's good to have another Brit into the second round of a main draw, even if one has to go out. It's a great thrill having Brits getting through, it gives everyone momentum and plenty to talk about."
Watson was in tears after losing the first set against Hogenkamp in 32 minutes, before being massaged by a trainer and given pills by a doctor.
"I was very ill today," she said. "I've had a fever for the last three days, but playing in this heat is almost impossible when you feel that bad.
"I was struggling to breathe and then my back... I don't really know what it is. I'm going to get some blood tests done and figure out what it was."
Asked if the symptoms resembled her debilitating bout of glandular fever in 2013, Watson added: "I feel similar, yeah."
British number three Aljaz Bedene could not capitalise on an injury to Australian Nick Kyrgios as he lost 6-4 6-4 6-4 in a controversial encounter.
At 5-4 up in the first set, Kyrgios called for the trainer after straining his right hip but Bedene struggled to cope with the pace and power of the Australian.
At the start of the second set, he stumbled into a line judge while chasing a ball, before saying: "Why doesn't he move? He can see I'm running there."
Kyrgio, 21, caused further controversy when he refused to shake the hand of umpire Ali Nili at the end of the match.
It was Bedene's third first-round defeat in four major tournaments this year.
Evans continued the form that saw him rise to a career-high ranking of 60 earlier this month as he beat Ram in four sets.
"It was good to come through, I enjoyed it out there and started to play a bit better towards the end," Evans told BBC 5 live.
The 26-year-old, who reached round three in 2013, faces German Alexander Zverev, the 19-year-old touted by many as a future world number one.
"He's younger than me but I'd say he's more experienced on the ATP Tour, so I'd say I don't have much to lose," said Evans. "The pressure's on him."
