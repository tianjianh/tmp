The X Factor auditions could be taken by storm if ET, the singing and whistling walrus turned up in front of Gary, Louis, Nicole or Tulisa.
He's been celebrating his 30th birthday with a sing-song. Orphaned as a baby, he was taken in by a zoo in the US state of Alaska.
The keepers there named him after the famous movie alien ET because of his wrinkles. Beautiful!
