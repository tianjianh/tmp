[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guy Verhofstadt said he was looking forward to a "hell of a conversation" - referring to comments by Mr Davis.
In September, Mr Davis answered a question about Mr Verhofstadt, an avowed believer in the EU, by saying "get thee behind me Satan".
Mr Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, has said there will be no compromise on freedom of movement.
He insists the UK will not get free access to the single market if it does not accept that.
The European Parliament has to vote on, and could therefore veto, both the terms of the UK's exit and the even bigger subsequent deal to establish Britain's future relationship with the EU.
How Mr Davis and Mr Verhofstadt fare face to face may have profound implications for the UK's future, says BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas.
Our correspondent says all eyes are on the meeting between Mr Davis and the man who could be one of the biggest thorns in his side.
Mr Verhofstadt tweeted: "Looking forward to a hell of a conversation with David Davis tomorrow :)", and attached a link to a newspaper report of the Brexit secretary's appearance before MPs and his "Satan" remark.
Mr Davis explained after that meeting that he was not comparing Mr Verhofstadt to the Devil, but telling the questioner not to tempt him into commenting on him.
