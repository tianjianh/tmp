Oxford City Council's shared housing policy 'pricing people out'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A policy to limit the amount of shared housing in Oxford is leading to people being priced out of the market, the National Landlords Association says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It claims the authority's licences for Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMO) are adding to a shortage of accommodation and forcing people to move out of the city.
City landlords have required licences for all shared houses since 2012.
The council argues too many HMOs can lead to poor quality accommodation.
Gavin Dick from the National Landlords Association said the lack of shared housing "has effectively created a monopoly which has increased the prices".
"People who are receiving housing benefit can't actually live in Oxford at all," he added.
He said shared homes in the city were worth up to Â£60,000 more than non-HMO properties.
Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said an "over-concentration" of HMOs led to a "change of character in the area, a loss of community and a creation very often of badly managed HMOs with poor quality accommodation".
He said a lack of city housing in general was to blame for a rise in prices.
The authority said the city has about 7,000 houses of multiple occupancy (HMO) and is currently consulting on the future of its HMO licensing scheme.
