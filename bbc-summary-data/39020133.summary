California is currently experiencing a very powerful storm, which has caused power cuts and sinkholes across the state.
Firefighters from the San Bernardino County Fire Department were out helping people in the storm, when a giant sinkhole opened up underneath their truck.
Thankfully, none of the firefighters were in the truck when it fell, and no-one was hurt.
