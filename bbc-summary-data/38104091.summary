Wales 'happiest place to live in UK', new study finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Wales are the most likely to feel happy with where they live, according to a UK-wide study.

More than nine in 10 people living in Wales said "yes" when asked if they were happy where they live.
But the survey of more than 2,000 respondents found that people in Northern Ireland are the least happy about where they lived.
Research by Co-op Insurance suggested people living in Yorkshire and south west England were also satisfied.
The study also claims the price of a home may have more of an influence on home buyers' decisions than the location.
Nearly half of people surveyed said the size of the garden was a major factor when buying a house, a third said access to transport links was vital and a quarter wanted storage space and to be near a good school.
Two-thirds of people said a good sense of community spirit was the key to being happy with where you live and nearly one in five had considered how nice the neighbours seemed before putting in an offer on a property.
