The 22-year-old was found by police on patrol on the A451 in Kidderminster just after 05:00 GMT on Sunday.
He was lying between the bus depot island and Comberton Hill island and was taken to hospital, where he died.
Det Sgt Laura Wright from West Mercia Police said the man may have been involved in a disturbance at a nightclub.
She said: "We are keeping an open mind in relation to this investigation.
"Initial indications are that the man was in a collision with a vehicle but we are also considering that he was involved in an altercation.
"We are currently linking this incident to a disturbance outside the Tribe nightclub on Green Street, Kidderminster, which occurred at around 4.50am and we're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this".
The man's family has been told and formal identification will take place later.
