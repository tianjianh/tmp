[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Humberside Police is to recruit 51 new officers to tackle crime in five "high demand" areas.

The force will take on 17 new PCs, 30 police community support officers (PCSOs) and four sergeants.
Funding for the recruitment, said to cost Â£8.1m over the next five years, will come from the force's reserves, Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner Keith Hunter said.
The new officers are expected to be appointed within six months
Two of the new sergeants, ten PCs and 20 PCSOs will be appointed to work across the East and West Marsh wards in Grimsby, the Bridlington South ward in East Yorkshire and the Scunthorpe Town ward.
The remaining officers will join the Hull city centre neighbourhood team.
Humberside Police currently employs 1,525 police officers and 228 PCSOs.
Chief Constable Justine Curran said: "We have done a lot of work to identify exactly where these officers are most needed, according to the demand across the whole force area, and the new officers will go directly to the neighbourhoods where they are most needed and where they will make the most difference."
Mr Hunter, who was appointed in May, said he believed the amount held in police reserves was "too high".
"My job is to help residents get the best police service possible and ensure taxpayers' money is spent wisely to do that," he said.
"This is the first step in that process and I will be carefully monitoring the effect these new officers and PCSOs will have, and look for other opportunities in the future to add further value."
