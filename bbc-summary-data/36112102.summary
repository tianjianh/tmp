Broadwick Live hope to grow the Abersoch festival from its current 5,000 attendees to 15,000.
The London-based festival group also owns Croatia's Electric Elephant and Austria's Snowbombing festivals.
A spokesman said they would keep the name but "invest in the line-up and ramp up the quality."
Glass Butter Beach festival started life as Wakestock, and was founded by the Sensation Group, which also owns Abersoch Life magazine.
Alex Barratt, festivals director at Broadwick Live, said: "We love the Glass Butter Beach name and we love the concept.
"It had lost a bit of money in the past so we thought we could go in there and make it a success."
He said the company wanted to develop an event with an 18 to 23-year-old demographic.
"We are going to keep the Glass Butter Beach concept and name but we will invest in the line-up and ramp up the quality to the next level.
"With that will come a better production and sound quality. We hope to increase the number of people attending to 15,000, but it will be a gradual growth."
