Leon Britton: Midfielder is Swansea version of John Terry, says Paul Clement

Swansea City manager Paul Clement says midfielder Leon Britton's connection with supporters is reminiscent of the bond John Terry has with Chelsea fans.

Britton suggested Swansea's players pay for the fans' tickets at Sunderland and also provided his teammates with inspirational DVDs.
"Leon, what an affinity he has with the fans, it's unbelievable," Clement said.
"I think that's why it's so great to have players that have spent years and years here."
He continued: "I have (experienced it before) with John Terry and Frank (Lampard) as well at Chelsea.
"Ultimately, the goal is to bring someone through, someone from the city, who has come from your academy, because then you get that real connection, like with John's example at Chelsea."

Clement believes Britton has set an example to the rest of the squad with his conduct, having made no protests despite taking a long time to carry favour with his new manager, having missed over three months of action before being recalled for the April win over Stoke City.
"The environment we want to create here is about giving your best to your team, giving your best to your team-mates, giving your best for this club," Clement said.
"The players are aware of that, even the players who have not played so much.
"Leon is a great example. He waited, waited and waited. He trained hard, he got behind his team-mates being a fantastic professional and then when he came in and he got his chance he took it. It was impossible for me not to play him again and again and again. It is all about teamwork."
Clement says he is hopeful that defender Alfie Mawson will continue his progress when he travels with the England Under-21 squad this summer.
The former Barnsley man has played in all but one game since Clement took charge and is being tipped for full international honours.
"I don't know (about him playing for England), I'm just pleased he's taken on board some of the stuff we've asked him to do," Clement added.
"He's training really hard, he's focused, and it's showing in his performances. That's all he can do, do his best for his club and his team-mates and see what happens in the future.
"(He's) got to be looking at finishing off well for us before going away with the Under-21s in the summer to the European Championships. That's the next step for him and he will go for there."
