The 24-year-old will join the Irish province later this year after completing his 2015 contractual commitments with Auckland Blues.
Twice capped for the All Blacks, Saili has made 33 Super Rugby appearances for the Blues, scoring five tries in the process.
"I believe I can continue to improve and grow within the Munster set-up," said Saili.
Describing the move to Ireland as "a fantastic opportunity", he added that Munster had the "values and traditions I can relate to from my time at the Blues".
Munster head coach Anthony Foley said he thought Saili would be a great addition to the Munster back line.
"We are really pleased that Francis has committed his future to the province," Foley said.
"He is a talented centre with an impressive skill-set and he possesses the physical attributes to excel in the northern hemisphere."
