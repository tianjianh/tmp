Senior UK museum figures have criticised plans to merge parts of National Museum Wales and conservation body Cadw.

National Museums Liverpool director David Fleming said threats to independence would send the wrong message about democracy.
The Museums Association warned the plan could risk the museum's financial sustainability.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates called for a heritage sector "global in ambition".
Last week it was revealed the two bodies' commercial functions may combine under a new umbrella body called Historic Wales.
A working group has been set up by Mr Skates to consider the best way to maximise the commercial potential of Wales' heritage bodies and organisations, which could also include the National Library of Wales.
Dr Fleming made his views known in a letter to the assembly culture committee chairwoman Bethan Jenkins.
He said: "Any action that threatens the arms-length principle of governance of a national museum service will send out all the wrong messages about Welsh attitudes to democracy.
"I cannot stress enough the pivotal role that Wales' national museum service plays in the demonstration of Welsh nationality and the damage that could result from any diminution of that role."
He said it looked "as though it will be very difficult to run an impactful national museum service if its commercial activities were to be taken away".
Museum Association director Sharon Heal said the plans would severely undermine the "independence and financial sustainability" of the museum.
Ms Heal said the association, which represents 600 members, was "extremely concerned".
In a letter seen by BBC Wales, Prof Dai Smith, former chairman of Arts Council Wales said he was alarmed by the "manner in which long and widely held convictions about the civic and national function of such a body might be overturned by the topsy turvy accountancy logic of means and resources".
He also argued there should be a ministerial post in cabinet dedicated to the arts, heritage and culture.
National Museum Wales previously stated it was "actively seeking clarification" of the plans, which had "significant implications".
The Welsh Government did not comment on the letters, but Mr Skates said in a previous statement he wanted "to see our national public institutions evolve, becoming more financially resilient and doing more to help us build a prosperous Wales.
"This is essential if these organisations are to continue to act as effective custodians of our outstanding historic collections and heritage and provide an outstanding visitor experience."
The working group is to publish a business case by January.
