He scored six tries in his 28 appearances for the Tigers last season.
The 23-year-old began his career at Hull FC before a move to Parramatta Eels in Australia in 2014, but he failed to make an appearance in the NRL and returned to Super League with Cas.
"The coaching staff identified Ben as a perfect fit for our model," said head coach Neil Jukes.
He could face his parent side in Leigh's opening game of next season on February 10.
