Scott Brown: Celtic captain wins appeal over red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic captain Scott Brown is free to face Rangers in the Premiership on Saturday after overturning the red card he received against Ross County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old midfielder's sending-off has been reduced to a caution "for recklessly dangerous play" following an appeal to the Scottish FA.
Brown was sent off for a stoppage-time challenge on Liam Boyce in a 2-2 draw.
Champions Celtic chose to contest the decision, with disciplinary hearings delayed due to the Easter holiday.
That allowed Brown to play in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final victory over Rangers at Hampden.
While Brown is available to play in the Old Firm derby at Ibrox, the yellow card takes him over the disciplinary threshold that triggers a two-game suspension.
That means he will sit out subsequent league matches against St Johnstone and Aberdeen.
