Norman was on loan to Allen Smith, 65, when he took flight from the falconer's workplace in Flitwick on Friday.
The plucky bird of prey has already been spotted in the garden of a woman living in nearby Lidlington since making his bid for freedom.
Mr Smith said three-year-old Norman "could potentially go for a cat. but not unless he was really hungry".
Norman stands roughly 3ft (0.9m) tall and boasts a 6ft (1.8m) wingspan.
The bird has also been seen in Stewartby, about five miles from Flitwick. He can be identified by the leather straps around his feet.
Mr Smith said: "He had just been fed when he disappeared and he's quite scared of people so I don't think anyone should panic."
Anyone who spots Norman is asked to call the RSPB or Bedfordshire Police.
