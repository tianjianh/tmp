A cycle hire scheme is to be trialled in Edinburgh in a Â£150,000 project later this year.

The city council considered a hire scheme in 2007, but it was shelved because of the cost.
Since then, London launched a scheme in 2010 and Glasgow followed suit with its own version before the Commonwealth Games in 2014, which is to be doubled in size.
Transport for Edinburgh is behind the latest move.
Lesley Hinds, City of Edinburgh Council's transport convener, said: "I'm absolutely delighted that we're going to have a pilot public cycle hire scheme in Edinburgh.
"Many cities now have successful bike hire schemes, which help encourage residents and visitors keep active while exploring their surroundings on two wheels.
"Thanks to the funding available as part of the local government finance settlement, we'll have more resources to devote to cycling projects (supplementing the 10% of the overall transport budget investment already allocated to cycling for 2017/18) and we plan to use some of this extra money for a pilot cycle hire scheme."
