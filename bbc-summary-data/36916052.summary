The 26-year-old forward was released by Carlisle United in June, after making 10 appearances for the League Two club.
Balanta has been training with the Wood during pre-season.
"I'm taking him to play up top, he'll be competing with two other forwards and he'll be judged on his work rate, attitude and, of course, his goals," manager Luke Garrard told the club website.
"Angelo knows he needs to kick-start his career here at Meadow Park, as he's not a wonder kid any longer.
"He must show me he has the desire to succeed everyday as nobody can question his ability."
