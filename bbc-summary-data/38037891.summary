Lauchlan Muir, from Bo'ness, West Lothian, was presented with the award by Sir Terry's son Mark during the Children in Need television programme.
Sir Terry, who died in January, presented the programme for 35 years.
This year's appeal raised a record £46.6m on the night, £4.6m of it from Scotland.
Lauchlan has raised more than £3,500 for this year's appeal, and over the years has raised £10,000.
He travelled to London to receive the award - and explained how he was inspired by Pudsey.
"I won a Pudsey Bear in a raffle in Primary One, when I was five - and that year I watched the Children in Need show," he said.
"And when I saw everything on it, I decided to fundraise the following year."
Lauchlan had only discovered he had won the award earlier in the day.
"I only found out I'd won this morning when my brothers woke me up with confetti cannons," he said.
Mark Wogan said: "Dad always said Children In Need was the thing he was most proud of in his entire career. He said he was just one player in a massive team and that you at home were the real stars.
"It was always about helping the children, for him."
He said the new award in his father's memory aimed to recognise the spirit behind Children in Need.
"It is about people who have gone above and beyond for charity, who have raised not necessarily enormous amounts, but who showed determination and creativity and people who inspire other people to do great things," he said.
