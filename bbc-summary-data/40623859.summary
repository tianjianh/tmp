The Cameroon international, 23, was on loan to the Ligue 1 club last season, scoring four goals.
Njie joined Spurs from Lyon in 2015 for a reported Â£10m and made 14 appearances for the club, though he suffered a serious knee injury in December 2015.
"We wish Clinton all the best for the future," Tottenham said.
