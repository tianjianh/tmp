Norwich City 1-0 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonny Howson's first-half goal was enough to give Norwich City victory over Bristol City and maintain the Canaries' unbeaten start to the season.

The Norwich captain side-footed past goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell to break the deadlock before half-time.
Alex Tettey had earlier struck a post for the home side, while Bristol City's Jonathan Kodjia also hit the woodwork.
Aden Flint's header forced Michael McGovern into a smart save, as the Robins' 100% record came to an end.
The scoreline may even have been more emphatic in the hosts' favour had O'Donnell not brilliantly tipped Wes Hoolahan's late shot against the post.
Cameron Jerome and substitute Sergi Canos, on for his debut after signing in the summer from Liverpool, also wasted good opportunities during a one-sided last 20 minutes.
Alex Neil's side, who thrashed Blackburn Rovers on the opening day before being held at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, have moved up to second in the early Championship table.
Norwich City boss Alex Neil:
"That was a very pleasing performance. We were a bit tentative for the first 10 minutes or so but then we settled down and played some really good stuff. We got our goal and also hit the woodwork a couple of times and in the end I think it was a relatively comfortable win.
"That's seven points out of nine now, which is a good start in what is a very tough league, and sets us up nicely for the derby on Sunday. We are all looking forward to that and I know the fans are too.
"From a technical and vision point of view I think Wes is as good as you'll get in the Championship. He is a key player for us in and around the box and also works hard on the defensive side of his game too.
"He just seems to get better and better with age and long may that continue."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"I thought the lads were excellent. If we had scored late on it certainly wouldn't have been a smash-and-grab raid. We weren't too far away from getting a comfortable draw.
"It is sometimes easy to forget what a young group we have got here and for large chunks of the game we matched a really top side. We won our first two games - but this is the best football we have played so far.
"We fell a bit short at the end of the first half when they pushed us back a bit and got their goal. We tactically switched off a bit to allow them space for the goal but overall I was very pleased with the performance.
"It's a good marker for us and on another night we could easily have come away with something."
