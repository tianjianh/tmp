They say some people have died because they have not received proper medical treatment.
Some women whose husbands died from Ebola say the government has not provided them with the support it promised, meaning their children cannot go to school.
There has been no response so far from the authorities.
Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors head Yusuf Kabbah told the BBC's Umaru Fofana that Ebola survivors had been abandoned with no clear recovery plan for them.
Nearly 4,000 people died from Ebola in the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone and more than 10,000 people are believed to have survived, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.
