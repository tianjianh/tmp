London-based OysterWorld is setting up its development, marketing and research centre on Melin Corrwg Business Park, Treforest near Pontypridd.
The inward investment is being backed by Â£1m business funding from the Welsh government.
Economy Minister Edwina Hart said it was a significant boost for the county's digital media sector.
"Wales was in competition with Canada for this project so I am delighted to welcome OysterWorld to Wales," she said.
"The Welsh government is fully committed to accelerating the growth of digital media businesses in Wales and the development of the games industry is an integral part of this aim.
"We have a growing pool of talent in games development, with universities becoming increasingly aligned to the needs of the sector and spinning out a large number of micro businesses."
She said attracting OysterWorld sent out a strong message to the industry that Wales "has the skills and talent to support this niche sector."
The announcement of the investment coincides with the Wales Games Development Show taking place at the Wales Millennium Centre on Wednesday when more than 50 companies are exhibiting their latest games and interactive projects.
OysterWorld says it aims to grow into a major force in development, publishing and electronic distribution of interactive entertainment software and online content services.
Communications manager Tony Bailey said: "We look forward to creating a dynamic new operations hub in Wales and building a new team to expand the business.
"We are very impressed by the availability of talented and skilled people in Wales and will be looking to recruit experienced staff as well as taking on talented young graduates."
The company said it was already working with the University of South Wales and said support from the Welsh government was another deciding factor in choosing Wales for its first major expansion.
