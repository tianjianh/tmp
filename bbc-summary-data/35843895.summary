[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a museum celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark have reached another funding landmark.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Borders Council (SBC) has been successful in a first stage bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the project in Duns.
Development funding of more than £50,000 has been awarded to help work up a full bid for about £645,000.
The council has already committed almost £620,000 to the scheme.
Community fundraising aims to bring in a minimum of £300,000 towards the project.
It would see the existing Jim Clark Room in Duns expanded and enhanced to allow cars and trophies to be put on display.
A total project cost of about £1.65m has been attached to the scheme.
It is hoped the development could be completed by 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany, aged just 32.
The driver was born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in the Borders, and was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965. He won a total of 25 grand prix races.
