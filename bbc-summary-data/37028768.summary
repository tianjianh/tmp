Openers Laura Wolvaardt (105) and Trisha Chetty (95) shared an opening stand of 192 - the second highest partnership in South African history.
They helped the Proteas to 260-6 before Isobel Joyce (57) top-scored for the Irish as they fell well short.
The teams meet again on Thursday at The Hills in the final match of the series.
The impressive Wolvaardt struck 14 boundaries while Chetty anchored the innings before being run out off the penultimate ball.
Ciara Metcalfe (2-37) was again the pick of the Irish attack, who fought back well after the initial onslaught.
The new opening Irish pairing of Clare Shllington and debutant Una Raymond-Hoey scored 25 apiece as Ireland replied to South Africa's total.
Cath Dalton and Gaby Lewis fell cheaply, but an 85-run fifth wicket stand between Joyce and Kim Garth (51 not out) gave the hosts hope of pulling off a famous win.
Ireland were genuine contenders at 160-4 with 15 overs left, but star spinner Sune Luus claimed a five-wicket haul to extinguish Irish ambitions, as they lost six wickets for 33 runs to finish on 193 all out.
