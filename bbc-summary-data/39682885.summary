Tottenham's Mousa Dembele  is a doubt after picking up an ankle injury in the win at Crystal Palace.

Goalkeeper Michel Vorm could return to the squad but Danny Rose is still absent with a knee injury.
Arsene Wenger has given centre-back Laurent Koscielny a "60% chance" of playing after suffering a knee injury against Leicester.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is fit but Shkodran Mustafi is missing with a thigh problem.
Guy Mowbray: "Tottenham's best approach would be to forget the title race for one day.
"Park all thoughts of Chelsea and concentrate on winning a derby - to end 21 seasons of St. Totteringham's Day.
"They'll have their own name for Arsenal not being able to catch them already. T-shirts might be on sale outside at full-time if it happens - but there's that 'if', which seems stronger now than a couple of weeks ago.
"The Gunners have rediscovered their scrapping gene in their last three games, and will (surely?!) fight tooth and nail to ruin their North London rivals' title bid.
"Arsenal's last visit to White Hart Lane as it stands and the 50th Premier League meeting of the teams could and should be memorable."

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "My feeling is now, when you are so close - only four points the gap - I will be very disappointed if we don't win the title.
"My challenge or my aim is not to be above Arsenal. My aim is to be above 19 teams and to be first, to be on the top.
"You cannot ignore Chelsea's game before us, but we played the day after they lost to Crystal Palace and it didn't affect our preparation."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "This is one of the only times where Spurs look in people's minds as the favourites.
"I expect an open, committed match with high pace and there could be goals as both teams play positive football.
"I don't think that the top three is decided. We have an opportunity to be in there only if we win our games, we don't have to speculate at all.
"There is a lot that can happen until the end of the season."
Spurs have now won eight league games on the spin but I just have a feeling that Arsenal will put a spanner in the works of their bid to catch Chelsea.
