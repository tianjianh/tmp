The attack happened at about 23:30 BST on Saturday in Rossdowney Drive.
The PSNI said the attack on the occupied house was "extremely reckless" and urged anyone who has any information to come forward.
Det Con Donnell said: "It is very fortunate we are not dealing with a death this morning.
"We believe at least two shots were fired through the front windows of the property."
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Christopher Jackson said "there was no place for guns on the streets of our city".
"This attack is wrong and must be condemned," he said.
"Thankfully no-one was injured in this incident but it must have been a frightening experience for those in the area at the time."
Gary Middleton, from the Democratic Unionist Party, said it was a "disturbing and worrying attack within our community".
"The reality is we could have been mourning the loss of life," he said.
"These actions are serious and criminal.  I would urge anyone with any information to contact the PSNI and bring forward any knowledge they may have of this attack."
SDLP councillor Martin Reilly described it as a "reckless and sinister" attack.
