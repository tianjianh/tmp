The Met Office issued at yellow "be aware" warning of the conditions at 08:45 for the Highlands and parts of Aberdeenshire and central Scotland.
The warning of ice and snow falling to about an inch (4cm) on ground above 656ft (200m) and to 3in (10cm) above 1,312ft (400m) is in place until 23:00.
Routes affected include the A82 at Altnafeadh and the A9 at Drumochter.
The Met Office said: "Be aware that some difficult driving conditions will be encountered today with the possibility of some local transport disruption.
"A cold showery westerly airstream will cover Scotland, with troughs of low pressure bringing some heavy and prolonged wintry showers through the day.
"While most of the snow showers will be found over higher ground, the heavier showers could bring snow to quite low levels at times."
The Cairngorms has been among places to have some of the heaviest snowfalls.
The area's Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig near Aviemore has three polar bears - two males Arktos and Walker and a female called Victoria.
The bears' birthdays were marked by park staff and visitors earlier on Friday with frozen treats.
