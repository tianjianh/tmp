The 37-year-old midfielder featured for an hour of Sunday's 4-0 loss to Ross County at Pittodrie.
"I wanted to stay in football and, although there were a few possibilities on the go, to remain here was a no-brainer," Robson told the Dons website.
"Ultimately, I would like to manage one day and this is a great way to learn the ropes."
Robson, who started his career with Inverness Caley Thistle, was a league winner with Celtic in 2008 and enjoyed League Cup success with Celtic and Aberdeen.
Capped 17 times by Scotland, he moved to hometown club Aberdeen in 2013.
