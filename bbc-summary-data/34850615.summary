European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) says it is working with the Ligue Nationale de Rugby, Premiership Rugby and the Pro12 to reschedule the ties.
"An announcement regarding the new dates will be made as soon as possible," read an EPCR statement.
Sunday's match between Stade Francais and Munster has also been postponed.
All round one pool games scheduled to be held in France last weekend, including Bath's trip to Toulon, Ulster's visit to Oyonnax and Racing 92's home game against Glasgow Warriors, were called off.
Pau's home game against Castres in the Challenge Cup was also postponed and will be rearranged.
Bath first-team coach Toby Booth said the Premiership side were keen to take on Toulon, the reigning European champions.
"We are desperate to play it and we are looking forward to pitching ourselves against the best in Europe," Booth told BBC Radio Bristol.
"It is very tough, as we know, to rejig things in such a congested schedule but I am sure we will come to some sort of conclusion."
Bath will belatedly start their Champions Cup campaign at home to Leinster in pool five on Saturday.
Booth said he was hopeful his players will feel reinvigorated after two weeks without a match since beating London Irish 45-14 in the Premiership.
"We have recruited a squad of high quality which we want to keep physically fresh," he added.
"The attrition rate in the Premiership is massive, so you need to do your best to maintain an output."
