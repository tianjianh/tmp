The 29-year-old was a free agent after being released by Oxford United at the end of last season having suffered a serious groin injury.
"He's had a couple of interrupted seasons with injury and we thought it was a good opportunity to bring him in on trial," Exeter manager Paul Tisdale told BBC Sport.
"He's a proven player with a pedigree in football higher than League Two."
Exeter have not divulged how long Hoskins' contract at St James Park will last for.
Hoskins, who is a former England Under-20 international, missed all of the 2013-14 season after injuring knee ligaments in a Championship match for Brighton in February 2013.
"The expectation we have of him is to ease himself through pre-season, which he has done," added Tisdale.
"He's got some real quality about him and we're hoping he'll force his way onto the bench in the first month of the season - and beyond that we'll see what happens."
