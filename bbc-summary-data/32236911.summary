The scheme, led by community interest group Shrewsbury Hydro, has already attracted funding of more than £100,000 to carry out studies.
It hopes to generate about 1.7 million kilowatt hours of electricity from the site next to the weir.
A public consultation opened on Wednesday and is expected to run until the end of the month.
Shropshire Council is expected to make a decision on the planning application by the end of May.
Details have also been submitted to the Environment Agency.
Shrewsbury Hydro believe the electricity generated would be enough to power more than 350 homes and save the equivalent of 900 tonnes of CO2 a year.
The project is expected to cost £3m-£3.5m and be funded by selling community shares.
