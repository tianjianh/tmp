West Yorkshire Police said the man was taken to hospital at about 15:00 GMT on Christmas Eve with abdominal injuries.
Part of Thornville Road, close to the junction with Alexandra Road, in Burley, Leeds, was cordoned off, while officers carried out forensic searches.
Police said the injured man had undergone surgery and is described as being in a stable condition.
Det Ch Insp Mark McManus said: "The incident continues to be treated as a targeted attack."
He said that two vehicles met at the location of the shooting, close to a BP petrol station.
"Officers have recovered a white-coloured Audi vehicle, but we are still keen to trace a dark or black-coloured hatchback car which we believe is connected to those involved in the shooting."
Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
