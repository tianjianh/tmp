Glasgow has the largest number of black and white sets at 200, followed by Edinburgh with 55.
TV Licensing Scotland revealed the figure as it reminded viewers they need a licence, however dated the model.
Regular colour broadcasts began on BBC Two in July 1967.
Britain became the first country in Europe to offer regular programming in colour, weeks ahead of Germany.
Yet almost 10,000 black and white licences are still in force across the UK.
The cost of a black and white licence is £49 compared with £145.50 for a colour licence.
Some black and white TVs may require a colour licence if they can receive and record programmes in colour.
TV Licensing Scotland spokesman Jason Hill said: "It's astounding that more than 550 households in Scotland still watch on a black and white telly, especially now that over half of homes access TV content over the internet, on smart TVs.
"Whether you have the latest 4K TV or a black and white set from the 1970s, if you are watching or recording live television, then you do need a TV licence."
Jim McLauchlan from the Museum of Communications in Burntisland, Fife, said there are an increasing number of collectors of old black and white sets.
He said: "It is now some years since I have come across anyone using a black and white television, though the occasional person has one tucked away in their attic.
"We certainly get them donated now and then to the museum and there are an increasing number of collectors throughout the UK collecting black and white sets from as early as the 1940s onwards, with some now fetching good prices.
"In general, younger visitors to the museum show very little interest in the black and white televisions but the occasional senior visitor will comment in a nostalgic way."
