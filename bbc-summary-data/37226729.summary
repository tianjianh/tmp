[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US goalkeeper Hope Solo will not play for club side Seattle Reign for the rest of the season - saying she is not in the right mental state.

The 35-year-old was banned for six months for calling Sweden "a bunch of cowards" after the United States' quarter-final defeat at the Olympics.
Solo, who has won the World Cup, said being "fired" from the national team after 17 years was "devastating".
NWSL side Seattle have four games of the regular season remaining.
"After careful consideration, I have decided to end my season with the Seattle Reign, an organisation I love playing for," Solo said in a statement. "Mentally, I am not there yet."
Solo has played 202 games for the US and won two Olympic gold medals.
Seattle coach Laura Harvey said she understood and respected Solo's decision.
