Seventh-tier Stourbridge lost 2-1 to the League Two side on Saturday.
"It was a full-blooded cup tie. There's a couple of Stourbridge players that opened my eyes a little," Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"I might be taking a trip to have a look because they did fantastically well and I really believe they'll do well in the league."
Stourbridge were the lowest-ranked team left in the competition and drew level at 1-1 when Dan Scarr turned home a second-half free-kick and looked on their way to a replay.
Their manager, Gary Hackett, has been in charge since 2005 and it was only a late Adebayo Akinfenwa header that denied his side a replay and another chance to make the fourth round.
"You can see why Gary has been in charge for so long," continued Ainsworth. "He's got his team organised, they work their socks off for him and the fans were awesome.
"Thank you to all the Stourbridge fans that came and made it a great cup tie, they probably won't like me at the minute.
"But what a result for us, when that ball hit the back of the net I was a relieved man.
Ainsworth, in charge since September 2012, is now the fourth longest-serving manager in the top four divisions of English football following the sacking of Steve Davis by Crewe on Sunday.
