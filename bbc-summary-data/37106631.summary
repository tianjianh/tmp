England lock Joe Launchbury has been appointed as captain of Wasps for the 2016-17 Premiership season.

The 25-year-old, who has won 35 caps for England, replaces co-captains James Haskell and Matt Mullan in the role.
"Joe is a natural leader and has grown with the responsibility of being a leader," Wasps director Dai Young said.
Launchbury, who has played 91 times for Wasps since his debut in 2011, added: "It's a massive honour and something I am very excited about."
Haskell and Mullan co-captained Wasps last season as they finished third in the Premiership, but Haskell has been ruled out for the majority of the upcoming campaign after picking up a foot injury playing for England against Australia in July.
Launchbury's appointment comes after loose-head prop Mullan had captained Wasps in a stint lasting almost three years.
Young continued: "I feel three years is probably the right amount of time before then passing the baton on and have someone else step up.
"But with Matt's calibre and experience, you certainly wouldn't rule out the possibility of them doing the job again sometime in the future."
