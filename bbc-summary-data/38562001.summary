Bradford: RFL to consider four bids to set up new team in the city

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Rugby Football League will consider four bids to create a new professional club in Bradford after the liquidation of the Bulls earlier this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After no buyer was found for the old club, the RFL requested submissions of interest before Monday's deadline.
Prospective buyers must provide proof of funds and relevant experience.
The confidential bids will be assessed by the governing body's executive and recommendations "as soon as possible", though there is no public timescale.
There has been a rugby league presence in the city of Bradford since before the birth of Northern Union in 1895. Two local clubs, Bradford FC and Manningham, were among the founding members.
Northern continued the legacy after being founded in 1907 and enjoyed success in spite of a reformation of their own in 1964, winning the Challenge Cups and establishing the careers of stars such as Welsh ex-union convert Trevor Foster, Ellery Hanley and Brian Noble.
Meanwhile, the Bulls were groundbreakers in terms of marketing and on-field success in the Super League era before their recent downturn in fortunes.
"Bradford is a great city with a rich rugby league heritage and deserves a professional club that supporters can be proud of," the RFL added.
