The 29-year-old met with brother and Bristol back Luke when he visited their team hotel the night before the match, which the West Country side won 24-23.
Sale suspended Arscott on 4 January and carried out an internal investigation.
Arscott said he was "extremely disappointed", but would assist the RFU with their own ongoing investigation.
The issue came to light on Tuesday when it was revealed Sale had complained to the Rugby Football Union that Arscott had released confidential details.
However, Bristol boss Mark Tainton insisted "nothing of any sporting value" had been passed on to his coaches.
"This has been a very difficult time for myself and my family and I will consult with my advisors before considering my next steps," Arscott said in a statement.
"In the meantime, I will cooperate fully and willingly with the ongoing RFU investigation and will not be making further comment until this has been concluded."
Sale, who have lost their past 10 matches in all competitions, said they would be making no further comment on Arscott's dismissal "in accordance with the club's disciplinary procedure".
Arscott, who can also play full-back, spent three years at Bristol between 2007 and 2010 before joining Sale from London Welsh in 2013.
He suffered a serious knee injury in March last year that kept him out for eight months.
