Christopher Meli: Teenagers charged with Twinbrook murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three teenagers have appeared in court charged with the murder of a man in west Belfast's Twinbrook estate at the weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Meli, 20, was found dead near houses at Glasvey Close. Detectives said he had suffered a sustained and vicious assault.
In court were Stephen McCann, 18, of Bearnagh Glen and Lee Smyth, also 18, of Colinbrook Gardens, both in Belfast.
A 16-year-old boy also appeared, but cannot be named for legal reasons.
Bail was applied for Mr McCann, but was refused.
A detective sergeant told the court he could connect all three with the crime.
When questioned by lawyers for the three accused, the detective discussed the events of the night Mr Meli was killed. It was an often confused picture of many figures and shifting groups and claims of fighting, sometimes with a knife.
All three teenagers were remanded in custody to appear again by video link on 11 January.
About 30 relatives and friends of Mr Meli, including his parents Christopher and Kathy were present in Lisburn Magistrates court for the hearing, sometimes crying out. Some left the court before the proceedings ended.
Two teenagers aged 18 and 17, who were arrested by detectives on Sunday, have been released on bail pending further inquiries.
Two more arrests were made by police on Tuesday evening.
