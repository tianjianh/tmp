A man has been shot dead in Dublin in what police believe could be a reprisal for a murder at a boxing match weigh-in on Friday.

Eddie Hutch Snr, who was in his 50s, was killed near his flat in Poplar Row, North Strand, in the north inner city.
Ireland's justice minister Frances Fitzgerald called it "another deplorable example of the ruthlessness of gangland criminals".
It comes days after David Byrne, 33, was killed at the Regency Hotel match.
Friday's shooting was claimed by a group purporting to be the Continuity IRA, a dissident republican faction.
However, a second statement made on Monday evening, also claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, denied any involvement in the attack at the hotel.
Mr Hutch's nephew Gary Hutch was also  shot dead in Spain in September.
It is understood four men were involved in Monday's attack, which happened at 19:45 GMT.
Speaking about the shooting, Ms Fitzgerald said: "It seems that some gangs are intent on waging a feud where human life counts for nothing.
"The gardai [Irish police] will take all necessary steps to try to prevent further bloodshed but we have to recognise the challenges they face. Members of gangs who have fears for their safety should come forward to the gardai."
Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan and senior investigators will hold talks with the minister on Tuesday.
Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams condemned Monday's attack, saying it has "brought further fear and intimidation to the streets [of Dublin]".
He added: "Those behind this latest shooting, and those behind the dreadful attack last Friday at the Regency Hotel, must be apprehended and taken off our streets."
