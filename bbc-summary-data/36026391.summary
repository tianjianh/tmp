Colchester double murder trial: Knife 'found in boy's blazer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knife was found inside the lining of a school blazer belonging to a teenager accused of two murders, a court has heard.

Latex gloves were also stuffed inside the pockets of the garment after the boy, 17, was arrested in May last year, Guildford Crown Court heard.
He has admitted the manslaughter of James Attfield, 33, and Nahid Almanea, 31, in Colchester in 2014.
But he has denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Jurors heard how the items were found after the teenager's arrest in May 2015, as well as material relating to high-profile serial killers, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe.
The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, told police he killed Mr Attfield, who suffered 102 knife wounds, and that voices had told him to "sacrifice people".
Earlier, PC Ben Savory, who was called after Mr Attfield's body was found in Castle Park, said he was "so covered in blood" he could not make out his skin or hair colour.
The victim's right eye was "protruding out of its socket", he said, and a wound to his scalp had left his skull exposed.
Officers at the scene attempted to revive Mr Attfield, PC Savory said, but he was declared dead at the scene.
A blooded trainer imprint was found about 3ft (1m) from Mr Attfield's body, the officer said.
PC Savory said they noticed further footprints stretching about 10m (30ft) away which were consistent with somebody running away.
Previously, the court heard how a book called The World's Worst Crimes was recovered among the boy's possessions along with a DVD about Sutcliffe, as well as a picture of the notorious killer on his phone.
On Monday, the defendant changed his plea to a third charge, of possessing an offensive weapon, to guilty.
The trial continues.
