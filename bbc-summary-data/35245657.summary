A yellow "be aware" warning is in place ahead of a band of heavy rain moving in from the west on Wednesday evening. It should clear by Thursday morning.
It comes as diversions were put in place at two locations on the Pembrokeshire coastal path after cliff falls damaged the route.
Recent heavy rain has been blamed.
Anthony Richards, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority's access manager, said: "The diversions are clearly signposted and we would ask that people follow these temporary routes while work to re-align the path is being completed."
The current closures and concerns on the 186-mile national trail are:
Wales saw the highest level of rainfall across the UK in December, although it was parts of northern England which bore the brunt of the floods.
The latest Met Office weather warning is in place for Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, Torfaen and the Vale of Glamorgan.
