Mountain rescuers in Snowdonia clocked up 750 hours in work responding to a record number of callouts last month.

Many of the 34 alerts in August could have been avoided if walkers had taken precautions, Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team said.
They claim Snowdon is being treated as a "tourist destination, rather than a mountain", with people ill-prepared.
They had to rescue walkers stranded on Tuesday night without a torch after they were caught out.
Meanwhile, a walker had to be airlifted to hospital after falling on to a ledge while leaning over to take a photograph at a beauty spot.
Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation carried the man, in his 60s, to a waiting helicopter after the incident in the Conwy valley on Wednesday which took almost three hours to conclude.
