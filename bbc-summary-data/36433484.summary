NHS Grampian 'needs to save millions of pounds'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Grampian needs to make millions of pounds of cuts to balance its budget, the health board has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It needs to save Â£18.5m in the year ahead.
NHS Grampian wants to see a reduction in the use of locums and agency nurses, as well as cutting back the reliance on the private sector to help meet treatment time guarantees.
The health board will hear it faces financial challenges replacing Â£44m of ageing medical equipment.
It is also predicted that Â£100m will need to be invested in GP practices in the coming years to cope with a potential rise in patient numbers.
