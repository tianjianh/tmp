The company is increasing the number of flights on its winter schedule from October.
Belfast International said it would mean more than 125,000 extra seats will be on sale on its routes to Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.
Additional capacity will also be added to services to Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester.
Belfast International said the move "could lead to over 100 new aviation-related jobs in Northern Ireland."
Easyjet operates to 26 destinations from Belfast and already employs 230 staff locally.
Airport managing director Graham Keddie said: "Increasing the number of seats will mean significant increases in airport activity.
"This is a good day for the airport, but an even better one for the Northern Ireland economy."
The winter schedule covers the four months from October.
Easyjet said this coming winter 9,620 flights are on sale from Belfast, providing 1,585,968 seats.
Last winter 8,711 flights were on sale providing 1,394,408 seats.
