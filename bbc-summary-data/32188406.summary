Woolly rhino skull to go on display in England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The skull of a woolly rhinoceros, thought to be at least 35,000 years old, is to go on display near where it was found in Cambridgeshire, England.

The fossil was uncovered by a digger driver on farmland in October last year.
Jamie Jordan, a "self-taught palaeontologist", said the skull was covered in "horrible black" clay and had to be cleaned with small dental picks and lollipop sticks.
It will be the "star attraction" at the Fossils Galore shop and museum from 11 April.
Palaeontologist Professor Adrian Lister, from the Natural History Museum, said: "Woolly rhinos were herbivores with low-slung heads who roamed the plains chomping on grass.
"Most similar fossils to this date from the last ice age, about 75,000 to 35,000 years ago."
