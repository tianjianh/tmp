The man, in his 30s and from the Midlands, was part of a group of three who were climbing down the Crib Goch ridge when the incident happened at about 11:00 BST.
Llanberis mountain rescue said they were called at 13:00 when the other two raised the alarm.
It is believed the group had turned back because of heavy snow.
A spokesman for Llanberis mountain rescue said it was a "tragic accident".
