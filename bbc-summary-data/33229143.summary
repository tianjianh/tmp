They will join Openreach, BT's local network business, to install new lines, fix faults and help bring high-speed fibre broadband to homes and businesses across the country.
A third of the new engineers will be based in the Highlands and Islands and the north east of Scotland.
BT said its engineers were currently connecting about 5,000 Scottish homes a week to fibre broadband services.
The new posts will be in addition to the 90 apprenticeships announced by BT for Scotland in April.
Openreach recruited 260 engineers in Scotland during the past financial year to bring its total Scottish workforce to 2,800.
