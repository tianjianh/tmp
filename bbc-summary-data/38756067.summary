More than 500 Triumph bikers have broken the world record for the longest ever parade of the iconic motorcycles.

Each of the 539 riders donated their entry fee to a fund set up by a 29-year-old woman who has had a series of brain tumours since she was four.
Jessica Simpkin's charity has now raised more than Â£31,000 for research into children's brain tumours.
Her mother, Jo French, said they were "in awe of every single rider that turned up".
The event in September was organised by Staffordshire Triumph and closed a section of the A617 in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire for a short time.
Earlier this week they had confirmation from Guinness World Records they had broken the world record - which previously stood at 362.
Mick Duckworth, who saw the parade, said many of the Triumph motorcycles were "post-1990 products of Triumph Motorcycles in Hinckley".
He said there was also a 1937 machine produced at Triumph's pre-war plant in Coventry and one with a sidecar attached.
The money raised will go to the Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre.
It will help pay for further research into early diagnosis of brain tumours and new treatments.
Miss Simpkin, from Rainworth, Nottinghamshire, was first diagnosed with medulloblastoma - an aggressive and malignant brain cancer - aged four.
When she was 19 doctors discovered she had another brain tumour and she was recently diagnosed with a further five.
Mrs French said: "There were lots of different people from all walks of life with problems themselves and they all came together that day, it was fantastic."
