Marcus Dove says he is inspired by Picasso's idea that "acts of art start with acts of destruction".
"Then I was talking to my grandfather about the war, and I've seen some Bond movies, and the idea came to me - use pyrotechnics to make art," he said.
With help from engineers he created the launcher but also uses flares, blowtorches and black powder tape.
He admitted the process had involved a lot of trial and error.
"The first time I did not ask anybody," he said.
"I was in a car park testing it out and some security came round.
"I thought they were going to tell me and off and say 'you can't be doing this' - but they offered to block off the whole top level for me."
Earlier this year, Mr Dove, who is a recent graduate of Leicester's De Montfort University, created an artwork for Baroness Lawrence to mark her appointment as the university's chancellor.
