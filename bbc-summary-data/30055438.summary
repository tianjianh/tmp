The 18-year-old has scored eight goals for the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League club this season.
Robins boss Kevin Wilson said: "It's a relief that it has finally been sorted because there's no doubt that all the activity and speculation has been a disruptive influence around the place.
"But I'm absolutely delighted and we all wish him well in his future."
