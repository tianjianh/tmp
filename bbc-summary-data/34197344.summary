HGS Europe chief executive Matthew Vallance said: "The creation of these 500 new roles across our sites in Preston and Selkirk will provide significant career opportunities in the local areas, and allow us to achieve our growth ambitions.
"We are delighted to be immediately augmenting our existing teams of talented professionals.
"We appreciate the support received at the national level from organisations such as UK Trade and Investment, Scottish Development International, Scottish Enterprise, and at the local level by Lancashire County Council, all of whom have helped us drive our expansion plans forward."
