[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anthony Grainger inquiry: 'No warning' before shooting by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man in the car at the time an unarmed man was shot dead by police said he was not ordered to raise his hands by officers, a public inquiry has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Grainger, 36, from Bolton was shot in the chest by a firearms officer during a Greater Manchester Police operation in Cheshire on 3 March 2012.
David Totton was in a stolen Audi in a car park in Culcheth with Mr Grainger.
He told the inquiry into his friend's death he did not hear anyone shout "armed police show me your hands".
Mr Totton described the moment an unmarked police car pulled into the car park, blocking them in.
He said: "I can hear the engine of a car speeding up... screeches in front of us.
"As it stopped, or before it stopped, I've heard a bang... feeling shards of glass in my face.
"At the time I didn't know what it was but I thought it could have been a bullet."
He was asked questions about the evidence of police officer Q9, who previously told the inquiry he shouted a warning and only fired when Mr Grainger disobeyed his order by moving his hand in a "deliberate" way towards his lap.
Leslie Thomas QC, for Anthony Grainger's family, asked: "Did anybody shout 'show me your hands' before the shards of glass?"
Mr Totton replied: "No."
He told the inquiry he was "clearly not" planning to carry out an armed robbery at the time as "you'd have to be armed to commit an armed robbery".
He said they visited Culcheth a number of times in March 2012 because they were looking for a man who owed Mr Grainger money.
They were wearing balaclavas and gloves because they were in a stolen car and took the measures in case they were chased, he added.
The inquiry continues.
