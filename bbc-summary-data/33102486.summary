The 20 singers competing include three each from the United States and South Korea.
Swansea soprano CÃ©line Forrest 24, will represent Wales after winning the Welsh Singers Competition.
As part of the warm-up for the event, she and bass singer Blaise Malaba, representing DR Congo, visited Radnor Road Primary School in Canton - which has a few budding singers of its own.
