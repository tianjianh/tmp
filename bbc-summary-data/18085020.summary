Cardiff City FC and the Football Association of Wales agreed to fund the remaining £14,000 for the tribute to Fred Keenor.
It is hoped the bronze statue will be in place outside Cardiff City Stadium in September.
Fans chose a design by artist Roger Andrews, who produced the Millennium Stadium's Sir Tasker Watkins statue.
Cardiff City Supporters' Trust and appeal spokesperson Phillip Nifield said: "It is just over two years since we officially launched the appeal and, providing there are no hiccups, the statue should be in a position to be erected in September.
"The statue is almost ready to go to the foundry and we're sure football supporters will welcome the finished image.
"It will be a great landmark outside the Cardiff City Stadium."
Besides supporter donations and cash raised through fundraising events, Cardiff council provided £15,000 and the Welsh government contributed £5,000.
Keenor had been wounded at the Somme in World War I but eventually returned to Cardiff City.
The tough-tackling Cardiff-born defender led City to FA Cup victory at Wembley Stadium in 1927 after the Bluebirds beat Arsenal 1-0 to become the only team outside of England to win the trophy.
In 2010, the approach to Cardiff City Stadium was named Ffordd Fred Keenor.
