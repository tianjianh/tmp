The 20-year-old, who spent 13 years at Watford's academy, has signed a two-year deal and will link up with the club's development squad.
Byers represented Scotland from Under-16 to Under-18 level and made one substitute appearance for Watford in the 2014-15 Championship season.
"It is a great opportunity for me, one which I am relishing. I can't wait to get started," said Essex-born Byers.
"I have come to a point in my career where I needed a change. I was at Watford for 13 years, now I am looking for that next step.
"Swansea's style of play was a big factor for me signing. Creativity is a big part of my game, I like to create chances but also do the hard work and battle in midfield to win the ball.
"There will be a lot of hard work for me from this point, I want to prove myself to people here and I am looking forward to getting started."
