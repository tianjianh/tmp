[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the public are being invited to express an interest in colourful beach huts on the Borders coast.
Scottish Borders Council recently got planning permission for 11 new buildings at Coldingham Bay.
The sites are owned by the local authority and then leased to tenants who can put up a hut.
There are currently 61 huts of various different colours constructed at Coldingham, some of which are believed to be about 100 years old.
The planning permission recently received also allows owners of the current beach huts to replace their facility, subject to conditions around style and colour.
An SBC spokesman said: "The successful block planning application was made by the council to allow owners to continue to display their individual tastes, while ensuring the huts conform to SBC's long-term plans for the site.
"We would encourage anyone interested in acquiring a beach hut, or renewing their current hut, to get in touch."
