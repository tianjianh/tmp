Hong Kong shoe shops lose out because of higher rents

On a gently curved street in the leafy neighbourhood of Happy Valley in Hong Kong, a lone shoe shop stands amid a row of consecutive property agencies.

Gigi Shoes has occupied this prime spot on Wong Nai Chung Road since 1975.
But this week, after four decades in business, the sole hold-out on a street once known as the best area in town to purchase handmade women's shoes is closing, a victim of rising rental prices.
Its founder and owner Ng Chung-fu, 88, had failed to agree a new lease with the landlord.
"Our business is doing well. We have a lot of customers who want us to keep going," he says.
Mr Ng started working with shoes in his teens, before becoming his own boss in his late 40s with the well-known store on Hong Kong's "shoe street".
"The customers say they are very happy with our service and have nowhere else to go to buy shoes. When I hear that, I feel really helpless."
Gentrification is a trend all over the world.
But in Hong Kong, it has been happening at break-neck pace due to low interest rates, a booming retail industry and the rise of the mainland Chinese economy.
According to figures from property firm Jones Lang Lasalle, rental prices at high street shops in Causeway Bay, a prime shopping district just a few minutes walk from Gigi Shoes, have risen by 45% since the beginning of 2010.
Compared to prices a decade ago, commercial rentals in the area have more than doubled.
Another index from Jones Lang Lasalle grouping rental prices in four of Hong Kong's top retail neighbourhoods - Causeway Bay, Central, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mongkok - shows a nearly identical trend.
"I've taken friends to that shoe store," says Denis Ma, head of Hong Kong research at JLL. "Most locals who need tailored shoes, either they have really small feet or gigantic feet, go to that street. It has changed a lot in the last 10 years."
Now Gigi is surrounded by nine property agencies advertising the latest commercial or residential deals.
Mr Ng's son, Desmond, 50, says the store has a profit margin of about 5%, which is average in the industry.
The business was more profitable 10 years ago, when costs were lower and competition less plentiful.
The younger Mr Ng says there were no long, drawn-out negotiations with the landlord because the property owner understood the store's finances and knew what they could afford.
Mr Ma of JLL says the general rule of thumb is that rental costs should not exceed 30% of revenue, for a business to be sustainable.
On a recent afternoon several days ahead of the closing, old and new customers flock to Gigi, lured by sale prices between 60% and 80% lower than usual.
A pair of comfortable yet elegant leather ballet slippers sells for 200 Hong Kong dollars ($25.80; Â£16.80).
Shiny patent leather pumps cost just 400 Hong Kong dollars.
The elder Mr Ng and two of his three children, Desmond and Annie, busily serve the shoppers, who include office worker Hazel Chan, 30.
"It is so sad that it's closing," says the customer of five years. "I think Hong Kong people like these family-owned shops because they are nicer to you, and the service is better."
She laments the disappearance of the mum and pop shops of her youth, when she was able to purchase snacks for one or two Hong Kong dollars after school.
Ms Chan's two friends, who each snap up several pairs of shoes, note that residential rental prices have been soaring too.
China's slowing economy and possible future interest rate hikes may present a silver lining for Mr Ng, who hopes to re-open the store at another location.
Mr Ma reckons high street shop rentals will fall by 20% to 25% this year, compared to 2014.
It would be the first such fall since global financial crisis of 2008.
Marcos Chan, a Hong Kong-based research director at property firm CBRE, says retail rental prices in nearby Causeway Bay have already dropped by an average of 22% so far this year, and are expected to fall even more.
It is good news for the elder Mr Ng, who professes to wanting to retire, passing the torch to his son Desmond.
But even as he is closing down his four-decade old business, the shoe designer is still looking for inspiration from French fashion magazines.
Perhaps, at 88 years, he will re-invent himself again.
