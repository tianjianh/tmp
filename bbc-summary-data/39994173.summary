However, it will not be marked as a first win over full member opposition as the two-game series was not given full one-day international status.
Chasing 287 from 50 overs, captain Coetzer made 118, adding 201 for the first wicket with Cross (106 not out) as they won with 7.1 overs to spare.
Sussex seam bowler Stuart Whittingham took 3-56 on his Scotland debut.
The teams meet again at the same venue on Tuesday.
"It's a massive step forward for Scottish cricket," Cross told BBC Scotland after making his highest score in international colours.
"It was a convincing victory against a side with plenty of Test match experience. We dominated and ran out comfortable winners."
Coetzer's 118 came from 84 balls, with Cross adding: "Kyle made it look easy. He took all the pressure off me."
Earlier, Dinesh Chandimal top-scored for Sri Lanka on 79, with Chamara Kapugedera reaching 71 from 50 balls and opener Kusal Perera making 57 as the visitors were bowled out for 287.
Alasdair Evans joined Whittingham in taking three wickets, with Chris Sole bagging a brace, while 24-year-old wicketkeeper Cross made it a day to remember with four catches behind the stumps.
Sri Lanka are warming up for the ICC Champions Trophy, taking place in England and Wales from 1-18 June, where they will play India, Pakistan and South Africa in Group B.
