Oxford resident Larry Sanders voted as Democrats Abroad opened a city polling station on so-called Super Tuesday.
Democrats Abroad is treated as a state, offering Americans overseas a vote in the Democratic presidential race.
UK polling booths also opened in London, Cambridge, Edinburgh and St Andrews until March 8.
Larry Sanders, who ran for the Green Party in the 2015 general election, said: "It is a great moment of pride.
"I am voting for my younger brother to be President."
Larry Sanders is a retired social worker and academic.
His brother Bernie is battling Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party's nomination to stand as the presidential candidate in the US election in November.
Larry Sanders, who cast his vote at the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford, said: "I think it is going to be a very, very close election and these delegates could make a difference.
"It is enormous; it is not just an election for president but it is at a critical time in modern world history.
"Bernard's positions are very important, so I am voting for someone who could make a huge difference for the world.
"And he's my brother."
The brothers grew up in Brooklyn in New York and Larry moved to the UK in the 1960s.
Republican voters can only participate via individual absentee ballots.
