[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luke Jones killed woman in 'savage attack', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "jealous and possessive" man killed his ex-girlfriend in a "savage attack", a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Jones denies murdering Natasha Bradbury, 27, at her Haverfordwest flat in February.
Prosecutor Paul Lewis said: "He effectively beat Miss Bradbury to death in her own home".
The 33-year-old is on trial at Swansea Crown Court, where the jury heard Miss Bradbury was left with cracked ribs, neck, brain, heart and liver injuries.
During police interview, Mr Jones said she was injured after falling over in her flat.
But Mr Lewis described him as "jealous and possessive", saying he had conducted "a savage attack on her".
He added: "The account he gave to the police was a pack of lies. To avoid the consequences of what he had done to Miss Bradbury."
The jury was shown records of WhatsApp conversations between the two in the four days before Miss Bradbury's death.
Exchanges deteriorated when she asked if she could stay at a friend's house instead of seeing him.
He told her that he was lonely and felt her friends were more important to her than he was, before accusing her of seeing someone else.
The case continues.
