[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There has been shock and anger in India after a shooting at a bar in the US state of Kansas left one Indian man, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, dead and another, Alok Madasani, wounded. Police are investigating whether the shooting was racially motivated. The BBC takes a closer look at the two men and an American, Ian Grillot, who was also injured.

Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, was from the city of Hyderabad, in the southern Indian state of Telangana. He moved to the US in 2005 to take a master's degree in electrical engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso.
He then worked for six years as a software and systems engineer at Rockwell Collins Inc in Iowa before moving to Kansas and taking a job with GPS-maker Garmin at Olathe.
Garmin is one of the best-known employers in the area.
Mr Kuchibhotla was married but had no children. His widow, Sunayana Dumala, told reporters that the gunman had taken "a very loveable soul from everyone."
A closed-door vigil was held on the Garmin campus on Friday, where Ms Dumala addressed a group of about 200 workers who took part.
Alok Madasani, 32, was wounded in the thigh in Wednesday's shooting. He was later released from hospital and was able to attend the vigil at Garmin.
He graduated from the Vasavi College of Engineering in Hyderabad in 2006 and moved to the US as a master's student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, according to his LinkedIn page.
Like Srinivas Kuchibhotla, he worked at Rockwell Collins Inc before moving to Garmin in 2014.
Workers at the bar where the shooting took place said the two men met there twice a week and were known as "the Jameson guys", as they liked to drink Jameson whiskey.
Amid widespread shock in India following the shooting, Mr Madasani's father, Jaganmohan Reddy, said he had spoken to his son by phone and feared for his safety.
"I request other parents to think twice before sending their children to the United States," he said.
A spokesman for the Indian embassy in Washington, Pratik Mathur, said officials had met Mr Madasani and were "ensuring his well-being".
A worker at the bar in Olathe told the Kansas City Star that when the suspected gunman, Adam Purinton, began harassing the two Indian men, Ian Grillot "stood up for them".
Mr Grillot, 24, of Grandview, Missouri, suffered bullet wounds to his hand and chest, according to the Star, and is still in hospital.
He brushed aside suggestions that he was a hero when he spoke to local TV News channel KMBC from his hospital bed.
"I was just doing what anyone should have done for another human being," he said. "It's not about where he's from or his ethnicity.
"We're all humans. So I just felt I did what was naturally right to do."
