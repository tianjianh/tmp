Scott Anderson: Wakefield Wildcats prop announces retirement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield Wildcats prop Scott Anderson has announced he will retire from rugby league at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anderson made 44 appearances for Wildcats after joining from NRL side Brisbane Broncos in November 2013.
The 30-year-old started his career with Melbourne Storm, before signing for the Broncos for the 2010 season.
"I have had a few injuries these past couple of years which have set me back, and it is time I listen to what my body is telling me," he said.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here, it is a great club with some fantastic supporters and I wish them all the best for next season."
