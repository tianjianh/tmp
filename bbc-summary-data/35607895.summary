The Pro12 champions take on Munster at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park on Friday after switching the game from Scotstoun, where the pitch is unplayable.
It's the third time this year Glasgow have changed venue for a home fixture.
"Discussions are at an advanced stage and we hope to announce something very soon," said Townsend.
"I'm very confident that we will have an artificial pitch in place at Scotstoun for the start of next season.
"Scotstoun is unplayable and has been for a number of weeks. There is a guarantee when you come to a 3G or 4G pitch that you can play.
"I've been speaking to football managers this week. Football actually want a wetter pitch, they want the ball to move along the pitch quicker.
"Obviously their pitch isn't damaged as much by scrums and heavy people on them.
"We would love to play on grass pitches like a bowling green all year round but that doesn't happen. The alternative for us are 3G pitches."
