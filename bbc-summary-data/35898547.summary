It happened on the B9006 near Culloden Moor at about 18:50 on Thursday.
Georgia Gilham, 16, from Inverness, and John Foggo, 18, from North Kessock, were both passengers in a Corsa which collided with a Mercedes.
The 19-year-old male driver of the Corsa and a 16-year-old female passenger suffered serious injuries.
The driver and passenger of the white Mercedes C Class were also taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for treatment and later discharged with no serious injuries.
The road was closed for about seven hours to allow investigations to take place.
Insp Ian Graham said: "Our thoughts are with the families and friends of Georgia and John, who tragically lost their lives as a result of last night's collision.
"I would like to thank those who assisted at the scene and to the fire and ambulance service for their support during the incident.
"Inquiries are still ongoing into the circumstances. I would urge anyone who may have information that would assist, and who hasn't yet come forward, to do so as soon as possible."
