[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-1 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Roberts netted a late penalty as Portsmouth's rise up the League Two table continued with a win at Exeter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder smashed the spot-kick down the middle of the goal after Pierce Sweeney was adjudged to have fouled substitute Kai Naismith in the area.
Portsmouth controlled the opening 45 minutes with Exeter struggling to get out of their half, but the visitors were unable to find that killer touch until late on.
Christian Burgess headed wide of goal, Roberts and Danny Rose fired efforts wide and high while the latter also saw another goal-bound shot bravely blocked by Troy Brown.
Exeter's one chance of the half fell to striker Liam McAlinden, who failed to react quickly enough to a cross and scuffed his shot into the arms of David Forde.
Curtis Main headed wide as the onslaught continued from Pompey and substitute Conor Chaplin saw a shot deflect just wide of the far post.
An Exeter counter led to Jake Taylor crossing, but Pompey cleared with Joel Grant lurking, while Pompey substitute Noel Hunt almost scored with his first touch but was denied by Bobby Olejnik.
However, Pompey finally broke the deadlock in the 85th minute when Roberts kept his composure from 12 yards, lifting his side into eighth place in the table.
