[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman pleads guilty to Thirsk care home murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has pleaded guilty to the murder of an elderly man at a North Yorkshire care home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heather Davidson, 53, of Sowerby Road, Thirsk, was remanded in custody at Teesside Crown Court and is due to be sentenced there on 5 June.
Police were called to the privately-run Sowerby House care home on 11 February, after 81-year-old David Paterson was found dead in his room.
Ms Davidson is thought to have known Mr Paterson through church.
North Yorkshire Police said Ms Davidson did not work at the care home, which remained open during the investigation.
The basis of her plea was not revealed in court, but it was understood she will claim it was a mercy killing.
Mr Paterson's relatives described him as "a devoted family man" and told the court that he had lived in the Thirsk area all his life, and worked as a welder for 30 years.
