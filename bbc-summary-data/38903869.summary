[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has issued a notice warning horse owners their animals will be removed from common land if they fail to register them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City of Lincoln Council put up notices for the South Common after five unregistered horses were found grazing.
The authority is asking owners to either remove their animals, or get them registered.
It said all horses needed to undergo a series of checks to ensure their welfare.

Any resident in Lincoln is allowed to keep horses on common land in the city, but must comply with the regulations, the authority said.
These include having their animals micro-chipped and linked to a horse passport.
Horses must also be examined by a vet to make sure they are free of disease, and cannot be used for commercial purposes.
There are also strict rules on breeding and giving birth.
It was not known if any of the horses involved had been abandoned, a council spokesperson said.
But changes to the law made in 2015 mean the authority now has the power to seize the animals and re-home them more quickly
