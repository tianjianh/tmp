The trip to JLR, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, was Narendra Modi's final engagement of his three-day visit to the UK.
Mr Modi was given a tour of the new production facility at the West Midlands plant for the new Jaguar XE sports saloon.
He said the "focus on technology, quality and innovation is impressive".
Earlier, Mr Modi unveiled a statue on the bank of the River Thames of the 12th Century Indian philosopher Basaveshwara.
He also spoke about the terror attacks in Paris, calling them "barbaric" and saying he "condemns them in the strongest terms."
At the heart of these big foreign visits is trade.  India is now the fastest growing large economy in the world and David Cameron would like the UK to get a piece of the action.
Meanwhile Mr Modi wants to promote his signature policy and encourage British firms to "Make in India".
The big theme of this visit is about how the two nations can enhance their "partnership".
Mr Modi will be hoping footage of him at Buckingham Palace and being cheered by a huge crowd in Wembley stadium will help burnish his image in India after his humiliating defeat in the state election in Bihar.
But he is a controversial figure and the visit is likely to be marred by demonstrations and protests.
Mr Modi's visit to Britain has seen the unveiling of Â£9bn of commercial deals between India and the UK.
On Friday, Mr Modi was greeted with cheers from a 60,000-strong crowd at Wembley stadium as he arrived on stage with David Cameron.
He also had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
But he has faced protests over his record as chief minister of Gujarat, where he is accused of doing little to stop the 2002 religious riots when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed - allegations he has consistently denied.
