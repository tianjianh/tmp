[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-men Leyton Orient suffered their 16th home league defeat of the season as Wycombe won at the Football League's bottom club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side had Tom Parkes sent off after 28 minutes before newly-appointed manager Omer Riza was sent to the stand for verbal abuse at referee Charles Breakspear as the teams returned for the second half.
It was 11 defining first-half minutes that proved decisive in the final outcome.
Orient had looked the better side until defender Parkes was shown a red card for a high challenge on Garry Thompson.
The Chairboys then netted twice in two minutes. An intended clearance by the home side struck defender Michael Collins and the ball rebounded to the unmarked Matt Bloomfield who accepted a simple chance to open the scoring after 37 minutes.
Then, shortly afterwards, Orient's Jens Janse and his goalkeeper Sam Sargeant collided and Weston pounced on the loose ball to double the lead.
The visitors coasted through the second half to comfortably protect their lead.
