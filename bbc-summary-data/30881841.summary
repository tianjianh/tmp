How much are you worth: The world's wealth in pictures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The world's richest 1%, around 70 million people (or the population of the UK and Ireland), will own more than the other 99% put together by next year.

A research paper from Oxfam suggests that the wealthiest 1% own on average £1.8m each of global assets and they'll own more than 50% of the world's assets by next year.
There are approximately seven billion people in the world.
Eighty per cent of the world's population (about 5.6 billion people) own just 5.5% of wealth - an average of £2,500 each.
The 80 richest people in the world have the same wealth as the poorest 50% (around 3.5 billion people).
Those 80 people could fit into a double-decker bus.
It would take nearly 44 million buses to transport the world's poorest 50% of people.
Oxfam says that 52% of global wealth not owned by the richest 1% is owned by those in the richest 20% (1.4 billion people).
With 80% of the population owning 5.5% of global wealth (£2,544 per adult in 2014), the world's elite 1% has an average wealth of £1.8m per adult.
That could buy you quite a few gold bars.
