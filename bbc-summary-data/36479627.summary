The 40-year-old played for Leeds and Sheffield United in the late 1990s and former Blades team-mate Michael Brown is on the coaching staff at Vale Park.
Ribeiro's last job in management was at Bulgarian side Ludogorets in 2015.
Vale have been without a manager since Rob Page joined Northampton Town.
Ribeiro started his coaching career at Portuguese top-flight side Vitoria Setubal in March 2011 but was sacked a year later.
He returned to the club in January 2015 before taking over at Ludogorets where he lasted only two months.
Former Finland striker Kuqi, who made over 400 appearances for clubs including Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich and Crystal Palace, is currently in charge of PK-35 Vantaa who are bottom of the Finnish top flight.
Under Page, Vale finished 12th in League One last season, nine points outside the play-off positions.
