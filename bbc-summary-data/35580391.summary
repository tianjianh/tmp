Ms Dorrian, 25, was last seen at a party at a caravan site in Ballyhalbert on 28 February 2005.
Despite land and sea searches, her body has never been found.
In a statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the latest search was the result of "new information" being provided to them.
The general area had been searched in 2012 when police were looking for a vehicle.
This time, the search is concentrated on a different area of farmland and specialist search teams are looking for human remains.
The detective leading the investigation said police would be deploying a significant range and amount of resources over the next few days.
"These will include search teams, body recovery dogs and ground probes," Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said.
"Other equipment and experts are available, if required."
The officer added: "Lisa's family are being kept fully informed about our inquiries.
"The search may yield nothing but we feel it is appropriate to act on this new information."
Last February, a reward of up to Â£5,000 was offered  by the Crimestoppers charity for information about Ms Dorrian's murder.
This reward was in addition to one of Â£10,000 previously put up by the family.
Police have previously made several arrests, but no-one has been charged with her murder.
