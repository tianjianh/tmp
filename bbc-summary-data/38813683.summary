[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trio of Coventry City football fans arrested following a protest against the club's owners have apologised, but said "enough is enough".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Howells, Dean Thomas and Paul Sulley were among nine men arrested after repeated disruption saw flares thrown during Coventry's 3-0 defeat to Northampton Town on Saturday.
Sky Blues fans are unhappy at the way their club is run by owners Sisu.
Coventry City said the "repeated disruptions" were "unacceptable".

Northamptonshire Police said six arrests were made when spectators from the away stand invaded the pitch and a further three when smoke bombs were let-off.
All nine individuals were bailed.
Mr Howells, 38, Mr Thomas and Mr Sulley were given interim three-month banning orders, but said the only way to "hit Sisu where it hurts is to keep disrupting games".
A statement on behalf of the three men apologised to families.
It said: "We are not thugs, [nor] did we want to cause distress to any fans, including children."
But it added: "Enough is enough for us all."
They said: "Our decision to interrupt the game was not an easy thing to do, but Sisu is destroying a community - this is more than just a football club."
"No-one is calling for violence, we are the first to disown that idea.
"We thought if we caused a delay it might keep us [Coventry City] in the spotlight.
"Does anybody think we want to never be able to watch our City play again? That we want to risk a life ban?
"We just want to be able to take our children to the football on a Saturday and meet up with our friends we have grown up with and their kids and have day out watching our Coventry City."
