[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bookmakers were hit by a major gamble on Tuesday as Irish trainer Charles Byrnes and jockey Davy Russell pulled off a treble at Roscommon races.

All three of the Byrnes-trained runners had been backed down by punters from much bigger prices.
The trio were available at combined odds of 3,314-1 earlier in the day, whereas the treble at starting prices was just 42-1.
Bookmakers estimated the hat-trick cost the industry more than Â£1m.
War Anthem won the 6.40 race at 6-1 (had been 16/1) before Mr Smith took the 7.10 at 7-4 (was 12s). Top Of The Town sealed the hat-trick in the 8.10 contest, going off 5-4 favourite, having been 14-1.
Byrnes told reporters: "After Galway we needed it. I did my brains in at Galway with Sea Light and Crystal Pearl."
Last week at the Galway Festival, Byrnes and Russell failed to collect with the well-backed Crystal Pearl and Sea Light, the latter twice failing to win.
