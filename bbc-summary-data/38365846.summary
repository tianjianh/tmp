Celtic v Partick Thistle: Jags must make it tough for champions - Alan Archibald

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald is urging his players to learn the lessons of their recent defeat to Celtic when the sides meet again on Tuesday.

The league leaders won 4-1 at Firhill 10 days ago and Archibald says his team did not make life difficult enough for Celtic on that occasion.
"You believe every game's different," Archibald said.
"They know the things they did poorly in that game and if we can rectify them then it gives us a chance."
Archibald believes it is "possible" their opponents could go through the league season unbeaten - they have won 15 and drawn one of their first 16 games - but says the onus is on other Premiership clubs to end that run.
"It will be tough for them [to remain unbeaten]," he said.  "They have got a tough run of fixtures coming up.
"I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's down to the rest of the teams to stop that happening. We'll give it a go.
"You saw Hamilton had a late flurry at the end of the game [last Tuesday], just at 1-0, but one thing you take from Hamilton and Dundee's performances is that you don't give them any goals.
"They had to work for their goals and that's something we didn't do out there [in the 4-1 defeat], we gave away two goals after half-time which gave us a mountain to climb."
Thistle are currently bottom of the Premiership by one point, but a draw at Celtic Park would lift them up to 10th and a win would take them up to eighth.
Archibald's players have taken confidence from their second-half display against Hearts on Saturday, when they equalised and might have gone on to win the game if it had not been for the goalkeeping of Jack Hamilton.

Thistle also switched from the back three they have been using in recent weeks to a back four, showing a versatility that Archibald believes might help against Celtic, who have also changed formations this season.
"It's a good tool to have, that versatility in the squad and the personnel, trusting them and knowing we can do that at half-time," the Thistle manager added.
"It helped on Saturday. I don't know if it affects Celtic as much as it does us, because even if they are a three or a four at the back, they have a lot of bodies forward. It definitely helps us, because we can shuffle bodies about to stop them."
Winger Christie Elliott says the Jags needs to build on the second-half performance against Hearts.
"It will be brilliant for us to stop that [Celtic's run] and get the three points, which is more important for us," said Christie, who takes heart from scoring against Fraser Forster in March 2014, only weeks after the former Celtic goalkeeper's record run of clean sheets was ended.
"We go into every game knowing three points is vital for us. A good run and you're back into the top six."
