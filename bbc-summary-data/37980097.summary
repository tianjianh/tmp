England back-row forward Nathan Hughes says choosing to play for Eddie Jones' side over Fiji, the country of his birth, "wasn't the hardest decision".

The 25-year-old made his England debut from the bench during Saturday's 37-21 victory over South Africa.
Having been at Premiership side Wasps since 2013, he qualified for England via the three-year residency rule.
"I have no qualms. I can say England is my home now and I feel English because I've played for my country," he said.
"It is the thing that provides my food, my shelter. Why not play for your country that I live in?" Hughes told BBC Radio 5 live.
Hughes, who could make his first start for England against Fiji on Saturday, denied his decision was financially motivated.
A new £20m deal will see England players receive more than £20,000 per Test match, excluding bonuses, while Fiji's squad are paid £60 a day.
"To play for England is not all about money. It is about representing the country and representing where I live and where I play my rugby," he said.
"I said to my wife: 'If I play for Fiji I will be travelling back and forth. If I play for England I'm here and you will be here.' It wasn't the hardest decision."
Hughes added that he had received support from friends and family in Fiji when he made his England debut.
"There was a lot of videos and cheering and stuff sent to me," he said. "People were saying: 'Everyone's wearing the Red Rose here in Fiji.'"
