[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The PSNI has said identifying who rented a garage where a weapons dump was found days after Constable Ronan Kerr's murder could hold the key to catching his killers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Detective Superintendent Raymond Murray has appealed for information about who used the garage in Coalisland, County Tyrone.
A Â£50,000 reward remains on offer from Crimestoppers.
This is for information leading to the conviction of those responsible.
A splinter group claiming it was made up of former members of the Provisional IRA said it killed the 25-year-old police officer in Omagh, County Tyrone on 2 April, 2011.
The PSNI believe the group was also responsible for at least nine other dissident republican incidents.
One man has been charged in relation to the arms, ammunition, explosives and vehicles found at the garage on Coalisland's Mountjoy Road, but no-one has been charged with Constable Kerr's murder.
Mr Murray said detectives had identified some people who used the garage, but that they were still looking for others, including those who rented it.
"This is a long-term investigation with Ronan's murder at its core but incorporating several linked incidents," he said.
"It is an extremely large investigation which, as we said at the outset, will rely on detail to succeed.
"We believe we have identified some key individuals connected to the discovery at the garage at 187A Mountjoy Road.
"But we also believe there are other people, both men and women, who remain to be identified.
"This is an integral part of our investigation.
"We need to know who was renting these premises and who frequented them."
Anyone with information is asked to call the PSNI in Omagh on 028 8225 6687 or via the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111.
