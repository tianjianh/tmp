Peebles sports pitch funds to help patch up Borders roads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Money freed up after the failure to find an acceptable site for a new sports pitch in Peebles is to be part of a £2.4m roads repair package.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Borders Council agreed the move after a six-month review of its capital plans.
The funds will be spent on a number of road and bridge improvements right across the region.
Sports pitch plans at Victoria Park in Peebles were shelved earlier this year in the face of public opposition.
A slice of the funding will now be used to help repair flood damage at the Bowanhill Bridge, the Selkirk flood scheme and Newmill Bridge near Jedburgh.
The bulk of the money - £1,328,000 - will go towards resurfacing at sites in Greenlaw, Duns, Chirnside, St Abbs, Kelso, St Boswells, Hawick, Denholm, Peebles, Galashiels, Lauder and Selkirk.
