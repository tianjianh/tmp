Aberystwyth street signs look back to the Edwardian era

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seaside town is replacing 260 of its street signs with Edwardian-style versions as part of a scheme to transform its appearance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £100,000 project will see the blue enamel signs with white text placed on buildings around Aberystwyth.
Ceredigion Council has consulted conservation body Cadw on the signs' design, which will mimic those of the early 1900s.
The bilingual signs will be put in place during the next six months.
The council said only a few streets in the town still had signs that dated back to the early part of the 20th Century. These include Chalybeate Street and Eastgate.
The signs are part of an £800,000 project to improve the look of Aberystwyth.
The Welsh Government-sponsored Aberystwyth town improvement grant aims to transform the external appearance of Aberystwyth's streets.
Typical projects have included work to roofs, chimneys and windows; replacement shop fronts; and improved signage and decoration.
Historians say Aberystwyth Town Council started to number the town's houses and provide street names in the 1830s.
A concerted effort was made to organise the town's streets in the 1880s and 1890s as part of a plan to develop the town.
