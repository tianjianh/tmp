Thirty-eight children were among those killed when the US Liberator heavy bomber destroyed houses, a cafe and a church school in Freckleton.
The service for was held at 10:30 BST - the time the plane hit the village.
It was held at Holy Trinity Church to remember those who died on 23 August 1944, during World War Two.
Ruby Currell was one of three children who survived when the reception classroom at Holy Trinity Church of England School caught fire.
She said: "I just want future generations to remember them. One day I'm not going to be here to do it.
"I just hope the village will continue to remember.
"It's nice to do this memorial service this year - it's 70 years and it is a long, long time."

Nellie Hankinson was in another classroom at the school and survived, but her sister Dorothy, five, was killed.
"It was a dreadful event. You never get over it.
"My mother and father never did," said Mrs Hankinson, 78.
"I still don't like thunder... I go to pieces when it thunders.
"I have always said it was the first time I saw a man cry. He was crying taking me home, crying.
"Tears were streaming down his face," she said.
