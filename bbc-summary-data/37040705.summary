Spectators and competitors were left confused during Tuesday's women's synchronised 10m platform final.
The International Swimming Federation (Fina) explained it was caused by water tanks running out of certain chemicals.
But Fina stressed that there was "no risk" to athletes.
It explained that the discoloration was caused by the pH level - or acidity level - of the water being "outside the usual range".
Rio 2016 spokesperson Mario Andrada said: "We did have test events with the same number of divers but we are using the pool for a longer period now.
"The people in charge could and should have done more extensive tests during the day - we probably failed to notice what would happen over time.
"There is no risk to the athletes - an independent group has confirmed that - and the pool should go back to the classic blue colour soon."
The water remained green during the men's synchronised 3m springboard final on Wednesday evening.
Speaking on Tuesday, Great Britain's 10m synchronised diving bronze medallist Tom Daley described the situation as "slightly strange".
However, he admitted the colour helped divers to judge their rotations, as it contrasted with the sky.
