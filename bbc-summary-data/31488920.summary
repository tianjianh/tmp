[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors have made their fifth signing for next season by bringing in Scotland international fly-half Tom Heathcote from Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He moved to Edinburgh last summer from Bath, where he was behind England's George Ford in the pecking order.
Inverness-born Heathcote, 23, who made his Scotland debut against Tonga in 2012, has now won three caps.
But he has so far not been selected for the Six Nations, despite 12 conversions and 28 penalties in 10 club starts.
"Tom has experienced international rugby," said Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan. "He has illustrated his talents across different competitions so I have no doubt he will flourish in the environment we are creating at Sixways. I am delighted that he has chosen to play a role in our future as we look to become a successful Premiership side."
"It is a great opportunity to join a club with so much potential," said Heathcote. "With a young squad, great facilities and infrastructure, the club is very attractive to me."
Having been born in the Scottish Highlands when his father was a pilot stationed at RAF Kinloss, Heathcote moved to England at the age of three, being educated in Wiltshire.
He came through the academy at Bath, going on to represent England at Under-20 level.
He won his first Scotland cap as a late replacement in the 2012 defeat by Tonga at Pittodrie, before his first two international starts came in the summer of 2013 against Samoa and Italy in South Africa.
