[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The celebrated County Monaghan aristocrat, Sir Jack Leslie, has died at the age of 99.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His family described him as an art connoisseur, water colourist, ecologist, disco-dancer and restorer of historic buildings.
A World War Two veteran, Sir Jack was captured at Dunkirk while serving as an officer in the Irish Guards, and spent five years in prison camp.
At an advanced age, he became a keen clubber, with a love for house music.
After travelling the world on his release at the end of the war, Sir Jack returned to live at the family home, Castle Leslie, in his 70s, when he became a regular visitor to County Monaghan nightclubs.
Legion d'Honneur
He celebrated his 84th birthday by dancing on stage at the world's biggest nightclub in Ibiza.
In November 2015, Sir Jack was presented with the France's top military award at the French embassy in Dublin on Monday.
He said he was accepting the Legion d'Honneur "on behalf of all soldiers from the island of Ireland who fought and died between the two great wars".
In 2002, Sir Jack famously blew the lid on the secret wedding plans of Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills by admitting to reporters that the ceremony was to be held at Castle Leslie.
