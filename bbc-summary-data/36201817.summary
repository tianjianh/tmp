The 34-year-old also returns to the Triangle circuit with a new team and former NW 200 winner Ian Newton as his crew chief.
"I'm looking forward to riding the Aprilia that I ride week in, week out in the BSB Superstock class." said Wilson on Wednesday.
Wilson will compete in the Superstock and Superbike events.
The Aprilia RSV4 will be prepared by Newton, who won two 250cc races at the seaside event in 1994 and 1995.
Wilson's EHA Racing squad is run by English-based Eglinton couple, Edward and Gail Allingham, in partnership with Newton.
"As we compete in the British championship we don't do many races in Ireland so it is really nice to get this opportunity to bring our team home," said Gail.
"We are really excited to coming over to compete at the North West with Ben."
