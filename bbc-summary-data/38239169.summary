Firefighters, like the rest of us, usually wrap up warm when out and about in December, but they may now consider Hawaiian shirts after their latest callout.

The crew from Dublin Fire Brigade were alerted to a fire at a house in the south of the city on Tuesday evening.
But when they arrived, they were surprised to find the smoky suspect was in fact a barbecue.
Luckily, officers saw the funny side and tweeted about it.
It was not their only summer themed callout on Tuesday - a car fire saw the firefighters making a trip to the beach too.
