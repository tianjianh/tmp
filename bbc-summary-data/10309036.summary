Surrey Fire and Rescue Service was called to the West Course on Sunday evening.
A total of six pumps attended the scene, with the final crews leaving at 0845 BST on Monday. Fire investigation officers were due to visit the site.
A spokeswoman said the fire was being treated as deliberate.
No-one was injured in the blaze, which affected undergrowth and timber next to the 10th and 11th greens.
The West Course is one of three championship golf courses at Wentworth in Virginia Water.
It hosts the annual the BMW PGA Championship in May.
