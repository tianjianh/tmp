Violet McAfee, 44, was in the garden of a friend's house when three bikes crashed during the opening race.
She was taken to hospital by helicopter. Her condition is stable.
Two riders were also taken to hospital. One, Stephen Thompson, is also now in a stable condition. The third rider was unhurt.
Ms McAfee has now been moved out of intensive care and Mr Thompson has regained consciousness.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Kathleen McAfee described how she first heard news of the accident.
"I was working at the time and I just went to pieces basically, it was so shocking.
"I just couldn't believe what I was hearing," she said.
"All I was told was there had been an accident and they were taking her to hospital, people were working on her."
Organisers said the incident happened on the section of the course between York Corner and the Mill Road roundabout.
Violet McAfee, who has one son, is still in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) but is recovering.
"She is coming on extremely well," said Ms McAfee, "She's still in the ICU but she's beginning to respond because they are reducing her sedation a bit.
"I visited her yesterday and I called her by name and she jumped, opened her eyes and closed them again."
When asked whether or not something could have been done to prevent the accident, Kathleen McAfee said she believed it was an accident.
"Unless you're going to put up wire fencing at everyone's house, but would they want that?
"This is just an accident. Will it ever happen again? I don't know. It's a freak accident."
She added that prayers said for her daughter had been of great comfort to her.
"There's been a lot of prayer for my daughter and the other rider and I know the power of prayer.
"It's a great comfort. I am a Christian so I do know the power of prayer."
Adrian Moir had been watching the race a short distance from the crash scene. He said the crash was in the most frightening incident he had witnessed in his time as a motorsport spectator.
"I've been following road racing and going to the North West for years and I've never seen anything quite as dangerous happening as close to me," he said.
"We were standing on scaffolding in a garden close by, the crash just happened in front of us in a matter of seconds.
"You do worry for your own safety. You don't go to watch road racing for the crashing but it is part and parcel of the sport."
