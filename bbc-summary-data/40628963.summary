Hannah Cockroft, Sophie Kamlish and Olivia Breen won gold for Britain on day four of the World Para-athletics Championships at London Stadium.

Cockroft, 24, was first in the T34 800m, following her success in the 100m on Friday and can complete the treble with victory in the 400m.
Team-mate Kare Adenegan finished third to add bronze to her 100m silver.
Kamllish, 20, secured the T43/T44 100m title and Breen won the T38 long jump with a personal best of 4.81m.
Britain's Richard Whitehead, who won T42 200m gold on Saturday, took bronze in the 100m, but Britain dropped behind the United States into second in the medal table with 20 in total and 11 golds.
Cockroft, who races in a category for athletes who have cerebral palsy and are in a wheelchair, remains undefeated in major competitions.
She has now won nine world titles, to go with her five Paralympic gold medals, and will repeat her trebles at the 2015 World Championships and 2016 Paralympics with success in the 400m later in the week.
"I'm really happy with that race. I knew I was in for a good time," she told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I'm not at full fitness. I feel like I'm smoking 100 cigarettes a day. Hopefully I'll have more of a voice by the 400m (on Thursday). I love the 400m."
Adenegan, 16, matched her bronze in this event from Rio and at the 2015 Worlds, while team-mate Carly Tait finished fourth.
Kamlish, who has an amputation of the right leg below the knee, had set a world record time of 12.90 seconds for the T44 category in the heats, just like she had done in Rio last year.
On that occasion she went on to come fourth in the final, but overcame the memory of that disappointment as well as a restart in the final.
Her victory also ended the domination of the Netherlands' Marlou van Rhjin, who had won the 100m and 200m double at the last two World Championships.
"I really wanted a medal. I knew I'd be disappointed if it wasn't gold," she said.
"The false start shakes everyone up. I was a bit pleased because it felt like my first start wasn't great. I beat Marlou in the Manchester City Games and now I can do it on a much bigger scale."
Breen, 20, who has cerebral palsy, claimed her first individual major title having won a gold medal in the 4x100m relay at the 2015 Worlds.
She had only finished 12th in the long jump at the Paralympics last year.
"I moved to Loughborough to train after Rio. I knew I had to change something and it's been the best change ever. This is a dream come true," she said.
"I'm so happy. I knew I had to be on my form and it's so exciting."
Whitehead, who turns 41 on Wednesday, had talked about the possibility of retiring after the London championships.
The four-time 200m world champion had made winning a gold medal in the 100m a priority and described his performance in the final as "rubbish".
He confirmed he would be competing at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, but criticised governing body the International Paralympic Committee for removing the T42 100m from the programme for the Games.
"The IPC are trying to shrink the programme. For me it's about performance, inclusion, and offering opportunities for performance, not actually restricting the programme," he said.
"It's a backwards step for the IPC. Hopefully they will do a U-turn on that decision - especially after today."
The IPC is splitting T42 athletes between two separate classifications for Tokyo and the body say there is not enough depth in talent in the double-leg amputee classifications to warrant keeping all of the events.
Britain's Richard Chiassaro crashed in his T54 800m final after touching wheelchairs with eventual winner Marcel Hug of Switzerland.
The 35-year-old, who looked to have damaged a finger, recovered to cross the line but was then disqualified. The race will be rerun on Friday without Chiassaro.
Elsewhere for Britain, Paul Blake and Graeme Ballard finished sixth and eighth respectively in the T36 200m, Steve Morris and James Hamilton came fourth and six in the T20 1500mm and in the T34 400m Ben Rawlings came fifth with Isaac Towers seventh.
America's seven-time Paralympic gold medallist Tatyana McFadden continued her domination of women's T54 wheelchair racing by winning two medals in one day and her third of the championships.
Having claimed the 1500m in the morning she added the 400m in the evening. The 28-year-old had already won the 200m on Friday and can complete the quadruple in the 800m on Wednesday.
