HBO has announced a full orchestra and choir performing live music from the programme will start touring 28 cities from February.
And they say it's going to be "epic". Obviously.
The show's composer Ramin Djawadi says some of the show's most popular scenes will go out on big screens at the same time.
He says he wants to create an "immersive" event.
"I wanted something that takes you beyond just watching an orchestra play with things happening onstage that will enhance the musical experience," he says.
He's also looking forward to bringing live classical music to fans who might not usually be interested in it.
And executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss say they're excited.
"For seven years, Ramin has been blowing our mind with his music's force, subtlety, and endless inventiveness," they say.
They're promising "an eye-popping, ear-splitting, phantasmagoric blend of the show's visuals and Ramin's powerful compositions".
The tour starts in Kansas City next year with stops including New York's Madison Square Garden and the Los Angeles Forum.
HBO confirmed last month that the next series of Game of Thrones would be the last but one.
