George Bush, 63, of Riverdale Road, Erith, south east London, also possessed sexual images of animals, Woolwich Crown Court heard.
He was sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years.
Bush admitted four charges relating to listings on the online auction site which included more than 130 body parts of endangered species.
Among them were leopard skulls and the hands and heads of monkeys. Bush also admitted possessing 71 images of bestiality.
Bush was arrested on suspicion of illegally importing protected species following information from UK Border Force.
Det Con Sarah Bailey, of the Met's Wildlife Crime Unit, said: "This case shows that strong controls are in place to protect endangered species and the police will take action against anyone found to be trading illegally.
"Illegal trade threatens many species' survival. I would urge anyone who sees specimens from protected wildlife for sale to contact police. We are committed to ensuring that anyone in London who is trading illegally in endangered animal parts is stopped."
Grant Miller from the border force agency CITES said the illegal movement of endangered species was "often cruel" and those trading in illegal wildlife products would be targeted "at the UK border and beyond".
He said Bush's supplier in Indonesia had been referred to the East Java police.
A confiscation hearing is due to take place in April.
