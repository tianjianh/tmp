The 26-year-old world champion set his best mark in round one.
Fellow American Will Claye took silver with a personal best jump of 17.76m, while China's Bin Dong secured the bronze with 17.58m.
Taylor jumped 18.21m in winning the world title last year but did not threaten Jonathan Edwards' 1995 world record of 18.29m on this occasion.
"Gold medal, defending champion, it's a dream come true. Everything came together and the stars were aligned," Taylor told BBC Sport.
Asked about challenging Edwards' 21-year-old world record, he added: "I want it so much. I have got to stay patient. Until I get that world record by my name, my career won't be complete."
