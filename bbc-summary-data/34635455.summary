[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England lost the second Test against Pakistan by 178 runs despite a valiant rearguard led by Adil Rashid.

Resuming on 130-3 and needing to survive the final day in Dubai to earn a draw, the tourists were bowled out for 312 with only 6.3 overs remaining.
Rashid was last out for 61, while Stuart Broad made 30 and Mark Wood 29 after Joe Root fell for 71.
Yasir Shah took 4-87 and fellow spinner Zulfiqar Babar 3-53 for Pakistan, who lead 1-0 in the three-match series.
The final Test in Sharjah starts on 1 November.
England can take great credit for the character demonstrated in posting their highest fourth-innings total in Asia on a wearing pitch.
But they will surely reflect on the first-innings collapse from 206-3 to 242 all out, which effectively cost them this match.
Caught off an ugly slog for a second-ball duck in the first innings, Rashid - playing only his second Test - batted with immense composure during a 172-ball knock spanning four hours.
His technique against the spinners was exemplary, combining positive footwork, a straight bat and wonderfully soft hands until he drove Yasir to short cover to spark wild Pakistan celebrations.
From a seemingly perilous 193-7, he added 60 with Broad and 55 in 29.2 overs with Wood, the highest ninth-wicket stand in a fourth innings in Test history.
Broad made a sprightly 30 before being cleaned up by an inswinging Wahab Riaz yorker, and Wood played with composure belying his position at number 10 as he survived 95 deliveries.
After Wood edged left-armer Babar to Mohammad Hafeez at second slip not long into the final hour of play, England's hopes rested with Rashid and James Anderson.
Pakistan feared their chance had gone when Anderson was dropped by Asad Shafiq at short leg, but a rare moment of ill-discipline from Rashid in the next over gifted Babar a straightforward catch.
Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott told BBC Test Match Special: "Do you blame him? Yes, it was a poor shot - but no, because he played splendidly in his second Test."
Rashid's stubbornness typified England's approach on a tense final day.
Although their hopes of salvaging an unlikely draw faded when Root edged Babar to slip less than an hour into play, Jonny Bairstow spent 86 balls making 22, only to be bowled playing across a Yasir googly.
After Jos Buttler fell to wonderful leg-break from Yasir, Ben Stokes' 13 occupied 66 deliveries and spanned almost an hour and a half before Imran Khan located his outside edge.
Rashid and Broad's response was admirable, but the consistent threat posed by Yasir eventually proved too much even for Rashid to repel.
England can trace defeat in this match to Saturday's collapse, when they lose seven wickets for 36 runs and conceded a first-innings deficit of 136.
"In these conditions you can't afford those two or three hours," said captain Alastair Cook.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told TMS: "This isn't the time to judge. The time to judge was that collapse on the third morning. That was the game."
Ex-England spinner Phil Tufnell added: "This England side have got bags of character - they've just got a blunder in them. That massive third day was that blunder."
It was telling that left-arm Pakistan pace bowler Wahab Riaz, who instigated that collapse en route to figures of 4-66, was named man of the match.
On Sunday, England assistant coach Paul Farbrace claimed a limping Alastair Cook was "fine" despite the skipper's obvious discomfort when running between the wickets.
Come Monday morning, England confirmed Cook was suffering from "right groin tightness", although they said they were "not concerned" about his availability for the final Test.
Vaughan said: "This England set-up have been a breath of fresh air how we deal with things, but last night I didn't quite get it.
"It was very obvious that Alastair Cook couldn't run - it was a real problem. So to come out yesterday and say it wasn't a problem was just silly."
