Millionaire ex-wife facing £1m legal bill after losing £18m asset row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who said her ex-husband was "frittering" away their £18m fortune on "boys' toys" is facing a £1m legal bill after losing her case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maya Kanev-Lipinski and Shahar Lipinski built up a student property empire across the East Midlands before separating in 2012.
The pair agreed to divide their assets 50/50, but Mr Lipinski was accused of purposely "frittering" away cash.
The High Court heard there was "no dispersal" of assets by Mr Lipinski.
In December, Mrs Kanev-Lipinski, 44, obtained a temporary High Court asset freezing injunction against her ex-husband and wanted to make the order permanent.
She insisted he was spending the millions they made from their student accommodation businesses on penthouse flats and a £70,000 convertible Bentley.
Her barrister, Andrew Hunter QC, claimed Mr Lipinski had treated the fortune "as his own personal wallet" and had vowed to leave his ex-wife "parked and penniless".
But Mrs Kanev-Lipinski wept in court after a judge refused to grant her a freezing order that would have given her control of Mr Lipinski's financial affairs pending finalisation of their divorce.
Mrs Justice May said Mrs Kanev-Lipinski's "fear, suspicion and dislike" of her ex-husband had got the better of her.
"There has been no actual dispersal of assets by the husband in the three-and-a-half years since the divorce," the judge ruled.
That decision leaves Mrs Kanev-Lipinski looking at a legal bill approaching £1m.
Lawyers for the couple's businesses said they have spent £280,000 fighting the case, while Elizabeth Jones QC, who represented Mr Lipinski, 45, said it had cost him £423,000.
Mrs Kanev-Lipinski's counsel said their fees had reached "two hundred-odd thousand" pounds prior to the three-day hearing.
The former couple's empire was based mainly in Nottingham and Leicester and the pair - who have two daughters - lived in a £2m five-bedroom home near Nottingham before they were divorced by a rabbinical court in Israel.
An Israeli court is due to finalise their divorce within the next few months.
