Amazing world record breaking dogs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Japanese dog called Purin has won her second world record, by travelling 10 metres on a ball, in just 11.9 seconds.

She adds it to her other world record, from 2015, when she proved her great paw-eye coordination by catching 14 balls in one minute.
Purin's not the only talented dog out there, so we've been looking back at some of our favourite record-breaking pooches...

Jiff, a Pomeranian from Los Angeles, America, won fans in 2014 for an unusual talent.
Despite having four legs, Jiff prefers to get around on just two - he stands up on his back legs, or balances on his front, like a handstand.
And as if that wasn't enough, he's speedy as well! He can travel 5 metres in just under 8 seconds on his front paws, and is even quicker on his hind legs, doing the same distance in less than 7 seconds.
Otto skated his way into our hearts in 2015, when he skateboarded through a 'human tunnel' of 30 people.
The bulldog was cheered by a huge crowd in Peru, and was given an official certificate for his achievement.
It took 270 dogs to set a new world record in 2016.
The dogs and their owners stretched and twisted in an hour-long 'doga' (dog yoga) session in Hong Kong, China, to be part of the biggest ever doga class.
They beat the previous record of 265 dogs, set in San Diego, America, in 2015.
