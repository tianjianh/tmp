Experts have welcomed the return of a rare fish to the River Wear as a sign that water quality is improving.

The Environment Agency said lampreys spawning is a good sign that work to improve the waterways is succeeding.
Twenty adult sea lampreys have been spotted in the Wear while searches are under way in North Yorkshire on the Ouse, Wharfe, Swale, Nidd and Ure.
Fisheries officer Paul Frear said lampreys will only nest where the water quality is good.
He said: "Their appearance is a ringing endorsement of the water quality in these areas."
The lamprey uses its mouth like a suction-cup to attach itself to the skin of a fish and rasp away tissue with its sharp probing tongue and teeth.
They outwardly resemble eels because they have no scales and can grow up to 3ft (1m) long.
During the Middle Ages lampreys were widely eaten by the upper classes throughout Europe, especially during fasting periods, because their taste is much meatier than that of other fish.
The deaths of two English kings, Henry I and John, are said to have been from overindulging on lampreys.
