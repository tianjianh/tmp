The Tyco BMW rider, who took the Supersport honours earlier in the day, led throughout to take his overall tally of successes at the event to 13.
The Yorkshireman produced a stunning opening lap of 133.098mph to smash the previous lap record for the class.
Hutchinson had a 27.6-second advantage over second-placed Dean Harrison.
The 36-year-old edged out compatriot and fellow Kawasaki rider James Hillier by 1.9 seconds.
Michael Dunlop retired at the end of the opening lap with a gear lever problem after lying second, 16 seconds behind the eventual victor.
The triumph saw Hutchinson move above Dunlop into fourth in the all-time solo winners' list at the TT and draw level with Bruce Anstey's record of four Superstock wins at the meeting.
The Bingley rider also broke the race record by more than 17 seconds as he gave the Tyco-backed TAS team their first success at the race for eight years.
"I pushed on from the start again and I really love riding this bike. Everything seems so easy on it and I just kept riding it hard," said an elated Hutchinson, whose opening circuit was clocked at a staggering 17 minutes 0.5 seconds.
"It's a great feeling to give the TAS team their first win here for quite a few years," he added.
Michael Rutter ended fourth, with Gary Johnson fifth and Morecambe's John McGuinness completing the top six.
Conor Cummins from the Isle of Man finished seventh, with William Dunlop in eighth.
Among the retirements were Bruce Anstey, Peter Hickman and Lee Johnston, who was challenging for a podium position.
