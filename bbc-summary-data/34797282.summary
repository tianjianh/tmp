[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers have been called in to resolve a "destructive and negative" row over who has the right to stage a city cycling event.

Two rival groups each want to run an amateur event, known as a sportive, in Lincoln on the same day and route in May next year.
Cyclists are now said to be confused as to which event to sign up to.
The city hosted the British Cycling National Road Championships in 2015, attracting thousands of spectators.
Lawyers have been contacted to try to resolve concerns about the staging and marketing of the events.
ITP Events has been running an event in the city, known as the Lincoln Grand Prix Sportive, for five years.
Another group wants to stage a new event, called the Lincoln Sportive, as part of the Lincoln Festival of Cycling.
Ian Pemrose, of ITP Events, said: "We've run five editions of the Lincoln Sportive. We created that event and we're just carrying on with what we do under our trademark.
"If you'd spent five years building up a business and then somebody said 'actually I want want to do that', would you do that?"
Both events are being proposed for Saturday 14 May and would run on a route starting at Yarborough Leisure Centre and ending in Castle Square.
Dan Ellmore, organiser of the Lincoln Festival of Cycling, said: "It's one of the best events I've ever seen.
"Dragging the name through the mud like this doesn't do anyone any good and is really a destructive and negative approach.
"If the ITP event goes ahead as planned on the 14th, we'll move, however it seems a little crazy to me to move a three-day weekend".
