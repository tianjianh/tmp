[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 3-2 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham won a five-goal thriller against Nottingham Forest to keep themselves firmly in the hunt for a play-off spot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pajtim Kasami's half-volley gave Forest an early lead, before an unmarked Tom Cairney drew Fulham level with a neat finish against the run of play.
Fulham's Lucas Piazon beat two visiting defenders to make it 2-1 before half-time, but 17-year-old Ben Brereton's header put Forest level on 47 minutes.
Neeskens Kebano's shot deflected in off Forest's Jack Hobbs as Fulham won it.
Victory moved Fulham up to eighth, six points below the play-off places with 15 games remaining, while Forest are seven points above the relegation zone.
The Reds remain winless away from home since 25 November yet, contrastingly, Fulham have now won four consecutive home games in all competitions, netting 12 times in the process.
And Slavisa Jokanovic's side produced some stylish play worthy of a promotion bid - epitomised by the neat, one-touch football that led to their winning goal, which was officially credited as on own goal for Hobbs as substitute Kebano's flicked effort looked set to go wide across the face of goal.
Teenager Brereton's tremendous header from range had given Forest hope, when he had earlier levelled things at 2-2, but Fulham were deserved winners in the end.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"I believe we have played better football. Today was not our best day - we didn't play a brilliant game.
"But after a very soft start to the game, we found so many problems but we overcame them, then we win the game.
"The last two games at home we have conceded four goals, both oppositions put us under so many stressful situations. We need to do better. We need the fans."
Interim Nottingham Forest manager Gary Brazil:
"I thought we did enough in the game to get ourselves a draw, we asked quite a lot of questions of Fulham.
"We were perhaps a little bit wasteful in terms of a final pass in that early period. They had to change their shape to handle us.
"We just need to show a bit more game savvy at a certain point of the first half, a little bit more discipline. They got through us too easily."
