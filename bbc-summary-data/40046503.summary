Netani Talei: Harlequins back-row forward announces retirement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harlequins and Fiji back-row forward Netani Talei has announced his retirement with immediate effect.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Talei joined Quins in February 2015 following his release by Newport Gwent Dragons, but a knee injury limited him to only seven Premiership appearances.
The 34-year-old also had spells with Edinburgh, Worcester and Doncaster.
"After 17 months out of the game spent rehabbing and draining fluid from my knee, it was advised that retirement is the best option for me," he said.
"I would like to thank Harlequins for their patience and show my gratitude to the medical staff who have continually monitored my rehab and training.
"Rugby has made me the person I am today. I am forever grateful and will cherish every moment of it."
