Hampshire batsman Joe Weatherley has signed a new contract with the county, while also agreeing to join Kent on a season-long loan for the 2017 campaign.

The former England Under-19 captain and Hampshire academy graduate has extended his deal at the Ageas Bowl until 2019.
Weatherley, 20, has made two first-class appearances and spent the winter playing grade cricket in Adelaide.
"Hampshire's where I want to be playing my cricket, it's an exciting club to be at," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Following Hampshire's signing of top-order batsman Rilee Rossouw on a Kolpak deal, Weatherley believes the loan to Division Two Kent will increase his chances of first-team cricket this season.
"It stems down to me being at an age where I want to play as much as possible," the right-hander said.
"Ultimately, I want to be playing as much cricket as I can. Ideally, that would be for Hampshire and I want that to be for them long-term.
"But this year, I think it's best for me to get some cricket elsewhere and I'm looking forward to joining up with Kent.
"They seem like a really good family club, who did well last year and will no doubt be pushing for promotion to Division One of the County Championship."
