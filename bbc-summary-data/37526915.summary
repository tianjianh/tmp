[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter's wait for a home win in League Two extended to six games following a goalless draw with Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter had the better of the first half, but they failed to take any of the chances that came their way.
Robbie Simpson volleyed wastefully high and wide from a promising position for the Grecians, while Lee Holmes forced James McKeown into a flying stop with a curling shot from 25 yards.
Reuben Reid then forced McKeown into another good save before the Exeter striker failed to make the most of a superb Pierce Sweeney cross when he failed to make contact from close range.
Things continued in much the same vein after the break as David Wheeler and Holmes both saw long-range efforts go high, Reid hit the crossbar after lofting the ball over the goalkeeper, and then saw a similar effort land on top of the net.
Omar Bogle was high with a free-kick for Grimsby, who rarely threatened the Exeter goal, but it is just one goal in six league games at St James' Park now for the Grecians, who ended the game to chants of manager Paul Tisdale to go once again.
