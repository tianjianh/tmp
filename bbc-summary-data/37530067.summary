Jeremy Corbyn remembers Jarrow Crusade 80 years on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Re-elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has visited Tyneside to mark the 80th anniversary of the Jarrow Crusade.

Mr Corbyn spoke to a crowd of about 400 at the town's Monkton Stadium, telling them the principles of the marchers were still needed in the 21st Century.
In 1936, 200 jobless men marched on the then government with a 12,000-name petition calling for help.
Mr Corbyn said images of the marchers were some of the most iconic ever seen within the Labour movement.
Descendents of some of the marchers spoke at the event, which also featured a re-enactment by local schoolchildren.
Mr Corbyn said the 300-mile trek to London to demand paid work, was a "cry from the heart" of a town that was suffering at the height of the depression.
He recalled the role played by the town's then MP Ellen Wilkinson, who marched with the men.
He said: "The march brought to the attention of so many, the picture of those men led by diminutive Ellen, marching in the rain through English villages.
"People say 'why 80 years later do you remember this'? Well it's because if we don't know what went before we don't understand the motives and the principles of those that founded and developed our movement.
"We will never know where we are going to unless we retain the principles of those that founded our cause in the first place."
He read extracts from a book written by Ellen Wilkinson in 1939 called "The town that was murdered", in which she highlighted the poverty of Jarrow despite the boom in shipbuilding, coal mining and steelmaking at the time.
The town's current Labour MP Stephen Hepburn said: "It has been a fantastic opportunity to celebrate an iconic event in Jarrow's history and give a brilliant South Tyneside welcome to Jeremy."
