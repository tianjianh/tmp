Danny Cipriani: England door open for every Wasps player under Eddie Jones

Danny Cipriani says catching England coach Eddie Jones' eye is an added incentive for Wasps as the Premiership leaders approach the season's climax.

Going into this weekend's return to Premiership action, Wasps remain top, with a European Champions Cup quarter-final at Leinster to follow.
But 14-times capped Cipriani, 29, knows that international recognition is only an option if Wasps continue to shine.
"If we keep doing well at Wasps, then we all have the same message," he said.
"Any English player would be trying to do that. Whether you're in the England squad or not, you'll get looked at. It's down to everyone just to play well.
"Eddie Jones is very diligent in how many people he talks to and to just who he speaks to. He speaks to everyone every couple of weeks. That's the calibre of the man," Cipriani told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
Former Melbourne Rebels and Sale stand-off Cipriani, now in his second spell with Wasps, has not played for England since August 2015.
He was left out of the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad by Stuart Lancaster and has so far been overlooked by Jones, but Cipriani says that it is simply nice to have been kept in the loop, especially at a time when Wasps are on a roll.
"It's good to have contact from the top," added Cipriani. "Whether that means you're close or not, I don't know. It's not really for me to worry about.
"I'm just pretty excited about how things are going at Wasps. It could be a very special end to the season."
