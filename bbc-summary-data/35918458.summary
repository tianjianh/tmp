It was the day the substitute tweeter became a footballing substitute and took social media by storm.

Harrison Allen, who was standing in for Sleaford Town's regular club tweeter, had to relinquish his social media duties to come on as a substitute 70 minutes into Monday's game against Boston.
An hour later, the following message appeared: "Sorry for break in tweets. I came on as a sub for Millard. Other subs were Anderson for Millington and Hollingsworth for Wright."
It has been retweeted more than 3,500 times, received more than 3,000 likes and helped add 250 followers to the club's Twitter account - one eighth of their total followers.
"Our usual tweeter, Jamie Shaw, was away on work," said 18-year-old Allen, who joined the club's youth team aged 12. "I asked if I could have a go. I was just doing my job really.
"There were only three of us on the bench. I was planning on passing the phone to someone else but we all pretty much came on at the same time."
Sleaford were leading 3-1 when midfielder Allen entered the United Counties League Premier Division game, but went on to draw 3-3.
"After the game, we went back in and showered and I decided to bring everyone up to date," said Allen, who has been distracted from his A-level revision by the publicity.
"A couple of people from Boston tweeted saying it was funny. I thought they were joking because we drew, but then it kept growing.
"Jamie had the notifications on his phone overnight. His phone was beeping non-stop. It's been really fun and I've loved the publicity, which is really good for the club.
"I know the manager, Paul Ward, will be a bit confused by it all. I think he joined Twitter over the weekend so it's quite good timing from him."
