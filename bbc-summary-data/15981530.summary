The award-winning production of Green Day's musical American Idiot, which played on Broadway more than a year, is to tour the UK.

The show will open in Southampton in October next year and tour across the UK and Ireland, before closing at London's Hammersmith Apollo.
The production, which scooped two Tony Awards, features Green Day's music.
"We can't wait for our friends across the pond to see the musical," frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said.
The production features the hit songs Boulevard of Broken Dreams, 21 Guns, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and the title track, American Idiot, from the band's  Grammy Award-winning album.
"We're excited to be bringing the US stage production of American Idiot to the UK and Ireland," said Armstrong.
"We played to some of the most insane crowds when we toured the album there."
The show's producers are hoping that the UK adaptation of the show will eventually transfer to the West End.
In 2010, the Broadway show scooped the Tony Awards for best scenic design of a musical and best lighting design.
It was also named the winner of the best musical show album at the Grammys earlier this year.
The production opened at California's Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009, before moving to Broadway, where it remained for a year.
Reviews were positive with Charles Isherwood, from The New York Times, calling the musical "thrilling" and The Stage's Mark Shenton describing it as "probably the most most compelling new musical of the Broadway season".
Tickets for the UK tour are due to go on sale on 9 December.
