Researchers have identified a compound which targets aggressive tumour cells found in breast, pancreas, colon and prostate cancers.
The discovery has now been licensed to biotech investors Tiziana Life Sciences.
It is hoped the compound can eventually be developed for clinical trials.
The research was conducted by Cardiff University's European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute (ECSCRI) and the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.
Scientists revealed details of the compound - called OH14 - on Thursday morning when the deal with Tiziana was made public on the London Stock Exchange.
Tiziana already has an established relationship working with Cardiff University.
Italian investor Gabriele Cerrone named the company after his partner who died three years ago from breast cancer.
