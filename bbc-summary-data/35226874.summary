[SN]TITLE[SN]
Call for clarity on apprenticeship levy's Welsh impact

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An organisation representing work training providers has written to the Welsh and UK governments for clarity on a new apprenticeship levy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National Training Federation for Wales asked for all money raised to be fairly distributed.
It said it was concerned the UK government levy of 0.5% of payroll costs on large employers would affect apprenticeship programmes in Wales.
The UK government said UK nations would receive their "fair share".
A Welsh government spokesman said the levy was an "unwelcome new tax burden" and it would have to carefully consider the impact on its existing apprenticeship system.
The levy is due to be introduced in 2017 to fund new apprenticeships.
