[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan O'Donnell attacked Lorraine Lorimer during an incident at her home in Yoker, Glasgow, in February 2014.
The 46-year-old, from the city's Drumchapel area, was previously convicted of assault, having initially faced a charge of attempted murder.
Jailing him, judge Lady Rae told O'Donnell: "No remorse has been shown for what happened."
She added: "It has been suggested that this is a lesson learned, but I am not sure how that can be when you accept no guilt."
At the High Court in Glasgow the judge also noted that O'Donnell had a previous conviction for a domestic breach of the peace.
