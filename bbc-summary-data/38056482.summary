The 24-year-old, named locally as Leon Ali, was driving a Ford Focus which was in collision with a Renault van near to Knowesouth Steading, west of Jedburgh.
The accident happened at about 21:20 on Saturday.
On their Facebook page the City of Edinburgh Running Festival described the loss of its "friend and fellow running competitor" as "heartbreaking".
"Our heartfelt sympathies go out to his family and friends at this devastating time," it added.
"He will be hugely missed by us all."
Two people from the van involved spent the night at Borders General Hospital after the crash but were released on Sunday morning.
The A698 between Cleikimin and Denholm was closed for several hours.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the incident to contact them.
