[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 27-year-old man has admitted slashing another man in a busy nightclub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Sutherland assaulted Christopher McAuley, 29, in the Word Up club in Greenock just before Christmas last year.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr McAuley needed hospital treatment for a neck wound and was left scarred for life.
Sutherland, who was originally charged with attempted murder, was remanded in custody and sentence was deferred.
Prosecutor Jo McDonald told the court that the attack happened at the club on 20 December last year.
She said that Sutherland and his victim were known to each other and that there had been a series of "minor confrontations" on the dance floor.
Sutherland had lashed out with the blade at McAuley when a bouncer tried to separate the pair.
Sutherland, a customer sales advisor, admitted assault and will be sentenced next month.
