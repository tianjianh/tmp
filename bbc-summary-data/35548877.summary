Spurs took the lead in the first half when Ben Davies was fouled inside the area and Nacer Chadli rolled home the subsequent penalty.
However, Federico Bernardeschi equalised when his deflected strike looped into the net.
Dele Alli shot over late on for Spurs, but a draw was a fair result.

Tottenham would be forgiven for prioritising domestic success over European glory this season, given they are in a strong position to challenge for a first league title in 55 years.
They are second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Leicester, but manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed a desire to win every competition they are involved in.
Although he made six changes to the side that beat Manchester City on Sunday, there were still several first-teamers involved, including Alli, Christian Eriksen and Chadli.
For large periods of the match they looked like the home side as Fiorentina, perhaps aware of the visitors' threat on the counter-attack, adopted a cautious approach and did not have a shot on target in the first half.
It was not a classic Tottenham display, but the fact a much-changed team was able to secure a positive result away to a team that has won 10 of their 13 home games this season bodes well for Pochettino's ambitions.
Pochettino has been widely praised for nurturing Tottenham's young talent, with Alli one of the most exciting to emerge during his tenure.
The 19-year-old once again showed glimpses of the brilliance he is capable of, notably producing a neat bit of skill that almost got him out of trouble when surrounded by four Fiorentina players.
He did, however, show immaturity when he appeared to kick out at defender Nenad Tomovic, and was perhaps lucky to only be booked.
It might have been easy for Pochettino to substitute the midfielder soon after to avoid a potential sending off, but the Argentine instead showed his trust in the youngster by keeping him on.
Pochettino was almost rewarded late on when Alli's spectacular acrobatic effort was just over.
Tottenham boss Pochettino, speaking about Alli appearing to kick an opponent: "We need to try to teach him
"He is a young player and he has a lot to learn about elite football.
"It is his first season in the Premier League at Tottenham. He came from League One, he needs to learn a lot. But I didn't see it. Some people say 'yes', say 'no', so I don't know."
