The brother of a pregnant teenager shot dead in disputed circumstances in west Belfast 45 years ago has told an inquest she was completely innocent.

Marian Brown, 17, had just kissed her boyfriend goodnight when she was fatally wounded in the neck.
She was caught up in an exchange of fire between paramilitaries and an Army patrol at Roden Street in June 1972.
A fresh inquest was ordered after questions were raised over the velocity of the bullet that killed her.
Her brother, Richard Brown, told the inquest that for two years the family thought she had been killed by loyalist paramilitaries shooting up the street.
However, it was only at the first inquest they discovered soldiers had also been involved in the shooting incident.
During Monday morning's hearing, Mr Brown spoke emotionally about his sister and how he felt about what happened to her.
As her older brother, he said he "felt ashamed that he couldn't do anything" to help her and he was angry that whoever fired the shot "took her life and robbed us of a sister, a daughter and a friend".
Mr Brown said the 17-year-old "never got to bloom".
Other family members were also in court for the start of the inquest being heard by Judge David McFarland, which is expected to last more than two weeks.
