Gylfi Sigurdsson says there is no concern in the Swansea team despite going three matches without a win.

Swansea were knocked out of the League Cup on Tuesday at Hull, while they drew 0-0 with Everton and lost at Watford in the Premier League prior to that.
But midfielder Sigurdsson says the blip is a temporary one that Swansea can put right at Southampton on Saturday.
"You get that kind of run sometimes... but we're not conceding many goals at the moment," said the Iceland star.
"We've just got to make sure we're ready on Saturday against Southampton. It's going to be a tough game and if we bounce back there, we're alright in the league.
"There's always pressure there to win every game and that wouldn't have changed if we'd won or lost the last two."
Swansea ended last season with their highest Premier League finish - eighth - and a record points total of 56.
Despite their mini-slump Swansea go into the game at Southampton still seventh in the table, after a good start to the season that included a draw at champions Chelsea and a win over big-spending Manchester United.
"We set the standard and put a bit of pressure on ourselves to do well, and do better than last year," Sigurdsson, 26, added.
"Of course we had a really good season last year, it's going to be tough to beat that but I think it's possible.
"The squad is stronger than it was last year so I don't see a reason why we can't match that or improve."
