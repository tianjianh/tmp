[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chelsea v Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea captain Gary Cahill and top scorer Diego Costa are among the players likely to be recalled after Antonio Conte made nine changes for Monday's win over Watford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Terry could made his 717th appearance for the Blues in his last game at Stamford Bridge as a player.
Relegated Sunderland will be without 11 injured players.
Defender Lamine Kone and midfielder Didier Ndong are the latest absentees because of dead legs.
Jonathan Pearce: "It's party time for Chelsea but a Sunderland wake. Two clubs hurtling in opposite directions.
"I'm convinced Antonio Conte will stay to empower a decent Champions League campaign.
"He deserves the Manager of the Year title for reinvigorating the club, bringing the best out of players who had sagged under Jose Mourinho, reinvented others and buying successfully.
"Diego Costa will probably be sold, Â£100m or more of new signings brought in and Conte will succeed again.
"Sunderland's future looks gloomy. Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe will surely go. There's not enough quality or character in the squad to come straight back up for fans who deserve far better."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte on the extent of John Terry's involvement on Sunday: "John is a champion and he deserves the best.
"He's a legend for this club and in this season he has been very important to win this title.
"For this reason I think I have to take my time and to make the best decision for him."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "We've had a tough year but we'll dust ourselves down, get ready to go again.
"Sunderland will carry big expectations and they could arguably be the biggest club in the Championship next year.
"I think we have a core here and we need to keep those players. We need to find a way of adding players who have quality."
Whatever team Antonio Conte picks, I don't think Sunderland will be able to stop the Blues from finishing their title-winning campaign on a high note.
