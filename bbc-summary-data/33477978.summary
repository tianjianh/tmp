Bid to block £47m Newry development fails

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newry Chamber of Commerce has lost its High Court bid to block a large development on the outskirts of the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £47m development, between the city centre and Carnbane Industrial Park, is expected to create more than 400 jobs.
Plans for the site include industrial units, new homes, a supermarket and a coffee shop.
Proposals for a £100m development were originally submitted in 2009, but had to be scaled down.
The revised plans were signed-off by Environment Minister Mark H Durkan in 2014.
The chamber requested a judicial review after existing traders in the area expressed concerns that their businesses would be hit by the new retailers.
During the consultation process, the Department of the Environment (DOE) received 20 letters of support and 85 objections, while more than 700 people signed a petition against it.
The judge said he was dismissing claims which objected to the development on the grounds that it posed a threat to the city's economy.
He said: "None of the grounds of the challenge were established and the challenge is dismissed."
The developers of the site are Warrenpoint-based, The Hill Partnership, run by father and son, Eamon and Laurence Breen.
Eamon Breen said: 'We're delighted to get this decision. The minister made the right decision a year ago and the judge has made the right decision today.
"It's a £47m development bringing 750 jobs when you include the people who will be working on construction of the site, and we are delighted to bring this to Newry."
Orla Jackson, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce, said they would now consider appealing the decision: "We do not believe the developer's claims that this brings jobs to Newry.
"It will displace jobs from our city centre businesses."
