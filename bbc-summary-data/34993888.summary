A project run by two police forces has helped identify and support 142 youngsters at risk of sexual exploitation since its launch in April.

The Wiltshire and Avon and Somerset forces funded the scheme with councils, Barnardo's and the Home Office.
Avon and Somerset police commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: "Sexually exploited children suffer adverse consequences that blight their lives."
The service has 15 full-time support workers to help the child victims.
The children's charity Barnado's is running the service and has also trained 350 professionals who work with children to spot the signs of child sexual exploitation (CSE).
Ms Mountstevens, added: "Preventing exploitation and responding quickly and effectively to stop exploitation will improve outcomes for vulnerable children and this partnership is helping with this vital work.
"By tackling the problem together, with different agencies working even more closely in partnership with each other, we can make a real difference."
CSE victims are defined as being manipulated or forced into sexual acts in return for attention, affection, money, drugs, alcohol or accommodation.
Dave McCallum, who leads the service, said: "Any child can be sexually exploited and we've seen examples with children with no overt vulnerabilities still being targeted.
"Children do tend to be vulnerable when they are approached by someone who's older who has more resources than their peers - every child might be vulnerable to that approach."
He added the affected children would get "long-term and consistent support" to help them recover from their experience.
The West of England CSE service will also mean both police forces can share data and intelligence about suspects more easily.
Mr McCallum said: "We're seeing more investigations, we're seeing more people being arrested and more disruption tactics being used.
"In the fullness of time, we will see more people in front of the courts and being convicted."
Mr McCallum is also the independent chair of the Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Board which is a multi-agency body protecting children.
