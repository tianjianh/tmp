[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Emma Baum, 22, was found at a house on Llwyndu Road, Penygroes, on Monday.
Her family, in tribute, called her "the best mother" to her son Steffan, two.
A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and a woman on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender.
Officers believe Ms Baum died during the early hours of Monday and appealed for witnesses to a disturbance between 02:00 BST and 05:00.
A neighbour described waking up to "screams" and someone shouting "stop".
There are 50 officers investigating, while an appeal was made for witnesses who saw a black Ford Fiesta travel from Trefor to Penygroes at about 02:00 and return at 04:00.
A tribute from Ms Baum's mum Amanda read: "She was my best friend and a beloved daughter, mother, partner and sister who had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody.
"She was always the life and soul in any situation."
The police investigation has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after officers were deployed following a call and initially "found nothing suspicious".
