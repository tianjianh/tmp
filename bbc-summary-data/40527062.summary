Aldred joined Blackpool from Accrington on an initial loan deal in February 2015 and went on to make 103 appearances for the club.
The 26-year-old featured in 52 games last season as Blackpool won promotion from League Two.
"He's strong, physical and a leader and a great communicator both on and off the pitch," manager Lee Clark said.
