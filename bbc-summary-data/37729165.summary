Plans for at least 225,000 homes across Greater Manchester - including some on green belt land - have been revealed.

The Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built on over the next 20 years.
Green belt sites at Pilsworth, Carrington, Cheadle Hulme and Ashton Moss have been included on the list.
The plans will be discussed by the region's 10 council leaders on Friday before the launch of consultation.
A draft report says the release of some green belt is "essential" to keep up with the city region's growth.
The combined authority said in 2015, 47% of the total land area of Greater Manchester was designated as green belt and this would be reduced to 43% if the plans are approved.
Meanwhile, West Salford Greenway, Rectory Lane, Standish in Wigan and land within the Roch Valley in Rochdale would be newly designated as green belt.
The GMSF also includes proposals for a new railway station at Droylsden and a Westhoughton bypass between Atherton and the M61.
Council leaders agree former industrial land should be used before any protected space is developed.
They say 200,000 new jobs will be created as industrial and warehousing sites are built or increased, as well as work on new roads and infrastructure to support them.
The report says: "We are preparing the GMSF to make sure that investment and growth in houses and jobs happens but also benefits our residents and makes Greater Manchester a better place to live and work.
"We need to be able to plan for schools, green spaces, roads and health facilities alongside new homes, offices and factories. If we don't do this, it won't happen."
Mark Hunter, Liberal Democrat councillor for Cheadle Hulme South, said; "There is a problem about shortage of housing and we do particularly want to help those who are desperate to get their foot on the housing ladder.
"But we've got many sites that are brownfield, some of which have stood empty for years and are ripe for development."
