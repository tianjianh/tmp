St Helens eye high Super League finish - Jon Wilkin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Wilkin wants St Helens to finish as high as possible in Super League, despite knowing a top-eight place will be enough for a play-off spot.

Leeds were crowned champions in 2011, beating Saints in the Grand Final, despite ending the season fifth.
"For my personal pride, I want to us to finish as high as we can, and not just because it makes the play-offs easier," Wilkin told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"The league table is a good barometer of who's been the best side all year."
The England international forward continued: "It's ridiculous that you can finish eighth and be deemed the champions but, the way the competition is set up, you can have a decent shot at it from anywhere in that top eight."

St Helens are one of the form teams in Super League and lie fourth in the table, eight points behind leaders Wigan Warriors.
Wilkin, 28, is celebrating a decade with Saints and is combining his playing duties with events for his testimonial year.
"A committee of people have organised a lot of things on my behalf," said Wilkin. "They've organised some great events and the impact on my rugby life has been minimal.
"I'm so proud to have been given a testimonial. I remember watching this club as a kid. To have played for 10 years at this club, I couldn't more proud and pleased to be part of this club's history."
St Helens face Wilkin's first club, Hull KR, at Langtree Park on Friday.
