The mother of April Jones, whose disappearance sparked one of the UK's largest police searches, has spoken at a service to remember missing people.

Coral Jones said the service was a chance for families to "pay tribute to their loved one".
The body of five-year-old April has never been found after she was abducted and murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012.
The sister of Manic Street Preachers guitarist Richey Edwards was also at the event. He disappeared in 1995.
The event was organised by the charity, Missing People.
Talking about her "beautiful daughter," Mrs Jones said: "Despite huge support from the police and the public, our search for her ended in tragedy.
"This is a chance for families who are suffering the heartache of missing someone to come together with supporters of the charity and pay tribute to their loved one."
April was abducted by Bridger as she played with friends near her home in Machynlleth, Powys, in October 2012.
Her body has not been found.
However, blood and fragments of bone consistent with a young human skull were found at the house Bridger rented.
The property has since been bought by the Welsh government and demolished.
Rachel Elias, sister of rock star Richey Edwards, also attended the event at Cardiff's Tabernacl Welsh Baptist Chapel.
The Manic Street Preachers's guitarist was presumed dead in October 2008, 13 years after he disappeared on February 1995.
Some believe Edwards, from Blackwood, south Wales, took his own life at the age of 27, and his car was later found near the Severn Bridge.
Jo Youle, the head of Missing People, said: "We know that Christmas is a particularly hard time for people searching for their loved ones.
"Families with someone missing tell us that having the public attend events like this offers them comfort and hope."
