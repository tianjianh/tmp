Green Room: 'The violence is grounded and brutal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Director Jeremy Saulnier returns to the Cannes Film Festival with a blood-soaked siege movie, starring Patrick Stewart as the leader of a white power gang of skinheads.

Two years ago, American film maker Jeremy Saulnier took his revenge film Blue Ruin to Cannes to screen as part of the Directors' Fortnight - a strand of the film festival which has screened early works from Martin Scorsese and Ken Loach to more recent films by the likes of Clio Bernard.
His new film Green Room casts British acting royalty Patrick Stewart as the leader of a gang of white supremacists in a Portland backwater bar. They lay siege to a dressing room where a young band are cowering, having witnessed the aftermath of a brutal murder.
And it's all set to a thrashing punk soundtrack.
"I grew up in the punk rock hardcore scene in Washington DC and had always been attracted to the aesthetic of that world," he explains.
"It's also very kinetic and physical and I loved that world. My high school years were spent with my friends making movies and playing in punk rock bands so the idea's been gestating for quite some time."
The film also features Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin, as the band's bass player, with Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat as the guitarist. British actor Joe Cole, seen recently in Peaky Blinders, and Callum Turner play the other band members.
British actress Imogen Poots is also stuck in the room with them, sporting plenty of attitude and a rather marvellous Chelsea fringe haircut [a punk style long at the front and short or shaved at the back].
The decision to cast a renowned stage actor against type as a backwater racist is the one of which Saulnier is most proud.
"We were about two weeks out of shooting and we still didn't have Darcy [Stewart's character] and I thought the film would implode," he admits.
"But Patrick swooped in. He got the script, he saw Blue Ruin and he was up for an adventure."
The British actor arrived on set pre-prepared, having worked on a detailed back story with the director.
"You hear horror stories of big name actors being a nightmare and not knowing their lines but he came in, he knew everything he had to do and discussed everything," he says.
Saulnier also cast his best friend Macon Blair, who starred in Blue Ruin, as another member of the skinhead gang.
"He got his hair cut short and bought fake tattoos from the internet and auditioned for the role," says Saulnier. "I thought, 'not only is he going to get this role, he's the only person who can do it'."
Another key character is the music, which plays a major role in the film.
"We have Slayer, we have Bad Brains, we have CCR [Creedence Clearwater Revival]. All of these crazy awesome bands.
"But also in the background of some of the scenes, and in one of the live performances, are [songs] from my high school bands.
"Hearing these songs that I used to hear in 1994 in Virginia being played live by Anton and Alia was a dream come true.
The film is incredibly violent with various characters dispatched with shotguns, machetes and even a vicious dog.
But the director insists "ideally there is an emotional impact to everything. The visceral blowback of seeing these acts on screen is not easy to digest - it's never supposed to rest easy."
The press screening at Cannes over the weekend was punctuated with gasps and squeals, which delighted Saulnier.
"This is a straight up genre film, it's for my 19-year-old self and the kids I grew up with. It's a movie for fans, if you're a horror nerd.
"But I also wanted to make sure that the violence is not celebrated. It's grounded and brutal and it has to serve the intensity of the story. If it's just violence for violence's sake, you lose the value of it."
For all the horror, Green Room is not without lighter moments of comedy, which often serve as a release valve for some of the more intense moments. A neat running gag involves the band all choosing a band which they would take with them on to a desert island.
They all go for the most obscure, credible bands until they face genuine danger and the truth comes spilling out. Without ruining the joke too much, it seems the hardest punks have a weakness for pop music. And it has a great payoff in the film's closing scenes.
"I always find humour in dark places, it also seems natural. I really let it evolve and I find a little irony here or a moment for a character. I like the fact when the characters are not experts and [there is] lots of confusion and miscommunication, that is a good environment for dark comedy."
So, what is Saulnier's one desert island band? "Definitely (Black) Sabbath," he says.
Credibility intact Mr S.
