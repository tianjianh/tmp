[SN]TITLE[SN]
Revised date for opening of £48.5m Wick Joint Campus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £48.5m school campus in the Highlands is now not expected to open to pupils until next year because of delays in completing the project.

At a turf cutting ceremony in 2014 marking the start of construction on the Wick Joint Campus it was said the site would open this summer.
Last month, the handover of the school from the contractor to Highland Council was delayed until October.
The council says the handover is now not expected to happen until December.
If that timescale is achieved, the campus would then be available to pupils and staff in January or February 2017, the local authority said.
Hub North Scotland is overseeing the construction of the campus by contractor Morrison Construction.
The campus is being constructed to replace Wick High School and Pulteneytown and South primaries.
It will also have community facilities which will be available to the public.
