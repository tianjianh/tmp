The seventh seeds beat Koreans Kim Gi Jung and Shin Seung Chan 21-12 21-16 at the Barclaycard Arena.
In the last eight on Friday, the Adcocks face Indonesia's Tontowi Ahmed and Liliyana Natsir, who beat them at the same stage last year.
The husband-and-wife pair have never reached the last four of the Championships.
"It's another quarter-final here and that's an amazing feeling, but we do want to go that step further," said Gabby Adcock, who lost 21-19 with Chris in the final set to Ahmed and Natsir in 2015.
"We know it's tough. We had a close match last year but we are going to go out there and give our everything."
Britons Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge reached the last eight of the men's doubles by beating Korean seventh seeds Kim Gi Jung and Kim Sa Rang 14-21 21-15 21-16.
Ellis and Langridge will play top seeds Lee Yong Dae and Yoo Yoo Seong, also of Korea, for a place in the semi-finals.
