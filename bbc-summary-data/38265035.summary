Tollitt joined Rovers on loan in September, and has made 10 National League appearances for the club.
The 22-year-old former Everton trainee signed for Pompey from non-league side Skelmersdale in March 2015, and played in 18 games for the League Two club.
"This is a great signing to be able to add a young, local emerging talent," Rovers manager Micky Mellon said.
"Ben is a lad of great promise and if he continues to work hard, he will be able to fulfil that potential."
