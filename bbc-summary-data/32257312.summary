The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said its Manannan fast craft was damaged by sea debris that has cost more than Â£100,000 to fix.
The firm said sea trials with the vessel earlier "went well" and it was ready to return to service on Saturday.
Sailings will start with the 07.30 BST crossing from Douglas to Liverpool.
Thousands of people have had their travel plans disrupted by the cancellations.
The firm said the damage, which has caused disruption to services since 3 April, was the "worst they have ever seen".
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's chief executive Mark Woodward said: "I would like to thank our passengers for their patience and understanding while Manannan was being repaired.
"This has obviously been a difficult period and I want to again apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers."
