A killer has sent the mother of his victim a letter telling her he is "sincerely sorry" for her "loss".

Paul Fether, 31, was stabbed and beaten in Benalmadena, near Malaga, Spain, in April 2010 over a drug deal.
Earlier this month Wayne Lennon, 38, and Brian McConville, 30, both of Dublin, admitted homicide and were jailed for 11 years.
Mr Fether's mother Beryl, of South Ockendon, Essex, said she had received a letter from McConville.
She said it showed her son's killer had a "human" side and that it had "come from the heart".
McConville and Lennon were initially charged with murder but the counts against them were downgraded to homicide as part of a plea bargain in Spain.
Mrs Fether said she felt "sick and disgusted" at the change in charges but said she did now feel able to "move on" following the case.
She told how attending the court hearing was the "last thing" she had been able to do for her son.
"I must have sat and stared at them [Lennon and McConville] on the first day for about 45 minutes. Not once did they look my way.
"I would have liked them, just once, to look me in the eye. I never got the chance."
Mrs Fether has received a personal, handwritten, letter from McConville.
In it he wrote: "I am sincerely sorry for your loss. I have so much remorse for what happened. I am in prison, I deserve to be here."
She also has a typed letter from Lennon - though that was addressed not to her, but to the judge.
