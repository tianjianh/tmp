[SN]TITLE[SN]
Embezzler to pay back almost £600,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman jailed for embezzling more than £1.3m from her employers has been ordered to pay back nearly £600,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacqueline McPhie, 46, took the money while vice president for finance at Altus Intervention in Aberdeen between March 2013 and April 2014.
McPhie, of Arbroath, admitted embezzlement and was jailed for three years and four months in July.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, she was ordered to pay back £587,434 through her "realisable assets."
She was given six months to pay the confiscation order.
McPhie diverted money from the business, which supplies equipment for North Sea oil and gas projects, to fund her lifestyle.
She bought an £80,000 Range Rover, and spent more than £60,000 on a new garage and driveway, £52,000 on a kitchen and £30,000 on a summer house in her garden.
McPhie had previously been given 300 hours of community service 16 years ago for stealing £250,000 from previous employers.
