It is only the second time a Briton has won the event since its 2004 rebrand, after Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2013.
Dimension Data rider Cummings finished in the main bunch as Australian Caleb Ewan won the sprint at Piccadilly Circus to end the 16-lap 100km course.
Australia's Rohan Dennis was second overall, 26 seconds behind, with Dutchman Tom Dumoulin third.
Cummings, 35, was runner-up in 2008 and 2011. He took the overall lead in this year's race by finishing eighth on stage six of the eight-day race and held on to it despite losing time on the penultimate day.
Victory builds on an impressive year in which he claimed stage wins in Tirreno-Adriatico, the Tour of the Basque Country, the Criterium du Dauphine and the Tour de France.
"I'm delighted. Finally I can smile and enjoy it. It's been a tough week. It was so close that it wasn't done until I crossed the line," he said.
"I'd to thank all my team-mates for keeping me out of trouble, and the British public for supporting every day like they have. It's been a great week."
The Netherlands' Jasper Bovenhuis won the sprint classification, Xandro Meurisse of Belgium was the best climber and Bovenhuis' compatriot Dylan Groenewegen - second behind Ewan on Sunday - won the points classification.
Team Sky, for whom British rider Ben Swift was eighth overall, won the prize for best team.
