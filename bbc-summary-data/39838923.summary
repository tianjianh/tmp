The Irish were bowled out for 96 in 44.4 overs and India reached the target in only 18.4 overs.
With several Ireland regulars unavailable for the series, Jennifer Gray top-scored for the Irish with 24.
Deepti Sharma was unbeaten on 51 and Poonam Raut 46 not out as India quickly reached their target.
Sharma and Ekta Bisht both took three Ireland wickets as the best Irish partnership in Potchefstroom was a paltry 27 between Gaby Lewis (20) and skipper Laura Delaney (14).
Hosts South Africa and Zimbabwe are also competing in the two-week long tournament and Ireland's next game is against the Zimbabweans on Tuesday.
Seven uncapped players - Aoife Beggs, Rachel Delaney, Louise Little, Lara Maritz, Sophie MacMahon, Leah Paul and Rebecca Stokell - were included in Ireland's 15-woman squad.
Ireland's women missed out on earning a place at this year's World Cup in England at the qualification tournament in Sri Lanka in February.
