After opting to field first, Northants enjoyed an early breakthrough when in-form Paul Horton was trapped lbw.
However Dexter (98) and Angus Robson (56) steadied the innings with a 143-run partnership that was broken eventually by Olly Stone.
Leicestershire then lost Mark Pettini just before the close but Niall O'Brien (15 no) guided them to 309-5 at stumps.
Leicestershire batsman Neil Dexter told BBC Radio Leicester:
"The ball did quite a bit in the first hour. Angus Robson played exceptionally well and our partnership put us in a strong position.
"It's a little hard to judge the pitch. As a batsman, you always had the feeling there might be a ball with your name on it.
"They may look back and feel they didn't attack the stumps enough. We'd certainly have taken this score at the start of play."
Northants captain Alex Wakely told BBC Radio Northampton:
"It was a tough one whether to bowl first or have the toss, and I still feel there was plenty in the pitch in the first session.
"All the bowlers have put their hands up and accepted they didn't hit their straps.
"We bowled too many balls they could leave, especially early on, and we were a bit flat in the field, but a couple of early wickets and we can be back in the game."
