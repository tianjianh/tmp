Election 2015: BBC News NI has it covered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As general election polling is under way, BBC News NI is ready to provide comprehensive coverage as results start coming in.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Our news website, TV and radio will bring you all the results as they happen.
On Thursday night, BBC News NI's website will bring you complete coverage of each of the 18 constituencies.
As the polls close at 22:00 BST, our election live page will bring you constant updates on how the parties are faring, who is out who is in, the big stories of the election and latest from the count centres.
You can also keep across how the vote is looking in your own constituency.
We'll bring you up-to-date content from our reporters and correspondents in the count centres, who will also be tweeting through the night.
On TV, Mark Carruthers, Tara Mills and political editor Mark Devenport will be live on BBC One Northern Ireland from 21:55 BST through to 06:00 BST the following day.
They will provide coverage and analysis of the results as they come in.
Joining Mark Devenport to analyse the results in the studio will be elections expert Nicholas Whyte.
As well as reporters at all Northern Ireland's count centres, political correspondent Stephen Walker will be in London giving viewers the overall UK picture.
On BBC Radio Ulster William Crawley presents an election night special from 22:00 BST until 02:00 BST on Friday.
There will be conversation, analysis and interviews with winners and losers as William is joined by political commentators to discuss the wider implications of the election results for Northern Ireland.
In this election, more than ever before, the focus could be on the Northern Ireland parties if there is a hung parliament.
So even after the results are in, we'll bring you all the wheeling and dealing that could result in another coalition government or a minority one.
And we'll bring you analysis of what this will mean for Northern Ireland.
Then from 06:00 BST on Friday, Noel Thompson and Karen Patterson will present a special election results programme on BBC Radio Ulster.
They will be joined by pollsters, number crunchers, journalists and commentators. Listeners will be asked to join the conversation, too, by phone, text or on social media.
On BBC Radio Foyle, Enda McClafferty and Elaine McGee will present the latest results from the count centres at breakfast time on Friday, from 07:00 BST to 10:30 BST.
