South Wales £4.5m 'organised' drugs gang jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of an organised crime gang who plotted to supply millions of pounds worth of drugs have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police seized 12kg of "high purity cocaine" equivalent to 48kg of "cut cocaine" worth between £1.5m and £4.5m.
Cardiff Crown Court heard at least 36kg of mephedrone worth up to £300,000 was also seized.
Eleven of the 13 defendants from Blaenau Gwent, Newport and Rhondda Cynon Taff were jailed for drugs offences.
Ashley Burgham, 28, from Blaina was described as the head of the organisation with Michael Barnes, 32, from Abertillery, as his second in command who met national suppliers.
Others were couriers who supplied "downstream customers" and met suppliers.
Gwent Police also seized £205,494 in cash during the operation.
Originally, the gang met an Albanian crime group to get hold of drugs, but when this relationship ended, they turned to a supplier in Spain.
Det Chf Insp Roger Fortey said: "Officers carried out a meticulous enquiry to dismantle this sophisticated organised crime group.
"The defendants in this case were motivated by greed and profits and had convinced themselves that they were untouchable."
