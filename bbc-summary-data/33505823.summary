Video gamers around the world are mourning the death of Nintendo's respected CEO Satoru Iwata in games and social media.

From an Iwata swordfighter to a banana meme, the BBC takes a look at some of the ways fans are honouring his legacy.
Wii tributes
Many users used Wii games to pay tribute to Mr Iwata, who steered the company to develop the game console.
On the popular paint-shooting game Splatoon, where users can doodle their own character status updates, some have been spotted referencing Mr Iwata and his games.
Twitter user Hollander Cooper noted: "Splatoon is really, really depressing tonight."
Some have also used it to express moral support for Nintendo.
Video gamer Matt Blankenship created a tribute figure to Mr Iwata in the game Mii Swordfighter.
Some have also tweeted tribute images of Mr Iwata with a bunch of bananas, in a reference to an internet meme about him.
In 2012 Nintendo screened a short clip of Mr Iwata silently staring at the fruit at the start of a press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), as an apparent nod to Donkey Kong.
The clip soon became a running joke. Mr Iwata's - or rather his puppet's - latest performance took place at this year's E3 where Nintendo hired the Jim Henson Company to make puppet versions of the executives.
Twitter has been flooded with artworks depicting Mr Iwata with famous characters in the Nintendo game universe.
This picture by Twitter user 1217karen shows him with Kirby perched on his head. The pink blob stars in the eponymous game which Mr Iwata helped to create in his early years as a programmer.
Others have tweeted screenshots showing Nintendo characters looking sad, and the "Thank you" credits at the end of classic Nintendo games.
