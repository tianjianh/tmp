He also donated the suits he wore at the Grammy and Brit Awards to the St Elizabeth Hospice shop in his home town of Framlingham, Suffolk.
They were among 13 bags of clothes donated by the pop star.
Rachail Pollard, the shop's manager, said they hoped to raise a "few thousand pounds" from the donation.
"We are delighted that Ed has chosen to donate so many of his clothes to us," she said.
"Over the last few years we have had multiple donations from him and they have proved very popular, with people coming from all over to queue outside the shop to buy them, as well as people all across the globe bidding on the online."
The donations will go on sale in the Market Hill store and online on Saturday.
The checked shirt worn by the 25-year-old when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in a bar in the film, will be auctioned on eBay.
It is the second time Sheeran has donated goods to the hospice.
Ms Pollard added: "We have raised over Â£4,000 so far from his donations and we hope to raise a few thousand pounds from these fantastic donations.
"We are really grateful to Ed for choosing to support us and we're sure his clothes will fly out of the shop."
It is also not the first time this year Sheeran has supported the Suffolk hospice.
As part of the Pigs Gone Wild art trail in Ipswich this summer, he had a pig sculpture designed to look like him.  It was named Ed Sheer-Ham.
The pig goes up for auction on Thursday.
