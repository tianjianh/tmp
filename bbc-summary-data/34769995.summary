Tim Wolfe: US university chief quits in race row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The president of the University of Missouri has resigned amid accusations that there is endemic racism at the university that is not being addressed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tim Wolfe made the announcement as students and professors staged a walkout at the Columbia campus.
Some members of the university's football team have threatened not to play at a game on Saturday over the racial issues.
Black student groups say racial slurs are commonly used around campus.
"The frustration and anger that I see is clear and real and I don't doubt it for a second," said Mr Wolfe.
"I take full responsibility for the frustration and inaction on this campus."
Missouri graduate student Jonathan Butler, who had been participating in a hunger strike as a protest, said the resignation was a "great step towards change" but there was still a lot of work to do.
"We still have a lot of healing that needs to happen on campus," he said, adding that his hunger strike would now end.
Mr Wolfe served as president of the entire university system and not specifically for the flagship Columbia campus.
Among the offences black students have complained about:
Concerned Student 1950, the student group that has been having a sit-in on campus since last Monday, tweeted that his resignation was a victory but its work was not done.
"Our brother can eat, but we are still owed Demands! Stay strong!" the group tweeted.
Rather than jubilation, the main sentiment was disappointment and frustration - at least if you looked at Yik Yak.
