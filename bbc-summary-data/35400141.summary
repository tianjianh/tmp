Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue to charge for broken lift call outs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Firms in Somerset and Devon are to be charged if they repeatedly call the fire service for broken lift rescues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue has said it costs £303 for a one-hour attendance using one appliance.
Neil Blackburn from the service said: "We will only take cost recovery on businesses where there are persistent problems."
The fire service said the move, which they aim to bring in from April, would save £30,000 a year.
There were 246 call-outs in Somerset and 1608 in Devon between 2011-15.
The fire service said by taking no action on lift rescues, it would cost £758,000 over three years, a figure it wants to reduce.
"We don't ever want to get to that position where we are charging businesses, the intention is we will work with the businesses and we will encourage them to take action," added Mr Blackburn.
The fire service said the recovery costs would be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the circumstances.
If repeated call-outs were made to the same firm, they could potentially be faced with paying for the £303 cost of sending out one appliance.
