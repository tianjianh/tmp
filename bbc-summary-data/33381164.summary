A nationwide minute's silence has been held in memory of the victims of the shooting in Tunisia last Friday.

Cumbernauld couple Jim and Ann McQuire and Billy and Lisa Graham of Bankfoot were among 30 Britons killed in Sousse by a gunman with extremist links.
Their bodies were flown back to the UK on Thursday.
A candlelit vigil was planned in Perthshire for the Grahams, while a special church service was held in Cumbernauld in memory of the McQuires.
Following the service in Abronhill Church, where Mr and Mrs McQuire were members, session clerk Linda Gray said: "The church was full. There were lots of people there and we were happy to be together to share our prayers with the community.
"We would like to thank everyone who came and also the very many people - some we knew and some we did not know - who sent messages of love and support. It was very kind."
A total of 38 people were killed in the attack by Seifeddine Rezgui last Friday. The gunman, who had links to the Islamic State group, was himself shot dead following the incident, and Tunisian authorities have arrested several people on suspicion of helping him.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who are in Glasgow, joined in with the minute's silence during a visit to the University of Strathclyde.
The silence was also marked by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who signed a book of condolence which has been opened by North Lanarkshire Council.
She said: "Today is a day to remember all of the victims of this senseless and cowardly terrorist attack and my thoughts, prayers and heartfelt condolences are with their families and friends at this incredibly difficult time.
"I hope that the families of James and Ann McQuire and Billy and Lisa Graham can take some comfort from the fact that right across Scotland people have come together to condemn these mindless acts and pay respects to their loved ones during today's minute's silence - just as I hope all the bereaved families will take comfort from the expression of solidarity right across the UK."
Shoppers and staff in Aberdeen and Inverness paused to mark the occasion, while passengers at Glasgow Airport also fell silent.
Flags are being flown at half-mast at the Scottish Parliament, Whitehall and Buckingham Palace.
A special ceremony was held at the scene of the killings in Sousse, and events were held at churches and mosques across the country.
The candlelit vigil in Bankfoot was due to be held at a park near the Graham family home. A local councillor said the village had been "very subdued" since the death of the "very well-known couple", who had been in Tunisia celebrating Mrs Graham's 50th birthday.
North Lanarkshire and Perth and Kinross Councils are flying flags at half-mast, and have opened books of condolence.
The first inquests into the deaths of the Britons are also set to begin, with the bodies of more of the dead expected to arrive back at RAF Brize Norton.
