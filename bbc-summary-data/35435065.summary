Syria conflict: Boycott threat to Geneva peace talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Syria peace talks are due to get under way in Geneva amid confusion over whether opposition groups will attend.

Earlier some opposition leaders said representatives would not go unless action was taken to stop the bombing of civilians; but another senior figure later said they would be attending.
A delegation for the Syrian government is due to arrive in Geneva later.
In a video message to the Syrian people, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the talks "cannot fail".
More than 250,000 people have died in almost five years of war in Syria.
Eleven million others have been forced from their homes as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other - as well as jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS).
The last talks aimed at ending the conflict broke down in February 2014 after only two rounds, with the UN blaming the government for refusing to discuss an opposition demand for Mr Assad to step down.
Despite little sign of a change in that stance, the rise of IS prompted the US and Russia to step up their efforts to get the warring parties back to the negotiating table.
The so-called proximity talks are expected to last for six months, with delegations sitting in separate rooms and UN officials shuttling between them.
The immediate priorities are a broad ceasefire, humanitarian aid deliveries and halting the threat posed by IS. But the ultimate aim is a peace settlement that includes a transitional period ending with elections, in line with a UN Security Council resolution approved last month.
The opposition Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee, which was formed after a conference of political and armed factions last month, declared on Thursday that its delegation would "certainly" not be there.
After a meeting in Riyadh, the committee complained that it had not received convincing answers to its demands for an end to air strikes and blockades by government forces.
The head of the committee, Riad Hijab, told al-Arabiya TV: "Tomorrow, we will not be in Geneva. We could go there but we will not enter the negotiating room if our demands are not met."
But another senior figure with the committee, Hassan Abdel Azim, said on Friday that members of the opposition were on their way to Geneva and others would follow.
He confirmed a small number of the opposition had refused to come because they were under pressure from a regional power, the BBC's Feras Kilani reports from Geneva.
In his video message, Mr de Mistura warned that these talks could be the country's last chance for peace.
"Now we need to hear your voice to everyone who is coming to this conference, and saying this conference must be an opportunity not to be missed," he said.
