Lyon, who are fourth in Ligue 1, were looking comfortable leading 3-0 thanks to goals from Christophe Jallet, Maxwel Cornet and Depay with his first.
The ex-Manchester United forward then spun in the centre circle and spotted teenage keeper Alban Lafont off his line before lobbing him from 50 yards.
"I didn't even see the ball go in, I just heard everyone go crazy," he said.
Depay has scored five goals in nine Ligue 1 games since moving from United.
"I had tried one like that a few years ago and it hit the bar," the Dutchman, 23, told Canal Plus.
"I saw the goalkeeper was playing off his line in the first half and I kept that in the back of my mind."
Lyon coach Bruno Genesio suggested the scoreline made it easier for Depay to attempt the shot "although knowing him he would also have tried it at 0-0".
