A Devon police officer has been suspended from duty after being caught shoplifting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The female Exeter-based officer was cautioned after admitting stealing from a Plymouth store in December last year.
The officer, who is believed to be of a sergeant rank, was arrested on suspicion of theft in February.
Devon and Cornwall Police said the officer was "currently suspended from duty pending an internal disciplinary hearing".
The force refused to confirm the identity of the officer, what was stolen, which shop was involved and if more than one incident of shoplifting had taken place.
