The panel, which will consist of 12 people in total, will decide the top 10 contenders for the main award, as well as the Team of the Year, Coach of the Year and Overseas Sports Personality.
The BBC Sports Personality of the Year event will be held in Glasgow on Sunday, 14 December at The SSE Hydro in front of an estimated 12,000 crowd.
The show will be broadcast live on BBC One, with the overall winner being voted for by the public on the night of the show.
The other representatives on the panel include newspaper sports editors Mike Dunn (Independent, the i and Evening Standard), Howard Wheatcroft (Express Newspapers head of sport) and Alex Butler (Sunday Times), pan-sports broadcaster/journalist: Alison Mitchell and the chair of SportScotland Louise Martin.
The director of BBC Sport Barbara Slater will also sit on the panel alongside Philip Bernie (Head of TV Sport) and Carl Doran (Executive Editor, BBC Sports Personality of the Year).
The panel will select a shortlist of 10 sportspeople on the basis that it reflects UK sporting achievements on the national and/or international stage, represents the breadth and depth of UK sports, and takes into account 'impact' over and beyond the sport or sporting achievement in question.
This year has been another busy one for sport with the Winter Olympics, Fifa World Cup, Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup, as well as annual events such as the Six Nations, Wimbledon and The Open Championship.

The top three will be announced on Blue Peter and invited to the live event at The Hydro in Glasgow. The other top seven contenders will be notified out of courtesy that they have not made the final shortlist.
