[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee employment support firm Claverhouse in liquidation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dundee employment support group has gone into liquidation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Claverhouse, which operated as a social enterprise and charity through the Claverhouse Group, Claverhouse Training and Claverhouse Services, has appointed liquidators from FRP Advisory.
The company had suffered from a fall in income in recent years, and anticipated "significant" losses over the next 12 months.
All 39 permanent staff and 13 fixed term staff have been let go.
As part of winding-up discussions, joint liquidators Tom MacLennan and Iain Fraser are talking with other contract providers who could take on the firm's work or the contracts of staff who have been made redundant.
Founded in 1981, Claverhouse provided the unemployed with training for work and interviews as well as work experience and job placement services. It worked both on a contractor and sub-contractor basis with the Scottish government, Dundee City Council, Skills Development Scotland and the BIG Lottery.
Mr MacLennan said: "Although Claverhouse has a long and proud record helping to train, support and place the unemployed in work, and had built an extensive network of partnership organisations across Tayside, the business is suffering from a reduction in income levels, is unable to finance the direct and overhead costs from operations and is therefore no longer financially viable.
"As a result, all 39 full-time staff have been made redundant with immediate effect and the short term contracts have been ended.
"Efforts are being made to relocate the services contracts and, where possible, any directly associated staff, and we will work with all contracting organisations to try and secure a positive outcome.
"It is hoped that as many employees as possible will gain employment in relation to certain contracts being taken over by other service providers. Support will be provided to all affected staff."
