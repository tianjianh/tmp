[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bid to trace parents of girl taken into care in West Sussex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal to trace the birth parents of a young girl taken into care in West Sussex has started.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl, temporarily named Jade, is thought to be about 19-months-old and is of Afro-Caribbean appearance.
Sussex Police said she was taken into care in March although may have been separated from her family before then.
Officers said her surname may be Alma or Nakabugo and she could have connections to Crawley or Tooting.
The toddler, who is being looked after by children's services, has been described as "affectionate, sociable, bright and happy".
The appeal has been jointly launched by Sussex Police, West Sussex Social Services, and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service.
Officers said they were particularly appealing to the Ugandan community for help and stressed the parents were not in any trouble.
Det Sgt Alexis Witek said: "At this point we really need to find out who this little girl's parents are.
"She may have connections to Crawley and West Sussex as well as Tooting or south London more generally."
Sussex Police said publicity for the case was ordered by Mr Justice Hayden sitting at the Family Court in Brighton on 20 June.
