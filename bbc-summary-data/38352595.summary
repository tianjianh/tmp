[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Detectives are investigating acts of violence, disorder and vandalism that took place at the event and have so far made 119 arrests.
The incidents happened after the final whistle at the Hibernian versus Rangers game at Hampden on Saturday 21 May.
A dedicated email address has been set up for anyone with information.
Thousands of Hibs fans jumped the barriers at the final whistle after their team won its first Scottish Cup Final in 114 years.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy to Hibs and there was no lap of honour.
Police have urged anyone with information about the identities of those pictured to come forward.
