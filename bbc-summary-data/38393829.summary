The boy was found outside St Peter's Church in Bramley, West Yorkshire, on the morning of 23 November.
Police said "baby Peter" was wrapped in a blue striped towel, a 15in-collar men's white shirt and had been placed in a Tesco "bag for life.
He died at hospital, with the cause of death still unknown.
Officers said a DNA profile of the mother has been identified, but it did not match any recorded on police systems.
Det Ch Insp Nicola Bryar said: "The towel has no label on it and so we would also be interested in hearing from anyone who owns this type of towel or knows where they are sold.
"We are now at a time of year when people are focusing on their families and on their children and, whatever the reasons may be, there is a girl or woman out there who will be going through the continued trauma of this tragic situation and who clearly needs help."
