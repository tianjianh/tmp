[SN]TITLE[SN]
Revised £30m Lincoln transport hub plan approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a £30m transport hub in Lincoln is expected to begin in August after councillors approved a revised planning application.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme includes a bus station, 1,000-space multi-storey car park and footbridge.
It also now includes plans to build a temporary bus station while the new one is constructed.
The council says the plans, going before the planning committee in May, will "revitalise the city centre".
The project has received £11m of funding from the Department for Transport and £2m of Greater Lincolnshire Local Economic Partnership funding. The council has said it will borrow the additional £16m needed.
