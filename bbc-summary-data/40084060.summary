McDowell's level-par total left him 10 shots behind winner Kevin Kisner.
The Northern Irishman looked on course for a top-10 finish after starting with two birdies on Sunday.
However, the 2010 US Open champion could manage one more birdie in a round which included three bogeys and damaging double bogey at the 16th.
McDowell's latest performance keeps him 87th in the world rankings and he is 102nd in the Fedex Cup standings.
American Kisner held his nerve to clinch a second PGA Tour victory as he finished one strike ahead of compatriots Jordan Spieth and Sean O'Hair plus Spaniard Jon Rahm.
