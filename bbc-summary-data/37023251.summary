DC Comics' super villain movie Suicide Squad has proved it could be a hit on both sides of the Atlantic as it topped the UK box office on its debut.

Mirroring its success Stateside, cinemagoers ignored critics who dismissed it as "boring and unfunny" and "the worst of the worst".
It took Â£11.2m over the weekend, knocking last week's number one, Finding Dory, into second place.
In the film, Will Smith and Margot Robbie team up with a gang of villains.
Jared Leto, Cara Delevingne, Karen Fukuhara and Viola Davis play other anti-heroes.
The latest Jason Bourne film also dropped a place to third in its second week of release.
Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Roald Dahl's BFG, starring Oscar winner Mark Rylance, took fourth spot, with Star Trek Beyond in fifth.
Suicide Squad was the only new film in the top 10.
