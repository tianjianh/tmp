Llorente, 31, scored twice in the 3-0 win over Sunderland as Swansea briefly moved out of the drop zone.
The Spaniard has scored four goals in his last three games.
"We've always been lucky at Swansea having strikers who score 15-plus goals and that is how to stay in the league. Hopefully Fernando can be that man," he said.
"He's someone with fantastic experience and he's starting to settle down now."
Swansea dropped back into the relegation zone on Sunday when West Ham secured a 2-2 draw at Liverpool.
The Swans signed the Spain striker and 2010 World Cup winner from Sevilla for an undisclosed fee in August.
The former Athletic Bilbao and Juventus striker admitted to having struggled on his return from a knee injury during the early part of the season and found the language barrier a difficulty.
He scored his first Swansea goal in a 3-1 defeat at home to Manchester City in September but did not score again until November when came off the bench to score twice in stoppage time and earn a dramatic 5-4 win against Crystal Palace.
"If you give him chances, then he'll finish them," Britton added.
"His first goal was a fantastic finish, it was difficult one, with a lot of bodies in the way but he's made contact.

"Also, if you can put a cross in the box for him, he's a powerful guy who's good with his head. He's a good finisher and his hold-up play is so important to the way we play."
Swansea were bottom of the table before beating fellow strugglers Sunderland at the Liberty Stadium.
Manager Bob Bradley has warned his side they still have "plenty of work to do" and Britton acknowledged the need to build on the win over Sunderland.
"The games coming up are winnable and we need to make sure we turn those games into points.
"We need to perform like we did [against Sunderland] and if we do, over the next period, then I'm sure we'll pick up enough points to get us up the table."
