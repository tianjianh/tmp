The thief, who was wearing a flat cap, struck as he drank at the bar in Wagley's in Aberdeen's Exchange Street on Sunday night.
The tin was in aid of Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) and the bar is now planning a fundraising night to replace the money.
Police Scotland confirmed it was investigating.
The bar has turned to social media in the hope of tracking down the culprit.
One post states: "We have contacted the police but want your help to catch this disgusting excuse for a human being.
"Do you know him? Can you help us point the police in the right direction? We are willing to give a reward for the person who helps us get him caught."
