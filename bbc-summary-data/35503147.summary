One of Edinburgh's iconic gardens has been invaded by nocturnal stick-figures as part of an art installation.

Keyframes are stick-figure light sculptures, which will be exhibited until 28 March in St Andrew Square.
Each sculpture has been designed to create an illusion of stop-motion movement as they shine in sequence to a series of sound effects every evening.
It is part of the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design and is by producer, Curated Place.
It is also produced with French artists Groupe LAPS.
Thomas Veyssiere from Groupe LAPS said: "The most exciting thing about installing Keyframes in St Andrew Square is that it is a long and immersive form.
"Our lighting puppets will inhabit the square for two months.
"Rather than offering one point of view, visitors who walk through the square will discover the figures undertaking different activities, be it climbing a tree, throwing a Frisbee or having a snooze.
"Sound will envelop the whole area and entice visitors to get closer to the installation."
Richard Lewis, Edinburgh city council's events champion, said: "Public art by day, lightshow by night, Keyframes is something completely different for Edinburgh.
"It's fantastic to bring international cultural events to the city.
"This project has been tailored by the French artists to suit the square and celebrate elements of Scottish culture, from the sound of the bagpipes to our national love of football."
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "The Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design is now underway and we have an exciting array of events planned to showcase Scotland's spirit of invention and creativity.
"Keyframes is a fantastic example of what will be on offer during the year.
"The installation will bring a busy part of our nation's capital to life and, as a free event, gives everyone the opportunity to participate and experience the architecture and environment of St Andrew Square in a new and different light."
Roddy Smith, chief executive of Essential Edinburgh, said: "We are delighted to support a project in St Andrew Square that is such a stunning addition to the city centre."
It is the first time Keyframes will be exhibited in Scotland following a UK debut in Durham at the 2013 Lumiere Festival.
It has been seen by thousands of people across the world from Singapore to Jerusalem, France, Spain and the Netherlands.
The exhibition, which is free to view, is being funded by Edinburgh city council and EventScotland with the support of Marketing Edinburgh and Essential Edinburgh.
