Cardinal George Pell has arrived at an Australian court, amid a large media scrum, to face charges of sexual assault.

The Vatican treasurer, 76, is accused of historical assaults involving "multiple complainants", Victorian police said last month.
He has said he will strenuously defend himself against the allegations.
Cardinal Pell made no comment as he entered Melbourne Magistrates' Court flanked by police officers.
Dozens of local and international media representatives have gathered outside the court, along with security guards and other onlookers.
The filing hearing, which is expected to be brief, will take place in a courtroom that can accommodate about 50 people, local media said.
Last month, Cardinal Pell said he was "looking forward" to his day in court.
Cardinal Pell had to slowly wade through a legion of camera crews and reporters to reach the entrance of the court.
He has vowed to vigorously defend himself against the allegations, and here he was at the start of what could be lengthy legal proceedings.
Rarely has an Australian court been besieged by such a large media contingent, with their satellite trucks and coverage taking the story all over the world.
Pedestrians were forced off the pavement on to the road outside, while one passing motorist paused briefly to shout abuse at reporters.
Supporters of Australia's most prominent Catholic figure had also gathered, queuing patiently to witness the hearing.
A middle-aged woman told me she was here with friends to "support George" as other curious onlookers captured the scene on their smartphones.
Cardinal Pell arrived in his home country earlier this month, after being granted a leave of absence from the Vatican to fight the charges.
Victoria Police said they had made the decision to charge the cleric after receiving advice from prosecutors earlier this year.
"Cardinal Pell is facing multiple charges and there are multiple complainants," Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said last month.
Last month, Cardinal Pell told reporters: "I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me."
He said in a press briefing at the Holy See that he had been the subject of a "relentless character assassination".
As Vatican treasurer, Cardinal Pell is considered to be the third-ranking official in the Catholic Church.
