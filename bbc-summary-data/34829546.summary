Paris attacks: British public must 'show resolve'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The British public must show "resolve" and "carry on with our lives" in the wake of the terror attacks on Paris, Prime Minister David Cameron says.

It comes as extra funding has been released for the UK's security services to help combat Islamic State terrorism.
Mr Cameron, who is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, told BBC News he was hopeful of an agreement with Russia over the future of Syria.
It comes as the French prime minister said the attacks were planned in Syria.
Manuel Valls said the authorities believed new terror attacks were being planned in France and other European countries.
A total of 129 people, including one Briton, were killed in Friday's attacks on bars and restaurants, a concert hall and the Stade de France. So-called Islamic State (IS or ISIL) claimed it was behind the killings.
A minute silence for the victims will be held in the UK at 11:00 GMT, to coincide with a Europe-wide silence at midday French time.

Who were the victims?
Briton Nick Alexander from Essex has been confirmed dead and Home Secretary Theresa May said other Britons had been injured.
Mr Cameron said people should be "vigilant" against those who want to "change our way of life and destroy our way of life".
"Remember that our freedom depends on showing resolve and carrying on with our way of life, which is exactly what we ought to do," he added on Radio 4's Today programme.
Mr Cameron is meeting Mr Putin in their first face-to-face talks for a year, at the G20 summit in Turkey.
He said dealing with Russia over the future of Syria was "difficult" and that there had been some "profound disagreements", but added that Mr Putin recognised the threat IS posed to his country.
Civil war erupted in Syria four years ago, and now President Bashar al-Assad's government, IS, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all hold territory. Millions have been displaced and more than 250,000 people killed as a result of the fighting.
The new funding measures will allow MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to recruit an extra 1,900 officers, and a doubling in funding for aviation security is also expected to be agreed this week.
The funding for the 15% increase in staffing for the three intelligence agencies was revealed ahead of the publication of the government's Strategic Defence and Security Review, which is expected next week.
BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said this was an increase on the number previously briefed to the media by the Treasury.
The intelligence agencies already have about 12,700 staff.
The extra funding for aviation security is expected to be used to pay for more experts to assess airport safety in countries with large numbers of British visitors, among other measures. The UK currently spends about Â£9m a year on this issue.
Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism laws, told BBC News Islamic State could be "exterminated" if there was international will.
"The Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon has been absolutely right in recent weeks in calling for parliamentarians to support more vigorous bombing of ISIL," he said.
"We must destroy them otherwise this will go on for a generation.
"If people start what is in effect a war then they must reap the consequences for people around them I'm afraid. This is not a group one can talk to or negotiate with."
Meanwhile, officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command unit are interviewing people returning to the UK from France who may have information about the Paris attacks.
The Met is also appealing for any potential witnesses to contact its anti-terrorist hotline, on 0800 789 321.
Mr Alexander, 36, from Colchester, died in the attack at the Bataclan concert hall, where he had been selling merchandise.
His family described him as "generous, funny and fiercely loyal".
Friends also paid tribute to him on social media. Joe Trohman, lead guitarist of the rock band Fall Out Boy, described him as a "great guy".
Tributes: Nick Alexander 'clever and charming'
More than 80 people died at that concert hall, one of a number of locations targeted by attackers.
The US band Eagles of Death Metal were playing a gig when militants burst into the venue and opened fire, but the band themselves survived unscathed.
Other bands, including U2, Motorhead and Foo Fighters, have cancelled gigs in Paris.
