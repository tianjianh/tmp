[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 6-1 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller scored four times in Dover's 6-1 win over struggling Braintree at the Crabble Athletic Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Matthews stunned the home crowd early on from long range, but Aswad Thomas replied quickly for Dover.
The irrepressible Miller then went out on his own at the top of the scoring charts, notching a quick-fire hat-trick. The second was a real highlight as he wormed his way inside from the corner flag before beating Joe Taylor.
Jack Parkinson made it five before half-time from close range. The break helped Braintree steady matters, and Dover's rampant form subsided.
But Miller grabbed his 14th of the season from a free-kick to cap his perfect day.
