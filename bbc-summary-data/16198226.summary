Tonga profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
State radio and TV tend to be pro-government, while private broadcasters offer little independent local coverage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Privately-owned newspapers carry opposition views, but journalists can face harassment and threats of criminal charges. A Department of Information oversees all media reporting, US-based Freedom House notes.
More than 40,000 Tongans were online by 2014 (InternetLiveStats.com). There are no curbs on internet access.
