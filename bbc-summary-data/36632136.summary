Euro 2016: Hotel concern for Wales' quarter final match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fans hoping to watch Wales in the Euro 2016 quarter finals have been warned accommodation in the host city Lille is "scarce" and "expensive".

Hotels are already busy because the game is being held on Friday, 1 July - the day the centenary of the Battle of the Somme is commemorated in the area.
The Football Supporters' Federation Cymru (FSF) said some hotels were charging up to Â£325 (400 euros) a room.
One tour company is using hotels in Belgium to put up Welsh fans.
Wonky Sheep Events, which has arranged trips for all Wales matches, said: "Lille has been challenging to organise not only due to the short notice of the match but because of the commemorations too.
"We've had to look over the border to Belgium and even then it's been tricky.
"Our base in Bruges is only an hour from Lille but we have to use a number of hotels and once we sell out our fourth coach we may not be able to add any more."
The Battle of the Somme, fought in northern France, was one of the bloodiest of World War One.
Paul Corkery, of FSF, said the commemoration in the French city meant accommodation in Lille was scarce or expensive.
But he added: "At this stage, getting this far, we have not thought about it to be honest.
"Most people have gone home because of work. I think you are going to get a lot of day trippers."
Wales will either face Belgium or Hungary  - who play on Sunday - in Lille on 1 July.
It comes after Wales beat Northern Ireland in Paris' Parc des Princes in the first round of the knockout stage on Saturday.
The FSF said several fans who were in the French capital for the team's victory fell prey to pick-pockets on Saturday.
One man had about Â£500 in cash and his match ticket taken.
Mr Corkery said people would need to speak to the British Embassy if they had lost their passport or to French Police if they had anything stolen and wanted to claim on insurance.
