The 19-year-old, who made 19 appearances for the Scottish Premiership side last season, has agreed a two-year deal at the Amex.
Centre-back Hall, who is a Northern Ireland Under-19 international, will initially join Albion's under-21 squad.
"Ben is an excellent young prospect," Seagulls boss Chris Hughton told the club website.
"His challenge is not only to progress but to be ready to make that step up into the first-team squad."
Motherwell say Hall, who joined Well from Dungannon Swifts in 2013, was offered several new contracts to stay at Fir Park.
"We have been in discussions with Ben for the best part of five months," manager Mark McGhee told his club website.
"However, we have always been conscious that this may happen and, as such, have been working on a replacement, which we hope to announce soon."
