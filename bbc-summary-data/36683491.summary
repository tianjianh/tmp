The men, aged 23, 24, 46 and 50, were held on Thursday at addresses in Glasgow, Renfrewshire and Edinburgh.
They were arrested for alleged assaults and disorder and are expected to appear from custody at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
This brings the total number of arrests following the match to 38. Hibs won the game 3-2.
Immediately after the final whistle, thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch to celebrate their team's first Scottish Cup win since 1902.
Some Rangers players were allegedly assaulted and clashes broke out after some Rangers fans entered the pitch.
Det Supt Kenny Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: "This investigation is extensive and involves a significant number of people.
"My officers remain committed to identifying and arresting those involved in the violence and disorder that occurred on 21 May.
"As our investigation progresses, there will be further arrests and continued police action to track down those responsible."
The detective added: "I would ask if anyone has any information or knowledge about people involved or for anyone with information, including footage or images, to contact us."
