US world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr has begun a three-month jail term for domestic violence.

The fighter was sentenced last December after pleading guilty to attacking his ex-girlfriend, Josie Harris.
The judge delayed his jail time to allow him to fight Miguel Cotto on 5 May. He won the fight, for which he reportedly received $32m.
Rapper 50 Cent was at the Las Vegas courtroom with Mayweather, and said the boxer would be "all right".
At the time of sentencing, the judge had told the court she was particularly concerned that Mayweather had attacked and threatened Ms Harris while two of their children were present.
The assault took place in 2010.
Mayweather has been involved in a string of criminal cases for violence since 2002.
He is widely regarded as one of the world's best boxers, and has won all 43 of his professional fights.
