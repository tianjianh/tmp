Newport Gwent Dragons and Wales forward Andrew Coombs said he was "devastated" to be told he needs a seventh knee operation.

The 31-year-old lock or back-rower has not played since April 2015, when he was injured against Cardiff Blues.
He said on social media a "gruelling" 13 months involving six operations has led to another.
"It's hard to take that I require the first op all over again #7 #devastated," Coombs wrote on Twitter.
