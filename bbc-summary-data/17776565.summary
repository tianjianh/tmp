TV is the medium of choice, with commercial stations Pro TV and Antena 1 being the leading outlets. TVR is the public broadcaster.
There is a competitive pay TV sector, via cable and satellite. Romania is yet to complete the switch to digital terrestrial TV (DTT).
There are more than 100 private radios. Public Radio Romania operates national, regional and local stations.
US-based Freedom House says the private media sector is dominated by influential businessmen who have their own political agendas.
Around 11 million Romanians were online by July 2014 (InternetLiveStats.com). Many users access the web via mobile phones. The most popular social network is Facebook.
