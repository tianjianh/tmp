National League side Sutton are looking to reach the FA Cup fourth round for the third time in their history.
They last achieved that feat in 1988-89 when they famously beat Coventry City, then in the top flight, 2-1 in the third round.
Dons boss Neal Ardley will assess a couple of unnamed players who are nursing injuries ahead of the game.
League One side Wimbledon have never reached the fourth round in their 15-year history, having lost to Liverpool in their sole previous appearance at this stage in 2014-15.
AFC Wimbledon boss Neal Ardley told BBC London:
"We showed immense character in both previous rounds, to come back from 2-0 down at Bury and 3-0 down at Curzon Ashton.
"It is a great tie and it brings romance. The relationship has been strong between the clubs and I have nothing but respect for the job Paul Doswell has done at Sutton.
"The pitch is a challenge I want to see my boys face. Their home form is exceptional compared to their away form so it shows Sutton do play it well.
"We desperately want to do well in the FA Cup."
