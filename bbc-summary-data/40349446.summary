Having entered the third day with a first-innings deficit of 414, the visitors lost both openers inside the first two overs at Trent Bridge.
Luke Fletcher (3-16) then took three wickets in the space of nine balls, before James Pattinson and Jake Ball combined to skittle the Foxes for 134.
Samit Patel's 247 on days one and two had set the platform for Notts' win.
The 32-year-old Leicester-born all-rounder struck 29 fours and two sixes as he compiled his second successive double century - with his personal tally only 21 runs short of the combined 268 Leicestershire managed across their two innings.
Australian Clint McKay was the only batsman to offer any kind of resistance on the final day, as he was left stranded on 41 not out with Ben Raine not fit to bat.
There was some concern around Nottinghamshire's England seamer Stuart Broad, who left the field after bowling only one over.
Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"You have purple patches but the really impressive thing about Samit Patel is his desire to go big and make a real difference, both in one-day and four-day cricket. In this game he wanted to bat right the way through and make sure we got a significant score.
"Leicestershire have been unfortunate because we've had very strong bowling attacks both times we've played them and the lads have bowled really well. Jimmy Pattinson leads the attack and there's a total commitment to the game. It's lovely to see an international bowler do that at first class level.
"Stuart Broad had a bit of pain in his heel. He's had it for a while. If the situation had been different he could have pushed on through. But there was no need to, so he came off. We'll monitor it and look after him."
Leicestershire captain Mark Cosgrove told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It obviously wasn't our best game all around but there are some positives to take. Dieter Klein bowled fantastically to take a six-for and the guys bowled really well to keep them to three and a half an over on day one when we were a man down as Ben Raine was injured.
"The Notts bowlers are international class. If you only put three or four balls an over in the right areas it doesn't do as much as when you put five or six there. They did that and built up pressure, which we didn't do when we bowled."
"We're not playing fantastic cricket at the moment, so we can't just brush this under the carpet. We have to look into each other's games and see where we can improve and we need to do it quickly."
