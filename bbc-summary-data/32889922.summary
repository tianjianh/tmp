Norfolk County Council needs to save further £169m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jobs and services could be cut as Norfolk County Council grapples to save a further £169m over the next three years.

The authority is looking at ways to make the savings as it faces cuts to its government grant.
It aims to cut costs through efficiency savings, technology and better value for money in commissioning services.
Labour council leader George Nobbs said the authority had a "mountain to climb" over its £1.4bn annual budget.
Since 2010 the number of people directly employed by the council has shrunk from 7,940 to 4,800.
About half the reduction in  staff numbers came from workers being transferred to other organisations such as NorseCare - which runs care homes.
Since 2011-12, the council has seen cuts to its grant of £124m, but further central government grant reductions are expected.
Plans to meet the latest savings go before the council's policy and resources committee on 1 June.
The proposals for "Re-imagining Norfolk" are set out in a report from the council's managing director, Dr Wendy Thomson. She said fundamental change was needed in local government, following the outcome of the election and continuation of the government's austerity policy.
Mr Nobbs said: "We are being open and frank from the start of this process about the mountain we have to climb. Despite unprecedented efficiencies, we still find ourselves having to take out more from the council.
"We need to use every penny of... [our savings] to get the best possible results we can for the people of Norfolk. "
The report said it set out a vision of creating a Norfolk public service by "forging alliances" with other organisations to free up capacity across the county.
It said the council needed to focus on four priorities - excellence in education, real jobs, good infrastructure and supporting vulnerable people.
The council is run by an alliance of Labour, Lib Dems and UKIP supported by the Greens.
