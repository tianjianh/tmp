The original Severn Bridge is to be reduced to single lanes for seven months while its cables are inspected for corrosion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lane one westbound will be shut between 07:00 GMT on Monday, 14 March and 17:00 BST on Friday, 2 September.
Lane one eastbound will be closed from 09:30 GMT from Monday, 16 May until 09:30 BST on Monday 17 October.
The inspections will be carried out by Highways England to ensure the bridge's continuing safety.
Chris Pope, Project Manager for Highways England, said: "During the period of lane closures, vehicles over 2.9 metres wide will be prohibited from using the M48 Severn Bridge, and the bridge will also be closed totally over four weekends to enable the lifting of an inspection gantry to a high level on the suspension cable."
The first full closure is planned for the weekend of 16-17 April and diversion routes across the M4 Second Severn Crossing will be in place.
