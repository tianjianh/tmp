Rowland, 24, graduated from the Renault academy and his development role will involve significant simulator time as well as track opportunities.
The Sheffield-born driver will also contest the Formula 2 Championship, having recently signed for Dams.
"I would love to be in F1 next year, that has to be the target," he said.
"I will work as hard as I can to achieve that.
"I am really pleased with today's announcement, and it is another step in the right direction, but you have got to carry on the momentum."
Rowland completed his first full season of GP2, recently rebranded the Formula 2 championship, last year and led after five rounds before finishing ninth.
Lewis Hamilton and Jolyon Palmer, both of whom won Formula One's feeder series, are Great Britain's only representatives on the current F1 grid.
"I understand that if I don't win the F2 championship than I probably won't get a chance in F1. But in my head it is quite clear," added Rowland.
"I want to go out and win and dominate the series."
