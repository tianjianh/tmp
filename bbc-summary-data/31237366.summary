Jenner himself wasn't hurt, but seven others were taken to hospital.
A woman in her seventies was pronounced dead at the scene on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.
An LA police spokesman said there was no indication that Jenner, the stepfather of Kim Kardashian, was being chased by nearby paparazzi.
Jenner's publicist, Alan Nierob, said the 65-year-old wasn't hurt.
Sergeant Philip Brooks, from the Los Angeles County sheriff department, said Bruce Jenner's Cadillac Escalade went into the back of a Lexus sedan, which had just struck the back of a Toyota Prius.
The Lexus then veered into oncoming traffic in another lane and collided with a black Hummer.
Police said Jenner cooperated with investigators at the scene and passed a sobriety test.
He also offered a blood sample.
Jenner won a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics but is more widely known to many for his appearance on reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
