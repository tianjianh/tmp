However, the 62-year-old will continue to help with the youth development programme at the Racecourse Ground.
"I've loved every minute of my time at Wrexham," said Jones, who went on to win two European Cups with Liverpool in 1977 and 1978.
"It's time to let others come to the fore and carry on the proud traditions of the club. "
Llandudno-native Jones joined Wrexham in 1970 as a teenager and made his senior debut two years later in a Welsh Cup tie against Chester.
His talent was spotted by Liverpool and the defender joined the Merseyside giants for Â£110,000 in July 1975.
Jones made his Wales debut the same year - against Austria at the Racecourse - and would go on to win 72 caps for his country.
He would play for Wrexham in two further spells, as well as Chelsea and Huddersfield Town.
During his playing career Jones won the old First Division, two European Cups, a Uefa Cup and Super Cup, the Second Division championship and the Welsh Cup.
Jones finished his playing career as player-coach at Wrexham under former manager Brian Flynn, hanging up his boots in 1992 at the age of 37 but continuing to coach at the Welsh side.
He required a heart operation in 2002, when he was 47, but made a full recovery.
"The club continues to be a massive part of my life and whilst I am retiring from a full-time position, I will still be part of the future of the club and especially helping the younger generations make the transition to professional football like I did with Wrexham," Jones added.
"I'm looking forward to the season ahead and hopefully we will be right up there."
Joey Jones won the European Cup with Liverpool in 1977 and 1978.
