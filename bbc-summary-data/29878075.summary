Aaron Hughes is a major fitness doubt for Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Romania on 14 November because of an ankle injury.

The centre-back, 34, picked up the injury in Brighton's 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday.
Fears of a broken ankle have been allayed but Brighton manager Sami Hyypia believes the defender could be ruled out for a number of weeks.
"If it's ligament damage we are talking about weeks," Hyypia told the Argus.
"There is nothing on the bone, so that's a good thing.
"If the bone was broken or something happened to the bone it would be a long process.

"Now we are waiting for the swelling to go down. Then we will be able to assess it a little bit better."
Hughes has been ever-present in his country's best ever start to a major qualifying campaign - playing 90 minutes in successive wins over Hungary, the Faroe Islands and Greece.
The former Northern Ireland captain is currently on 93 caps, on track to become his country's first ever outfield centurion.
