Ryder Cup 2016: Bubba Watson named as fifth United States vice-captain

United States skipper Davis Love says Bubba Watson will add "a lot of fun" and "great heart" after naming the two-time Masters winner as a vice-captain for this weekend's Ryder Cup.

Watson lost out to Ryan Moore for the final wildcard spot but will still play a key role for the US in Hazeltine.
"We're thrilled to have him," said Love, who is trying to stop Europe from claiming a fourth consecutive win.
Tiger Woods, Jim Furyk, Tom Lehman and Steve Stricker are also assistants.
Love, who was also captain in 2012 when Europe won after a record comeback, said Watson, 37, completed an "interesting group" of vice-captains.
"We have a mix of guys who think differently," he said. "You couldn't put five guys together of differing personalities who get along so well."
Watson, who has played in the past three Ryder Cups, reiterated to Love he wanted to be part of his backroom team, despite losing out to Moore.
"When I told the team members and assistant captains, we were in disbelief," said Love. "What Bubba did really shows how together the US team really is."
BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter:
"One of the key elements as far as Davis Love was concerned in terms of selecting his wildcards was team chemistry.
"Bubba Watson is ranked seventh in the world, so if you were going to pick him because he is a top-10 player in the world, it makes total sense.
"If you're going to drop someone who is a top-10 player, then it is clearly down to a lack of chemistry. But here he is in the backroom staff. It's fascinating."
Players, officials and fans will pay their respects to golfing great Arnold Palmer, who died on Sunday aged 87, when the 41st Ryder Cup starts on Friday.
Flags at Hazeltine were lowered to half-mast on Monday in tribute to the seven-time major winner, who was nicknamed 'The King'.
Players from both teams will wear pins bearing a special logo, while tournament officials are finalising details of a video tribute and minute's silence to be held during the opening ceremony.
Love said he had spoken to Europe captain Darren Clarke about honouring American legend Palmer.
"Whatever we do, we are going to do together," said Love. "He was my inspiration as a golfer, a role model as how to act as a professional."
Clarke added: "Our sport wouldn't be where it is without Mr Palmer. He was a global superstar and inspired people all over the world to take up our sport."

Europe are aiming to continue their recent dominance of the biennial event by winning a fourth consecutive Ryder Cup for the first time.
But Northern Irishman Clarke, who arrived in Minnesota with his team on Monday, said past glories count for nothing against a US side that Love claims is the "best ever assembled".
Europe have won 10 and drawn one of the past 15 events.
"I think it's irrelevant going into this week," said Northern Irishman Clarke. "Each Ryder Cup is individual in its own right."
