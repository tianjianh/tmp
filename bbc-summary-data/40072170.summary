Tony Walsh's poem became a symbol of defiance when he read it before a crowd of thousands at a vigil for the Manchester attack victims on Tuesday.
Endorsed by the poet, 61 people will take a line of the poem and respond to it as they like.
Organiser James Torry said: "We want this book to mark a moment, but to look ahead with real hope for the city."
In a Twitter video, he said he felt the poem "gave language to a city that was struggling to articulate how it was feeling".
"I just felt there was a response that could be made from us," he added.
Contributors already confirmed include Peter Saville, who designed Factory Records' graphics, and Malcolm Garrett who designed for Buzzcocks, Duran Duran and Simple Minds.
Proceeds will go to help those affected by the Manchester Arena attack and the mayor's fund for the city's homeless.
