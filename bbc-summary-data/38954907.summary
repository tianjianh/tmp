Services from Douglas to the UK were disrupted after the Ben-my-Chree, which sailed from Heysham, Lancashire, struck the pier on Sunday.
The Isle of Man Steam-Packet Company confirmed no passengers or crew were injured.
Four crossings between Douglas and Heysham were been cancelled following the the collision.
Chief executive Mark Woodward apologised to passengers and said it was an "unfortunate incident", adding the company would "do all we can to minimise the disruption".
A company spokesman said that on arrival in Douglas Harbour, the Ben-my-Chree "encountered significantly stronger than forecast easterly winds" and the vessel made contact with the King Edward Pier.
He said engineers worked through the night to assess any damage and a diving inspection had been carried out.
He added the Ben-my-Chree would return to service later, though its sailing at 19:45 GMT would be subject to "prevailing weather conditions".
