Centurions coach Jukes said Goodwin's versatility was part of the reason for snapping him up.
"I have followed Bryson's career over past years and he has been one of the most consistent performers for his team. He can play full-back, centre or wing," he said.
"Those are areas where we need to add quality and when I spoke to Bryson over the phone I could immediately tell that he has the appetite to achieve things over here and he is a good fit for us, just as we are for him."
Leigh chairman Derek Beaumont decided to announce their new signing for the next campaign early because news of their deal broke out in Australia.
"We intended keeping next year's signings under wraps until the end of season out of respect to the clubs they currently represent," Beaumont explained.
"Unfortunately this one broke over there and has led to us confirming it early. I look forward to seeing Bryson in a Leigh shirt next year."
