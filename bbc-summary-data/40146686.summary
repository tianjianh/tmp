Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson says he is likely to miss the US Open later this month to attend daughter Amanda's high school graduation.

The tournament is the only major the 46-year-old has not won.
The US Open first round at Erin Hills in Wisconsin is on the same day, 15 June, as the ceremony in California.
"As I look back on life, this is a moment I'll always cherish and be glad I was present," Mickelson told the New York Times.
"There's no greater joy as a parent."
Amanda was born a day after the US Open at Pinehurst in 1999, when Mickelson finished second to Payne Stewart.
However, the American said he would have left wherever he was on the scoreboard had his wife Amy gone into labour.
Mickelson, who needs to win the US Open to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam, has notified tournament officials of his intention but has yet to withdraw formally.
Tournament rules dictate he has until just before the commencement of his opening round to pull out.
"My daughter is graduating, she is the school president, she'll be giving the commencement speech for the school and I am going to be there," he added.
"I didn't want the USGA (US Golf Association) to be caught off guard and I wanted the alternate to know he will most likely be in.
"There is no sense in doing it (withdrawing formally) now. Something might come up with the commencement, the weather, something unforeseen, but it doesn't look very good.
"It doesn't look good for me playing but I am really excited about this moment in our family's life."
