A major public consultation has been launched to canvass views on how Edinburgh's world heritage site should be protected.

The city's old and new towns have held Unesco status since 1995 and are among six world heritage sites in Scotland.
The aim is to gather feedback for the City of Edinburgh Council, Edinburgh World Heritage, and Historic Environment Scotland.
The consultation will close at the end of July.
Ian Perry, convener of the City of Edinburgh Council's planning committee, said: "Our World Heritage Site is of crucial importance to the future vision and development of the city.
"This consultation process is an opportunity for everyone to have their say on how the site is being run.
"We would like as many people as possible to let us know what they think is working well, and where we can make improvements.'
Adam Wilkinson, director of Edinburgh World Heritage, said: "The management plan consultation may sound like a theoretical exercise, but the plan is a living document that provides the base from which the partners in the management of the World Heritage Site guide change.
"Its review is an important opportunity for the communities of the World Heritage Site and the city in general to ensure their voice is heard.
"We would urge everyone to get involved and take part in this consultation process."
Barbara Cummins, of Historic Environment Scotland, said: "As partners in the Management Plan, we welcome the launch of the consultation - this provides an opportunity to gather suggestions and ideas from those who live, work and visit Edinburgh on how we manage and celebrate the Old and New Towns World Heritage Site."
