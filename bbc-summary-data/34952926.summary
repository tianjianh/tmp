Britain's Giles Scott claimed his third world title courtesy of a dominant victory in the Finn Gold Cup in Takapuna, New Zealand.

The 28-year-old, who is undefeated since April 2013, won with a day and two races to spare.
Scott is now one of six sailors to win three Finn world titles, along with fellow Briton Sir Ben Ainslie.
"I have been really pleased with my year and the way I've been sailing," said Scott, who also won in 2014.
"The last couple of months have been tricky to manage because we've been testing these new boats that have just come out, so to be able to come here and show good form and win with a couple of races to go is great.
"I've sailed a good, consistent week and it's come good early, which is great."
Weymouth-based Scott came into the penultimate day of racing on the Hauraki Gulf with an imposing 52-point lead, and claimed the top-18 finish he needed to secure overall victory by coming second in the first of the day's two races.
He was also runner-up in the day's second race, giving him an overwhelming 54-point lead over France's Olympic bronze medallist Jonathan Lobert going into the final day of competition.
"I was trying to stay risk-free where possible and fortunately the racing panned out in a manner that rewarded that," added Scott, who has already secured his place on Team GB for next year's Rio Olympics.
Scott narrowly missed out on a place at London 2012 to Ainslie, who went on to take his fourth Olympic gold.
