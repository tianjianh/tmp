Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil should join Paris St-Germain, according to Germany team-mate Julian Draxler.

Ozil has just over a year left on his Arsenal contract, with manager Arsene Wenger saying talks with the 28-year-old were on hold until the summer.
Draxler, who said he turned down a move to the Premier League in favour of PSG in January, says Ozil would "enjoy life" in the French capital.
"I would love to play with him every day," Draxler told BBC World Service.
"For me, he's a great player. I enjoy to play with him for every training, every match with the German national team."
Asked if he thought Ozil would come to Paris, Draxler added: "Yes, I think he's a great player. He would help every team in the world and I think he would enjoy the life here and even to play for PSG."
Draxler, 23, said his decision to sign for PSG rather than join a Premier League club in January was not motivated by money.
"You know we have been in talks with some clubs in England as well, but this time I decided to make the decision as to what I feel and what I prefer for myself," he said.
"There were some teams that wanted me from the Premier League but it was not like it was very, very close.
"Football is about making decisions and that's what I did. I decided that PSG is the best club for me at the moment."
Asked whether Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp had declared an interest, the winger added: "It's not about Jurgen Klopp, about Liverpool or about different clubs from England.
"It was just my opinion that I am the best player for PSG at the moment - so that's what I decided.
"I chose a great new step in my career because PSG is a really, really great club . They have big goals, they want to reach big things and that's why I want to be part of it.
"I did not - and will not - decide my club just for the money."
PSG looked to be cruising into the Champions League quarter-finals in March when they led Barcelona 4-0 after the first leg and then 5-3 on aggregate at the Nou Camp with two minutes of normal time remaining.
Cue three goals in seven minutes - Sergi Roberto's winner coming in the 95th - as PSG lost 6-1 on the night to surrender the tie in dramatic fashion.
"We played a wonderful first leg and then we went to the Nou Camp and everything went wrong that was possible to be wrong," said Draxler.
"You know it hurts. It would be a lie if I said it doesn't. Maybe this game [was the worst moment of my career], because it was a great opportunity.
"We were really comfortable after the first leg and you know besides my big injuries it was maybe my worst day."
