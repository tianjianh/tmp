Cornwall Council 'going soft' on school absence fines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council which has fined parents 16 times for taking children out of school without permission has been accused of "going soft" as unauthorised absences increased by 20% in one year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cornwall Council issued the fines since the absence policy changed in 2013.
Elsewhere, Devon County Council fined parents 1,600 times in the same period.
Cornwall Council said it was "not letting anyone get away with it", but there were "better ways" of making children go to school.
Cornwall Council said 50,471 days were lost to unauthorised absence in 2012/2013 compared to 59,858 in 2013/2014.
Unauthorised absence figures for Devon County Council were not obtained.

Chris McGovern, chair of Campaign For Real Education, said it appeared Cornwall Council was "going soft".
However, he said, it was better to persuade parents to not go on holiday during term times rather than fining them which caused "antagonism".
"The passport to the future is more important than a passport to Mallorca," he added.
Jason Short, from Plymouth, who was fined for taking his daughter out of school for a holiday, said: "The time we spend together is precious, so as a seven-year-old I want her to experience things with her family which we can't normally do.
"Education does come first, but will two weeks affect her?"
Andrew Wallis, portfolio holder for children and young people for Cornwall Council, said: "There are better ways of making children go to school, rather than using the sledge-hammer approach.
"If there's long term non-attendance we will take it through the court, we're certainly not letting anyone get away with it."
Guidelines brought in by the Department for Education (DfE) in September 2013 require head teachers to take a harder line on requests for absence.
If an absence is not authorised, parents who take their children out of school during term time are reported to their local authorities who are obliged by government to fine a parent Â£60 per child - this rises to Â£120 if it is not paid within 21 days.
