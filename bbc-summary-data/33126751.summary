The last flying Vulcan bomber has made its final appearance at an annual airshow in Shropshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The display involving the Vulcan XH558 bomber at RAF Cosford was dedicated to former Wolverhampton Wanderers president, Sir Jack Hayward.
Sir Jack donated Â£500,000 to help get the plane back in the sky after being contacted by the Vulcan to the Sky Trust in 2006.
The plane's permit to fly cannot be renewed, partly due to its age.
By coincidence, the show took place on what would have been Sir Jack's 92nd birthday.
A spokesman for the Vulcan to the Sky Trust said: "XH558's appearance today at RAF Cosford is dedicated to his remarkable generosity in saving the project.
"The date is a huge, unplanned coincidence as Sir Jack was born in Wolverhampton, just eight miles from RAF Cosford, on June 14, 1923."
Sir Jack's son Jonathan, Wolves vice-president Baroness Heyhoe Flint and Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey were also due to attend.
RAF Cosford was originally established before World War Two to store aircraft but later became a training base.
