[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senegal international defender Lamine Sane has been suspended indefinitely by his club Bordeaux, along with goalkeeper Jerome Prior.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bordeaux said there had been a "serious incident in the dressing room" after the club's 4-3 extra-time loss to Nantes in the French Cup on Wednesday.
The French club added they "would make no further comment on the matter".
Sane joined Bordeaux in 2009 but sought a transfer in January and the ban could now end his career with the club.
