[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shoe store chain with eight shops in Wales has called in administrators.

The retailer Brantano has 200 outlets across Britain, employing about 2,000 people.
It has shops at Aberystwyth, Broughton in Flintshire, Cardiff, Carmarthen, Holyhead on Anglesey, Pembroke Dock and Rhyl in Denbighshire.
Administrators said the shops would continue to trade while a decision was taken over the future of the business.
"Like many others, Brantano has been hit hard by the change in consumers' shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment," said Tony Barrell, lead administrator for PwC.
"The administrators are continuing to trade the businesses as normal whilst we assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks.
"Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work during the administration."
