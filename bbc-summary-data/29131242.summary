Borek Dockal had given the hosts the lead in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague before Stefan de Vrij equalised.
But Daryl Janmaat's mistake allowed Pilar to seal the points as Hiddink, 67, became the first Dutch national manager to lose his first two games since his previous reign in 1995.
Italy, Iceland and Cyprus also won.
Goals by Simone Zaza and Leonardo Bonucci earned the Azzurri a 2-0 win away to Norway to extend Antonio Conte's winning start since taking over following Cesare Prandelli's resignation.
Also in Group H, Real Madrid's former Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric and Andrej Kramaric scored as Croatia overcame 10-man Malta 2-0, while Bulgaria won 2-1 away to Azerbaijan.
One of the biggest surprises of the night saw Wales' Group B rivals Cyprus come from behind to win 2-1 away to Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Vedad Ibisevic put Bosnia ahead, but Demetris Christofi equalised and then scored again in the 73rd minute.
Bosnia's misery was complete when Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic saw his penalty saved by Antonis Georgallides.
There was also a surprise in Group A where Iceland ran out 3-0 winners at home to 10-man Turkey.
Dadi Bodvarsson put them ahead before Turkey's Omer Toprak was sent off for two yellow cards.
Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson and Kolbeinn Sigthorsson scored two goals in one minute to round off the win.
In the same group, Kazakhstan drew 0-0 at home to Latvia.
