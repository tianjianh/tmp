At closing, the FTSE 100 index was up 147.52 points, or 2.47%, at 6,100.01, with similar gains being seen in other major European markets.
Rising prices of metals and oil helped to boost mining and energy shares.
Markets also took heart from a speech by Janet Yellen, in which she said US rates were still set to rise this year.
Analysts said her comments indicated that the US economy was still in good shape and could remove some uncertainty over the timing of a US rate rise.
Shares in Lloyds Banking Group rose were up 2.26% to 75.5p. The government announced it had sold another 1% tranche in the bank, reducing its holding to below 12%.
In the FTSE 250, shares in Synergy Health jumped 42% after a US court ruling raised hopes that its takeover by Steris would go ahead.
A federal court in Ohio denied a request by US competition authorities to block the takeover.
Shares in energy firm Drax rose 1.04% after it said it was pulling out of a Â£1bn project to introduce carbon capture technology to cut emissions.
Drax said it was halting further investment because of the government's decision to reduce subsidies for renewable energy.
On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.4% against the dollar to $1.5175, and also fell 0.15% against the euro to â‚¬1.3554.
