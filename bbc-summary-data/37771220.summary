The models include the Corolla and the Yaris subcompact models, most of them sold in Japan, China and Europe.
The cars affected were produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and between April 2006 and December 2014.
Global carmaker have for years been hampered by recalls of airbags made by Takata.
Toyota said it was calling back 1.47 million airbags in cars sold in Europe, 1.16 million in Japan, 820,000 in China, and 2.35 million in other regions excluding the US.
Toyota's recall on Wednesday brings its total of recalled Takata airbags to 23.1 million. So far, a total of 12 carmakers have had to recall vehicles because of faulty Takata airbags, with the total number of recalls expected to exceed 100 million cars.
Car parts maker Takata is already facing huge compensation costs over its airbags, which are used by many car manufacturers and have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide.
US regulators believe the volatile chemical used in the inflators, ammonium nitrate, can cause airbags to explode with excessive force.
Several automakers, including Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Ford have said they will stop using Takata airbags containing ammonium nitrate in future models.
Takata also produces seatbelts, child seats, and other safety-related car parts.
