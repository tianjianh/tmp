A "cavalier" lorry driver has been jailed for three and a half years for causing the death of a cyclist by careless driving.

Barry Meyer, 52, of Walthamstow, crushed Alan Neve with the lorry's front and back wheels, causing "almost instant death", the court heard.
Mr Neve, from Poplar, was hit during morning rush hour in High Holborn on 15 July 2013 and died at the scene.
Blackfriars Crown Court banned Meyer from driving for 10 years.
Meyer had previous convictions for drink driving and admitted causing the 54-year-old's death.
He was also guilty of driving without insurance and a licence.
CCTV footage of the crash showed Meyer also drove through a red light.
Sentencing Meyer, Judge Worlsey said the harm the lorry driver had caused was "devastating beyond all measure."
Mr Neve's widow Penelope was in court when her statement was read out.
It said: "I want to start by telling you that I loved Alan with all my heart and that he made me happier than anyone else in the world."
"There is not one area of my life that has not been affected," she added.
The court heard how when Mr Neve's rucksack was brought home from the scene, his wife took out the sandwich he had made for his lunch and froze it.  It is still in the freezer.
She also folded up the last bedding he used and stored them in a wardrobe.
"His pyjamas are still under his pillow. I smell them and imagine he is here," she said.
London Cycling Campaign welcomed the jail term and 10-year driving ban, but said: "We believe, however, that a lifetime driving ban is essential to keep such dangerous drivers off the road."
