Tipu Sultan, 32, was found at the back of the Herbs n Spice Kitchen in Lake Avenue, South Shields, on Tuesday.
Two men riding a large red high-powered motorbike were seen leaving the area immediately after the shooting.
Detectives said several areas had been searched along the route the bike is thought to have travelled, including Whitburn Golf Club.
Footage taken from a CCTV camera showed the bike heading along Lizard Lane towards the course at 21:55 BST on Tuesday.
Mr Sultan was shot at close range, in what police believe was a pre-planned killing.
Det Ch Insp John Bent of Northumbria Police, said the force had received a "very positive" response and several calls it was following up.
"We'd still appeal for anyone who thinks they may have information about the motorbike or the two men to come forward and speak to officers," he said.
