United States-based Cave revealed on her website she has not been picked for Glasgow 2014.
The 36-year-old has won world titles at triathlon and Ironman, and claimed a silver medal for Wales at the 2002 Games in Manchester.
"I will not be representing Wales... in Glasgow. It's disappointing on so many levels," she said.
Cave has concentrated on the longer-distance Ironman events in recent seasons, winning the world titles at Ironman and half-Ironman in 2012.
She was Olympic-distance world champion in 2002 and long distance (raced over double Olympic distance) in 2007.
Cave had been hoping to be one of three athletes Wales could send to Glasgow along with reigning world champion Non Stanford and twice-former world champion Helen Jenkins.
She says that "the very talented" Stanford and Jenkins had both been selected and that she was prepared to play a supporting role to them.
In preparation for the Games, Cave competed International Triathlon Union Continental Cup events over the Olympic distance in Mexico and Chile earlier in 2014, winning both.
The Welsh team for the Glasgow event has not been officially named, and Welsh Triathlon Cymru has declined to comment.
"I'm really disappointed, it was really my last opportunity [to represent Wales at a Commonwealth Games]," Cave told BBC Wales Sport.
"I take every opportunity I can get and I really did everything that was laid out for me under the selection criteria that was established at the end of last year.
"Unfortunately they decided to change the goal-posts in the selection criteria based on an ITU [International Triathlon Union] rule change, which really came late in the game.
"I'd already set myself up for making a position based on the previous selection criteria.
"I just feel very disappointed in the whole process, I feel a little disappointed that it was more about having a team in the relay than having an athlete in the individual event that they were really concerned about.
"I feel I have so much to offer: my experiences as an athlete, I'm a pretty well known name in the sport and I definitely feel I could have helped... play a role in the race to help Non and Helen.
"The role could change and be very flexible to how the race was going.
"I'm racing really well and I also feel like I have the ability actually perform really well. The worst part is now I'll never know."
