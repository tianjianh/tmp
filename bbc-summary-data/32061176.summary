[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative AM Antoinette Sandbach has been selected as the party's Westminster candidate in a safe seat in Cheshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was selected on Wednesday to fight Eddisbury, where the Tory majority was more than 13,000 in 2010.
If elected in May she would be the first AM to leave Cardiff Bay for a Parliamentary seat in England.
Departing MP Stephen O'Brien has a 13,255 majority.
Ms Sandbach, a north Wales regional AM since 2011, has said she intends to stand down from the assembly if elected.
She said she plans to donate her salary to charity during the campaign.
The constituency stretches from just outside Chester across to Winsford, before skirting around Crewe, Nantwich and Whitchurch.
Llandudno councillor Janet Haworth would take the north Wales regional seat in Cardiff Bay for the Conservatives without the need for a by-election.
Fellow Tory AMs Byron Davies and Mark Isherwood have already been selected as Westminster candidates to fight Gower and Delyn respectively.
