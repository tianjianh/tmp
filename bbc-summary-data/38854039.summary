[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The headquarters for a new tax-collecting body for Wales is to be set up in the south Wales valleys.

The Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA), with a total staff of around 40, will be based in Treforest, near Pontypridd, subject to a review after 18 months.
Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it was a "clear demonstration of our commitment to spread prosperity" into the valleys.
Plaid Cymru AM Llyr Gruffydd said north Wales had been "shamefully ignored".
Mr Drakeford said staff at Treforest would have "a high degree of expertise and specialist skills in tax compliance; digital services and data management".
He said Treforest was chosen after detailed analysis of six potential locations as it was felt that "to attract and retain these specialists it is important the WRA is located in the same area of Wales as other organisations carrying out similar functions".
The WRA will also have a presence in Aberystwyth and Llandudno, Mr Drakeford added.
The minister said it would ensure staff had direct contact with stakeholders, taxpayers and their agents in what is intended to be a paperless, "digital-first" organisation.
Mr Gruffydd condemned the location of the main office as being "just 10 miles north of the capital city" of Cardiff.
"This Labour government has, once again, ignored the north," he said.
"This is despite there being more than 400 tax workers based in Wrexham and Porthmadog who are ideally placed to work for a new revenue authority.
"They've got the skills and expertise and they've been shamefully ignored."
From April 2018, control of stamp duty and landfill tax will pass to the Welsh Government, which is replacing them with a land transaction tax and a landfill disposals tax.
The authority will manage and collect an estimated Â£1bn of taxes in its first three years.
The 2017 Wales Act also devolves some power to vary the rates of income tax at a date yet to be confirmed.
