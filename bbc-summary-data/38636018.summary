The Scottish SPCA has appealed for information after a cat was found dumped in a recycling bin in Stranraer.

A dog walker found the animal trapped inside the bin on Friday in an area known locally as The Approach.
The cat - which has been named Dusty - had been left with a puppy blanket but no food or water.
It is now being looked after at the charity's animal rescue and re-homing centre and being treated for eye and ear injuries.
Scottish SPCA Inspector Geraldine Lawrie said, "Dusty is a very friendly and affectionate wee man so he's obviously belonged to someone.
"He's lucky that he was found by the member of the public whose dog took an interest in the bin.
"Dusty was inside the bin with the lid closed."
She said that a vet who had seen the cat was confident it would recover from its injuries.
"We are appealing for anyone who has any information, or noticed any suspicious activity to get in touch with our animal helpline on 03000 999 999," she said.
The Scottish SPCA said that abandoning an animal was an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.
It said anyone found guilty of doing so could expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or for life.
