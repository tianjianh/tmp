The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's (BBMF) Lancaster, known as Thumper, based at RAF Coningsby, took to the skies for a test flight on Monday.
This was followed by a flypast over the newly created Bomber Command memorial spire in Lincoln.
Pilot Flt Lt Tim Dunlop said it was great to have her in the air again.
The BBMF said it would look to fly Thumper again before it is grounded over the winter.
The team will also feature in a BBC documentary on Sunday.
