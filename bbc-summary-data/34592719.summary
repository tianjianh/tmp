Charlton Athletic head coach Guy Luzon is not concerned about his future despite a run of eight games without a win in the Championship.

The Addicks dropped into the relegation zone following Tuesday's 3-0 defeat at home to Preston.
The 40-year-old has been in charge at The Valley since January.
"I need to worry only about the next game, how I pick the team and how I encourage the squad to bring the result on Saturday," he told BBC Radio London.
Charlton have only won two of their 12 league games this term and Luzon described the defeat by Preston as "a difficult night".
However the Israeli, who previously worked under Charlton owner Roland Duchatelet at Belgian side Standard Liege, says recent injury problems have hampered his team selections.
"We know that we have a crisis with the injuries in the last two months," Luzon said.
"This is the situation. This is our squad. Without a pure wide player in the eleven, it is difficult to create chances and get the result.
"I hope on Saturday some of them will come back and help us to choose a normal eleven with balance. Then we can play football."
