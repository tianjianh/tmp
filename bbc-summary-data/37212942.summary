Joleon Lescott: Aston Villa defender joins Greek side AEK Athens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Joleon Lescott has left Championship side Aston Villa to join AEK Athens on a two-year deal, the Greek club have announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old joined Villa from West Brom on a two-year deal last summer but leaves after just one season.
It has not been disclosed whether a fee is involved for Lescott, who has not featured for Villa in 2016-17.
Lescott was close to joining Scottish giants Rangers this month but failed to agree personal terms.
The former Manchester City player made 30 Premier League appearances last season, scoring one goal, as the club were relegated to the Championship.
He twice drew criticism from fans in the second half of 2015-16, first in February when tweeting a picture of an expensive car after Villa were thrashed by Liverpool, before in April describing relegation from the Premier League as "a weight off the shoulders".
