The 30-year-old signed a new three-year contract with Notts on Monday.
Gurney told BBC Radio Nottingham: "Notts are a very special club with a lot of history. In my five years here, my career has been on an upward trend.
"Despite the fact we've been relegated, I feel pretty optimistic about the future and quite excited to be getting stuck in under Peter Moores."
Gurney joined Notts from East Midlands rivals Leicestershire in 2011 and has since taken 306 wickets for the Trent Bridge club in all formats.
"I am really grateful to Mick (Newell) who originally signed me and I feel loyalty to him, as well as the club to be honest," continued Gurney.
"I think we can rebuild next season, tweak a few things and hopefully build a foundation which can propel us back into Division One."
