First Minister Carwyn Jones said it was a "huge step" ahead of Sunday's game in Cardiff against Israel where victory will ensure a trip to France.
Wales manager Chris Coleman has urged fans to get "carried away".
Supporter Abigail Davies from Swansea told BBC Radio Wales she had even bought a book to start learning French.
Another fan was caught on camera jumping for joy at the moment Gareth Bale scored while watching the game at a pub in Denbighshire, as the team took another step towards securing a place in the final stages of a major tournament for the first time since 1958.
Ex-Wales captain Kevin Ratcliffe said he believed the team had "surely" done enough to secure their place.
"I'm a bit envious of them. I'd love to be part of that. We have a world class squad."
