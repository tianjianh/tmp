People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said animal abusers were "a serious threat to the whole community".
The attack happened at Danesmoor Nursing Home in Haslingden, Lancashire, on Tuesday night.
The men were seen on CCTV throwing items at the animals and chasing them.
The alpacas - named Bill and Ben - are brothers and have lived at the home for five years.
Peta is offering a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of "the callous persons" who attacked the alpacas.
"It's imperative that any community faced with a sadistic and violent act such as this take measures to find the culprits and bring them to justice," said Peta UK spokesperson Elisa Allen.
"Animal abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on whoever is available to them, human or non-human, and must be caught before they act again."
Anyone with any information is asked to contact Lancashire Police.
