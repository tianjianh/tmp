Motorists are being warned to expect tailbacks as millions of Britons set out on bank holiday weekend trips.

The RAC motoring body says the busiest time is predicted to be between 11:00 and 16:00 BST, when up to 10 million vehicles are likely to be on the roads.
Warm weather, rail maintenance and a boom in "staycations" due to a fall in the value of sterling are contributing to a rise in traffic, it says.
The M20 in Kent is closed after a lorry hit a bridge, causing it to collapse.
One person was reported injured; a motorcyclist in his fifties with suspected broken ribs was taken to Tunbridge Wells Hospital by ambulance.
Sonny Gladdish, who was travelling several cars behind, said he saw a lorry carrying two diggers driving on the hard shoulder.
He described hearing a crash as the lorry collided with a pedestrian bridge between junctions three and four near Maidstone.
It collapsed across both carriageways of the motorway, partly crushing the rear of another lorry, he said.
The motorcyclist was travelling behind, and "threw himself off his bike" to avoid the collapsing bridge, he added.
The motorway is expected to be closed until tomorrow. Travel disruption is severe.
Meanwhile, travel organisation Abta estimates two million Britons will be flying abroad between Friday and Monday.
It says city breaks are a popular choice, and many families are travelling to Mediterranean beach resorts, with Spain the top destination. Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are among the leading long-haul destinations.
More than 440,000 people are expected to depart from Heathrow over the weekend; while 311,000 passengers are leaving from Gatwick; 150,000 from Stansted; more than 103,000 from Manchester; 55,000 from Bristol and 47,000 from East Midlands, Abta said.
Ports and the Channel Tunnel are expected to be busy, it adds.
Monday is a day off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but a working day in Scotland, which had its summer bank holiday at the beginning of the month.
According to a study of 1,579 motorists for the RAC by Ragdoll Research, more than 20 million vehicles could be using UK roads between Thursday and Monday, compared with 10 million in 2015.
The RAC says other busy times on the roads over the bank holiday weekend are expected to be between 11:00 and 16:00 on Sunday and 16:00 and 18:00 on Monday.
Transport information supplier Inrix predicted congestion hotspots would include:
National Express says it will be busiest weekend of the year for its services, with hundreds of thousands of passengers booked on coaches.
Music festivals this weekend include Reading and Leeds, Creamfields in Cheshire, and CarFest South in Hampshire.
Highways England said almost 98% of England's motorway and major A roads would be clear of roadworks over the weekend.
But Network Rail said its larger upgrades were carried out over bank holidays because there were fewer passengers travelling.
Almost 1,000 engineering projects are taking place including a signalling upgrade in the Bristol area, affecting Great Western passengers; track replacement between Milton Keynes and Rugby, and a project to electrify the railway through Chorley.
