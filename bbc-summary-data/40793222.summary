Ghana goalkeeper Razak Brimah joins South Africa's Sundowns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ghana goalkeeper Razak Brimah has joined South African side Mamelodi Sundowns after his contract with Spanish side Cordoba was not renewed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brimah joins two other international keepers at the club, which already has Uganda's Denis Onyango and Zambia's Kennedy Mweene on their books.
The 30-year-old played just four times for the Spanish second division club last season.
He was Ghana's first-choice keeper at this year's Africa Cup of Nations.
However he missed the Black Stars' third place play-off game in Gabon as they lost to Burkina Faso and has not started an international game since.
He caused controversy during the Nations Cup when responding to criticism with an expletive-laden rant on social media.
The Ghana Football Association fined him $2,500 (Â£1,990) for the comments after he apologised for the video.
Mamelodi Sundowns continue the defence of their African Champions League title with a quarter-final against Morocco's Wydad Casablanca in September.
