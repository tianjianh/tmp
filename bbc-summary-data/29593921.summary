The first classes giving pointers on how to avoid online frauds are being held in Aberdeen.
The sessions have been organised by Police Scotland and Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).
Cyber scamming includes frauds that use email, websites, chatrooms and message boards.
The first classes for over-60s are being held in Aberdeen's Stratosphere.
They are being led by Silver City Surfers, an organisation which runs monthly sessions for its members and promotes computer literacy among older people.
David Bernard, COPFS equality ambassador for age, said: "Criminals profiting from others is particularly detestable when they prey on the more vulnerable in our society.
"This class is to educate the older generation on the issue of cyber scamming, raise their awareness of such scams and provide information on how to avoid falling foul to these scams.
"The hope is that through education we can both prevent them from being victims of those crimes but also inspire confidence that the criminal justice system in Scotland will listen to them and take action."
Det Insp Eamonn Keane added: "Police Scotland encourage and embrace technology in communication and engagement with all communities and recognise the internet as an intrinsic part of people's lifestyle.
"We welcome this opportunity to educate and improve awareness amongst all communities to prevent crime and reduce opportunities for criminal exploitation."
