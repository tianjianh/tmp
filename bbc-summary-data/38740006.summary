Bill Kintner retweeted a post implying that three female protesters were too unattractive to be sexually assaulted.
The tweet drew criticism from other lawmakers, who threatened to submit legislation to boot him out of office.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters around the world took to the street on Saturday, supporting a range of causes.
Mayor resigns over Michelle Obama post
Mr Kintner retweeted a comment Sunday by conservative radio personality Larry Elder that mocked female protesters.
Mr Elder had posted a photo of three women holding signs apparently referring to Mr Trump's taped boast about grabbing women by the genitalia.
The radio host had commented: "Ladies, I think you're safe."
On Wednesday morning Mr Kintner posted his resignation on Facebook saying: "I look forward to not having to spend 75 more days with politicians."
"To paraphrase Richard Nixon, You won't have Bill Kintner to kick around anymore," he added.
Mr Kintner had already been under fire for the past five months after a sex scandal provoked calls for him to resign.
The Republican lawmaker was fined $1,000 (Â£795) last year after admitting to using his work laptop computer to have cyber-sex with a stranger online.
Other politicians around the country have faced criticism over social media postings about Saturday's women's rights protests.
Indiana Republican state Senator Jack Sandlin shared a meme on Sunday showing women marching through Washington.
It included the caption: "In one day, Trump got more fat women out walking than Michelle Obama did in 8 years" - referencing the former first lady's fitness campaigns.
In a follow-up post, he denied having posted the image, implying that he had been the victim of hacking.
President Trump was criticised during his election campaign for implying that the women who had accused him of sexual assault were too unattractive for him.
