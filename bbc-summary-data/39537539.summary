Stimpson took silver in the opening race in Abu Dhabi last month after a sprint finish with Andrea Hewitt.
But the 28-year-old was unable to get close to Hewitt this time, with the New Zealander winning from Australia's Ashleigh Gentle and Japan's Juri Ide.
Stimpson was the sole Briton competing at the 2018 Commonwealth Games venue.
A top-five finish could potentially have secured a place at the Games for England's 2014 gold medallist.
In the men's race, Spain's reigning World Series champion Mario Mola held off Richard Murray of South Africa, with another Spaniard, Fernando Alarza, third.
Britain's Rio 2016 silver medallist Jonathan Brownlee is expected to race at the next round of the series in Yokohama, Japan on 13 May.
His brother, Alistair, is focusing on longer distance events this season.
The double Olympic champion, 28, will make his debut in that discipline in a 70.3 mile race in Gran Canaria on 22 April.
