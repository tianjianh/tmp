Manager Graham Westley wants to add to the nine players he has already signed for Newport in the January transfer window.

He says more new arrivals are imminent with a focus on midfield after gaps were filled elsewhere.
Westley saw his side end an eight-game losing streak in League Two with a draw against Colchester on Saturday, but the County manager is still not satisfied.
"I'm still expecting to be active in the market," confirmed Westley.
Despite the point against Colchester, County remained bottom of the table and six points from safety.
Westley has been overseeing a major overhaul of his County squad including bringing back former Exile David Pipe.
Westley wants more experience. "We need to strengthen. We've got experience in the dressing room and we've got one or two youngsters. I just need just one or two more experienced ingredients," he said.
"I've strengthened the back-line, I've strengthened the front-line so obviously the midfield is going to be next."
One midfielder it seems Westley does not have to worry about replacing is Josh Sheehan.
The 21-year-old's loan spell from Swansea was due to end this month, but Westley expects Sheehan to now remain until the end of the campaign.
The Newport boss added: "We've spoken to Swansea and I hope and expect Josh to stay."
