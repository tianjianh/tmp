The Dons twice led in the first half, through David Fitzpatrick's 20-yard strike and Tom Elliott's volley.
But Compton levelled on both occasions, running through to slide home and curling in a free-kick from out wide.
And the winger sealed his treble from the penalty spot after substitute Kevin Dawson was fouled by Callum Kennedy.
The home side drop to 10th in the table after seeing their four-game winning run come to an end, while the Glovers are three points ahead of Dagenham & Redbridge, whose match was postponed.
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:

"You concede three goals at home, that's not good enough.
"I knew this would be tough and I drummed it into the players. That's the sort of game I expected.
"We struggled at times and we had too many players who probably didn't perform to the levels they have performed at. We're giving away really, really poor goals.
"We ran out of ideas trying to chase the game in the last 20 minutes."
