The company had been ordered to help the FBI circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contained crucial information.
In a statement, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: "We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand."
The BBC's Technology reporter Chris Foxx explains what the FBI wants Apple to help them with.
