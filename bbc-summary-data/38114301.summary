Barrow 0-1 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow suffered a narrow home defeat by Southport on their return to National League action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts, who were knocked out of the FA Cup by League One side Rochdale on Saturday, fell behind in the 14th minute when winger Ben McKenna made a penetrating run down the right flank and produced a neat finish.
Barrow, having been watched by a crowd of 4,414 at Holker Street for the cup tie, were looking to improve on sixth place in the National League table, and went close to an equaliser before half-time when an acrobatic effort by defender Moussa Diarra hit the crossbar.
Southport could have extended their lead in the second half, but Andrai Jones' close-range effort was saved by Jonathan Flatt as the visitors held out to secure a crucial three points in their battle to pull clear of the relegation fight.
