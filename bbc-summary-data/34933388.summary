Birmingham City have signed striker James Vaughan from Huddersfield Town and Rotherham defender Greg Halford on emergency loan deals until 2 January.

Birmingham-born Vaughan, 27, has hit 33 goals in 95 games since joining the Terriers, initially on loan, in 2012.
Much-travelled Halford, 30, a seven-figure signing at three of his former clubs, Reading, Sunderland and Wolves, was signed by Rotherham in the summer.
Sixth-placed Birmingham travel to second-placed Brighton on Saturday.
Boyhood Blues fan Vaughan has lost his place at struggling Huddersfield this season, having so far made just four substitute appearances.
"When the possibility of a loan came up, James asked me if we would consider it," said Town head coach David Wagner.
"I considered the advantages and disadvantages, the fact that it is for only six weeks and that James wanted to go and we decided to allow it."
Vaughan, who is contracted to Huddersfield to the end of this season, will not be available to play for Blues when the two sides meet in the Championship at St Andrew's on 5 December.
But he should be available for seven matches to help fill the void left by the loss of five-goal top scorer Clayton Donaldson with a groin injury while on international duty.
Halford, who started his career at Colchester and has also played for Charlton Athletic, Sheffield United, Portsmouth and Nottingham Forest, made 19 appearances while on loan at Brighton last term.
His eight games for Rotherham so far this season leave him just one short of 450 career appearances, in which he has scored 55 goals.
