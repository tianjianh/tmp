Kairon McKay, from Perth, died after the incident on the A90, at Longforgan, at about 21:20 on Friday.
Police said Kairon was hit by a blue Ford C Max and have urged witnesses to come forward.
Kairon's mother Laura posted a picture of the nine-year-old holding a skateboard on Facebook and called him her "precious boy".
She said: "No child should be away before their mum, I wish I would wake up from this nightmare. My whole future is with Kairon in it. I'm totally lost now."
