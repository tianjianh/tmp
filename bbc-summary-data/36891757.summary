The front of a derelict property on High Park Street in Toxteth collapsed onto the pavement shortly before 19.45 BST on Monday, Merseyside Police said.
Nobody was hurt but a family living in a flat above a neighbouring shop has been evacuated.
High Park Street is closed at its junction with Voelas Street and Rhiwlas Street while structural engineers and demolition experts assess the scene.
Pedestrians and motorists are being warned to avoid the area.
Liverpool City Council cabinet member for housing Frank Hont said: "What we think is that the frontage of the shop has collapsed but obviously we've got to check that there's no damage to the rest of the block.
"There are people living on the other end of the block so our paramount concern is their safety."
The regeneration of the Welsh Streets, which include Ringo Starr's birthplace, is set to start next month.
A pilot scheme in High Park Street and Veolas Street will make 35 properties into "25 energy efficient homes", the council said.
Developer PlaceFirst tweeted the collapse was "not related to any PlaceFirst development activity" and will "not affect" their plans.
