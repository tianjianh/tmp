The balloon was launched near Bristol on Saturday as part of a 10-year project, entitled A Decade with Mars, by artists Ella Good and Nicki Kent.
It came down later in Miskin, near Cardiff, and was found by Mia Williams, nine, and her friend Ffion Payne.
Footage captured by the camera shows the mountains of Wales and the River Severn.
The girls were playing in Mia's back garden when they noticed something "green and orange heading towards us very quickly".
When they went to investigate they found the camera on the ground with a phone number written on it.
Mia's father Jamie Williams contacted the two artists to say they had found the camera.
"We got the call about an hour-and-a-half after the launch," said Miss Good.
"We were surprised as the prediction was that it would land in the Bristol Channel so we were delighted to hear it was safe."
Before launching the balloon from Yate Common, the artists spent time in local primary schools talking about space travel and the future.
"We worked with seven- to nine-year-olds. The workshops were about that they will be 17 to 19 when A Decade With Mars finishes, so we discussed what they might be doing in 10 years' time, and how the world might change," said Miss Good.
The images from the balloon represented "the closest most of us will ever get to launching in to space", she added.
The project will also see the artists stay in touch with a group of non-astronauts who applied to the Mars One Project to become the first people to colonise Mars.
