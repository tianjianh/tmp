Ten Indian soldiers are missing after an avalanche struck the Siachen glacier in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Army spokesman Colonel SD Goswami said army and air force rescue teams helped by dogs were looking for the troops.
The avalanche hit the high-altitude military post on the northern side of the glacier early on Wednesday morning.
Siachen, known as the world's highest battlefield, is patrolled by troops from both India and Pakistan, who dispute the region's sovereignty.
Four Indian soldiers were killed by an avalanche in the same area last month.
More soldiers have died from harsh weather on the glacier than in combat since India seized control of it in 1984, narrowly pipping Pakistan. Soldiers have been deployed at heights of up to 22,000 ft (6,700m) above sea level.
The neighbours have failed to demilitarise the Siachen glacier despite several rounds of peace talks.
