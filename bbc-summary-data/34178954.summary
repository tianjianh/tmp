Customers in greater Belfast will see prices fall by up to 10% from October. Those in the 'ten towns' gas network outside Belfast will get a 5% cut.
The cuts are due to the continuing fall in wholesale gas prices.
Last week, Northern Ireland's biggest gas supplier, SSE Airtricity, which has about 125,000 customers in greater Belfast, announced a 10% price cut.
Michael Scott, Firmus Energy's managing director, said: "All our customers will receive a letter within a week outlining their tariff reduction and the date it will come into effect.
"We will continue to monitor costs and wholesale fuel prices closely to ensure the price we charge our customers is the best value that we can offer."
The price cut is greater in Belfast because it is part of a separate network.
The 'ten towns' area covers Antrim, Armagh, Banbridge, Craigavon, Newry, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine, Limavady and Londonderry.
A spokesperson for Firmus Energy said: "Natural gas costs only make up around 50% of the bill, the remainder is made up of distribution and transmission costs.
"These costs are 21% higher in the 'ten towns' licence area than in greater Belfast and have been reviewed and approved by the utility regulator."
Richard Williams, head of energy at the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland, said the price cuts were "positive news" for gas customers.
"This will mean the annual gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter in greater Belfast will fall by £57 and £31 in the ten towns," he added.
