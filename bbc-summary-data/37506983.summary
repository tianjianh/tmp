The victim is thought to have been saved from serious injury by his glasses in the attack in Great Barr, Birmingham.
Up to six youths reportedly restrained the schoolboy during a confrontation in the street.
West Midlands Police said the boy was not seriously hurt in last Friday's attack in Birdbrook Road at 15:50 BST.
Officers, who appealed for witnesses, are checking CCTV from the area.
