He had back surgery for the second time in 18 months in September and talked about retirement earlier this month.
Now the former world number one, who is 40 on 30 December, hopes to play competitively again early in 2016.
"Where do I see myself in the next five to 10 years? I am still playing golf at the highest level, winning tournaments and majors," he wrote on his website.
Woods spent a record total of 683 weeks as world number one but has not won a tournament since the Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013.
He is now ranked 414th and won the last of his 14 majors in 2008.
Asked about entering his fifth decade, he said: "Mentally, people who know me know I'm like a five-year-old.
"Physically, sometimes I feel old and sometimes I feel like a teenager. I don't like the polar opposites of the two. I'd like to be somewhere in the middle where I feel 40.
"The thing I'm looking forward to the most about 2016 is getting back out there again. I've missed it, and I would like to do it pain-free.
"I've had it in spurts the last few years and have done some pretty good things, but I'd like to have sustained health."
Woods was named as an assistant by US captain Davis Love III for next year's Ryder Cup in Minnesota but said he is still aiming for a more prominent role against  Europe at the Hazeltine National Golf Club.
"Hopefully, I'll be able to play my way on to the team," he said.
"Either way, I'm excited about being an assistant captain. It will be new, fun and special.
"To have Davis appoint and trust me is pretty special.
"If you look back to when we played together in 1999 at Brookline, I don't think either one of us would have foreseen this."
