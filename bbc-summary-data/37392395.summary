[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kieran Lee's stoppage-time winner saw Sheffield Wednesday get their third win in four games as they defeated Nottingham Forest in the Championship.

Henri Lansbury put the visitors in front, with his shot from 30 yards deflecting off Barry Bannan and looping in over goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.
Lee levelled, heading home Ross Wallace's corner after finding himself unmarked in the Forest area.
And Lee got the winner as he stabbed home from close range late on.
Wednesday move up to 11th spot, one point off the top six, while Forest slip down to 15th place.
Lansbury's opener for Forest came against the run of play, as the Owls had seen Wallace, Gary Hooper and Steven Fletcher all go close for the home side.
Westwood made a great save from Apostolos Vellios to keep Wednesday in it by palming away the Greek striker's header as it made its way towards the far post.
But Forest's poor defending from Wallace's corner began their downfall as Lee ghosted into the box unmarked and did not have to jump as he guided the ball into the net.
Chris Cohen headed Wallace's effort off the line with six minute left before Lee - who was making his 150th Wednesday appearance - got the winner, prodding a square ball across the six yard box past Vladimir Stojkovic.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"If the plan of the team is to kill me, they are very near, I must tell you! One more game like this and they will kill me!
"We created a lot of chances to win the game. Nottingham Forest were very difficult and organised opponents and they had some chances also.
"When questions are put to us, we must give the correct answers and I felt we did that so we are happy. My players showed a lot of character to win this game."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"It was a good game against a good team. It's disappointing to lose at the end of the match.
"I'm disappointed about two bad decisions, too, because it makes the difference at the end.
"We defended very well and we felt that if we could score at the start of the second half, perhaps we can change the game. We have had several games where we've showed a good defensive mentality."
