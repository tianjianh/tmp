[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lyle Taylor grabbed the only goal of the game as AFC Wimbledon beat Walsall to record a first win in eight matches in all competitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons came into the match without a victory since beating Oxford on January 14, a run that started with their 3-1 FA Cup defeat at home to Sutton three days later.
But Taylor's 12th goal of the season was enough to earn them all three points in this game as Walsall suffered a first defeat in three games.
Home goalkeeper James Shea stopped Walsall full-back Jason McCarthy's fierce drive, while Dons midfielder Tom Soares was inches away from scoring in a first half low on chances.
Dannie Bulman forced Neil Etheridge into a brilliant full-stretch save after the restart as the Dons pushed for the victory.
And Taylor gave the Dons three points with a cool finish at the second attempt to finally get the hosts' season back on track.
The striker completely missed the ball at the first attempt, before burying his second effort from 12 yards.
Tom Elliott missed a good chance to double the lead in the 89th minute and almost paid the price as Walsall came close to a late leveller.
Shea batted O'Connor's shot off the line before visiting substitute Scott Laird hit the bar in the 90th minute, but Wimbledon deservedly hung on for the win.
