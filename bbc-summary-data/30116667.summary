It includes 700 posts at accountancy firm Deloitte after hopes were raised in September that it would expand in the new Cardiff enterprise zone.
In Torfaen, Griffin Place Communications will create more than 300 jobs at a new call centre in Cwmbran.
It comes on the eve of an international investment conference in Newport.
The jobs unveiled are:
First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will visit SPTS Technologies on Thursday, said the announcements were the latest in a steady stream of new investors choosing Wales.
"We operate in a global market and there is global competition for these projects. These companies could have been located anywhere in the world and I am happy to say they all chose to come to Wales," he said.
He said it was a "good news day" for Wales as the jobs were being created in parts of both north and south Wales, across a number of sectors.
He added that they would be jobs for local people.
"We have the skills in Wales, " he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales.
"If you look at our universities, they certainly are able to produce the people with the skills that are needed.
"There may be some people who might come down in the initial stages into Wales but in the medium term, certainly, these are jobs for local people."
Although only 30 posts are coming to SPTS, the work will be highly-skilled in researching and developing biomedical devices.
The company, which already makes micro-electrical equipment, is receiving a £4.6m research and development grant from Welsh government, while four of the other companies are sharing a total of £2.2m in business finance.
The announcement comes as UK Investment Summit Wales 2014 is due to take place at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport over the next two days.
It brings together 250 investors, business leaders and ministers.
Hi-tech products will also be showcased including a James Bond-style high performance speedboat that transforms into a streamlined underwater submersible, made by an Anglesey firm, and the UK's first 3D printed metal bike frame from Cardiff.
"There's nothing we can't do in Wales and that's what I'll be telling international investors tomorrow," added Mr Jones.
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the UK government had a long term economic plan for "getting right behind Welsh businesses and creating the perfect conditions for growth".
"This week's summit will send a message to the world that we are an ambitious nation that is open for business," he said.
"There has never been a better time for Wales to capitalise on an investment summit - to turn the success of the recent Nato summit into jobs and prosperity so that more people in Wales can benefit from the security of a regular wage."
