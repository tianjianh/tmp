How to spend £33m: a lottery winner's shopping list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The multi-million pound fortune of today's lottery winners ranks alongside the wealth of some of the world's top sports and movie stars.

Incredibly, David and Carol Martin's payday was healthier than that of Top Gun star Tom Cruise in 2015, according to Forbes' list of highest paid celebrities.
Their eye-watering fortune even exceeded the combined winnings and salary of Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton last year.
With £33m safely deposited, the couple from Hawick can now draw up an almost unlimited shopping list.
Always willing to help, we've come up with our own suggestions.
Quit your job, pay off your mortgage, throw a party for friends and family but surely then you buy a superyacht?
For just $35m (£24m), you could have your own palatial home on the water. The 122m long Alexander has a crew of 60 ready to wait on up to 80 guests.
With a 27-seat cinema, disco bar, beauty salon, heliport and even a small hospital, you need never set foot on dry land again after making this astronomical purchase.
If a life on the ocean waves is not your thing, maybe a private jet would be a more convenient way to see the world?
Pay just $8.7m (£6m) and you could be the proud owner of a 1992 Boeing MD 87 VIP.
According to Exclusive Aircraft Sales and Charter, it is ideally suited to heads of state and professional sports teams - and multi-million pound lottery winners, of course.
It boasts a stateroom, with its own bed and en-suite, as well as a nine-seater first-class cabin for VIPs. There is also a "clubroom" for six passengers and a premium coach for another 21 people.
After a gloomy Scottish summer and particularly damp winter, it is definitely time to head for the sun. What do you fancy? Spain, Ibiza, Lanzarote?
How about a private island in Caribbean?
Eight acres of paradise in the Bahamas is available for $17.9m (£12.4m).
Gumelemi Cay is supplied with electricity, water and cable TV but it is otherwise a blank canvas for today's lottery winners to transform into their own oasis.
When you've got £33m in your bank account, why wouldn't you pay other people to do those little jobs you hate?
Ironing, cleaning, answering the door, replying to begging letters - it's time to hire a butler.
According to the website of the International Butler Academy, modern butlers are all-purpose household managers. They can act as valets, chefs, and bodyguards as well as organising the schedules of other domestic staff.
They can oversee household maintenance, organise parties and events, and even book hotels, restaurants and theatres.
For a salary of up to around £100,000, they could be an indispensible addition to any lottery winner's household.
If there is any loose change after buying a superyacht and private island, perhaps Mr and Mrs Martin could consider donating to some worthy causes.
Euromillions winner Colin and Chris Weir have given some of their fortune to the SNP and they have invested in Partick Thistle Football Club, helping it become debt-free.
If our latest winners are looking closer to home, they might consider matching the investment of Boyd Tunnock in the St Abbs Lifeboat appeal.
He gave £250,000 to the project, which aims to return a lifeboat to the Borders village after the RNLI withdrew its service last year.
Borders Water Rescue Unit is also trying to raise £50,000 to fund a dedicated vehicle for its service. The team of divers is called upon by the emergency services to carry out search, rescue and recovery services in the region.
The modest couple have said that they intend to help their family and closest friends.
Mr Martin said: "We don't have all the answers yet but we'd like to help our closest friends and family and there are charities which are important to us too."
