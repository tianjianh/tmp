The Red Hot Chilli Pipers have joined forces with the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) pipe band to record a single for the 9/11 anniversary.

Scottish piper Willie Armstrong, who retired from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service in March, paired up with FDNY fire-fighter and pipe major Jimmy Lee to record '343 The Fallen'.
More than 3,000 people were killed in the terror attack on the twin towers 15 years ago.
The fire department lost 343 members.
The FDNY pipers played at all 343 funerals, and Willie said it was hard to imagine how difficult that must have been.
"I've only piped at three funerals during my career, so to play at that many, including your friends and colleagues, that shows how emotional it must have been for them," he said.
Willie Armstrong first worked with Jimmy Lee at a charity concert in New York 2007, where they raised $10,000.
The money raised from this single will be divided between the Scottish Fire and Rescue Family Support Trust and The FDNY Pipes and Drums.
Willie said:  "Both charities are important and have done so much to help those who've lost loved ones.
"The Scottish Fire and Rescue Family Support Trust is close to my heart, and has been going now for 90-years."
Jimmy Lee added: "The Pipes and Drums of the FDNY made it their mission to play at every single funeral of the 343 firefighters that lost their lives on September 11 2001 and we continue to play at many funerals today.
"We wanted to do something special to honour the 343 brothers we lost that day, including two members of the pipe band.
"Working with Willie and the Red Hot Chilli Pipers was an incredible experience."
The SFRS Family Support Trust was established in 1923, and exists to provide financial and other support to serving and retired fire service personnel and their families in times of need.
The FDNY Emerald Society Pipes and Drums began in 1962 and works to commemorate fallen firefighters.
