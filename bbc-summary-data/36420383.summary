[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ice cream van man robbed at knifepoint in Oxford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ice cream van man has been robbed at knifepoint after a thief vaulted through the serving hatch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vendor had turned his back momentarily to add some extra toppings to his order.
The robber leapt into the van and stole the till before being chased, with the till, by the ice cream man along Kelburne Road in Oxford on Sunday.
At one point the thief entered a property and changed clothes mid-chase before re-emerging.
The vendor eventually lost sight of him in St Martins Road.
The suspect is described as white, about 5ft to 6ft tall, of medium build, with short fair hair and a spotty complexion.
He was initially wearing a white top, dark trousers and light-coloured trainers, but changed into a grey hooded fleece, dark coloured shorts and trainers.
