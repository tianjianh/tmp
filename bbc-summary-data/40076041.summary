The Plaid Cymru leader called for police to be "adequately resourced" to keep people safe including at the Champions League final on 3 June.
The threat level has now been reduced in the wake of the attack which killed 22 people and left scores injured.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the security services and police "have the tools they need".
Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Ms Wood said that people should not feel put off from coming to the final in Cardiff at the weekend due to security concerns.
But she said bomber Salman Abedi - who detonated the device at the Manchester Arena - had been brought to the attention of the authorities.
"There are serious questions that need to be answered as to why action wasn't taken earlier to prevent this," she said.
Armed police have been guarding events and high footfall areas across Wales this bank holiday weekend in the aftermath of the attack.
Soldiers deployed across the UK to support the police will be stood down on Monday night, at the close of the bank holiday weekend.
Ms Wood said police needed greater resources to deal with attacks, adding: "We wouldn't need troops on the streets perhaps if there were enough police officers on the streets."
Co-leader of the Green Party Caroline Lucas said there were questions that needed to be answered about reports Abedi was known to the authorities.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said he was "confident" that all was being done to keep the up to 170,000 people expected in Cardiff for the showdown between Juventus and Real Madrid safe.
Speaking to BBC Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, the Welsh Labour leader said more had to be done to prevent attacks.
He said: "We need to just work harder to make sure these attacks can be avoided in the future.
"What's the key to that: good intelligence, making sure that people understand where the attacks might come from, these things are never perfect," he said.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the Andrew Marr show that the Conservative UK government were in constant discussions with the police and security services to make sure they had the "right tools" to do the job.
She said that the operation was ongoing, but the security services had foiled 18 different plots since 2013 and were doing a "good job".
"We are not frightened though of learning lessons and improving," she said.
