London Help-to-Buy: quick guide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Chancellor has announced a London help-to-buy scheme in his Autumn Spending Review.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This is what we know about the scheme so far:
A spokesman for the Treasury said the new scheme was simultaneously designed to help people get onto the property ladder and to help stimulate house building.
If you accept a 40% London equity help-to-buy loan you are required to pay back a 40% share of the value of the home when you come to sell.
Between April 2013 and June 2015 the government provided 3,128 help-to-buy equity loans in London worth nearly Â£200m in total.
In the capital the most help-to-buy loans were supplied in the borough of Havering (362).
Four London boroughs - Haringey, Westminster, Camden and Kensington and Chelsea - had no applications for the scheme. The City of London also had no loan applications.
