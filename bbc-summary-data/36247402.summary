The blaze at Wythenshawe Hall in Manchester on 15 March caused extensive roof and upper floor damage.
Since the fire, an emergency tarpaulin has been used during to protect the building during structural and archaeological work.
Jeremy Taylor, 26, is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court on 1 July, charged with arson.
A team of archaeologists has continued sifting through debris to preserve as much original material as possible.
Manchester City Council Leader Sue Murphy said: "A huge amount of work has already gone into helping protect Wythenshawe Hall, most visibly the scaffold cocoon that is helping to stabilise the damaged areas of the property and will support the new temporary roofing.
"It will be a long road to recovery for the building, but working with our partners and the friends' group, we will see Wythenshawe Hall back to its best."
