Some women struggle to access education or healthcare, while others are battling for better wages.
There are also genuine dangers, including the threat of female genital mutilation, domestic violence or sexual abuse.

Despite this, many feel there has never been a better time to be a woman and new opportunities are opening up all the time.
All around the world, more women are entering higher education, gaining legal rights and protections, and offering their daughters the chance of a brighter future.
So how can we tell this complex, nuanced story - the story of 3.5bn people in more than 200 countries?
During October 2013 the BBC's 100 Women season will seek to shine a light on life for women in the 21st Century - the risks, challenges and opportunities they face every day, in every country.
And we want our global audiences to tell us what they think:
Throughout October our global network of correspondents will try to answer some of the questions above. But we want to hear your stories as we go along.
Our season will close with a conference on Friday 25 October when 100 women from around the world - some high-profile, many less well-known - will join us at our London HQ for a day of debate and interaction.
The conference will be streamed online and broadcast live in English on BBC World News TV and World Service radio, as well as by many of our 27 global languages services.
The 100 Women season is a chance for women to be represented, involved and inspired - and we want you to have your say.
You can get in touch via email, text message and social media - including on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #100Women.
