[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liverpool v Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool are without Adam Lallana for the 228th Merseyside derby because of a thigh problem sustained playing for England earlier this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Henderson remains a doubt but Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firminho are all in contention.
Everton's Ramiro Funes Mori and Seamus Coleman will not play again this season following injuries suffered on international duty.
Morgan Schneiderlin has a calf injury and is also unavailable.
Guy Mowbray: "Does form go out of the window for derbies? With both teams in fine fettle before the break, let's hope not.
"Everton's upturn goes back to December's derby. Beaten only once since losing at home to Liverpool in the last seconds, they've narrowed the gap on their rivals from 16 points on 1 January to six on 1 April.
"Might a win across the park for the first time this century even prompt thoughts of pipping the Reds (and two other reds) to a top-four finish?
"It might, although Liverpool's performances under Jurgen Klopp in the biggest games means that remains a far-flung thought for now.
"Anfield expects. The match SHOULD deliver."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman on the injury to defender Seamus Coleman: "It's a big, big blow for the player and a big, big blow for the club.
"In all my years in football, Seamus is one of the best professionals I've ever worked with at any club.
"That mentality will really be helpful to him now in not only coming to terms with what has happened but in setting out on the road to recovery and, over time, in him building himself once more to the level he has maintained over many years here at Everton."
