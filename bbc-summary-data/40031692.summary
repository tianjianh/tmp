Its Welsh manifesto will also say mental health services should get "parity" with physical treatment.
Neil Hamilton, leader of UKIP's assembly group, said it was a "vigorous document" with Wales "at its heart".
UKIP is resuming election campaigning on Thursday, which parties had paused after Monday's terror attack.
Other political parties are due to re-start their campaigns over the next few days, with just two weeks to go until polling day on 8 June.
Pledges in the UKIP Welsh manifesto will include:
Mr Hamilton called the document, entitled Wales Into the World, a post-Brexit "full-spectrum vision".
"From taking those earning minimum wage out of income tax altogether to putting mental health on an equal footing with physical health; our manifesto is a vigorous document filled with domestic policies with Wales at its heart," he said.
"This manifesto is specific to Wales and will accompany the national manifesto being launched in Westminster."
Mr Hamilton, who is also standing as a parliamentary candidate in June, will launch the manifesto in Cardiff Bay on Thursday morning.
The party performed badly in local elections earlier this month, failing to win any Welsh seats.
