Anthony Wordsworth gave the hosts an early lead from close range but Stuart Beavon equalised for Burton just before the break with a deflected strike.
Tyrone Barnett's fine drive restored Southend's advantage and David Mooney sealed the win in the last minute on the counter-attack.
Burton have now lost three of their past six matches.
Burton boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:

"I thought we played well enough to get something out of the game.
"After the first 10 minutes we got to grips with the game and played well; deserved the equaliser and I thought we started the second half very well.
"They hardly had a shot and then all of a sudden one flies in the top corner and we're chasing the game again.
"We probably played better for an hour of the game tonight than we did in the two previous victories."
