Selby had been due to face Hermogenes Castillo, also of Nicaragua, but the 21-year-old has pulled out at the last minute with a hand injury.
The 27-year-old became the fastest Welsh boxer to a British title with victory over Louis Norman in May.
He is undefeated in five fights since turning professional in 2015.
IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby says brother Andrew is a "natural fighter".
"I'm not saying it because he's my brother but he's one of the most talented boxers I've seen," he said.
"He does stuff in the gym that you cannot teach. He's just a natural fighter."
Former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan said Selby is "one of the best talents" he has ever seen.
Older brother Lee has sparred against his sibling in the build-up to Friday's fight at Meadowbank Sports Centre in Edinburgh.
"He's looking brilliant and I've got a black eye to prove it," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It's like trying to swat a fly and you get stung by a bee. That's what it's like chasing round the ring - you just can't hit him.
"He hits you about five times before you move your hands."
After the Edinburgh fight, the younger Selby will face a yet to be announced opponent on 18 November at London's Wembley Arena.
Lee Selby has said he is likely to defend his IBF featherweight title against Jonathan Victor Barros in mid-December in the United States.
