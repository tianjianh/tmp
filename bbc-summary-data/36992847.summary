[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova will not appeal against her ban from the Rio Olympic Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Athlete Stepanova, who helped expose state-backed doping, was ruled out when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned from Rio any Russian who had served a doping suspension.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) outlawed that ruling on Thursday.
But Stepanova, 30, said she was "hugely sad and heartbroken" at a lack of IOC support and therefore will not appeal.
Stepanova, who served a two-year ban for blood passport abnormalities in 2013, was not included in Russia's team but had hoped to be invited to the Games by the IOC to compete under a neutral flag.
She and husband Vitaly, a former Russian anti-doping official, said in a statement that the IOC had "turned a blind eye" to the risks the 800m runner took in exposing "systematic cheating in Russia".
"We believe that in exercising this discretion to deny Yuliya a place in the competition, it sends a message that the World Anti-Doping Code and the values of Olympism are merely words on a page," the statement added.
"As a result, we will not file an appeal to Cas."
