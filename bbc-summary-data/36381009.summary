Cody Cropper: MK Dons goalkeeper leaves League One-bound club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Cody Cropper will leave MK Dons at the end of his deal in June after the club decided against exercising the option in his contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old made 12 appearances for the Dons since joining them last summer after his release by Southampton.
The United States Under-23 man failed to keep a clean sheet as the Dons were relegated from the Championship.
News of his release comes the day after young keeper Charlie Burns was given a new contact at Stadium:MK.
Defenders Matthew Upson, Antony Kay and Jordan Spence were released by the Dons earlier in the month.
