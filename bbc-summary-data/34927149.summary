Ian Parkhill scored the opener on the half hour, pouncing after home keeper Stefan McCusker had fumbled Jamie McGonigle's shot.
United levelled on 57 minutes through Adam Leckey's glancing header.
But a fine 84th-minute strike by Rodney Brown gave Coleraine their first ever Premiership win at Ferney Park.
It meant a fourth successive league defeat for Ballinamallard who are ninth in the table.
Front man Parkhill had started the match because leading scorer James McLaughlin was injured in the warm-up.
He snapped up the opening goal after McCusker failed to hold on to McGonigle's low shot.
Ballinamallard should have scored before the break but James McCartney shot wide from just a few yards out.
However, the hosts did equalise as big midfielder Leckey headed in from a Jason McCartney corner.
Coleraine secured the victory when Brown got his fifth goal of the season with a superbly-struck shot.
Coleraine manager Oran Kearney: "We never get it easy here and it is great to come away with the three points for the first time.
"It was disappointing to concede from the corner because we aim to limit teams at set pieces.
"But our players found some energy and strength of character from somewhere and found another gear.
"We had other chances before Rodney scored with what was a great strike."
