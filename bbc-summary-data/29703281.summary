Immigration campaigner Sir Andrew Green set for peerage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of Migration Watch, Sir Andrew Green, is among several public figures to have been awarded peerages.

The ex-diplomat, who has argued for more immigration controls, will sit as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.
Former Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, former MI5 boss Sir Jonathan Evans and education expert Professor Alison Wolf are also honoured after being nominated by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Downing Street said it reflected their proven track record of public service.
The peerages have been approved by The Queen.
Sir Andrew Green founded Migration Watch in 2001 after serving in the Diplomatic Service for 35 years, including as UK Ambassador to Syria and Saudi Arabia.
The organisation, which campaigns for a more managed immigration policy, said the nomination was a "clear endorsement at the highest level" of the work it had done.
UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Green had "doggedly applied statistics and hard evidence to the thorny questions surrounding migration into this country".
He added: "Without his clear work, the debate in this country would still be typified by attempts to blank out debate. The political class and the country at large owes him a debt of gratitude."
Sir Robert Rogers served in the historic role of Clerk to the House of Commons and chief executive of the House of Commons Service for three years before his retirement earlier this year, having worked in the House of Commons for four decades.
His retirement triggered a row over the scope and duties of the role with many MPs unhappy about the proposed choice of Australian Carole Mills to succeed him.
The recruitment process, overseen by Commons Speaker John Bercow, has now been paused, with MPs conducting an inquiry.
Sir Jonathan Evans retired as director general of the domestic Security Service, better known as MI5, last year after six years at the top of the organisation.
He joined MI5 as a 22 year old in 1980 and had a key role in shaping the UK's counter-terrorism response to the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.
Professor Alison Wolf is an expert on vocational education and training and on the relationship between education, gender and the labour market. She is currently the Professor of Public Sector Management at King's College London.
The majority of non-political nominations for life peerages are made by the House of Lords Appointment Commission, although a handful of crossbench nominations are recommended directly for approval by The Queen by the prime minister.
In a statement, Mr Cameron said he was "extending the criteria for these recommendations to ensure they can properly encompass a range of individuals with a proven track record of public service, not solely public servants on retirement".
The four nominations will still be vetted by the Commission but without the power of veto.
