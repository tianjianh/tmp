[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster's survival hopes in League One suffered a cruel blow as Leon Clarke scored a late winner for Bury.

John O'Sullivan was denied in the first half by the reactions of Rovers goalkeeper Remi Matthews, before Andy Butler headed over in reply.
Doncaster then went close as Andy Williams intercepted a poor back pass only to fire over the crossbar.
Clarke punished Doncaster's wastefulness, volleying home with 13 minutes left to play.
The result keeps Bury well-clear of relegation danger, but Doncaster are eight points from safety, having failed to win a league game since 2 January.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"The goal was immaculate. He creates chances for himself, but the rest of the players had to work hard for the clean sheet.
"It's a massive clean sheet. You don't play against a Darren Ferguson team that lies down.
"We had to withstand a lot of pressure, but we expected that.
"We said to the players before the game, to get a zero, we're going to have to work incredibly hard."
