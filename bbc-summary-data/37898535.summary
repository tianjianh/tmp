Brett Pitman: Ipswich Town striker has Jersey international ambition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town striker Brett Pitman is keen to play international football for Jersey, if the island is allowed to join Europe's governing body, Uefa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This week's meeting between Uefa and Jersey officials to discuss the application has been postponed.
The island is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after Uefa refused to allow its full members to discuss Jersey's application.
"If Jersey can do it, it's something I would want to do," Pitman said.
"I'd want to come and play for Jersey for sure, if that was possible."
The 28-year-old was born and raised in Jersey before leaving to join Bournemouth's academy as a teenager and is one of three islanders playing in the English Football League (EFL) - the others being Rochdale's Peter Vincenti and Colchester United's Kurtis Guthrie.
Gibraltar, who Jersey have regularly played at the Island Games, and Kosovo have recently joined Uefa.
But Jersey's case is made more difficult because the island is not a sovereign nation - a qualifying rule that was brought in after Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, applied and was granted membership.
"If they're going to do it, it's something they've got to do properly, you can't do it half-heartedly," added Pitman, who played for Jersey champions St Paul's as a young teenager.
"You've got to do it as properly and professionally as possible if you're going to be competing against international teams because I don't think there are any weak teams at that level."
Jersey is a Crown dependency of the United Kingdom, although it competes in its own right in the Commonwealth Games and is an associate member of the International Cricket Council, competing in the World Cricket League.
