Draught soft drinks company Nichols Dispense Scotland has expanded its production capacity after striking a major deal with Coca-Cola.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nichols has moved from its former Dunblane premises to a bigger depot in Stirling, more than doubling its capacity.
The company, which already exclusively supplies Irn-Bru on dispense, has now added Coca-Cola to its range.
It said it had become Coca-Cola's first independent "bag in box" supplier.
Nichols Dispense, which is part of Vimto and Sunkist maker Nichols, focuses on producing and distributing soft drinks for dispensing in pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants.
It has a satellite depot in Aberdeen, in addition to the Stirling premises. A total of 20 people are employed between the two facilities.
Trading director Nick Yates said: "The deal with Coca-Cola only adds to our credibility as the leading supplier in the market and expansion through a bigger depot enables us to capitalise on the significant opportunities for growth."
