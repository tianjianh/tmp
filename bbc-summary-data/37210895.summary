The funeral for Daniel Sheridan is to take place in his native Dublin later.
The schoolboy was taking part in a practice session when he came off his motorbike and was then struck by another bike driven by his brother, Jake.
"There was nothing I could do, it was like a bad dream," Jake, 18, told BBC Radio Foyle.
The brothers, who were from Tallaght, were regular visitors to the County Londonderry track where the crash happened last week.
Daniel was airlifted to Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, but died later from his injuries.
"Me and Daniel were out practising, it was a beautiful day, but we had a crash and he passed away," Jake said.
"It was really a shock for something like that to happen. There was nothing I could do, it was like a bad dream."
Both brothers raced motocross bikes in competitions in England and had a close relationship.
Jake said Daniel had looked up to him and wanted to "be the best" at everything he did.
"I know he would want me to be strong, he was a very strong human being, even though he was very young," he said.
"I know he knows we loved him.
"It's been one of the hardest weekends of my life. We just need to stick together as a family now."
