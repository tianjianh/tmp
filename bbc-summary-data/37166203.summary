All paid up members of the party are eligible to vote in the election. Voting closes on 25 August and the winner will be announced on 2 September.
Former leader Caroline Lucas, the party's only MP, is bidding to be leader again, this time as a job share with Jonathan Bartley, the party's work and pensions spokesman.
Ms Lucas became the party's first MP in 2010 when she took the seat of Brighton Pavilion from Labour. She was re-elected in 2015 with a much-increased majority of nearly 8,000.
At Westminster Ms Lucas has raised the party's profile with her opposition to the so-called "bedroom tax", the benefits cap and the renewal of Trident.
The Spectator named her "newcomer of the year" in 2010.
Ms Lucas, who has also served as an MEP for South East England, was elected as party leader in 2008.
She stood down in 2012, saying: "I want to give other people the opportunity to get well known, to have some profile in the party, hopefully to use that to get themselves elected as well."
She was replaced by Natalie Bennett but the new leader failed to get elected to the Commons in 2015.
Ms Lucas was the Greens' first solo leader in England and Wales, after it switched from a system of having two principal speakers. Standing again on a job share ticket recalls the previous arrangement and has echoes in the Scottish Green Party, which is led by two co-convenors.
The Green Party's spokesman on work and pensions is standing on a joint ticket with Caroline Lucas because, they say, both are candidates who have "considerable experience of campaigning and winning".
Active in the Green Party in Lambeth, south London, Mr Bartley stood for the party in the recent London Assembly elections but failed to win a seat.
A year before that, he stood as a general election candidate in Streatham, coming fourth.
Mr Bartley campaigned for the alternative vote in the 2011 referendum, as vice-chairman of the Yes to Fairer Votes Campaign.
Simon Cross was the Greens' 2015 general election candidate in the Essex constituency of Rochford and Southend East, coming fourth.
Before moving to Southend he lived in South Yorkshire and was active in the Green Party there.
His general election campaign profile said he campaigned "in the areas of the NHS, young people and education, poverty and homelessness".
Writing in 2014, he said he would "oppose NHS privatisation and treating healthcare as a market" and campaign to "keep the health service free - abolish prescription charges, reintroduce free eye tests and NHS dental treatment for all".
On the economy, he wrote: "The Green Party wants to rehabilitate progressive taxation. This requires two things: raising taxes fairly and explaining them honestly."
Clive Lord describes himself as "almost a founder member of the Green Party", having joined the party (then called PEOPLE) in 1973, five months after its formation.
At the age of 81 he says he is "the longest serving member still active" but his campaign website hints heavily that his leadership would be about preparing a favoured successor for the role.
He supports deputy leadership candidate Andrew Cooper, going as far as to say Mr Cooper "will be a much better leader than me".
Mr Lord hoped that Mr Cooper would run on a joint ticket with Caroline Lucas but, as that has not happened, he says he would transfer much of his work if elected leader to a deputy, which he hopes would be Mr Cooper.
Mr Lord backs a Citizens' Basic Income and greater redistribution of wealth. "I pointed out to the actual founder members in March 1973 that they had just founded a socialist party, whether they liked it or not," he wrote.
Film-maker and lecturer David Malone is calling for "a serious debate in the party, first and foremost, about finance and economics".
In a campaign statement, he wrote that the Greens should prioritise "bringing our economy, our financial structures, corporate tax and our currency back under effective democratic control",
On the leadership election, he added: "I doubt I will win. Caroline Lucas is a very good MP, will make a very effective leader and is far better known than I am.  But I  thought running anyway could still serve a purpose, in hopefully spurring a debate."
During an online Q&A during the leadership campaign, he commented: "Why not have a very good and well known MP in addition to a good leader? If Caroline does both jobs (even as a job share) I think we look like a party that only has one good person and has no depth of talent."
He is the son of the late producer and director Adrian Malone, who worked on such landmark shows as The Ascent of Man and Cosmos with Carl Sagan.
Parish councillor Martie Warin stood in the 2015 general election at the age of 27 as a candidate in Easington, County Durham, coming sixth is a very safe Labour seat.
He has described himself as an "EcoSocialist", tweeting: "Socialism is the philosophy of caring, Capitalism, the philosophy of the greedy, EcoSocialism is the philosophy of caring for the future!"
Mr Warin wrote in an opinion piece about the impact of the closure of Easington's pit: "People suffered then, and continue to suffer the effects now. The cuts of recent years continue to rub salt into the wounds of these once proud people. Now I know coal mining is certainly not Green, but compassion and justice are."
Salford-born David Williams is the leader of the Green Party group on Oxfordshire County Council.
The former Labour councillor and parliamentary candidate said his "politics were challenged with Labour moving towards Blair's political agenda" and he joined the Greens in 2003.
In his campaign statement he wrote: "I'm standing because we need a debate on the direction of the party post-Brexit. I am a great supporter of Caroline Lucas who is an excellent MP. However, as a democrat I don't believe we should have 'coronations' of leaders."
He has said the Greens must maintain what he describes as a "sensible left of centre stance" and does not rule out working other parties.
"We must not retreat into promoting only a simple ecology message," he argued. "We are a political party not an environmental pressure group."
