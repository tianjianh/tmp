[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Elis-Thomas 'under no constitutional obligation' to stand down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas has said he is "under no constitutional obligation" to stand down as an assembly member.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Plaid Cymru leader left the party on Friday to sit as an independent.
He told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme that people in his Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency were "disappointed and concerned" about his decision.
Others understand his reasoning to put Wales ahead of the party, he said.
Lord Elis-Thomas left the party to sit as an independent over claims Plaid Cymru wasn't "serious" about taking part in the Labour-led Welsh Government.
Plaid Cymru said he had "misled" constituents and it would call for a by-election as soon as possible.
But Lord-Elis Thomas insisted he had a mandate to remain as an AM.
"My mandate is what appeared in my election literature," he told the programme.
'More honest vote'
"All this talk of a by-election is to mislead the electorate. I am under no constitutional obligation.
"I am an independent member formerly elected as Plaid Cymru and that will be my position throughout this assembly."
His former colleague, the Plaid AM Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it would be "just" for Lord Elis-Thomas to allow a by-election.
"I, and others, including people who have been colleagues for many years in the party in Dwyfor Meirionydd, say the just thing for him to do would be to seek that mandate he doesn't really have currently.
"There are people who have worked with him closely feel let down and disappointed and they are saying let's have another vote, a more honest vote this time."
Lord Elis-Thomas said that while some people are distressed, others understand his reasoning to put Wales ahead of the party, "when that party seems to be unable to take responsibility for running its own country."
