The 58-year old fell close to Fanad Head lighthouse at 15:00 BST on Sunday.
Mr McCourt was recovered from the sea and received first aid at the scene.
He was then airlifted to Letterkenny Hospital, but was later pronounced dead.

"We also tasked our coast guard helicopter from Sligo, both Lough Swilly lifeboats and also our fast response coast guard team from Mulroy," he said.
The station officer added: "All the search and rescue units arrived on the scene and our coast guard team from Mulroy managed to recover the man from the water, they administered CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
"He was then transferred to the coast guard helicopter and flown to Letterkenny Hospital."
