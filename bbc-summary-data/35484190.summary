[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daryl Brady, 29, and Darren Smith, 25, admitted slashing Sean Kergan, 27, in the exercise yard on 14 May 2015.
The High Court in Glasgow heard claims of "bad blood" between Brady and Kergan over an alleged earlier attack.
Brady is currently serving a minimum of 16 years, Smith a minimum of 19 years and Kergan a minimum of 13 years.
Brady and Smith were told the new sentence would begin after they had served the minimum part of their life terms.
Jailing them, judge Lord Burns said: "This was a vicious and obviously planned assault with improvised weapons.
"You both have a violent history and are clearly dangerous young men."
Brady was jailed for life in 2008 after stabbing to death father-of-one Brian McWilliams in Glasgow's Govanhill area.
Smith was jailed in 2010 after stabbing George Mathieson through the heart in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire.
Kergan was jailed for the murder of Stephen Daly in Glasgow's Sighthill area in 2005.
