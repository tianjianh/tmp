British 100m record-holder Dina Asher-Smith is up against world 200m champion Dafne Schippers in the women's 100m.
Adam Gemili, who ran a time of 9.97 seconds in 2015, will compete in the men's 100m race again.
The 800m world record-holder David Rudisha of Kenya will step down to the men's 600m, a race he won in 2014.
European 800m champion Lynsey Sharp, who has won three British titles at the Alexander Stadium, will be looking to emulate her 2014 performance when she won with a time of 1:59.14.
Further British interest comes from European 100m hurdles champion Tiffany Porter, who claimed a third successive World Indoor medal in Portland last month by finishing third in the women's 60m hurdles.
