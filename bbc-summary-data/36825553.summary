[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales dual code international Rowland Phillips has been appointed full-time head coach of Wales Women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phillips, 50, previously head coach of Neath, Aironi, London Welsh and Wales Under-18s, succeeds Rhys Edwards.
The former Neath and Wales forward, who also played rugby league for Warrington and Workington, will take up the reins with immediate effect.
"The most pleasing aspect of this role is that we have an abundance of talent in the women's game in Wales," he said.
"There's a huge increase in interest in women's and girls' rugby in Wales, and globally, at the moment, from international rugby to the community game,
"I'm looking forward to being part of that and helping players to fulfil their potential on the field."
Phillips' daughter Carys, who plays as a hooker, has won 26 caps for Wales since making her debut against Ireland in the 2013 Six Nations.
