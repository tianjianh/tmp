Celebrity-inspired selfies are boosting the sales of make-up to a generation of women, a retail analyst says.

Many people are following the lead of stars such as Kim Kardashian and Beyonce by posting self-shot photos on social media.
Face, eye and lip make-up sales have seen double-digit growth as a result, according to the NPD Group.
The analyst said sales of "prestige make-up" hit £390m in the first eight months of the year.
This was up by 14.3% compared with the same period a year earlier.

Britons 'love smartphones and selfies'
The beauty market - including the products on offer - were being driven by individuals such as the self-confessed selfie-obsessed television star, NPD claimed.
"Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and Cara Delevingne have inspired a generation of women to post selfies on social media channels such as Instagram and Facebook," said June Jensen, director of UK beauty at the NPD Group.
"Face, eye and lip make-up is vital to achieving a photo-ready finish and brands have responded with foundation and primers that reference the look people want to achieve using terms like photo-ready, camera-ready and HD.
"It has spurned a new sub-sector and is driving sales."
The analyst's figures suggested the total UK eye make-up sector was valued at £101m in January to August, up 13% on the same period a year earlier. Lip make-up reported sales of £54m, up 16%.
Products for strobing - used to layer highlights on the face to illuminate complexion - saw sales rise by 48.5%, it added.
Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that prices for personal care rose by 0.4% in August compared with a year earlier.
