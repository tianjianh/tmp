[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old completed a four-under-par 68 on Friday, resuming after high winds stopped play on Thursday.
France's Karine Icher, American Cristie Kerr and Germany's Caroline Masson are tied for the lead.
Teenage amateur Seong Eun-jeong hit a hole-in-one to help move her into early contention on day one.
The 17-year-old South Korean carded an impressive four-under 68, and is joined by Hull in a six-way tie for fourth place.
Seong, who last year became the first player to win the US Women's Amateur and US Junior titles in the same season, birdied the first two holes before her hole-in-one at the 182-yard par-three fifth.
Almost half the field were forced to complete their first rounds on Friday, with winds of 25mph and gusts of 35mph blowing when the players were taken off on day one at Mission Hills Country Club in California.
World number 16 Hull hit six birdies and two bogeys in her round. Compatriots Mel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff finished level par and one over respectively.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew shot a three-over 75 and is in danger of missing the cut.
