[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Book Trust are looking for new authors to develop their writing towards publication.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Trust have announced that applications for the New Writers Awards 2017 are now open.
This scheme provides financial support to ten unpublished authors who live in Scotland.
Writers winning the award will receive Â£2,000, mentoring from industry professionals and the opportunity to showcase work to publishers and agents.
The annual awards are managed by the Scottish Book Trust in association with Creative Scotland.
Applications are invited from Scottish-based writers who have not published a novel, short story or poetry works.
Successful applicants will be announced in January 2017.
Caitrin Armstrong, Head of Writer Development at Scottish Book Trust, said:  "Writing is often a lonely pursuit and it can be very difficult for writers to get themselves noticed.
"That is why the New Writers Awards are so important to writers in Scotland - we give them support, encouragement and friendship, along with a bit of financial and physical breathing space to enable them to concentrate on their writing for a while."
