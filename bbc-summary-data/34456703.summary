That was achieved despite annual turnover falling by 4% to £190m.
Coca-Cola HBC NI said that was down to improvements in buying, inventory management and other cost savings.
The firm runs a large bottling plant near Lisburn and is responsible for 95% of Coca-Cola products sold throughout Ireland.
It employs more than 500 people, paying wages of more than £19m.
The company said the soft drinks market "remain highly competitive".
