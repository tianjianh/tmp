A former senior detective is to give evidence to the inquest of the murdered County Tyrone schoolgirl Arlene Arkinson via the internet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eric Anderson, an ex-detective chief superintendent with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), was in charge of the case after her 1994 disappearance.
The 15-year-old from Castlederg went missing after a school disco in County Donegal. Her body has never been found.
The Court Service confirmed Mr Anderson has agreed to give evidence via Skype.
The former RUC detective was asked to attend the inquest into her murder in what the coroner described as a "belt and braces" approach.
The inquest is currently under way after years of delays.
No date has been set yet for Mr Anderson's evidence to be heard.
