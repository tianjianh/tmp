Celtic have signed Costa Rica right-back Cristian Gamboa for an undisclosed fee from Premier League side West Brom.

The 26-year-old has agreed a three-year deal with the Scottish champions.
Gamboa, who has made more than 160 club appearances, has previously played in Denmark and Norway and has 47 caps for his country.
"When my agent called me to tell me about Celtic I said to him, 'Do everything because I really want to go'," said Gamboa.
"It doesn't matter if they play Champions League or not - it's still a big club.
"So for me the fact they have qualified [for the group stage] is like a double bonus - I get to play for this club and to play in the Champions League."
The full-back played all five matches as Costa Rica reached the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals in Brazil and also featured in this year's Copa America.
However, he made fewer than 20 appearances in his two years at the Hawthorns.
"I always try to keep myself in shape by doing extra work," he added. "I wasn't playing at West Brom but I was playing in all the national team games.
"So right now I am missing some match fitness but I will come here and do my best and if you give me the chance I'll be ready."
