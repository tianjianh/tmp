Tapuai, 27, was due to stay with the Perth-based Super Rugby outfit for another year, but Western Force agreed to release him from his contract.
Welshman Allinson, 28, joined London Irish from Cardiff Blues in 2010.
"We're a bit light at scrum-half due to the autumn internationals and injury," director of rugby Todd Blackadder said.
London Irish director of rugby Nick Kennedy added: "This is a great opportunity for Darren to get some game time in the Premiership, with Bath's injury situation in that position."
Discussing former Brisbane City and Queensland Reds player Tapuai, Bath boss Blackadder continued: "He's a really good all-rounder, which will be a great boost for us.
"His experience will bring a new way of looking at things, and will really help develop our young midfield players. "
Western Force head coach Dave Wessels told their website: "Bath made a fantastic offer to Ben. That provided an opportunity to free up some money in the salary cap for us to explore a few other options."
