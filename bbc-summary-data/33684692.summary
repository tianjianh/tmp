Barrow has long suffered shin problems and was advised not to compete in the competition in Kazan, Russia five weeks ago by medical experts.
But she was determined not to miss the event as a top-three finish would have earned Britain a place at Rio 2016.
"My shins were so sore, but I tried my best," Barrow, 23, told BBC Sport.
The former European champion was barely able to train after the diagnosis in the build-up.
However, after qualifying for the synchronised 10m platform final with the fourth-highest score, there were hopes the British pair could secure their first world medal together.
It was not to be though, with China's defending champions Ruolin Chen and Liu Huixia winning gold and Canada and North Korea both impressing to secure the silver and bronze medals respectively.
"We're a bit gutted about the result as we know we can be up there," said Barrow.
"The preparations weren't ideal, but hopefully with some rest I can come back strong next year and get that Olympic place."
Barrow and Couch have another chance to qualify Britain for the Games in Brazil in the synchronised 10m event at the Rio World Cup competition in early 2016.
Before that, they both return for the individual 10m platform competition, which begins on Wednesday.
If they can secure top-12 finishes they will seal Britain berths in the event for Rio 2016.
"It's so disappointing as we couldn't work any harder, but I've just got to put that behind me and smash it even more," Couch told BBC Sport.
