Chester 3-0 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester stretched their unbeaten run to five games as they comfortably beat bottom club North Ferriby United to climb four places in the National League table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors went close before the break when right back Sam Topliss twice had close-range shots blocked in quick succession.
But Chester should already have been ahead when James Alabi shot wide, before Elliott Durrell was just off target from long range.
And, within nine minutes of the restart, Jon McCarthy's side led 2-0.
Kane Richards bundled in at the near post on 52 minutes after the Yorkshire side had been opened up by a superb piece of left-wing trickery by Craig Mahon.
Just two minutes later, Alabi then fired home from the penalty spot after himself being brought down by keeper Rory Watson.
Alabi was then sent clear by Ryan Lloyd to blast home City's third a minute from the end.
