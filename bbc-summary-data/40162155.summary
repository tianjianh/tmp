Seven people were killed and 48 injured in Saturday's incident.
The attackers were shot dead by police after driving into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in Borough Market.
The silent tribute took place across the country at 11:00 BST.
Prime Minister Theresa May called it "an attack on the free world" as the victims included a "number of nationalities".
The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
All 12 people arrested on Sunday after the attack have now been released without charge.
Police forces and fire services took part in the silence, along with Arriva Trains Wales, council and courts staff.
Speaking ahead of the silence, Rhondda Cynon Taf council mayor Margaret Tegg said: "Once again the whole nation is in a state of shock following the horrific attacks in London at the weekend, and our sympathy and thoughts are with everyone affected."
Observing the silence at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: "This morning, at this time, throughout the country, millions of lives are being paused in memory of those who lost their lives and for all the others injured or affected as a result of the tragic events in London on Saturday night."
Conwy council's chairman Brian Cossey said: "It's something that is really touching every member of the population of Britain.
"Our hearts go out to those who were injured, to the families of those who died, and to the people who witnessed this who weren't injured themselves. The tragedy will live with them forever."
