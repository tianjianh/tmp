A missing python has prompted a police search in north Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Wales Police officers are on the lookout for the 4ft (1.2m) reptile after it slithered out of its owner's home in Gwersyllt, Wrexham.
The green and black royal python has not been seen since 15:00 BST on Tuesday.
Royal pythons are not venomous and the police said it is likely it will try to avoid people.
