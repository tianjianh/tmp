Lewis Hamilton v Nico Rosberg: Team orders an option - Wolff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff says he could impose team orders to stop Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg from clashing again.

The pair collided on the last lap of the Austrian Grand Prix, with Hamilton winning and Rosberg slipping to fourth.
Wolff said "one option is to freeze the order at a certain point" but said such a move would be "unpopular".
"It makes we want to puke myself but if racing is not possible without contact that is a consequence," he added.
Rosberg still leads the 21-race championship after Sunday's grand prix, but his advantage over Hamilton is now just 11 points.
The 10th race of the season takes place at Silverstone this weekend, when Hamilton will be racing in front of his own fans at the British Grand Prix.
Both Rosberg and Hamilton criticised each other after Sunday's incident, but race stewards blamed the German and added 10 seconds to his race time.
"They gave me the blame, which sucks," said Rosberg. "I'm of a different opinion, but that doesn't help."
Wolff initially described the collision as "brainless", without indicating which driver he felt was at fault.

It was the second time Hamilton and Rosberg had hit each other in the past five races. They crashed out of the Spanish Grand Prix in May on the first lap.
"In Barcelona, I was much more at ease because we had 30 races without a collision," said Wolff.
"In my naive thinking, I said to myself: 'OK, they have learned the lesson and they saw the consequences and it is not going to happen again.'
"Here we go, it happens again, so the only consequence is to look at all the options on the table."
Most pundits and observers blamed Rosberg for the latest incident, but Wolff refused to say which driver was most at fault.
"I don't want to attribute any blame because every time you watch the video and look at onboard there is new information," he said.
"You can't say who is more to blame than the other. I have an opinion. I am not going to express it. But it needs to be avoided.
"I am fed up with trying to analyse it. I just don't want any contact."
Wolff said he would discuss the incident with the rest of the team management but said it would have no bearing on his contract negotiations with Rosberg.
The 31-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and both he and Mercedes have said they want and expect to continue together.
