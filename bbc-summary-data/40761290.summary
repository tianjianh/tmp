[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 2-2 Ebbsfleet United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ebbsfleet grabbed a point on their return to the National League as they drew 2-2 in an entertaining match at Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guiseley hit the front spectacularly when Kevan Hurst swung in a corner to the edge of the box and John Rooney volleyed in past a stunned Nathan Ashmore.
Ebbsfleet staged a dramatic second-half turnaround in the space of three minutes. Full-back Luke Coulson cut back for Myles Weston to place into the net and, shortly after, Darren McQueen beat the offside trap to silence the home fans.
But Lions debutant Reece Thompson converted a late chance at the third time of asking, after the post and goalkeeper had denied him, to level the scores again.
