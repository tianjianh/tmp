Sami Hyypia: Ex-Liverpool player appointed FC Zurich coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Liverpool and Finland defender Sami Hyypia has been appointed as the new coach of Swiss side FC Zurich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hyypia, 41, has signed a two-year contract having been out of work since he quit as Brighton boss in December 2014 after just six wins in 26 games.
He takes over from Urs Meier, who was sacked on 3 August shortly after a 3-2 home defeat by city rivals Grasshopper.
Hyypia also had a spell in charge of German club Bayer Leverkusen but was sacked following a poor run of results.
Hyypia, who won 105 caps for Finland, was a Champions League winner at Liverpool in 2005, and was also part of the team who secured a historic FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup treble in 2001.
He made 464 appearances in a decade at Anfield, and won seven player of the year awards in his homeland between 1999 and 2008.
