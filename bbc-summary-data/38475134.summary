Hours after Wayne celebrated his 249th United goal in their 4-0 FA Cup win over Reading, John fired home Wrexham's opening goal after the break.
Fabio Saraiva levelled for the visitors with a low-level header four minutes later but Wrexham came back to win it.
Robbie Evans struck on the hour to seal three points for the hosts.
Wrexham climbed a place to 15th while Woking went down a spot to third from bottom as their battle against relegation suffered another blow.
Winning manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "We made a few changes, freshened things up this week and we definitely deserved the three points today.
"I didn't ask for a performance before the game. I just said to them today it was ultimately about three points.
"If the performance comes on top of it, that's a bonus."
