A mental health trust criticised for taking a year to fix a leaky roof that caused a sewage smell in a bedroom has made "significant improvements".

Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust was rated as "requires improvement" by the Care Quality Commission in January.
The watchdog raised concerns about the quality of risk assessments, staff training and long waiting lists for some services.
Now the trust has been rated "good" after a follow-up inspection.
It was praised for better risk management, having more ward activities and removing the sewage smell at the Whiteleaf Centre in Aylesbury.
Dr Paul Lelliott, deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said: "We found that generally the trust had taken action to identify and manage ligature points that could endanger people at risk of suicide.
"Patients and carers told us they felt highly involved.  Although the trust were trying to mitigate the issue, staffing levels remain an area of concern and we still require improvement in safety.
"However we have found all services to be effective, caring and well led. I anticipate that the trust will continue to work on those areas which require further improvement."
A trust spokesman said the sewage smell had been a "teething problem" with a new centre.
The trust provides health and social care to people in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes, Berkshire, Swindon, Wiltshire, Bath and North East Somerset.
