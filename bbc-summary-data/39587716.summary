Selby, 33, lifted the trophy for the second time last year with victory over China's Ding Junhui, who comes up against fellow countryman Zhou Yuelong.
Five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan faces Gary Wilson, world number two Judd Trump plays Rory McLeod and Shaun Murphy meets 17-year-old Yan Bingtao.
Selby begins his campaign on Saturday, 15 April at 10:00 BST.
O'Brien came through qualifying with a final-frame win over David Gilbert, which included the longest frame played in professional snooker history - two hours, three minutes and 41 seconds.
"It was dragging on with so much safety being played," O'Brien, 45, told BBC Sport. "We were on the yellow for about half an hour and there were not many chances to pot it.
"There was so much at stake and we were fearful of making a mistake.
"It is a great occasion to play the defending champion on the opening morning. I need to rest up and relax until then and get some practice in."
World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn described 2005 champion Murphy's tie against China's Yan as his "pick of the opening round".
Yan - who won the snooker World Cup with partner Zhou in 2015 - will become the first player born in the 2000s to compete at the Crucible, which is hosting the tournament for the 40th year.
Meanwhile, Anthony McGill faces Stephen Maguire in an all-Scottish tie and 2010 champion Neil Robertson plays Thailand's Noppon Saengkham, who at 72 is the lowest ranked player in the tournament.
Ryan Day, the only Welshman in the draw, is up against another Chinese player in Xiao Guodong.
