Molly-Mae Wotherspoon death: Pregnancy halts mother's sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sentencing of a mother whose dangerous dog mauled her six-month old baby to death has been adjourned - because she is pregnant and too unwell to attend court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Molly-Mae Wotherspoon was attacked by an American pit bull in October 2014 at a house in Daventry, Northamptonshire.
Mother Claire Riley, 23, and grandmother Susan Aucott, 55, both admitted being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog.
They will now be sentenced in August.
Aucott, of Alfred Street, Northampton, was looking after her granddaughter at Riley's former home in Morning Star Road when the dog, called Bruiser, attacked her.
Molly-Mae suffered severe blood loss from head wounds. The dog was killed at the scene.

Last month Aucott admitted being in control of the dog, a banned breed, resulting in the death of the baby.
Riley had initially denied the charge but changed her plea on the first day of her trial.
Both were due to be sentenced earlier at Northampton Crown Court. However, neither attended because of Riley's health issues.
The judge, Mrs Justice Carr, agreed to an adjournment based on medical information provided to the court.
However, she described it as "woefully inadequate", adding: "I am no medical expert but I'm not sure the delay is in anyone's interests, in any point of view.
"The sentencing process is going to happen and I am not going to delay it until after the birth. She [Riley] has to be sentenced. The sooner that happens the better."
Riley, of Merrydale Square, Northampton, is now expected to be sentenced along with Aucott on 26 August.
