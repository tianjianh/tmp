Posting on Instagram, the X Factor judge denied her husband had hit her. She wrote: "My hubby would never lay a hand on me".
Earlier this month the 39-year-old was forced to miss the Saturday show of the X Factor final because she was in hospital suffering a mystery illness.
Tulisa stood in for Mel, mentoring her act Andrea Faustini who bowed out on the Saturday - coming third.
Mel B returned to the X Factor stage the following evening. However, several viewers took to social media with concerns the judge had bruising to her face and an absent wedding ring.
Stephen Belafonte denied any involvement in his wife of seven years missing the show.
He also described suggestions he was responsible for the alleged bruising as "disgusting and untrue".
It's the first time Mel has responded to claims her husband hit her.
Speaking to Newsbeat, X Factor winner Ben Haenow said he didn't see any bruises when Mel returned to X Factor: "I didn't see anything of that kind. I mean she looked fine when she was there."
Mel has one daughter with Stephen, and two daughters from previous relationships.
