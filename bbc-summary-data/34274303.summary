The boy, from KidStuff nursery in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, was taken on an outing to the zoo last week.
The Metropolitan Police said it received a report of a missing child shortly before 15:00 BST on Wednesday.
While at the zoo he became separated from his carer but was reunited with his mother at 16:20 BST the same day, police said.
KidStuff said the matter was being handled by lawyers.
A staff member added: "Until all investigations have been completed we are not at liberty to issue any statement at this time."
London Zoo said a visitor had alerted staff to an unaccompanied child in its grounds.
A spokeswoman said: "Staff accompanied the child to the meeting point for lost children, where they then followed procedures to reunite them with their family."
