Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong says the late goals conceded in recent games will not concern them ahead of Wednesday's game with Malmo.

Ronny Deila's men face the Swedish champions in the Champions League play-off round.
However, the Parkhead side have lost late goals in recent games against Kilmarnock and Inverness CT.
"I think that was just a bit of complacency after being 4-0 up," Armstrong told BBC Scotland.
Armstrong played a starring role as Celtic defeated Inverness 4-2 to continue their unbeaten start to the defence of the title, netting twice.
And Armstrong, who joined Celtic in January's transfer window, says all focus now is on defeating Malmo and making the group stage of the Champions League.
"A dream come true," he said. "Everyone wants to play in the group stages and play against the best.
"You can only think of the excitement of being drawn against these huge, massive teams that you've watched when you've been growing up, so we'll keep that in the back of our minds for now and just focus on our preparations and getting through the tie."
Celtic's squad was bolstered on Friday by the signing of Scott Allan from Hibernian despite interest from Old Firm rivals Rangers.
"It's nice to have him back, I played a couple of years with him at Dundee United," said Armstrong. "I know his talents and it's nice to have another friend on board.
"It's a club like Celtic and that's what you would expect - good quality players coming in all the time and that's just the way of life here. It's healthy for the team and it'll always bring the best out of different players."
