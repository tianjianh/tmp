[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trewin had untreatable cancer, with which he had been diagnosed in October.
But he had been determined to continue working and was involved with the judges for this year's title winner - the UK's top book accolade.
Trewin devoted his life to literature and had had several high-profile roles within the industry, including literary editor of the Times.
He also had an illustrious career at publishers Weidenfeld & Nicolson, rising up to become editor-in-chief until his retirement in 2006.
His long and respected experience within the literary world led to his having many leading authors as friends.
He was also an author himself and wrote the biography of the late politician Alan Clark.
His work for the Man Booker Prize was well-established and he had held a number of roles, including chairman of the panel of judges in 1974.
Jonathan Taylor, chairman of the Man Booker Prize foundation trustees said Trewin would be "sadly missed".
"His calm, courteous and avuncular demeanour masked a sharp intelligence, shrewd diplomatic skills, a great sense of humour and huge knowledge of and affection for books and book people.
"He helped guide the Man Booker Prize through evolution and development while ensuring stability, continuity and, most important, an effective, efficient, independent  judging process."
Trewin's death follows that of Martyn Goff, the previous Booker Prize administrator, who died on 25 March at the age of 91.
Trewin leaves a wife and two grown-up children.
