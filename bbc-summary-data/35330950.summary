"I'm a very proud manager today. I thought we were excellent today from start to finish. I thought we defended well, at times we were a little bit deep but we tried to play.
"We have to have a squad here that wants to work hard, that wants to graft, that has a structure, that wants to do things right. If we get that then we can climb the league and start to do things.
"We have to get a bit more know-how, a bit more fluency in our play and once we do that we will be heading in the right direction."
