The gongs included gold in the Station of the Year category.
The station won six Gold, three Silver and three Bronze awards at the prestigious event, which took place on Friday night in Kilkenny.
BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle secured 20 nominations.
The nominations spanned the full range of output, including speech, news and current affairs, specialist music, comedy and Irish Language.
Fergus Keeling, Head of Radio for BBC Northern Ireland said "We are passionate about providing our audiences with programmes that reflect their lives and their interests and we work hard daily to deliver fresh, engaging and informative content."
He added "This has been an incredible year for BBC Radio Ulster/Foyle as we remain the most listened to station in Northern Ireland, but it is also a measure of our success that our efforts have been recognised by our peers in this way, at the PPI Awards.
"I'm enormously proud of the presenters and teams for their success."
The PPI Awards ceremony was presented by Dermot Whelan to a packed room with many of Ireland's well known radio presenters, producers, programme staff and radio station heads.
A total of 90 judges this year took part, more than ever before and all of them drawn from the radio industry, north, south and across the water. They are required to shortlist from 700 entries across 37 categories.
BBC presenters the late Sir Terry Wogan and Paddy O'Flaherty were remembered for their work in the 'Lest We Forget' section of the awards.
