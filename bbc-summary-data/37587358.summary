Arran Coen, 25, sustained serious head injuries when his Ford Focus car hit the central reservation, left the road and hit a tree last November.
An inquest at Swansea Coroner's Court heard that Mr Coen died from a brain injury.
A conclusion of death as a result of a road traffic collision was recorded.
Consultant pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto told the inquest that Mr Coen, from Swansea, had been over the drink-drive limit at the time of the crash.
He had 102 milligrams of alcohol in his blood at the time of the accident. The legal drink-drive limit is 80.
But he added: "The dumbbell found in the car may have contributed to his injury."
Assistant coroner Paul Bennett said: "The accident was not witnessed. The vehicle, a blue Ford Focus was extensively damaged and the driver was strapped in the driver's seat by his seatbelt.
"It was obvious however he had suffered severe head injuries.
"There was a heavy dumbbell in the vehicle with may have been contributory towards the head injury."
Speaking after his death, Mr Coen's mother Angela Coen said he had qualified to be a personal trainer the day before he died.
"He was such a lovable character - everybody from the length and breadth of the country - everyone loved him," she said.
