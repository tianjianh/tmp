England v Pakistan: Ben Stokes & Mark Wood back for ODI series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England have recalled Durham's Ben Stokes and Mark Wood after injury for the forthcoming five-match one-day international series with Pakistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All-rounder Stokes, 25, has recovered from the calf injury he suffered in the second Test against Pakistan.
Wood is fully fit again following ankle trouble, while Jos Buttler and skipper Eoin Morgan have also overcome injury.
James Vince is omitted after a modest Test series, but uncapped Hampshire team-mate Liam Dawson is included.
Stokes has been hampered by injuries this summer, missing the remainder of the Sri Lanka series with a knee injury sustained in the first Test in May.
Fast bowler Wood, 26, has not played for England since needing two operations on an ankle problem suffered in last winter's series against Pakistan in the UAE.
Buttler, 25, has been sidelined since fracturing his thumb playing for Lancashire at Worcester on 8 July, while captain Morgan chipped a bone in his little finger in a One-Day Cup match at Taunton on 26 July.
Vince, who made 51 against Sri Lanka in an ODI in July, scored 158 runs in the four-Test series with Pakistan at an average of 22, with a top score of 42.
Nottinghamshire opener Alex Hales, who scored fewer runs and averaged only 18 against Pakistan, retains his place.
Off-spinner Dawson, 26, the only player uncapped in the squad, made an impressive international debut with 3-27 in the T20 against Sri Lanka at his home county ground, the Ageas Bowl, in July.
The ODI series begins at the same venue on 24 August.
The Test series was drawn 2-2 after Pakistan won the final match at The Oval by 10 wickets.
England ODI squad: E Morgan (capt) (Middlesex), M Ali (Worcestershire), J Bairstow (Yorkshire), J Buttler (Lancashire), L Dawson (Hampshire), C Jordan (Sussex), A Hales (Nottinghamshire), L Plunkett (Yorkshire), A Rashid (Yorkshire), J Root (Yorkshire), J Roy (Surrey), B Stokes (Durham), D Willey (Yorkshire), C Woakes (Warwickshire), M Wood (Durham).
