Daniel Pinillos: Freedman considers cover for Forest defender

Nottingham Forest are considering cover for defender Daniel Pinillos after a potentially season-ending injury, says boss Dougie Freedman.

Pinillos, 23, ruptured knee ligaments in Forest's 2-1 home win against MK Dons last weekend and could miss the rest of the campaign.
Freedman had planned to bolster other areas before the loss of Pinillos.
"It does certainly tip the balance in what I was going to do in January," Freedman told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"For every position we've always got things that we feel can help us at the right price and the right age, and there are a couple of players at left-back that I always knew would be available.
"But it certainly wasn't my thinking."
Spanish defender Pinillos has made 19 Championship starts since arriving at Forest in July as a free agent following his release by Cordoba.
The options available for Forest in signing a player are limited by the terms of the Football League transfer embargo, which remains in place.
They can register players, but cannot pay transfer or loan fees, only covering wages as long as there are 24 or fewer professional players on their books.
"We can't just go out there, spend and get a replacement," Freedman said.
"Money-wise you can't do it, you either have to pick up someone who's in another manager's bad-books and put your arm round them or coach someone in your team or your squad to fill in there."
