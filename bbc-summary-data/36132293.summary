Security will be boosted at water stations for future London Marathons after video emerged of water bottles being "stolen" during the race.

The footage, released on social media, shows people filling large bags with crates of water from a Deptford water station, as competitors run past.
Event director Hugh Brasher said organisers "deplore the scenes".
"We will be investigating the matter further, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police", he added.
The footage is believed to have been shot by a volunteer who worked on the station, who can be heard sarcastically saying that it is "obviously hard times in Deptford".
A spokesperson for Nestle Waters, who supply Buxton water used in the event, said the drinks are meant "for the benefit of runners".
London Marathon policy is for any spare water not drunk by competitors to be collected and used at other events.
Mr Brasher said it was "very disappointing to see water being stolen in this way".
He said volunteers are told "not to get into altercations if this kind of thing happens" and "in future, we will be providing... additional security measures on race day,"
It is understood the footage was taken when most runners had passed through Deptford, which is eight miles into the 26.2 mile course.
There has been no complaints from runners about a lack of water being available during the race.
The Met said no allegations of theft had been made over the water.
