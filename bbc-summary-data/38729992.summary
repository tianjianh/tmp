Ellington, 31, and fellow sprinter Nigel Levine, 27, both sustained a suspected broken pelvis with Ellington also suffering a facial fracture and a broken leg in two places.
"Out of surgery, all went well," Ellington tweeted on Wednesday.
"Feel like I have done 200 rounds with Tyson and 50 marathons."
Both athletes were hit by a car on 17 January and will miss the 2017 season, which includes the World Championships in London in August.
A British Athletics statement read: "James Ellington and Nigel Levine have safely returned to the UK via air ambulance, following a road accident in Tenerife last week.
"Both athletes have been admitted to hospitals in London where they are receiving specialist medical treatment for their injuries, under the supervision of the British Athletics' medical team.
"Both James and Nigel have been overwhelmed by the support they have received since the accident last week."
The pair had been in Tenerife as part of a British Athletics group taking part in a warm-weather training camp when the accident happened.
Any pelvic injuries to sprinters are career-threatening and both athletes will need significant rehabilitation.
Ellington is a 100m and 200m specialist and a two-time Olympian who was part of the gold medal-winning 4x100m relay teams at the 2014 and 2016 European Championships.
Levine is a 400m runner who was born in Trinidad and raised in Northamptonshire.
He won a European outdoor relay gold in 2014 and an indoor relay gold in 2013.
