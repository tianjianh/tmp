[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 2-3 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ollie Norburn grabbed a late winner as Macclesfield overcame Chester 3-2 at the Deva Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Alabi netted for the Blues early on after taking Elliott Durrell's cross with a deft touch before turning and rifling home.
John Askey's men equalised against the run of play when right-back Andy Halls made a forward run and played a neat one-two before placing past Chester goalkeeper Alex Lynch.
Jack Mackreth's superb cross then allowed Anthony Dudley to put Macc ahead with a firm header.
Alabi hit the post in the second half, but Kane Richards did eventually stab Chester level from another Durrell ball in.
Norburn, however, took on Rhys Browne's ball and struck in low from outside the area with five minutes remaining.
