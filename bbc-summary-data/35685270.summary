Adam Scott claimed a one-shot victory at the Honda Classic in Florida to end a title drought of nearly two years.

With a revised putting technique, the Australian held off Sergio Garcia with a level-par 70 to win on nine under.
Former Masters champion Scott has been forced to return to a conventional short putter following a ban on anchoring putters to the chin or chest.
"I have made some nice progress in all areas, especially noticeably on the greens," said the 35-year-old.
The last time Scott won a tournament with a short putter was more than five years ago at the Singapore Open.
He then switched to a broomstick at the 2011 Match Play Championship and went on to win seven titles with an anchored putter, including his first major at the 2013 Masters.
Scott began the final round by sinking a 15-foot putt to birdie the par-four first and then buried a 10-footer at the fifth to move two strokes clear.
Garcia, 36, who had been bidding for a ninth PGA Tour title, had to settle for second place after bogeying the 16th and 17th holes, before rebounding with a birdie at the last for a 71.
