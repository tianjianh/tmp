Electronic tag removed from terror suspect who 'feared it was bomb'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An electronic tag is to be removed from a terror suspect because he was scared it contained a bomb.

The man, a 39-year-old imam known as DD, is one of two suspects in the UK who are subject to a TPim - a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure.
The order requires the Somalian refugee to wear a monitoring tag, but the High Court ruled it must be removed due to a deterioration in his mental health.
The Home Office said it was "disappointed", but would not appeal.
The court heard that DD, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is suspected of radicalising young people and making a "powerful contribution" to an Islamic terror group's media campaign.
Lawyers for Home Secretary Theresa May told the court there was evidence the man had provided important support for Somali militant group al-Shabaab for many years.
His role included recruiting "young and vulnerable individuals from Europe", they said.
But Mr Justice Collins ruled that requiring the man to continue wearing the ankle tag - slightly larger than a sports watch - now breached his human rights because his mental illness and delusional thoughts had grown worse.
There was medical evidence that DD had psychotic and unusual beliefs that the tag was there to punish him, said the judge.
He believed it contained a camera and a bomb, and that voices and noises were emanating from it, the court heard.
Two doctors had accepted that DD was not exaggerating his symptoms. There was no doubt that the tag might produce a further deterioration and result in serious self-harm, said the judge.
Requiring him to continue wearing the tag was a breach of article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment, he said.
"Since the appellant has the delusion that there is a bomb in his tag which will be detonated so that MI5 can kill him if a judge allows his appeal, great care should be taken with the removal of the tag," Mr Justice Collins warned.
"It may be considered sensible not to inform him of my decision that the tag must go until on some pretext the tag has been removed."
But the judge refused to lift the TPim itself, saying the decision to maintain it was not legally flawed.
A Home Office spokesperson said: "We are disappointed with the verdict of the court that certain restrictions to which the individual was subject should be removed.
"But the court found there was sufficient evidence to support the national security case to impose and keep in place a TPim notice and restrictions on this individual's activities to protect the public remain in place."
