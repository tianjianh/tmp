Shirley and John Hanson have cared for up to five children at a time while running their farm in Leominster, Herefordshire, with their two sons.
Mrs Hanson, 69 and her 73-year-old husband, are showing no signs of slowing down.
"I love my job," said Mrs Hanson. "I want to keep going as long as I'm able to. Since 1976 I've never, ever not had children."

Mrs Hanson said: "I have fostered for so long it's a way of life for us.
"I feel I have been very fortunate, so this has come as a real surprise.
"I'm always here on the farm so the children feel secure and I'm here if I'm needed to turn cattle."
She said some of their foster placements now had children and grandchildren of their own and still visited.
