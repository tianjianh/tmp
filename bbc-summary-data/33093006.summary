Chartoff's daughters confirmed he died at home in Santa Monica surrounded by his family. He had pancreatic cancer.
"He was an amazing father and person," said Julie Chartoff, adding: "There are no words."
He won the best picture Oscar for the first Rocky film in 1977, which was written by its star Sylvester Stallone.
The producer shared the Academy Award - one of three for the 1976 film - with partner Irwin Winkler.
They both went on to produce all seven Rocky movies, including the forthcoming film Creed, which is currently in post-production.
Chartoff was also nominated for an Oscar in 1981 for Raging Bull, Martin Scorsese's darker take on the sport, which starred Robert De Niro as boxer Jake La Motta.
He produced films into his late 70s and early 80s, including 2014's The Gambler with Mark Wahlberg and 2013's Enders Game with Harrison Ford.
He also worked on Jane Fonda's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and 1983 film The Right Stuff, which won four Oscars.
Chartoff and Winkler - who worked together until 1985 - convinced United Artists to make Rocky for less than $1 million (Â£646,000), after Stallone insisted on playing the lead, according to Variety.
The film went on to earn 10 Oscar nominations and take more than $200m (Â£129m).
Chartoff is survived by third wife Jenny Weyman and his five children.
