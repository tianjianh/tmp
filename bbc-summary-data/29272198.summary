"Let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short. Let us dwell on the distance we have travelled and have confidence that the movement will take this nation forward as one nation."
"The people of Scotland have spoken. It is a clear result. They have kept our country of four nations together. Like millions of other people, I am delighted."
"We've taken on the argument and we've won. The silent have spoken."
"I'm absolutely delighted the Scottish people have taken this momentous decision to safeguard our family of nations for future generations."
"We have won the referendum but the responsibility is on all of us to take forward more powers for the Scottish parliament."
"I am indicating a willingness to work with whoever to get Scotland more powers."
"Our UK is stronger today than it was yesterday."
"The status quo has been thoroughly smashed."
"Business as usual, with strong roots in Scotland."
"We have no plans to move any part of our business out of Scotland."
"Following the result, it is business as usual for all our customers across UK and RBS."
"Now, together, let's get the Tories out."
"The challenge now is for those who've won the referendum to deliver on the promises that they made to the people of Scotland."
"Bosses, bankers, billionaires and millionaires unite with Labour MPs, Tories, UKIP and the UK establishment to celebrate Project Fear."
"Scotland has voted for unity. Let's move forward together to achieve change for Scotland within the UK."
"Thanks to everyone in the Yes movement for building such a great campaign. All that new energy will give Scotland a fantastic future."
"This outcome is good for the united, open and stronger Europe that the European Commission stands for."
"Every effort must be made to heal the rifts from the past few months. Scotland must unite and work within the wider UK to take full advantage of the opportunities."
