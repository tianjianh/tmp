[SN]TITLE[SN]

Gary Ironside and Ryan Jendrycha's terrified victim lay crying "why me?" as the pair delivered a sustained assault on his head and body.
The court heard that the attack in Dundee on Alexander Lees - who neither knew - was completely unprovoked.
Mr Lees had to move out of his home following the attack.
Dundee Sheriff Court had been told that the pair downed an "industrial amount" of alcohol before forcing their way into Mr Lees' home in Hindmarsh Avenue at midday on Sunday 27 July last year.
Jendrycha, 28, knocked the former police officer to the floor and climbed on top of him before repeatedly punching him on the head for several minutes.
When he had finished, Ironside, 19, continued the attack, repeatedly kicking Mr Lees on the back and head leaving him with a "significant" head injury.
The pair then left, with Ironside attacking a pedestrian outside for no reason.
Ironside claimed in a pre-sentencing report that he thought he had gone to the house to "sort out a sex offender" - a completely baseless allegation.
Jendrycha claimed he was trying to sort out visiting rights to his child from a previous relationship.
Ironside and Jendrycha, both from Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge of assaulting Mr Lees to his severe injury.
Ironside further admitted a charge of assaulting Alan Gilmartin to his injury.
Sheriff Alistair Brown told the pair: "The physical effects [on Mr Lee] were short-lived but the emotional effects were such that he could no longer live in his home and had to be moved.
"The proper sentence is six years imprisonment - though I am required to reduce that by 25% to reflect your early pleas."
