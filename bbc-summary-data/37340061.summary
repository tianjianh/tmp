[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows an incident outside the County Bar on the High Street in Peebles at about 01:40 on Sunday.
A 49-year-old man challenged three other men about their behaviour towards his wife while they were in the bar, at which point the group attacked him.
He was injured and taken to Borders General Hospital where he continues to receive treatment for his injuries.
Police said they were following a positive line of inquiry, but were keen to speak with anyone who could assist with their inquiries.
Det Con Callum Peoples said: "The victim has sustained a number of painful injuries to his face during the attack, which we believe was witnessed by a number of people.
"We are actively pursuing various lines of inquiry to trace those responsible and anyone with information relevant to this ongoing investigation is asked to contact police immediately."
