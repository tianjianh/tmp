Hertfordshire Police say standstill reached in Ford Mustang theft case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police say they have reached the end of the road in their search for a classic car thought to have been stolen during the last 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The owner of the 1977 Ford Mustang died in August and when his daughter checked his garage in Welwyn Garden City, she found that the car had disappeared.
The family last recall seeing the car, registration VTM 648S, in 1995.
Hertfordshire Police said: "We have exhausted all lines of inquiry and are waiting for any new information."
It is understood the reason the car's disappearance went unnoticed for two decades is the owner was not well enough to visit the garage it was housed in.
The force said it was convinced the car was not sold by the owner, as his daughter said she would have been informed, and all of the documentation is still in her late father's house.
Police appealed for information about the missing Mustang six months ago but have yet to receive any leads in the case.
