Stormont budget: Finance committee grants bill accelerated passage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stormont's finance committee has agreed to allow Finance Minister Arlene Foster to rush her new budget bill through the assembly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee unanimously agreed to grant what is known as accelerated passage to the bill, which would allow it to become law by the end of July.
Earlier, the minister told committee members there was no other option.
And she dismissed critics who have called the bill a 'fantasy budget'.
It has been drawn up as if welfare reform had been agreed by the parties.
The minister told the committee that if she had not come forward with the bill "we could be in a very, very serious situation."
"We're in a serious situation as it stands, " she said.
"The only way to go forward with this is to go forward with this budget and I know that there has been derogatory remarks in the media about fantasy budgets and all of this sort of thing.
"Let me assure you, I am not delusional.
"I know exactly what I am doing in relation to this issue and I was very clear in the assembly that it is predicated on welfare reform being implemented.
"Its the only basis on which this budget can go forward."
Ms Foster brought forward the bill in an attempt to overcome the impasse caused by Sinn Féin's withdrawal of support for the Stormont House Agreement because of its opposition to welfare reform.
But a Sinn Féin MLA told her the obstacles could be overcome.
Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said he is "confident we will resolve the difficulties over the next few weeks. I base that on no information, on no insider information".
"I know you are the eternal optimist," Mrs Foster replied, "and I hope that your optimism does come to fruition".
During an hour-long hearing, the minister said Northern Ireland is facing a very critical time if the Stormont House Agreement is not implemented.
She said she had listened to all of her Executive colleagues talk about the dramatic effect a lack of agreement would have on services.
The minister is due to meet the Treasury minister Greg Hands on Wednesday to discuss Stormont's budget problems.
