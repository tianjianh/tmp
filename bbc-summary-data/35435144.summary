Train disruption after signal failure at Yoker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All low-level trains out of Glasgow Central are subject to delays and cancellations after a signal failure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The problem, which was traced to Yoker, was not believed to be weather-related.
ScotRail said the disruption would continue until the end of service on Thursday and urged people to make alternative arrangements.
Affected lines were Delmellington to Airdrie/Bathgate/Cumbernauld, and Rutherglen to Partick/Milngavie in both directions.
