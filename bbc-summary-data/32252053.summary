Phillip Shortman, 27, from Abersychan, Pontypool, had previously admitted 10 counts of fraud at Newport Crown Court.
He was caught after failing to deliver a car part to a police officer who ordered it from him online.
Sentencing him, Judge John Jenkins QC said he was a "inveterate fraudster who simply will not stop".
Shortman must also pay £2,065 compensation to his 10 victims and £100 costs.
The court heard he had 17 previous convictions for 77 offences, many related to the online market place.
The judge said eight of his most recent offences - committed on eBay and a car parts website between May and December 2013 - were done while on bail and on licence.
He added: "Terms of imprisonment have not deterred you, you have continued to act with deceit and manipulation."
On Wednesday, Shortman admitted using his five-year-old son's details to sell a bogus Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile phone.
He arranged for £480 to be transferred into his wife's account, but failed to deliver the phone.
He then attempted the same con again, being paid £440 for the same phone.
The court was told he then "attached" himself to a website selling Suzuki Jeep parts, calling himself Yuppy Bear.
The Essex police officer who failed to receive the parts he ordered from Shortman helped fraud officers in Cardiff arrest him.
