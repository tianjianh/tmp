Det Insp Martin Slevin, from West Midlands Police, said: "Mr Evans had been a happy family man until working night shifts affected his sleeping pattern and he took to drink to relax, which resulted in him losing his family and spiralling into alcoholism.
"He lost his life tragically and his neighbour and friend is now serving time for his death and will have to live with the consequences of their brutal pastime for the rest of his life."
