She stepped down after a disastrous assembly election left her as the party's only remaining AM.
Mr Williams, the party's only Welsh MP, said it was a "great honour".
"These coming months and years will test the flame of liberalism, and I will do everything possible to ensure that flame burns brightly again across our great nation," he said.
Mr Williams had already been named as acting leader, and was confirmed in the post at a meeting of the party's Welsh national executive committee on Saturday.
"It is a great challenge to follow in the footsteps of Kirsty Williams, who has served us outstandingly for eight years through challenging times," he said.
"Every one of us owe her a huge debt of gratitude.
"Despite the election results, I'm heartened by the growing number of members and activists joining us because they believe in our cause, and I call on any person who shares our values to join us in our fight."
