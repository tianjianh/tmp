US politicians face sack for gay sex ruse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Michigan state lawmakers have been recommended for removal from office after admitting misconduct in covering up an extramarital affair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tea party Republicans Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat concocted a false story that Mr Courser had solicited a male sex worker, to make the story of their affair less credible.
Mr Courser apologised to a disciplinary panel and pleaded for leniency.
The state's House needs a two-thirds majority to expel the politicians.
Only three legislators have been removed from office in Michigan's history.
The state's House disciplinary committee voted on Thursday to recommend that the full House remove the pair from their positions.
Mr Courser and Ms Gamrat have urged the House to censure them instead - an official rebuke that would limit their official activities, but would allow them to remain in office.
The allegations stem from a spurious email that Mr Courser asked an aide to send, that claimed he was caught with a male prostitute.
The email was sent to party activists in the hope it would make allegations of his and Ms Gamrat's affair sound less credible.
For her part, Ms Gamrat claimed that she was aware of the plot, but that she did not know the content of the email before it was sent.
The House Business Office's investigation determined that the email itself was likely legal, but nonetheless unethical. The investigation ultimately alleged dishonesty and wrongdoing.
