Leeds captain Sol Bamba volleyed in Alex Mowatt's corner on 34 minutes for his second goal of the season.
Mirco Antenucci made it 2-0, running clear on the counter-attack before lifting the ball over Jason Steele for his fourth goal in three matches.
Simeon Jackson scored late for Rovers after Leeds failed to clear a corner.
Steve Evans' side have responded brilliantly to their 4-0 thrashing at Brighton on 29 February, taking maximum points from games against Bolton, Cardiff and Blackburn to banish any fears of being dragged into a relegation battle.
Rovers had scored 10 goals during their four-match winning run at home but while Paul Lambert's side enjoyed spells of pressure, they struggled to create many clear opportunities.
Leeds head coach Steve Evans: "I've said many times what a wonderful finisher Antenucci is on the training ground but there's been a lot of wonderful finishers on the training ground over the years that can't hit a barn door when they come out of it.
"Antenucci's very much as good on the pitch as he is on the training ground. His touch before he dinks it over the boy Steele is a fantastic touch because the opportunity for the goalkeeper to advance and to put it where he wants.
"He's a wonderful player. I'm so pleased for him. He is one player playing with determination for a place in the team. He's often the difference between winning and losing."
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert: "I don't think we deserved to lose. I thought we were well on top until they scored. We started the game really well and losing the goal through a set play was disappointing.
"The second goal was probably even more so disappointing but I've said to them, you've played so many games in a short space of time and I don't know if any other team has had the schedule we've been on and it's gruelling.
"It's the same lads going out week in, week out, and I knew one game was going to come back and bite because of the amount of games we've played.
"I couldn't fault the effort and the commitment, the way they played. It was just a game too far for us with the games we've had."
