European stock markets appear to have lapsed into a pre-Christmas calm, shrugging off fresh warnings about the eurozone crisis.
A quiet but positive tone in stock markets on Thursday continued into early Friday trading in Europe.
Italy's long-term borrowing cost fell back for a second day towards 6% - a still high, but not critical, level.

Zynga, the online games maker behind Mafia Wars and FarmVille, is to raise $1bn on its US stock market debut.
The company has priced its initial public offering (IPO) of 100 million shares at $10 a share. The price values the company at about $9bn.
Its flotation will be the largest by an internet company since Google raised $1.9bn at its IPO in 2004.
The Reserve Bank of India has held interest rates at 8.5%, interrupting a long period of rate increases.
The widely expected decision reflects concern at the weakness of the economy.
Inflation remains high, although the rate of wholesale price rises fell to 9.1% in November from 9.7% a month earlier, data on Wednesday showed.
Despite the central bank raising rates 13 times since March, the value of the Indian rupee fell to another all-time low against the dollar this week.
Russia is finally set to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday at a ceremony in Switzerland, after 18 years negotiating its membership.
The Swiss brokered a deal between Russia and Georgia earlier this year that removed the last obstacle to Russia's accession.

Russia is by far the biggest economy yet to join the global trade body.

The money will be put into the $20bn trust BP set up to compensate those affected by the disaster.
