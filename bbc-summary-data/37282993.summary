[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chez Isaac netted in each half as 10-man Braintree returned to winning ways with a much-needed victory over Sutton at Gander Green Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's scored the opener 10 minutes before the break after Kevin Amankwaah was brought down in the Braintree box, when former Middlesbrough midfielder Nicky Bailey beat goalkeeper Sam Beasant for his third goal of the season.
Isaac equalised in kind just before the break as he fired home from the penalty spot following a foul by Louis John.
Beasant did well to tip Amankwaah's header over the bar after 50 minutes and put in a diving save to deny Chris Dickson, while - at the other end - Ross Stearn's attempt to find the top corner missed by inches.
The away side lost Ian Gayle to a red card with seven minutes remaining but Isaac completed his brace at the end when his 25-yard strike beat Ross Worner to clinch all three points.
