UK business lobby group the CBI has welcomed the Paris Agreement climate deal that was secured at United Nations talks in the French capital.

Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the agreement "heralds an exciting opportunity for business".
But she called on the UK Government to do more to back clean technology.
"Businesses will want to see domestic policies that demonstrate commitment to this goal and none more so than in the UK," she added.
The Paris pact aims to curb global warming to less than 2C (3.6F).
Nearly 200 countries took part in tense negotiations in the French capital over two weeks, striking the first deal to commit all nations to cut emissions.
The agreement, which is partly legally binding and partly voluntary, will come into being in 2020.
Climate deal in summary
"We now have a climate deal agreed by the world's leaders that puts us on a sustainable low-carbon path and which can provide the framework for business to invest with confidence," said Ms Fairbairn.
She added: "The [UK} government must provide a stable environment that enables investment in cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy generation, including renewable technologies and new gas plants.
"As other nations start to play a greater role and increase their ambition, the UK needs a level playing field for carbon costs, so that our energy intensive industries can compete effectively in a global, low carbon market place."
