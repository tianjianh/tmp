University Challenge rape accused claims 'failed one-night-stand'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A history graduate who denies raping a fellow student has described what happened as "a failed one-night-stand".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bartholomeo Joly de Lotbiniere, 21, is accused of raping a woman at York University in June 2014 after a drunken night out.
He told a jury at York Crown Court both parties felt "disappointment and regret" afterwards, but what had happened was consensual.
The defendant, of Kensal Rise, London, denies rape and assault.

The former University Challenge contestant told the court the pair had kissed then started to have sex, but he was unable to maintain an erection.
He said the woman told him "you are not very good at this", and suggested they stop and go to sleep.
Describing the encounter as a "failed one-night-stand", Mr Joly de Lotbiniere told jurors he felt embarrassed, got dressed and left.
It was the second time he had sex, he told police, having lost his virginity two or three months before.
The defendant said he never considered what happened was without her consent.
Judy Khan QC, defending, asked: "Was there any suggestion she didn't want what was happening to take place?"
He replied: "No."
The court previously heard the woman sent him a text which said: "I thought I'd let you know I wasn't overly comfortable with what happened."
He had replied: "Neither am I".
Mr Joly de Lotbiniere told police his apologies related to him being unable to have sex with his accuser.
The case continues.
