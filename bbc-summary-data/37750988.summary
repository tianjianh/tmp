Shrewsbury had been in talks with Hurst for several days after making an approach for the 42-year-old, who left his post with the Mariners on Monday.
Hurst joined Grimsby in March 2011 and won promotion back to the English Football League last season.
He replaces Micky Mellon at Shrewsbury, who have not won in nine league games.
Hurst will be joined at Greenhous Meadow by his assistant at Grimsby Chris Doig.
Shrewsbury, who have won only twice in the league this season, have been managerless since Mellon left on 7 October to take over at National League side Tranmere.
The club are bottom of the table, six points adrift of 20th place ahead of Hurst's first match in charge on Saturday at Southend.
BBC Radio Shropshire's sports editor James Bond:
Hurst fits the bill Shrewsbury were demanding - a young manager with drive and ambition.
After promotion with Grimsby last season, he has already taken them into League Two's top six.
He will provide a much-needed morale boost at Shrewsbury, who have slumped to four defeats in a row since Mellon's exit.
It will also perk up Town fans, who were not slow in expressing their frustrations after Saturday's 4-2 home defeat by Northampton.
