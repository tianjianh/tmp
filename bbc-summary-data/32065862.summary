About 150 officers executed warrants in Rose Hill, Blackbird Leys and at a travellers' site in Redbridge Hollow in Hinksey Hill, at about 06:00 GMT.
The investigation, known as Operation Rague, relates to human exploitation, slavery and fraud offences.
Nine men and one women were arrested on suspicion of offences including servitude and slavery, assault, making threats to kill and fraud, police said.
Supt Andy Boyd, of Thames Valley Police, said the "alleged offences are matters which are taken extremely seriously".
"Our priority at this time is to care for those individuals who have been subject to these offences.
"At this time we are caring for those individuals with our colleagues in the local health service and the local authority," he said.
Thames Valley Police worked with a number of organisations including the National Crime Agency's UK human trafficking centre, local councils, HM Revenue and Customs and the Salvation Army.
Extra officers were put on patrol in the areas of the raids.
