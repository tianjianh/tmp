Ceinfryn Robins, 87, left his 1940s photographs, signed on the back 'Yours Truly' or 'Y.T', a year ago.
An appeal by National Express staff in The Times was seen by the family of the Methyr Tydfil-born RAF engineer.
Although Mr Robins died in November, his son David said the family was "so pleased" to get the photographs back.
Mr Robins, known as Cei to his family, was on his way to get the photographs enlarged for his family when he left them behind.
There were 33 pictures taken while Mr Robins was serving in India and on the Suez Canal to send to his childhood sweetheart Gene Jones.
When staff found them, they launched an appeal to trace the owner.
David Robins, 59, said: "We are so pleased that they have come back because dad would have sent these as a little love letter to Mam.
"Dad would always say 'It's nice to have a record' and his mission on the day he lost them was to pass on that record. Now they are coming back to us and it is wonderful."
Cardiff coach station manager Donna McDonald said: "We couldn't be more delighted to have found Cei's family and return these precious pictures back to the family."
The family are due to collect the photographs next week.
