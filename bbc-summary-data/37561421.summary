Bros, one of the biggest boy bands of the 1980s, are reuniting to mark their 30th anniversary.

Twin brothers Matt and Luke Goss will play London's O2 Arena next August. But original bassist Craig Logan will not take part in the reunion.
"I've always wanted it to happen in my heart," Luke said. "But I wanted it to be the right time."
Bros scored eight top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989 with songs like When Will I Be Famous and I Owe You Nothing.
"I didn't want to resist it any more," Luke told reporters. The pair promised the concert will be "a contemporary show that stands up today".
The band said they have no plans to release new music ahead of the shows. "We're going to honour the songs, some of the key sounds," said Luke.
"But at this stage, I don't want to populate the show with new stuff. If it was to happen again [after that] then maybe so."
Logan quit the group at the height of their fame after suffering ME. He later became a successful music mogul, managing the likes of Sade and Tina Turner and playing a key role in the success of Robbie Williams.
The brothers said he was "welcome" to return. Matt said: "I'm very proud of Craig's success but we started the band in school and Bros is Matt and Luke, without question."
The reunion show will take place on 19 August 2017 - exactly 28 years after the brothers played to 77,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Tickets go on general sale on Friday.
At the height of "Brosmania", the band sold 17 million records - but their fall from grace was swift.
They split after disappointing sales of their third album, Changing Faces, only to discover they faced debts of up to Â£500,000.
The brothers refused to declare themselves bankrupt and spent a decade repaying their creditors.
Matt forged a successful career in the United States, with a successful residency in Las Vegas, while Luke became an actor, appearing on TV shows and comic book movies like Hellboy II and Blade II.
