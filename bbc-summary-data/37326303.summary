[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite scoring 15 goals in their previous five games the hosts struggled to break down Bromley before the break.
Former Fulham midfielder Keanu Marsh-Brown looked the likeliest for Forest Green, firing several shots just wide, while the lively 24-year-old almost set up Elliott Frear just after the half-hour mark only to be thwarted by Bromley goalkeeper Alan Julian.
Bromley hit a post through Rob Swaine just after the break, but Marsh-Brown finally got a reward for his endeavour by turning in Frear's cross in the 74th minute to score the only goal.
