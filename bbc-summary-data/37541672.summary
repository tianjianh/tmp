Clare Shine scored a hat-trick with Savannah McCarthy, Keeva Keenan, Erin Cuthbert and Haley Rosen also netting.
Second-placed Hibernian Ladies, also in Champions League action with Bayern Munich visiting Easter Road on Wednesday, beat Forfar Farmington 5-1.
Celtic beat Stirling University 4-3 and Rangers overcame Spartans 5-4.
Glasgow City will head to Sweden for Thursday's first leg of their round-of-32 Champions League tie with Eskilstuna United in buoyant form after their goal spree.
"I was really delighted with the intensity of the team performance today and with the clinical finishing, which let us down last week," said manager Scott Booth.
"All parts of our game were spot on today and it was a terrific performance to take into the Champions League."
With only three league games left and a five-point lead, City are odds-on to win a 10th successive SWPL title.
