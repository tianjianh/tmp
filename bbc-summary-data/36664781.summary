[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitchell, 20, was offered new terms by Chelsea, where his previous deal was due to expire this summer.
However, he has agreed a move to the Spireites, becoming the League One club's fifth signing of the summer.
He did not make a first-team appearance for Chelsea but helped them win the 2012 FA Youth Cup and the Under-21 Premier League two years later.
The Spireites have also agreed to give a trial to striker Diego De Girolamo, 20, following his release by Sheffield United.
He was given his league debut by boss Danny Wilson during his time in charge at Bramall Lane.
