[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey States ask public for bus 'wish list'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Islanders are being asked to suggest ideas to improve the bus service in Guernsey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Environment Department has received "considerable public feedback" in the past 18 months.
But any further suggestions will be explored before a contract to run the service from April is signed.
The contract of CT Plus ends in March and the tendering process for a five-year contract to take over the service begins at the end of the month.
The introduction of a two-tier fare system in May 2013 was heavily criticised and scrapped earlier this month.
Under the States transport strategy the bus service will be free for 18 months as a trial.
Comments have to be submitted by 4 July and can be emailed to env@gov.gg.
