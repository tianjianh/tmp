[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester Tigers will look to reach their first European Cup final since 2009 when they meet French side Racing 92 at Welford Road on Sunday.

The Tigers, two-time winners of the previous incarnation as the Heineken Cup, went out in the group stage of last year's inaugural Champions Cup.
Racing have never before made it to the last four.
The winners will play Saracens in the final in Lyon on 14 May after they beat Wasps in Saturday's other semi-final.
Leicester have named the same side that beat Northampton in the Premiership last weekend for the tie, which will be held at the City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest.
Head coach Aaron Mauger will come up against compatriot and former All Blacks fly-half Dan Carter, who is in his first season with Racing.
"He's probably been the difference for Racing this year, even though you don't want to pin too much on one person," said Mauger.
"The direction that Dan has given the side has been critical. His composure in those tight moments has been the missing ingredient for them."
Mauger, who helped Crusaders to four Super Rugby titles between 2000 and 2007, also said that the Champions Cup has overtaken the southern hemisphere competition as the premier tournament for clubs.
"I think the Champions Cup is getting bigger, a bit more so now as I believe Super Rugby has been diluted by adding extra teams, which is a bit of a concern for them down there," said Mauger.
"It's probably the most prestigious competition."
