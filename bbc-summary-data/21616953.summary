England's new men's hockey head coach Bobby Crutchley says there is likely to be a significant overhaul of the squad.

Crutchley, who will also lead Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, replaces Jason Lee after he was named head coach of the women's squads.
"There will be new coaches coming in as well as a number of new players," Crutchley told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"Following a home Games the turnover of players will be significant, so the team will change on and off the pitch."
Crutchley will lead England in the European Championships this year and also in 2015, as well as in the Commonwealth Games, which Glasgow hosts in 2014. He will also coach the GB men in the Olympics, where they will be looking to improve on a fourth-placed finish at London 2012.
Previous head coach KLee took the team from 11th in the world to fourth, but Crutchley faces a huge challenge to improve on that.
Earlier this month Ben Hawes, Mark Pearn and Ken Forbes retired from the men's squad but despite failing to win a medal in London, funding from UK Sport has increased slightly thanks in part to the bronze medal won by the women's team.
The 42-year-old former international forward, who won 80 England caps and a bronze medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, will be at the helm when England play in the FIH Hockey World League semi-final competition that runs from 29 June to 7 July in Malaysia.
And Wirral-born Crutchley says he is excited about what he sees as a new era for the men's game.
"I will have a slightly different style to Jason [Lee]," he said,
"We've been looking at the next group of players since London. We are pretty aware of the talent coming through and are positive of getting them up to speed with international hockey relatively quickly.
"There has been a lot of interest in hockey after the Olympics and the challenge is to keep the momentum going.
"It will be challenging to stay at the top. We are ranked fourth in the world and I'm confident we can be competitive in Rio."
