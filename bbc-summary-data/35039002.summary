MPs sing from same hymn sheet on awards night

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The awards season has arrived for politicians, bringing a little festive cheer into their daily working lives.

Welsh Labour MPs put aside the party's recent difficulties to hand out the gongs at their Christmas bash in Westminster on Monday night.
Huw Irranca-Davies, newly-selected as a Welsh assembly candidate for Ogmore, was awarded the 'politician of the year' award, although some senior Labour voices have yet to forgive him for helping ensure Jeremy Corbyn could enter the leadership election earlier this year.
Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris was 'newcomer of the year' ahead of higher profile figures such as Stephen Kinnock or Nick Thomas-Symonds.
Former Vale of Clwyd MP Chris Ruane dropped in and was presented with a special award: The Ladybird Book of Mindfulness.
Guests included former Labour leader Ed Miliband, but the star of the night was singer Natasha John, 'discovered' by Islwyn MP Chris Evans as she cut his hair at The Cutting Crew in Pencoed, near Bridgend.
Mr Evans is convinced Natasha is another Shirley Bassey and the Bond fan inside the MP was particularly impressed by her rendition of Skyfall. You can read more about Natasha here and listen to her powerful voice on her own website.
Some of those who missed out on the awards will be hoping the judges in the ITV Welsh Political Awards on Tuesday night are more generous. Last year, each of the four parties represented in the assembly and Westminster won something although the party that came within a few thousand votes of topping the poll in last year's European elections in Wales went home empty-handed.
