Gwendoline Goring said she was catching her breath when she stopped in a children's play area while walking Mylo off French's Avenue, Dunstable.
Soon afterwards a warden handed her a fine for disobeying signs stating that dogs were not allowed in the park.
The council said there was "clear support" for the dog ban.
Ms Goring said the incident happened on Tuesday lunchtime as she was walking with her friend in the park.
She said: "I can't walk very far and I hadn't been out because I've had an operation on my arm.
"I seemed to be getting out of breath and I didn't feel well, and there are no benches at all in that park, except for the two that are in the play area.
"And I know you're not supposed to take a dog in there, but there was nobody in the whole park except for us, so I just sat down.
Mrs Goring was told the fine would be reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days, but she said she would not pay it as the amount represented half of her weekly pension money.
"Why should I pay it? I know I'm in the wrong but even just giving me a little leeway... I think it's disgraceful," she said.
Central Bedfordshire Council said: "There is signage clearly stating this is not allowed.
"There was clear support for banning dogs from enclosed children's play areas when we consulted the public before introducing the dog control orders last year."
