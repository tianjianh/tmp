[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 0-2 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday climbed back into the Championship play-off places as Steven Fletcher's double secured victory over local rivals Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Millers' Jon Taylor shot wide from a tight angle before Fletcher's low drive gave the visitors the lead.
Fletcher powerfully headed Jack Hunt's right-wing cross into the top corner to put Wednesday in control at the break.
Richard Wood went close for the hosts, but already-relegated Rotherham have now lost nine games in a row.
Wednesday meanwhile, are back up to sixth after in-form Fulham were beaten at Derby.
It could have been a different story had Rotherham not been so wasteful in front of goal as Wood and Carlton Morris both spurned decent openings in addition to Taylor's early opportunity.
Fletcher, however, was clinical with the Owls' first real sight of goal as he kept his composure to beat Lewis Price after collecting a Ross Wallace pass and score his first in 15 games.
The former Scotland international was equally lethal just before the break, meaning that three of his nine goals this season have come against the Millers.
It might have been a hat-trick for the ex-Sunderland and Burnley man early in the second half, but this time he was denied by Wood's block.
Rotherham interim manager Paul Warne will hope this latest defeat will not affect his chances of getting the job on a permanent basis, with a new full-time boss expected to be confirmed on Wednesday.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: "I think last season this is a game we might not have won, but we have learnt.
"We only depend on us. We must win our games. We won today and we are sixth with six games to go. Our fans will be very important.
"It was not fantastic, but two derbies, back-to-back, away from home, and it is four points to us."
Rotherham interim manager Paul Warne: "I have been told there is a board meeting and I am told they are going to come to a conclusion over the direction of the club, and I would presume that will include the manager of the club.
"If the chairman rings me up in the morning and asks me to be manager I will be very proud to do it. I can't promise I will do a good job but I will try.
"In the first half, we were pretty good, we were brighter than them. Their first goal was offside, it is a bit of a game changer."
