[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most of us love cycling and at a school in Yorkshire the pupils have proven that two wheels are better than taking the car.

The pupils are so good at cycling that they have won an award for it.
For five days each pupil used a scooter or a bike to get to school.
The children like to get to school on two wheels because it's fun and helps the environment. Check out the video.
