The event took place at Help for Heroes Phoenix House Recovery Centre in Catterick.
Army veteran Chris Yates, who was injured in 2011 when a truck tailgate gave way and fell on him while he was serving with the Royal Engineers, said: "It's definitely a confidence booster. There's no way I would have gone out there a year ago, but Help for Heroes have given me that confidence."
