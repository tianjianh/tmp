Strictly Come Dancing fans... we have a competition on our hands!

Ore Oduba and partner Joanne jived their way to the top on Saturday night with a glittering display which wowed the judges.
It was only Craig Revel Horwood who could find the tiniest fault, leaving the dance duo 1-point short of a maximum score!
Danny Mac came in second spot while Ed Balls came rock-bottom with his paso doble.
This week Ore sent us an exclusive look behind the scenes on rehearsal day, showing us there's more than dancing he has to do on a daily basis.
But it's so far so good for the sports presenter who's got everyone guessing what he'll bring to the dance floor next...
