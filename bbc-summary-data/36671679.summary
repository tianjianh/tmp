The 50-year-old former Bristol, Newcastle Falcons and England back row guided them to promotion from the Championship in 2015.
Having finished 10th last season, chief executive Jim O'Toole said on Monday the club would have a "top-six rugby budget" for the forthcoming campaign.
Ryan has recently been linked with a move to Premiership rivals Bath.

Worcester have confirmed their senior management team to replace Ryan will consist of head coach Carl Hogg and high performance director Nick Johnston.
Hogg, a former head coach at Gloucester, will retain responsibility for the first-team squad, while Johnston will continue to run the Warriors' academy, medical, sports science and player welfare departments.
"Disappointed would be a key adjective in all this," O'Toole told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"We were more than happy with the progress, our long-term business plan to make this a top-six Premiership team and where we are on the pitch.
"We are very disappointed to have to discuss this but it happens, people move on, and this is an example of that."
O'Toole was also quick to deny speculation that a lack of finances were behind Ryan's departure, reiterating that the club have already announced that the playing budget will rise by 25% next season.
"There's no shortage of money for players coming in - you can see with the signings of Ben Te'o, Francois Hougaard, Jackson Willison and others that we are full committed to the salary cap."
The club are also in the process of laying their first-ever artificial pitch at Sixways for next season.
Ryan, who took over in May 2013, suffered relegation in his first season in charge, won promotion in 2015 and then kept Worcester up last season.
BBC Hereford and Worcester rugby commentator Dave Bradley:
"While we still don't really know the full reason for his departure, it's interesting that the club are keen to point out he will not be moving to another Premiership club.
"They are also not appointing another director of rugby.
"What is Ryan's legacy? Well he got them back into the Premiership - having initially taken them down with one of the worst-ever playing records - and he managed to keep them in the top flight on their return, which some coaches had failed to do.
"His vision of a successful academy is just coming to fruition with some 20 players in England age group squads, which makes his departure even more puzzling."
