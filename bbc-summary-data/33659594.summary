[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shellfish farms in Devon, Jersey, Dorset and Somerset are closed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shellfish beds in Devon and the Channel Islands have been closed after tests showed high levels of pollution.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Closures have taken place after sewage bacteria, thought to be E. coli, was found in Slapton, Taw, Torridge and Jersey, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said.
Shellfish beds in Weymouth in Dorset and Porlock in Somerset have now been closed.
Five sites in Cornwall were closed on Thursday.
The Shellfish Association of Great Britain has contested the move, claiming the test results were "inconceivable".
The FSA said: "We are monitoring the situation by taking further samples but until we have evidence to the contrary the beds must remain closed to protect public health."
