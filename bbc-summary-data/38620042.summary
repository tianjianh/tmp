West Brom's new signing Jake Livermore trained with his new team-mates on Friday and could be involved.

Jonny Evans remains an injury doubt, while Allan Nyom is still waiting for international clearance to play after he wasn't selected by Cameroon.
Sunderland expect to have midfielder Jack Rodwell available after a knee scan gave him the all clear.
Steven Pienaar and Victor Anichebe are the only players from Sunderland's lengthy injury list who could return.
Steve Wilson: "Last January, Sunderland effectively saved themselves in the transfer window. Under Sam Allardyce they invested in Lamine Kone, Jan Kirchhoff and Wahbi Khazri, who all played a significant part in the club's escape.
"I am taking nothing away from Allardyce's achievement by saying that I reckon David Moyes could do just as well given the same opportunity to bolster his squad. But it seems that Sunderland are either unwilling, or unable, to support Moyes in the same way.
"The consequences are likely to be serious - particularly with three players on Africa Cup of Nations duty and a host of others injured.
"Moyes can surely only look on enviously as West Brom lavish in the luxury of eighth place and get their chequebook out."

West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "It will be a tough game. I have great respect for David (Moyes), he's a top manager and they have great support wherever they go.
"Sunderland have got players who can hurt you. Jermain Defoe's goals speak for themselves and Fabio Borini is back fit.
"We can't take anything for granted in the Premier League. When you do, that's when it turns round and kicks you."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "We've made some mistakes recently and I'm finding it difficult to change any of the players around, because we don't have that.
"Normally I would say if you're going to make that level of mistake then you won't play but we've not got the resources at the moment to change that round.
"So the players get that chance again, but we don't want repeated mistakes, that's for sure."
West Brom are always tough opponents and carry a threat from set-pieces. Having watched what Sunderland are like at the back, I cannot see them holding out.
