The coming of summer has been marked in Edinburgh as revellers gathered for the spectacular Beltane Fire Festival.
The celebrations, based on the the old Celtic May Day, began above the city on Calton Hill as the sun went down on Sunday.
During festivities the Green Man is killed as god of winter and reborn as spring to consort with the May Queen.
The modern Beltane Fire Festival has run since 1988, making this its 30th year.
About 300 drummers, fire dancers and performers acted out the scenes around a large bonfire.
All the fires are put out and relit using a fire made from a piece of wood from last year's festival.
Angus Farquhar , Edinburgh's Beltane Fire Festival founder, said: "Since we restarted it in its modern form 30 years ago, the Beltane Festival has continued to grow and flourish.
"It always felt apt to celebrate spring, warmth coming back into the air and the miracle of renewal as witnessed through the annual arc of growth and fecundity in the natural world.
"I am incredibly proud of its evolution, the energy and commitment of the hundreds of volunteers who make it happen and draw strength from the heart of its rituals and traditions."
