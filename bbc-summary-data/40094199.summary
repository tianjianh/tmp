Julie Thomas from Aberystwyth said she had queued in traffic for almost two hours to get into the event at Bridgend College's Pencoed campus.
Director of the Welsh language youth festival Aled Sion said Tuesday was expected to be the busiest day.
The event runs until 3 June and is expected to bring in 100,000 visitors over the course of the week.
