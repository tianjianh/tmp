[SN]TITLE[SN]
Extra cash for Leeds Kirkgate Market development

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An extra £1.3m is to be spent on refurbishing the Grade I-listed Kirkgate Market in Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The redevelopment, aimed at increasing the number of shoppers, was due to cost £12.3m.
The city council has blamed the rising costs on heritage work, building fees and keeping parts of the market open during the refurbishment.
Council leader Judith Blake said: "We all know that Kirkgate Market is the jewel in our crown."
The council wants the market to be able to take advantage of the expected increase in shoppers to the area when the neighbouring £150m Victoria Gate development opens next year.
Work got under way earlier this year on the market project and is expected to be completed next September.
Changes include a new fresh produce area and improvements to the toilet area.
