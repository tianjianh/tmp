[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Suffolk County Council is finalising a deal which will see Lowestoft College move on to the Lothingland Middle School in nearby Lound.
The college plans to use the site for new courses in construction trades and horticulture.
The school closed as part of the county's schools reorganisation programme.
The council is introducing a policy of replacing all middle schools in Suffolk with a two-tier primary and secondary school system.
Richard Perkins, Lowestoft College's corporation chairman, said: "The college regards this as an exciting opportunity to expand our current provision whilst servicing local employers and the community."
The college also plans to expand its sports courses at the second campus.
The council said the deal will be finalised at a meeting in January.
