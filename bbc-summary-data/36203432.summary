Lowestoft pre-war beach huts close after being deemed unsafe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 50 beach huts dating back to the 1930s have been removed from use after engineers raised concerns about their structural safety.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All of the affected beach huts are brick-built chalets in Jubilee Parade in Lowestoft.
Waveney District Council has written to leaseholders saying they will not be able to use their huts this year.
The council said the future of the huts depended on what structural engineers found on further inspection.
Waveney currently has about 400 people on its beach hut waiting list and people can expect to wait anywhere between five and 30 years for a hut to become free.
Cabinet member Stephen Ardley said :"One of the things I have to say is just how understanding the leaseholders have been. There has been sadness rather than annoyance."
