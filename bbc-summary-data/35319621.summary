Strong winds brought down trees and and power lines as the storm swept across the city on Thursday afternoon.
Emergency services received almost 2000 calls for help, mostly from Sydney's western and south-western suburbs.
The driver of the crushed car, a 60-year-old woman, was flown to hospital with critical injuries.
Emergency services worked for 40 minutes to free the pair, but the man died at the scene.
She is now in a stable condition, a Westmead Hospital spokesperson told the BBC on Friday morning.
The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) said around 400 volunteers would have a "busy day" on Friday cleaning up.
"Most of what we're seeing is large trees and branches brought down by those strong 122km/hr (76 mile) winds," SES spokesperson Phil Campbell said.
One resident told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that he "came home to a disaster zone".
"We've already had one roofer come round advertising," he said.
