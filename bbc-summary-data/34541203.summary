Mine plan lodged near Druridge Bay nature reserve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a surface mine close to a Northumberland nature reserve have been lodged two years after first being mooted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Banks Mining has submitted an application for a site at Highthorn, to the south east of the village of Widdrington.
It would see a total of three million tonnes of coal mined near the Druridge Bay nature reserve.
Objectors argue "massive environmental damage" would be inflicted on the area.
Banks said 50 jobs could be created, with a further 50 being transferred from its other sites in Northumberland.
It has amended its initial plan, with a reduction in the size of the proposed site as well as moving it further from the south and east of Widdrington.
Mark Dowdall, the firm's environment and community director, said: "Our Highthorn scheme would offer real and lasting opportunities for the surrounding area for which it would otherwise be impossible to find the necessary funding."
He added it would also "bring a wide range of other economic, employment, social and supply chain benefits to the local community".
Campaigners against the development include the Save Druridge group.
It said the opencast mine would be "right next to one of Northumberland's most beautiful and loved beaches".
Northumberland County Council is expected to rule on the application in 2016.
