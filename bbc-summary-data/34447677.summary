The politician was on the Greek island of Lesbos to see what help was being given to those coming ashore.
Mr Yousaf said an estimated 5,000 people had arrived on the island in the 24 hours he was there.
The Scottish government is providing Â£300,000 in humanitarian aid for those arriving in Europe.
It has also pledged that Scotland will accept at least 2,000 refugees.
Mr Yousaf called on governments across Europe to do more to assist.
During his visit, he said he;
Mr Yousaf said: "It is hard to describe in words how shocking and heartbreaking it is.
"You're talking of mothers, pregnant women, the elderly, children - all just desperate to find safety, security and a home.
"The first thing that hits you when you see the coast is the thousands, if not tens of thousands, of life jackets piled up on the shores.
"The emotions of the people who disembarked ranged from delight that they'd managed to make it to safety, to shock - one woman collapsed in front of us with shock - to fear because the journey had been so treacherous.
"It's a scene that should leave every single one of us thoroughly ashamed of ourselves, that this is happening on our doorstep and we're doing next to nothing to assist."
