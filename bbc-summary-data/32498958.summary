[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British stars Carey Mulligan, Ruth Wilson and Dame Helen Mirren are all up for best actress at the Tony Awards, the biggest honours in US theatre.

They go up against home-grown stars Geneva Carr and Elisabeth Moss, in a year where British talent is particularly well-recognised.
Three of the four best director nominees are British, while Bill Nighy and Ben Miles are in the running for best actor.
The awards will be presented on 7 June.
Musicals An American in Paris and Fun Home are the front-runners, each landing 12 nominations on Tuesday, showing two sides of the Broadway experience.
An American in Paris is a sunny, heavily-choreographed adaptation of the 1951 film; while Fun Home is a moody show based on Alison Bechdel's graphic novel about her suicidal father.
The nominations also ranged from 11-year-old Sydney Lucas in Fun Home to the 82-year-old Chita Rivera, looking for her third Tony.
British talent accounts for 24 nominations in total, with two West End transfers - Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, up for best play.
Dame Helen is recognised for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience, which imagines the private weekly meetings between the monarch and eight of her prime ministers.
She already has an Olivier Award for the London production, and an Oscar for portraying the Queen on the big screen.
"I've studied the shape of her mouth," said Dame Helen. "I know her face probably better than anyone else does. But it's only my portrait," she said. "I can only surmise and imagine."
Ruth Wilson is shortlisted for her role in Constellations, the tale of a relationship playing out across alternate universes.
Her co-star Jake Gyllenhall missed out on a nomination, however, joining other notable omissions such as Larry David's Fish in the Dark; and Finding Neverland, the JM Barrie musical produced by Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein, with music by Gary Barlow.
Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy are both nominated for Skylight, a revival of David Hare's 1995 drama, in which they play mis-matched lovers, as is co-star Matthew Beard.
Director Stephen Daldry - best known for his work on the films Billy Elliot and The Hours - is also up for best director for the play.
Daldry, who also directed The Audience, said: "It is a fantastic day for British theatre on Broadway. I am personally thrilled for The Audience and Skylight, and delighted too for Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"
The latter, which began life at the National Theatre, was nominated for best play, with British director Marianne Elliott also receiving a nod.
"It feels amazing," she told the BBC. "We had no idea when we first started how the hell this play was going to go down. We were taking big risks, we felt. We had no idea whether there'd be an audience for it. So to see it go to Broadway is quite amazing."
Curious Incident has six nominations in all, Skylight seven, while the RSC's double bill of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies has eight, including a best actor listing for Ben Miles, who plays Thomas Cromwell, and best director for Jeremy Herrin.
Other notable nominees included Bradley Cooper, up for best actor for his portrayal of Joseph Merrick in The Elephant Man; and Sting, who was shortlisted for best original score, despite his musical The Last Ship closing early.
Cooper, who will perform the play in the West End next month, said: "To be a part of a community that gathers together in a 13 block radius, eight shows a week, no matter what, in the greatest city in the world - for one sole purpose, to tell stories - I can't think of a better job to have. Thank you for letting The Elephant Man be a part of this season's story telling."
Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth - nominated herself for best lead actress in a musical - will host this year's ceremony.
