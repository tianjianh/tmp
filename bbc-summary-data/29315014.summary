More than 200 officers are searching for Eric Frein, 31, in Pennsylvania's dense north-east woodlands.
Pennsylvania police said they found an AK-47 rifle, ammunition and other items left behind by the survivalist.
He is accused of killing Capt Bryon Dickson outside a barracks and critically wounding another officer.
"I do believe we are close to him at this point," said Lt Col George Bivens of the state police.
Officers are continuing to search the area around Mr Frein's parents' home, searching hunting cabins, campsites and other temporary shelters in the Pocono mountains.
The search has been hampered by rugged terrain and forest canopy heavy enough in places to block police helicopters' view of the ground.
Mr Frein has been added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List and $175,000 (Â£107,000) has been offered for information leading to his capture.
On 12 September, a sniper opened fire outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks during an evening shift change.
In addition to the death of Capt Dickson, State Trooper Alex Douglass was wounded in the attack.
Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Mr Frein had survivalist training and had "made statements about killing law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder", according to the Wilkes-Barr Times-Leader newspaper.
Police said he also took part in a re-enactment group whose members play the role of soldiers from eastern Europe.
On Thursday, thousands of law enforcement officers came to pay their respects to their slain comrade.
Friends and colleagues called Dickson a devoted officer.
During a eulogy, fellow officer Derek Felsman remember Dickson as "impeccable" in both his work and family life, saying he regularly worked past his regular hours to get drink-drivers off roadways.
"He held himself to the highest standards as evidenced in every aspect of his life," he said.
