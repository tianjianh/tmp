Jordan Watson's body was found in the graveyard in Carlisle early on Tuesday morning; Cumbria Police initially said a man had been killed.
A post-mortem examination revealed he died from multiple wounds to the head and neck caused by a sharp implement.
Detectives said they were shocked by the murder and said for a child to die in such circumstances was "appalling".
The body was found in Upperby Cemetery, next to St John The Baptist Church in Manor Road, at about 07:45 BST on Tuesday.
Police patrols have been increased across the Carlisle area while the investigation continues into the death of Jordan, who lived in Ridley Road in the city.
Det Supt Andrew Slattery said: "Jordan has lost his life as a result of a savage and brutal attack which has shocked the officers working on the case.
"For a child to die in these circumstances in Carlisle is appalling.
"The offender or offenders must be apprehended and I appeal to any members of the public with information to come forward.
"If anybody heard or saw anything unusual in the area of the cemetery on Manor Road overnight, I would urge them to report it to our incident room."
The Reverend Jim Hyslop, vicar of St John The Baptist Church, said the first he knew of Jordan's death was when he saw police vehicles outside his house opposite the cemetery.
He said: "Nothing like this has ever happened in the 20 years I have been at the church.
"Jordan's body was found in the older part of the cemetery, which has been here since the church was founded in 1840.
"We haven't been told too much and I've not spoken to many people about what has happened. My thoughts are with his family at this time."
Carlisle's mayor, Steven Layden, said the entire city had been left "shocked and appalled" by the murder.
He said: "This is outside the normal life of people in Carlisle. It's absolutely shocking and the savagery and brutality of this murder makes it doubly appalling.
"It is utterly, utterly shocking that a 14-year-old can die in such a way."
