Lee Barnes saw the animals outside the back door of his flat in Creamery Court, Letchworth, in Hertfordshire, on Tuesday evening.
The pair, who he has called Bangers and Mash, stayed in his shed while the RSPCA found them a home.
"They are very friendly and are clearly pets.... maybe unwanted Christmas presents," said Mr Barnes.
The two female Kune Kune pigs were discovered eating the hedge behind the block of flats.
"They can't have come very far but can't be from a farm as they have no tag, I think they have been abandoned," said Mr Barnes.
"If I had a garden I would keep them."
RSPCA collection officer Amy Reiter found them a home with a friend in Peterborough.
An RSPCA spokeswoman said it was "delighted" to have found a home for the two pigs in such a short space of time.
"Farm animals like pigs can be in our care for a long time as they are very difficult to rehome," she said.
"Some people buy pigs on a whim and think they can just be kept in the back garden - which is why pigs can then be dumped when people realise how complex these animals actually are."
