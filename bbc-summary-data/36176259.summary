QPR defenders Clint Hill and Grant Hall both had efforts cleared off the line during a goalless first period, while Lee Tomlin hit the crossbar for City.
Midfielder Henry put the hosts ahead after the break with a curling shot from the edge of the area.
Sebastian Polter struck the woodwork as the home side pressed for a second goal in the closing stages.
The result means QPR achieve a top-half finish in their first season back in the Championship with the victory taking them a point above Leeds United into 12th place.
Bristol City end the season in 18th place, 12 points off the relegation places, ensuring another campaign in the second tier.
QPR head coach Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "Obviously there is more work to be done. We all know we are in transition.
"We've got some good characters here at the club and we have a base. We now want to work from that base.
"There are going to be some changes at this club, but we also have to understand that it's not going to be about only throwing money at it."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "I've got to take stock of the bigger picture and congratulate everybody on their contribution.
"I thought we had enough chances and had the better play, but we've been done by a fantastic strike - in fairness you've got to give credit for that goal."
