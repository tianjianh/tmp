They face the threat of administration unless a deal is struck between Anderson and director Dean Holdsworth.
The pair led the consortium that bought the club for £7.5m, but Anderson is now seeking to become the sole owner.
He told BBC Radio Manchester: "We're both sensible people and want the best for the club, I think it will happen sooner rather than later."
Speaking at a fans' forum on Tuesday, Anderson said he was "very confident" there would be a resolution.
He also told supporters:
Bolton, who were relegated from the Championship last season, are just a point behind leaders Scunthorpe after their 4-0 win over Gillingham on Monday.
