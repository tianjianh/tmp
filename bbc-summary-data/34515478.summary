[SN]TITLE[SN]
Price of Football Quiz: Are these deals true or false?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As part of the 2015 Price of Football, we asked clubs if they had any special offers they'd like to tell us about and they didn't disappoint.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
These are not your typical two-for-one, or name in a programme type deals, these are deals which really make the clubs involved stand out.
But can you tell (or guess) which deals are true and which are false.
At the end of the quiz you'll get your own special (made up) offer. Get quizzing!
