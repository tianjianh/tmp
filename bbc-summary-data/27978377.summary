The balloon was brought down by Matt Rate in Hilldrop Road, Northampton, on Friday evening.
Mr Rate said the wind had suddenly dropped and if he had left the landing any later he could have come down over the town centre.
Resident Ian Callaghan, of Digital Torque, filmed the balloon as it came in to land.
Ben Geoghegan reports.
