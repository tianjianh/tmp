[SN]TITLE[SN]
Victor Nealon wrongful conviction: Investigation reopened

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are to reopen the investigation into an attempted rape, following the acquittal of a man who served nearly 17 years in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Mercia Police said a review into the Redditch attack had highlighted areas, including forensic results, where reinvestigation was necessary.
Victor Nealon, who was living in the town at the time, was jailed for life over the attack on the woman, which happened in 1996.
His conviction was quashed in December.
The Court of Appeal made the ruling after hearing fresh DNA evidence cast doubt on the 1997 verdict.
Police carried out a case review and found forensic results relating to the victim's clothing needed further investigating.
A spokesman said the inquires might take "a considerable amount of time" and that police were liaising with the victim.
Mark Newby, Mr Nealon's solicitor, said his client was pleased police were reinvestigating.
