KL1 200m winner Chippington and KL2 200m champion Wiggs added to their Paralympic and World titles.
Young took gold in the men's VL3 200m event.
Britain's Rachel Cawthorn won Canoe Sprint European Championships bronze in the women's K1 1,000m event at the same venue earlier on Saturday.
Wiggs beat compatriot Charlotte Henshaw in the KL2 200m, with Henshaw's silver one of three for Britain alongside Ian Marsden (KL1 200m) and Robert Oliver (KL3 200m). There was also a bronze for Nicholas Beighton in the KL2 200m event.
Former swimmer-turned canoeist Chippington, who has won 12 Paralympic medals, beat Russian Alexandra Dupik into first place by almost a second and a half.
"It's nice to get the first major event out the way and deliver a successful performance," she said.
Wiggs was almost three seconds faster than her team-mate Henshaw, who was competing in her first major championships.
