Students taking part in the "free education" protest will march through central London.
They are expected to hear a statement from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn read out and a speech from shadow chancellor John McDonnell.
The campaigners say university is being made "inaccessible" to poor families.
The National Campaign Against Cuts and Fees says that students from campuses around the country will be taking part in the demonstration.
It wants to remove tuition fees, currently up to Â£9,000 per year in England, and to reverse a decision to convert means-tested maintenance grants into repayable loans.
"The government is impoverishing the poorest students for minimal gains," said the campaign's Callum Cant.
"It is an attack on the least privileged students which doesn't save much money and causes misery.
"It is austerity which targets the poorest students. Our worry is that it will make university a lot more inaccessible."
But a spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which is responsible for universities, said it was "committed to ensuring everyone with the potential to benefit from higher education has the opportunity to do so, regardless of their background".
The student funding system was operated so that "lack of finance should not be a barrier to participation and more funding is available to support living costs than ever before".
