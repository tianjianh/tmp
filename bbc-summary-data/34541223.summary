[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who took part in dissident republican event, during which a masked man made threats against UK forces, have been given suspended sentences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ciaran Anthony Boyle and Anthony Michael Lancaster participated in the event in Londonderry in 2012, which commemorated the 1916 Easter Rising.
Lancaster, from Circular Road in the Creggan area of Derry, was described as being the event's Master of Ceremonies.
Boyle, of The Meadows, Derry, held the Irish tricolour during the speeches.
He was also alleged to have collected various other flags from members of the colour party who attended the event in Derry's City Cemetery on the day in question - Easter Monday, 9 April 2012.
The dissident republican rally was organised by the 32 County Sovereignty Movement.
A unnamed masked man, who claimed to speak on behalf of the paramilitary groups ??glaigh na h??ireann (ONH) and the Real IRA, addressed the event.
He stated that the "IRA" would continue to attack "Crown force personnel" and "British interests and infrastructures".
Almost a year later, in March 2013, Boyle and Lancaster were arrested by police investigating the rally.
The pair were both charged with assisting in, arranging or managing a meeting which they knew was to be addressed by a person who belonged or professed to belong to a proscribed organisation, namely the IRA.
Boyle, 30, and 53-year-old Lancaster initially denied the charge when their non-jury Diplock trial began last month
However, they later changed their pleas to guilty, and were sentenced at Belfast Crown Court on Thursday.
A defence barrister, representing Lancaster, told the court his client was unaware that a masked man was going to give a speech at the podium.
Boyle's barrister said her client's involvement in the event was "of a low level".
She also told the court that a large number of other people attended the event but their prosecution "is not being sought".
The judge handed both men a 12-month sentence, which he suspended for three years.
