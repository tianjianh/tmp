[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queen of the South 4-2 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen of the South scored two late goals to beat Dundee United, who lost ground on Falkirk in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derek Lyle finished neatly after a Stephen Dobbie through ball but Thomas Mikkelsen rounded goalkeeper Lee Robinson to level for United.
Dobbie finished off a counter attack for Queens' second but Mikkelsen again equalised, converting a rebound after a Robinson save.
But strikes by Lyndon Dykes and Dale Hilson gave the hosts victory.
With Falkirk beating Raith Rovers, the Bairns move above Greenock Morton into second. United trail Falkirk by four points and are two off Morton, while Hibernian have a nine-point lead at the top.
Challenge Cup winners United host Falkirk next Saturday.
Queens move to within eight points of Dundee United but face a tall order to prevent Ray McKinnon's side claiming at least the final play-off place.
The sides finishing third and fourth will play off at the quarter-final stage with the winner going on to meet the league's runners-up. The semi-final winner will meet the team who are second bottom in the top flight in the Premiership play-off final.
