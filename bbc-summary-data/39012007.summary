Barnet 0-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Berry netted his 16th goal of the season as Cambridge beat Barnet at The Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder's goal helped his side, four points off the League Two play-off places, claimed their first win on the road in 2017.
With both senior goalkeepers out injured, Barnet handed a debut to Harry Burgoyne, on emergency loan from Wolves.
But he was untested in a first half in which neither side hit the target, with John Akinde's header over the bar from Mauro Vilhete's cross the closest the Bees got.
After the break, Barnet might have gone ahead when Jake Carroll's back-pass was seized on by Vilhete, only for Will Norris to come racing out and block.
However, they would rue the missed opportunity when Harrison Dunk picked out Berry 12 yards from goal and the 24-year-old side-footed a volley past Burgoyne.
Barnet skipper Michael Nelson, Charlie Clough and substitute Jamal Campbell-Ryce all tested Norris late on but the U's keeper was equal to it and Cambridge hung on for a hard-fought win.
