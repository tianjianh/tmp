Grimsby strengthened their position in the National League play-off places despite being held to a goalless draw by 10-man Eastleigh.

Visiting keeper Ross Flitney was in great form to stop Omar Bogle on a number of occasions in the first-half.
Shortly after the restart, Eastleigh's Josh Payne was sent off for a tackle on Richard Tait.
Grimsby stepped up the pressure but Flitney was equal to Jon Nolan's swerving shot to secure a point.
The Mariners are fourth in the table, seven points clear of sixth-placed Braintree, with Eastleigh a point further back in seventh.
Grimsby boss Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:

"Overall I was really happy with the performance and I think you can see at the end that they're the ones who went down to 10 men.
"You can see the lads are out on their feet and we're having to really demand and ask them to dig deep and give everything.
"Unfortunately today we weren't rewarded with the three points but I feel it was a good performance and if you look at who we're playing against, it was just unfortunate we couldn't get that winning goal."
