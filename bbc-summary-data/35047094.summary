GB lost their opening game 2-1 against the hosts Argentina before a 1-1 draw with China.
Australia had won their two previous fixtures in the tournament.
Britain's victory on Tuesday means they are now likely to avoid facing World and Olympic champions the Netherlands in Thursday's quarter-finals.
"We're up and running now and I thought that was a fantastic performance from us," Richardson-Walsh told BBC Sport.
"That's the number two side in the world and, although the score didn't suggest it, we dominated. That's set us up well for the quarter-finals."
Against Australia, Crista Cullen made her first competitive appearance for GB since retiring after winning bronze at the London 2012 Olympics.
The GB women have struggled to find breakthroughs with their penalty corner routines during the competition and were again thwarted with eight attempts.
At the other end Britain were indebted to keeper Maddie Hinch who pulled off two crucial saves to deny Australia.
However, Alex Danson - who made her 250th international appearance on Sunday - was in inspired form.
Her darting run from the left and subsequent shot during the second quarter would have seen her open her account for the tournament - had Richardson-Walsh not claimed the goal with a touch inches from the goalline.
Britain will learn the draw for Thursday's quarter-finals once the Pool A and Pool B fixtures are completed on Wednesday.
