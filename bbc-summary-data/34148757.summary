Inverness CT 2-0 Heart of Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Vincent and Miles Storey earned Inverness their first win of the season as Hearts suffered successive defeats.

Ryan Christie was the architect of the opener with a burst of pace down the left flank and composed cut-back which Vincent dispatched form close range.
Debutant Storey finished from an angle late on to seal the points.
It was a poor evening for Hearts, who had Juwon Oshaniwa dismissed just before the second goal after he lashed out at Tobi Sho-Silva.
This may be the spark Inverness require to progress this season.
Both sides handed debuts to recent recruits with Storey starting up front for the home side and Danny Swanson named in the Hearts line-up.
Hearts seemed to be edging the early stages with both sides comfortable in possession but rarely threatening.
Juanma Delgado broke into the box after Josh Meekings lost possession and claimed for a penalty under Ross Draper's challenge but the striker appeared to go down too easily.
Storey showed a flash of what he can offer when Danny Williams flicked a pass in behind, a heavy touch just carrying the ball through to goalkeeper Neil Alexander.
The game became more and more scrappy, exemplified when Juanma powered a fresh air-shot nowhere to the delight of the home crowd.
Oshaniwa then saw a low drive edge past the post after the ball deflected into his path before Robbie Neilson's side had a second penalty claim turned down.
Sam Nicholson struck a fierce effort off a defender's arm and referee Steven McLean seemed to make the correct call that there was no intent.
But Neilson seemed to believe hands were raised and made his thoughts known to an official.
Play improved in the second half and Christie, back on loan at Inverness after signing for Celtic, provided the spark the Highlanders needed.
He showed great pace to escape down the the left and squared accurately for the onrushing Vincent, who fired home from close range. It was Caley Thistle's first home goal in just over four and a half matches.
They took real confidence from that and looked far more purposeful.
Swanson offered most of Hearts' creativity but Owain Fon Williams was rarely troubled throughout as the visitors struggled to cut the home side open.
Oshaniwa was red-carded for hitting out at Sho-Silva after the pair had exchanged while awaiting a corner.
And Storey put the result beyond doubt after Iain Vigurs played a low ball across goal, striking powerfully past Alexander to seal a deserved Inverness win.
