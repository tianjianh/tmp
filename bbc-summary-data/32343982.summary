The girl, who was 16 at the time of the assault, was seven months pregnant when she was attacked in Oldham's Copster Hill Park in August last year.
She later lost her baby in hospital.
Dusan Bako, 18, of Copster Hill Road, Greater Manchester, previously pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent at Manchester Crown Court.
Prosecutors dropped a charge of child destruction due to a lack of evidence. His sentence will be served at a young offenders' institution.
Police said Bako went to the teenager's house and asked her to come outside to speak to him.
He then became aggressive and dragged her by the arm to the park, where she was attacked.
Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "Bako's incomprehensible actions have left the victim understandably distraught in a way I cannot begin to comprehend or imagine.
"To punch a heavily pregnant girl in the stomach is as unthinkable as it is deplorable, and I can only say that I hope today's sentence brings some closure to the girl and her family."
