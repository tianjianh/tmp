And Alex Schalk's early strike consigned Thistle to the bottom half of the table for the season run-in.
Schalk turned on to his right foot and fired a firm effort low to Ryan Scully's right to hand Jim McIntyre's side a crucial advantage.
The Dutch striker almost created a decisive second when he teed up Brian Graham only for Gary Miller to block.

Thistle knew an equaliser might be enough for them to finish in the top six and came close through Mathias Pogba and Kris Doolan but Alan Archibald's side will have to settle for being comfortably clear of a relegation fight.
Ross County add a top-half finish to their Scottish League Cup triumph in what's proving to be a very successful season.
Both sides knew a win was the most likely route to their ambition of getting above seventh before the split and it was the home side who seized the initiative with an early opener.
Forward Schalk showed great confidence when he picked up possession in an inside left position and smashed a low shot past Scully.
It was his eighth strike since arriving in January and proved to be another vital contribution after his late League Cup final winner against Hibernian last month.
Thistle tried to respond when Abdul Osman nodded towards the back post but the onrushing Pogba was offside when he tried to connect.
Schalk seemed central to most positive County moments and did superbly to escape down the left. As the angle got too tight he laid the ball into the path of the onrushing Graham, who tried to place a low shot across Scully, but Miller positioned himself wonderfully to snuff out the danger.
Almost instantly, Dundee fell behind to Hamilton Academical in South Lanarkshire and all of a sudden County were in pole position for that top-six place.
A timely reminder arrived when Ryan Edwards tried to curl a shot beyond Scott Fox, which the keeper palmed narrowly over whilst appearing to be slightly unsighted by the sun.
Schalk seemed at the top of his game and almost netted again when he fired another low effort narrowly past. He was sharp and threatening every time he gathered possession throughout the first half.
Thistle started the second period very positively with Pogba watching his close range header palmed away and Edwards failing to hit the target with a diving header.
Callum Booth looked like he had broken through but Fox raced off his line brilliantly to gather before substitute Doolan shot straight at the keeper from close range.
Booth had a claim for a penalty dismissed as County held out in a nervy finale.
