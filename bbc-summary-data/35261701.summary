Public toilets to be offloaded by Flintshire council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last five public toilets in Flintshire look set to be closed or offloaded in a move that will save the county council up to Â£94,000.

Facilities in Duke Street, Flint, will shut on 1 April while Mold's New Street car park toilets will be offered to the town council or close.
Facilities in Holywell and Talacre will also be offered to community councils.
Councillors discussed the plans on Wednesday but a final decision has yet to be made.
A decision on the future of toilets at Mold bus station will be delayed.
