A police chief, cleared of misconduct, has apologised for upsetting officers after being told to by investigators.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sue Sim, chief constable of Northumbria, admitted raising her voice out of "frustration" at "significant challenges" faced by the force.
Recorder Joel Bennathan QC investigated Ms Sim's conduct after officers complained to Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird about rudeness.
But, he concluded said there had been no breach of standards.
Sue Sim, who led the manhunt for Raoul Moat in 2010, has previously said she will retire in June after 30 years' service.
Ms Baird said if she were not retiring, Ms Sim would have been sent on a management training course to "moderate" her style.
The commissioner also said she had directed Ms Sim to apologise to two particular officers.
Ms Sim said: "I have always accepted that there have been times when I have raised my voice. This has always been about work-related issues and, as a result of the significant challenges we faced, my frustration at the speed of progress.
"It was never my intention to cause any upset and, if I did, then obviously I apologise wholeheartedly.
"I am saddened that some senior members of the organisation chose to act in this manner and have also raised my concerns with the commissioner in respect of the motivations and intent of some of those involved in making complaints against me."
