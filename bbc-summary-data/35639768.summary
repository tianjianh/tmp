The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.
Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders and sentenced to death in December.
Jersey Coroner Mark Harris recorded a narrative verdict after outlining the murder case in Thailand.
Earlier this month, Norfolk's coroner ruled Ms Witheridge was unlawfully killed.
Mr Miller's mother Sue said after the inquest in St Helier: "We kept in contact with Dave via Skype during his time in Australia and Thailand.
"His last call was on Skype from Koh Tao hours before his death. He described the island as paradise and showed us the view from his balcony using his phone and said he was going snorkelling that day.
"We're so grateful for that last contact. I heard the news about the deaths on the radio. No names were mentioned but I knew it was Dave.
"I tried to call him and sent him emails but my worst fears were confirmed by the arrival of the police."
She added: "Dave was intelligent and hard-working. He brought light, energy and hope into our lives. He had a clear sense of justice. He was in the prime of his life and had so much ahead of him."
Last year, the University of Leeds, where Mr Miller had been studying, presented his mother with his posthumous degree in civil and structural engineering.
The convicted men are appealing against their convictions and death sentences for the murders.
