MP nominates Corbyn - but won't vote for him

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He won't be voting for him and he doesn't want him to win. But Ogmore MP Huw Irranca-Davies has nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He's one of several MPs who lent their support to the left-wing MP to ensure party members have a wider choice. Mr Irranca-Davies explained: "It's not because I think he'll be a great Labour Leader. It's not because I agree with his views (there's much I disagree with) and it's not because I'll even be voting for him.
"But Jeremy represents a distinct part of the Labour Party and movement which deserves to be heard in the leadership contest. If he doesn't get on the ballot paper, that voice is stifled before the contest begins."
Mr Corbyn is now on the ballot paper and that voice is not stifled. Mr Irranca-Davies said: "I personally feel it will be a better contest with Jeremy included. All the other candidates will be tested more thoroughly, be challenged more directly. Their arguments will need to be stronger. As a result, whoever is chosen will be better for it, and more ready for the fight for the election in 2020."
Nominations closed at noon on Monday, with Andy Burnham able to claim the support of 11 of the 25 Welsh Labour MPs, including Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith and his deputy Nia Griffith. Yvette Cooper has six, including Stephen Kinnock, who originally backed Mary Creagh only for her to withdraw from the contest.
Liz Kendall has the support of five Welsh MPs. Only two of the 25 - Susan Elan Jones and Mark Tami - have not nominated a candidate. You can read more about the candidates - and who's backing who - here.
And if you want to know who Huw Irranca-Davies is backing, he says:  "I will (probably) be announcing who I shall be supporting in the next few days."
