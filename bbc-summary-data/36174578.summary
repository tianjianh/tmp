The Scot, 22, was a game and 18-16 down against Denmark's Anna Thea Madsen before winning 17-21 21-18 21-19.
Second seed Gilmour will meet Spain's Carolina Marin in the final after the top seed beat Line Kjaersfeldt 23-21 21-15 in La Roche Sur Yon, France.
In the men's singles, England's Rajiv Ouseph took a second successive bronze medal after losing his semi-final.
Ouseph, the silver medallist in 2014, was beaten 21-11 21-16 by last year's champion and top seed Jan O Jorgensen of Denmark.
On reaching the final, Gilmour said: "I feel happy, feel relief, I feel excited, tired - all of those things. I am just delighted.
"Remaining calm on court, not getting ahead of myself, not thinking too much was the key."
