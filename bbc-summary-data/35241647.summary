So far this winter, Nevis Range near Fort William and the Lecht in Aberdeenshire were able to open for a short time at the end of December.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said it was not unusual for the resorts to open later in winter.
She said the winter of 2014-15 was the first in years all five opened for snowsports before Christmas.
Ms Negus told BBC Radio Scotland: "Even in the really, really good year of 2009-10 only four were open by Christmas.
"Looking back to the early years of Glencoe, it made no attempt to open for snowsports until mid-February."
In April last year, Glencoe Mountain was described as having the "best powder snow on the planet".
The conditions, which are highly sought after by skiers and snowboarders, followed heavy snowfalls over several days.
Snowaction magazine rated the centre as having the best powder snow of any of the world's ski resorts at that time.
The last day of skiing at Glencoe for the 2014-15 season was 4 May.
Scotland's other mountain centres are CairnGorm Mountain near Aviemore and Glenshee near Braemar.
