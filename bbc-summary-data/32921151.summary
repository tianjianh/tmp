[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff Welsh language centre plans approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to open a Welsh language and cultural centre in Cardiff have been approved by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The aim of the facility, which will include a cafe bar, teaching rooms and exhibition space, is to protect the language and provide somewhere for people to speak Welsh.
It will be run alongside the Cardiff Story museum already based at The Old Library on The Hayes.
The plans are dependant on a Welsh government grant.
The money is part of a scheme to create similar centres around the country to encourage more people to learn and use the language.
Among the activities planned for the centre are Welsh language courses run by Cardiff University and music events for Welsh bands, hosted by nightclub Clwb Ifor Bach.
