[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville has been visiting the port of Misrata and a detention centre holding migrants wanting to flee to Europe.

There are clear skies in Misrata, Libya.
It means hundreds of people who have left their homes in Sub-Saharan African countries like Senegal and Eritrea will attempt to cross to Italy by boat in search of a better life.
The European Union says more than 7,000 migrants have been rescued from the Mediterranean since Friday.
Summer brings calmer waters, waves of migrants and death to the Mediterranean. Three boats - 250 people rescued in 24 hours.
Ali, right, is from Gambia. It's his second attempt crossing to Italy. "I've had enough. I want to go home to my mum".
Ninety-seven men were crammed on this boat, rescued by Libyan coastguard, stuck at sea for 24 hours, not all survived.
When they saw how flimsy the dinghy was, many refused to board. The people smugglers forced them at gunpoint.
A year since we visited Libyan jails holding migrants fleeing to Europe: it's worse than before.
This kid, 14 years old, is from Eritrea. "Is this a jail? Are we refugees?" some ask, and tell us they've been held for seven months.
A thousand men and women, migrants, are crammed in here. The jail has doubled in numbers in less than a week.
A smaller EU rescue mission only means more of these people are dying. They aren't discouraged from crossing.

The Libyan coastguard rescues hundreds of migrants from the Mediterranean - they have few working boats.
Already this Libyan jail contains hundreds. Standing room only.
