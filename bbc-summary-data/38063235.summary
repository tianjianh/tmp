A man who burst into a young mother's home as part of a gang and gave her "an absolute hiding" has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Jamie Wallace left Leesa-Marie Myles with broken teeth and multiple bruises following the attack.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard Miss Myles was sheltering Wallace's partner at her home in Doune, Perthshire, at the time of the assault.
Wallace's car had "screeched  to a halt" outside Miss Myles' house.
She told a jury: "Jamie punched me. I tried to grab his hand, but got hit by one of the other ones.
"Another boy reached over and hit me on the head with a Buckfast bottle, and I fell onto the floor in the foetal position.
"Jamie stamped on the left hand side of my head."
Wallace then kicked Ms Myles in the mouth as she held on to a claw hammer he was brandishing at her.
She received further kicks to the body, until an older man in the gang said "that's enough" and her attackers left.
The court heard each person, apart from the older man, gave her a final kick as they left.
Ms Myles was left with multiple bruises, two cracked teeth and marks on her fingers.
Wallace, 34, was found guilty of acting with others and assaulting Ms Myles to her injury on 1 August 2015.
Prosecutor Sarah Lumsden said: "Miss Myles was battered, given an absolute hiding, by five guys who broke through her front door, and Wallace was one of them. It was quite shocking."
Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told him: "It's extremely fortunate that the level of violence did not result in more serious injury.
"You can be described as a violent man. You were convicted of assault by stabbing when you were very young.
"The gravity of this is such that no sentence other than custody is appropriate."
