Thousands of visitors are expected at the college of art and design event, which opens to the public on Saturday.
Themes range from Scandinavian furniture design to artwork inspired by grief at the loss of family members.
The show takes place over two buildings and 14 floors at the school.
Duncan of Jordanstone alumni include best-selling illustrator Johanna Basford, photographer Albert Watson and painter Albert Morocco.
One of this year's exhibits is Gentian Meikleham's pair of mechanical swings made from porcelain and parian ceramic and inspired by the death of her brother Koan and other family members.
Miss Meikleham said: "Koan was 24 when he died, and this number is repeated several times throughout my work.
"I chose the swings because they are an easily recognisable symbol of childhood and innocence and also relate to so many memories of my own childhood.
"They continue to swing together, despite the loss of the physical body and despite the childhood that is lost."
Former DJ Jon Christie is exhibiting his range of Scandanavian furniture, created using traditional methods and modern 3D printing.
His love of the Scandanavian designs began more than 20 years ago after visiting his Danish wife's homeland.
He said: "This didn't look like any furniture I had ever seen before and I had never seen people take such pride in it either.
"I instantly fell in love with these beautiful, elegant, timeless designs.
"Every single component has a function and that's where the design brings the traditional skills and technology together.
"It is important to me that 3D printing isn't seen as a replacement for these traditional skills but another tool for the maker to use to complement them."
Last year's degree show attracted 15,000 visitors, its highest number to date.
The show exhibits from students in all 11 Duncan of Jordanstone undergraduate programmes and from graduates in architecture.
College Dean, Prof Paul Harris, said: "Research we carried out showed that the creative industries account for 3,000 jobs and contribute Â£190million to the local economy annually.
"When you consider that Dundee has a population of around 150,000 that shows the phenomenal importance of this sector.
"In many ways Duncan of Jordanstone is the starting point for all this.
"For more than a century he has brought together practising artists, designers and researchers, and of course, students, to create a hub for creativity and it has been shown across the world that a thriving arts scene is a factor that makes a city a vibrant and attractive place to live.
"The city-wide Ignite Festival and Dundee Design Festival have been built around the degree show in recognition of its huge importance to Dundee."
Following a preview evening for students, families and guests on Friday, the show will open to the public until Sunday 29 May.
