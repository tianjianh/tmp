NI farmers launch high court action challenging end to wind power subsidies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's farmers will go to court in an attempt to quash a Stormont minister's plan to close a subsidy scheme for onshore wind a year early.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ulster Farmers' Union is joined by wind energy firm Simple Power Ltd in seeking leave for a judicial review.
They want to challenge consultation proposals from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment (DETI).
But a DETI spokeswoman said Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell has not taken a final decision on closing the scheme.
Mr Bell had initially said he would retain the scheme until 2017, but in September he announced a two-week consultation on a proposal to shut the subsidy scheme in April 2016.
This came after the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), based in Westminster, announced plans to radically scale back financial support.
The High Court legal action focuses on the handling of DETI's consultation process.
The Ulster Farmers' Union said many farmers had invested heavily in turbine applications on the basis that the subsidies would not change until 2017.
They have also called for different rules to apply to large scale wind generators and small scale turbine owners such as their members.
The legal papers, lodged at the High Court in Belfast, seek an order to quash Mr Bell's September announcement.
In a statement, Mr Bell said: "I recognise that the industry needs clarity and I had hoped to publish the formal government response before now.
"I continue to engage with DECC to secure the best outcome for Northern Ireland and will issue the consultation response as soon as possible."
It is expected the High Court hearing to decide on whether the judicial review can proceed will be heard in January.
