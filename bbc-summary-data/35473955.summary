[SN]TITLE[SN]
UK greenhouse gas emissions' 8% drop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greenhouse gas output in the UK fell almost 8% in 2014, although emissions from transport and agriculture rose slightly, official figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell 8.9% in 2014 on the previous year, while emissions of all the greenhouse gases were 7.7% below 2013 levels.
The figures come from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc).
The biggest fall in 2014 was in homes (17%), where a warmer year meant less gas was used for heating.
A significant fall was also seen in the power sector (down 13.6%), which saw less use of coal in electricity.
