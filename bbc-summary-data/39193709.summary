Brentford: Championship club allowed to retain Griffin Park terracing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford are to retain terracing at Griffin Park for the 2017-18 season after being given a dispensation by the Sports Ground Safety Authority (SGSA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clubs promoted to the Championship are given a three-year period to convert terracing to all-seater arenas.
Brentford returned to the second tier in 2014, and were due for alterations.
The club said in view of its planned ground move, and good safety record, the SGSA said it could retain the Ealing Road and Brook Road terraces.
Brentford chief executive Mark Devlin said the introduction of seats would have reduced the stadium capacity by approximately 1,600.
"This is hugely positive news as this would have had a significantly damaging impact on our revenues and ability to grow our fanbase," he added.
Brentford have planning permission to build a new 20,000-capacity ground at nearby Lionel Road and hope to move in by the start of the 2019-20 season.
