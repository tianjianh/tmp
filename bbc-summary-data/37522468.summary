[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gymnastic coach with a "foot fetish" who abused children he was teaching has been given a six-year custodial sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Griffin, 20, of Cardiff, targeted seven girls and a boy, all under 10, biting, licking or tickling their feet.
He filmed some offences on his phone.
Griffin was handed six years in a young offenders' institution at the city's crown court, after admitting 13 sexual assaults and a count of false imprisonment.
The court heard the offences took place over a two-year period, as Griffin gave acrobatics and keep fit lessons.
Defence barrister Andrew Taylor said: "He has had a foot fetish since he was younger and has had sexual fantasies.
"Griffin said he's been stupid and abused his position of trust. He got sexual gratification from it."
Most of the assaults happened as he gave pupils lifts to and from the gym, the court heard.
In some cases he bound his victims' ankles, before licking or tickling their feet, while he tied one girl up and shut her in his car boot for a few minutes.
When he freed her he told her not to tell anyone or he would "get her mum in the night", while he bribed others to keep silent with 50p and Â£1 coins.
Prosecutor Caroline Rees said he "abused the trust" of parents, describing it as "deliberate and sophisticated targeting and grooming of children who were easily manipulated".
She described all his victims as from primary school and "vulnerable", with at least two upset that their parents had split up.
"He would arrange lifts to and from the club," she added.
"He was doing that for the purpose of gaining access to the children away from their parents."
In sentencing him, Judge Patrick Curran called it "the grossest breach of trust".
He added: "You adopted a method of selecting certain parents and certain children and targeted and groomed the children who were vulnerable "
Griffin was made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order which bars him from having contact with anyone under the age of 18 and made to sign the sexual offenders' register.
Following the sentencing, the Crown Prosecution Service's Wendy Brady said: "I hope that today's sentencing will be of some comfort to his young victims as well as their families, who continue to support them in dealing with the effects of Griffin's actions."
Det Sgt Annalisa Bartley, of South Wales Police, described Griffin as "dangerous and manipulative".
She said his victims have been on "a harrowing journey", adding: "Despite being so young and often very frightened, they have shown remarkable bravery in coming forward."
