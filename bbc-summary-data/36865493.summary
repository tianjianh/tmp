Swansea City are considering a bid for Liverpool's Wales midfielder Joe Allen.

Liverpool have accepted an offer of around £13m from Stoke for the 26-year-old but Swans chairman Huw Jenkins suggests the club could match the bid.
Swansea's American takeover has been completed and Allen, who the club sold to Liverpool for £15m in 2012, could be the new board's first signing.
"Joe is one of our own players and if at all possible we would probably make that signing," said Jenkins.
Jenkins revealed the Swans have already spoken to Liverpool about re-signing Allen, who has one year left on his Anfield contract, and confirmed the club will "put in a little bit more effort" now their American takeover has been finalised.
The Swansea chief also confirmed the club's interest in signing Tottenham Hotspur's Belgium winger Nacer Chadli after being linked with a £15m bid.
Liverpool rejected an £8m offer from the Swans in June but Allen, who was named in Uefa's team of Euro 2016 as Wales reached their first semi-final at a major tournament, is keen on a return to Swansea.
"We discussed it with Liverpool a few weeks back," confirmed Jenkins.
"Stoke have made an offer. The player will decide where he wants to go. Liverpool are asking a fair fee for the fact he has one year left on his contract but they are entitled to."
Allen started only eight league games for Liverpool last season and wants regular first-team football following his impressive performances at Euro 2016.
New American investor Jason Levien confirmed Swansea's interest in Allen.  "Thinking about how additions to the club will fit in with the current structure is something we spend a lot of time on, and he is someone who obviously has a great history here," he said.
"He is still a young player. He is someone who multiple clubs are interested in, us included.
"Huw and I are in ongoing discussions. We are leaning on his [Jenkins'] wisdom, and also the right kind of process to figure out whether that's the right addition for us, but he is someone we have our eye on."
Jenkins accepts Swansea "need two more strikers" and the clubs is "well down the line of looking at different options," including Spurs' Chadli.
The 26-year-old made just 10 starts in Spurs' Premier League title push last season and was left out of Belgium's Euro 2016 squad.
Chadli, however, is in Tottenham's squad to play in next week's International Champions Cup pre-season tournament in Australia where they face Italian champions Juventus in Melbourne on Tuesday.
"It has been publicised he is of interest to us," admitted Jenkins.
