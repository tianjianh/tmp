Newport County plight 'humiliates' manager Graham Westley

Manager Graham Westley says Newport County's run of eight successive league defeats is "painful" and has hurt his personal pride.

He won back to back promotions in his second spell at Stevenage.
But Westley's Exiles are bottom of League Two and five points from safety.
"It's embarrassing, humiliating even though in your own mind you can justify that you've inherited one bad run, a team that was doing a lot of losing," he said.
"You try and make a difference to it and it's painful. But I am quite philosophical.
"I did believe when I walked in the door that there were missing ingredients, we've gone into January and hopefully I'm showing I mean it and I can do something about it."
Since the January transfer window opened Westley has brought in eight new signings and is expecting more new arrivals before the end of the month as he bids to  help them avoid relegation.
"It's time for change, time for action and we are taking that action," Westley added.
"We were looking at the amount of promotions there are in the camp.
"Promotions get won by players who know how to win games consistently.
"It was surprising how few promotions there were amongst the players at the football club.
"Mickey Demetriou, of course, comes in having recently won a promotion out of League Two with Shrewsbury.
"So having a player in the camp who knows what it takes to win consistently on a Saturday and a Tuesday is important."
On Saturday the Exiles host Colchester with Demetriou unlikely to start.
On-loan midfielder Josh Sheehan is expected to be fit after missing last weekend's defeat at Stevenage while Jamie Turley, Lenell John-Lewis and Joss Labadie all remain sidelined.
