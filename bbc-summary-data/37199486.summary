Ex-Whitland Creamery site housing plans get go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build 28 new homes on a derelict dairy site have been given the go-ahead by Carmarthenshire council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors voted eight to six in favour of developing land on the former Whitland Creamery.
It had been recommended for refusal as the homes were proposed on land reserved for employment purposes.
The site should be redeveloped "for the benefit of the community", planning committee member Anthony Jones said.
Local councillor Sue Allen said the empty site was a "constant reminder of the past" and the town "needed to move forward".
Applicant Whitland Green Park Limited sought full planning permission to build a mixture of detached, semi-detached and terraced properties, along with a new access from Market Street.
A report which went before the planning committee said: "It is accepted that the site, in its vacant dilapidated state does detract from the character and appearance of the area and as such the proposal would serve to significantly improve the site's appearance."
But despite planning officers saying the benefits of the scheme did not outweigh the loss of employment land, the plan was approved, with one abstention.
The site has a long planning history - it formed part of the Whitland Creamery which closed in 1994, with many of the associated buildings demolished in 2003.
Redevelopment of the site has been a "firm objective" of Carmarthenshire council.
