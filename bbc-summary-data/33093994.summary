Engine fault to blame for Strathallan airfield crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An engine fault was responsible for a plane crashing in Perthshire in January, air accident investigators have concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The engine of the Cessna plane cut out at 3,000ft while taking off from Strathallan Airfield, near Auchterarder, on 17 January.
The pilot attempted to glide back to the airfield but overshot the runway, crashing through a fence and a hedge.
Neither the 55-year-old pilot or any of his five passengers were injured.
The newly-published report said piston rods in the engine had failed, cutting power and causing oil to spray across the windscreen.
