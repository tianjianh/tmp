Police said SAR Geelani recently organised an event in Delhi against the 2013 hanging of parliament attack convict Mohammed Afzal Guru.
The arrest comes days after a student leader from a top Indian university was charged with sedition over a campus rally against Guru's hanging.
Mr Geelani was also made a co-accused in the parliament attack case, but the Supreme Court cleared him in 2003.
Afzal Guru had always denied plotting the attack, which was carried out by Kashmiri militants and left 14 people dead.
Senior Delhi police officer Jatin Narwal told the PTI news agency that Mr Geelani was arrested on Tuesday after "examining media clips of the 10 February event".
He added that Mr Geelani was the "main organiser" of the function.
"The request for booking a hall for the event at the Press Club was done through Mr Geelani's e-mail and it was proposed to be a public meeting, which did not turn out to be so," the officer said.
