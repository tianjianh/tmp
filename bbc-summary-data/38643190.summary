Oldham Athletic: League One side exit transfer embargo

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham Athletic have confirmed that they have had their transfer embargo lifted and can now sign players again.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League One team had the embargo placed on them in November because of a Â£300,000 bill from HM Revenue & Customs and fees owed to other clubs.
The Latics won their first league game since 18 October on Saturday as they beat Gillingham 1-0 in boss John Sheridan's first game since returning.
Sheridan replaced Stephen Robinson, who was sacked after six months in charge.
"We'll have three or possibly four players in next week," Sheridan, 52, told BBC Radio Manchester after beating Gillingham..
"We need them and they can only add to what we've got and make us stronger."
