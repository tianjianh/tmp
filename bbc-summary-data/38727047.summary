Brentford 3-0 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford shrugged off Scott Hogan's transfer deadline day exit by sealing a first-ever victory over his new club, Aston Villa, in comprehensive fashion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As the striker underwent a medical at Villa Park ahead of a deal that could reach Â£12m, the Bees beat the Villans for the first time in 10 attempts.
Lasse Vibe chipped the hosts in front after being teed up by Nico Yennaris.
Yennaris poked in a second before the break and Vibe slotted in from Josh McEachran's pass to seal Villa's fate.
A first league meeting between the two sides at Griffin Park since February 1947 saw Villa field new signings Birkir Bjarnason and Conor Hourihane, while winger Florian Jozefzoon made his Brentford debut.
After a bright opening from Steve Bruce's side, when Alan Hutton's shot was saved by Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley and Jonathan Kodjia dragged wide, it was the hosts who took command.
Before Vibe stuck his fifth goal of the season midway through the first half, Harlee Dean had already nodded wide from a corner by Jota, whose pinpoint cross allowed Yennaris to turn in a Bees second from close range.
Spaniard Jota almost made it three as half-time approached, while Vibe found the side-netting as Brentford pushed for a third goal.
That came when Vibe collected McEachran's through ball and turned Hutton before slotting in expertly.
Brentford's victory, which could have been even more emphatic in the closing stages, was only their second in nine home games, while Villa have lost five of their last six away league games, failing to score in each of those defeats.
Brentford manager Dean Smith: "There was a freedom about the players tonight. We had pace down the flanks and that opened up the middle for us to pass through the lines really well.
"We had a debrief after the Chelsea game and talked about how quick and athletic Chelsea were and the quality they had and we said if you push yourselves there are no barriers to stop you getting to that level. They did tonight."
"With new signing Sergi Canos, Jota and Flo Jozefzoon, we have pace and a goal threat. I'd have loved Lasse to get his hat-trick but this was a team performance where our pressing after the first few minutes was exactly what we wanted and we put them under a lot of pressure."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce: "We started brightly enough and had chances. Then we had to be better for the next 60 minutes, but we were poor all over the pitch both offensively and defensively against a very good Brentford side."
"We can't just keep thinking we are going to buy our way out of it. We have to look like a team and do the basics and in this division if you don't do the basics right, you have horrible nights like this.
"As soon as we conceded we went all over the place and didn't do a job at all. We have to question ourselves because it has to be a mentality we have to try to find away from home, where we are too easily beaten."
