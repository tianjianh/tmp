England defender Laura Bassett says she has decided not to sign for a new club before this summer's Euros.

Bassett is a free agent after her previous side Notts County Ladies folded last month.
Speaking to BBC Sport, the 33-year-old said she had received interest from other teams but those opportunities were not right for her.
"I acknowledge that everyone will have an opinion on my decision but I have to trust myself," she said.
"I need to look after myself psychologically and be in the right frame of mind.
"To get the best out of me, I need to be motivated, committed and really believe whole heartedly in a club's direction and I wasn't sure that I felt that".
Notts Country were liquidated on the eve of the Women's Super League One Spring Series, meaning Bassett will play no club football before the European Championships in July.
To remain fit, the centre-back is training with her previous club Birmingham City, as well being given a bespoke training programme by England.
Mark Sampson named Bassett in his 23-player squad for the European Championships in April and she says the England manager has backed her decision.
"I've been in touch with Mark and his staff a lot, they've been so supportive and helpful in my decision," Bassett added.
"I'm making sure I cover the distances and replicating tournament football so as well as training with Birmingham, I'm absolutely shattered."
Bassett says she does plan to find a new team after the Euros but that she has not yet started this process.
"I'm excited about my next venture," she added. "I'm a free agent and open to talks but I don't know if that'll be in England or abroad."
