[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newcastle United 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United made it three straight Championship wins to end Brighton's unbeaten start to the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Jamaal Lascelles headed the Magpies in front from Matt Ritchie's free-kick before Yoan Gouffran hit the bar with a 25-yard shot.
Anthony Knockaert struck the woodwork for the visitors but they were reduced to 10 men when Sam Baldock was sent off for two yellow cards.
Jonjo Shelvey then curled in a free-kick to wrap up a comfortable win.
Newcastle began the season with back-to-back defeats by Fulham and leaders Huddersfield, but victories over Reading, Bristol City and now Brighton have seen them go into the international break fourth in the table.
Lascelles' free header from 15 yards gave them the perfect start and they created several other clear chances as Ritchie saw a shot saved by David Stockdale, while Gouffran also hit a half-volley over the bar.
Glenn Murray had a volley blocked by Lascelles and Knockaert hit the bar with a shot from 10 yards as the visitors started the second half brightly.
But once Baldock was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on home keeper Matz Sels the result was never in doubt.
Shelvey's free-kick doubled the lead and, although Sels produced a fine late save to deny Beram Kayal, Newcastle comfortably completed a first win over Brighton since 1990.
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez:
"It was important to win against a team going well with players and a manager who has experience in this division.
"We got a lot of the things we were looking for today but there is still room for improvement.
"The team has been working very hard. But when you want change and improvement, it takes time.
"It is good to have another win before the international break, and it would be good to carry it on, but we have a rest now."
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"I thought it (the sending-off) was harsh. If you watch the second challenge, the keeper kicks Sam. He is not that sort of player.
"Newcastle were very efficient but it feels like a missed opportunity. They scored from two set pieces and although they hit the bar, we had the better chances.
"We are disappointed because we felt we had a good chance today and we didn't pose as much of a threat as we should have."
