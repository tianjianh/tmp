Craig Disley and Danny East both went close for the visitors in a largely uneventful first half.
Sam Habergham had to be alert to clear a threatening Grimsby attack after the break, while Sean Marks shot over the bar for the Iron.
Disley went closest in the final minutes, rising to meet Richard Tait's cross, but his header hit the bar.

"It wasn't the prettiest of games. It very rarely is in truth when you come here.
"With the injuries we've picked up as well I'm happy with a clean sheet.
"We're in October, I don't think we've particularly had a bad spell of weather and we were hoping the pitch would be a bit better than it was."
