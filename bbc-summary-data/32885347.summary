Andre Marshall, 29, was found dead next to a car at Manor Park in Urmston, on Wednesday.
Police said Marshall, a member of the Moss Side Gooch Gang in Manchester who was jailed in 2008 for a gun attack, had been shot in his torso and leg.
An 18-year-old from Trafford is being held over his death, said Greater Manchester Police.
Marshall was jailed for assault and possession of a firearm following an attack at a gym in 2007.
His former gang was involved in clashes with rival gangs during the 1990s.
