[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 100 people have signed up for a naked cycle ride through Exeter to highlight how vulnerable cyclists are on the road.

The event has been organised by environmental campaigners as part of World Naked Bike Ride on 11 June.
Others rides are due to take place in London, Brighton, Southampton, Manchester, Sheffield, Bristol, Portsmouth and York.
Exeter organiser Maurice Spurway said total nudity was not compulsory.
"We're not expecting everyone to be naked - I'm not going to be totally naked," he told BBC News.
It has been described as a "peaceful, positive and fun protest exposing the need to rediscover non-oil-dependent modes of transport, and highlight the vulnerability of cyclists".
Mr Spurway is part of Exeter Cycle Vision, which aims to create a culture where cycling is the main way of getting about the city.
The car, he said, mitigated against that vision and he said he hoped the naked bike ride would be the "culture shock" needed to kickstart the process of "greening" the city.
Participants in the bike ride are being encouraged to paint their bodies.
"It'll be quite a splash as we cycle up the High Street," Mr Spurway added.
Organisers are meeting Devon and Cornwall Police later to discuss the event and acceptable levels of decency.
A police spokesman said while he respected the campaigners right to protest, he hoped common sense and respect would prevail and people would be sensible about their level of nudity.
Complete nudity, he said, was not acceptable, and officers would be obliged to uphold the law if complaints from the public were received.
