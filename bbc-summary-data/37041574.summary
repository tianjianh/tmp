GB goalkeeper George Pinner scrambled to save a Blake Govers shot in the second quarter to keep the scores level at half-time.
However Aran Zalewski sliced home in the fourth quarter, before Jacob Whetton nudged a second over the line.
GB's Ashley Jackson hit a late strike but the team slipped to fourth in Pool A before Friday's game against Spain.
The top four from each pool of six progress to the quarter-finals, which begin on Sunday.
"We came out wanting three points and we nearly salvaged a draw at the very end," said goalkeeper George Pinner.
"It is disappointing but it is the first time in this tournament we have really put up a proper performance and that is something we can build on going into our last game against Spain where we should know what we will have to do to get through".
The men were aiming to join Great Britain's women in qualifying for the quarter-finals, with the women having beaten Argentina 3-2 earlier in the day.
Although Australia had won just one of their pool games before the match, the World Cup winners were stronger as the game progressed.
Brazil suffered their fourth defeat of the tournament in Pool A, as Nick Wilson struck four times to give New Zealand a 7-0 victory.
