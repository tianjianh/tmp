The 25-year-old died in hospital on 30 September after being knocked down twice during his bout with Welsh fighter Dale Evans in Glasgow the previous evening.
His funeral service will take place in Dundee's St Andrew's Cathedral on Friday.
A mural commemorating the welterweight was unveiled in the city this week.
A statement from the Towell family said: "It is the family's hope that everyone who attends the service does so to celebrate Mike's life.
"We will always mourn losing him, but we hope everyone takes time to remember the enjoyment and smiles he brought into their lives.
"As a sign of this, we would ask that no one wears either black or red to the funeral, Mike didn't like the colour red.
"Also, we would request that there be no floral tributes, instead there will be a donation at the cathedral that will benefit charities close to the hearts of Mike and the family."
