An award-winning musician says seeing a giant mural of herself on the side of a club she went to as a teenager is "very, very surreal".

Cardiff singer Gwenno recently won the Welsh Music Prize 2015.
But those unaware of the artist before will now see her adorning the outside wall of Cardiff's famous venue Clwb Ifor Bach on Womanby Street.
The 34-year-old said she was " incredibly honoured" to see herself in the 12 x 38 metre mural.
"I remember Clwb when I was growing up, I probably went to see my first gig there, dragged along to a Welsh Language Society event with my mum," said Gwenno, whose full name is Gwenno Saunders.
"Clwb is a huge part of everyone's heritage from Wales, most bands have played here.
"I'm incredibly honoured that they thought my face was worth putting up there," added the singer, who recently became a mother to son, Nico.
Gwenno was first approached by designer Mark James about the mural, which he designed for the Get it right campaign.
The campaign aims to prevent piracy in music and television, by promoting the value of creativity in the UK and raising awareness of genuine online content services.
"Gwenno's album had just come out and was getting a lot of attention," Mr James said.
The sci-fi themed album Y Dydd Olaf, sung in both Welsh and Cornish, was inspired by Owain Owain's 1976 Welsh novel of the same name.
"The original idea was to be quite political and to make a statement," he said.
Mr James's design, one of Cardiff's largest street art projects, was sprayed painted onto the building by local street artists Rmer, Zadok and Karm, in under three days.
It will remain on the walls of Clwb Ifor Bach for the next six months.
