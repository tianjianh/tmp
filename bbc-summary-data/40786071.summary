[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maidstone's Stuart Lewis carried the main goal threat in a low-key first half, but was denied in the 13th minute by Myles Weston's well-judged tackle and in the 38th by a superb save from Nathan Ashmore.
It was Ebbsfleet who broke the deadlock in the 66th minute, though, when Luke Coulson cut in from the left and fired home in style.
Danny Kedwell made it 2-0 in the 77th minute after he was played in by Jack Powell and Lewis was sent off in stoppage time for a foul on Andy Drury.
