Ms Bladon's family said the student, from from Burton-upon-Trent, had been taking part in an archaeological dig that morning and described her as a "talented musician" and "enthusiastic rugby player".
The train was busy at the time of the attack as Christians marked Good Friday and Jews celebrated Passover.
A pregnant woman and a 50-year-old man were also injured when the tram came to a sudden stop in the aftermath of the attack.
