An investigation into suspected people smuggling has been launched after footage of people climbing out of cars on a transporter was passed to the BBC.

The video, taken in Rochester, Kent, shows four men and a woman getting out of new Citroen vehicles in Laker Road, near to the M2 motorway on Tuesday.
The car transporter is believed to have originated in Lithuania.
The Home Office said it had started an investigation into the "suspected facilitation of people smuggling".
Maggie Brown, an employee at a business on a Rochester industrial estate, filmed one of two clips of the incident sent to BBC South East, from behind mirrored glass.
She said she watched the driver climb on to the second level of the transporter and then tap on the cars to signal to the people inside to get out.
"One got out and he [the driver] went further along and then obviously another got out.
"One at a time they were just getting out.
"We don't have things like that happening round where we work. To actually see that, it's like 'Oh my god what's going on'."
She added: "The scary side was how easy it was for him to park up and for them to actually come out of the cars.
"I was absolutely astounded by the fact that we were actually watching it at the time. You don't expect it to be on your doorstep."
Immigration officials were due to talk to Ms Brown and her colleagues about the incident on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: "This is now an ongoing Home Office investigation into a suspected facilitation of people smuggling and it would be inappropriate to comment further."
