Manny Pacquiao beat Timothy Bradley by unanimous decision in what the Filipino says is the final fight of his career.

All three judges scored Pacquiao winner by 116-110 on Saturday in the match between the pair in Las Vegas.
Pacquiao, 37, knocked down American Bradley, 32, in the seventh and ninth rounds in the third welterweight meeting between the two.
"I've made a commitment to my family that I'm going to retire after this," said Pacquiao.
Pacquiao, who bounced back from a split-decision defeat by Bradley in 2012 with a decisive win two years later, looked the more menacing fighter after a cagey opening round.
Bradley landed occasionally but Pacquiao caught the American on the chin in the second round and stretched his lead further with a knockdown in the seventh.
A second knockdown followed in the ninth, despite a Bradley left-hook wobbling the Filipino a round earlier, as Pacquiao coasted home in the 66th fight of a career in which he has won world titles at six weights.
"Maybe I enjoy being a retired man, serving the people, helping the people," added Pacquiao, who said before the fight he wishes to concentrate on a political career in the Philippines.
