US election daily dig: Schwarzenegger wishes he was running

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With just two weeks until America goes to the polls, Arnold Schwarzenegger is sad he can't run, Donald Trump is fighting back over sexual assault claims, and President Obama is really happy.

First, let's spend a minute thinking about what could have been.
"If I'd been born in America, I would've run," says Arnold Schwarzenegger, in an interview with AdWeek. "Because now? This was a very good time to get in the race."
Sadly, because the actor-turned-politician was born in Austria, we'll never know who would have won in a (primary) battle between Schwarzenegger and Donald Trump.
Judging by his comments earlier this month, he would have put up more of a fight than the other Republican candidates.
Anyway, back in the real world, Donald Trump continued his offensive on Monday against the women who have accused him of sexual assault.
Talking about the allegations at a rally in Florida, he said: "One said, 'He grabbed me on the arm.' And she's a porn star," before adding: "Oh, I'm sure she's never been grabbed before."
He was referring to Jessica Drake, a 42-year-old adult film star who says the Republican nominee grabbed her and kissed her without permission 10 years ago.
Mr Trump denies the claims and has vowed to sue the accusers after the election. We've got a round-up of the accusations and Mr Trump's response to each here.
It's not all plain sailing for Hillary Clinton though, with her links to the FBI coming under scrutiny again.
On Monday, it was revealed that a political committee for Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe gave nearly $500,000 to help fund an election campaign of Dr Jill McCabe, the wife of an FBI official.
That's awkward for Mrs Clinton because Mr McAuliffe is a long-term friend of both her and Bill, and the FBI official later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs Clinton's email use.
Like many of the scandals that have been linked to the Democratic nominee, it's confusing and unclear how, if at all, she was involved - but it's news she could do without.
One group of voters that Donald Trump has found it difficult to woo is millennials, with one USA Today poll earlier this month giving Hillary Clinton a 48% lead over the Republican. The BBC's Franz Strasser has been out to speak to young Trump supporters in North Carolina to find out why they're standing behind the businessman. You can watch his full report above - it includes this great quote: "The slime will only get slimier."
On what led to Mr Trump's candidacy, Katty Kay has come up with 10 reasons why The Donald ended up as the Republican candidate, including the financial crash, Uber and the LGBT movement. You can read her full piece here: Driverless cars and other reasons we have Trump.
And Aleem Maqbool has been to Virginia to see if the allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding Donald Trump have stifled support among America's Christian evangelical churches, traditionally a reliable source of Republican votes. Watch the video below to find out.

Donald Trump remains in Florida, holding a rally in Sanford then another at the Tallahassee Car Museum in the evening. Mike Pence, his running mate, is in Ohio.
Hillary Clinton is also in Florida, holding two rallies during the day before attending a fundraising event in Miami in the evening. Her running mate Tim Kaine is also attending fundraising events, but in Connecticut and New York.
Mrs Clinton's army of surrogates are also out on the road, with her husband Bill campaigning in North Carolina and her daughter Chelsea in Wisconsin. Vice President Joe Biden is taking the Democratic nominee's case to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Senator Elizabeth Warren is in North Carolina.
