Eve Muirhead's rink won 8-6 in Glasgow to make it six wins from six at the Braehead Arena.
However, Tuesday was a bad day for the Scottish men, who suffered defeats to Finland and Germany.
The Finns edged the morning session 6-5 to pick up their first win of the contest, while Germany triumphed 4-2.
It leaves Tom Brewster's rink in a tie for fifth place on three victories and four defeats, with defending champions Sweden the only team already guaranteed a place in the semi-finals after six wins - their sole defeat coming against the Scots.
Brewster and his team meet Italy and Russia on Wednesday needing two wins to keep their hopes of progress alive.
The men require a top-seven finish in the standings to book Scotland a place at next year's World championship, which is vital for Olympic qualifying points.
Standings: Sweden (6-1) Q, Norway, Switzerland (5-2), Russia (4-3), Austria, Germany, Italy, Scotland (3-4), Denmark (2-5), Finland (1-6)
Standings: Scotland (6-0), Sweden (5-1), Czech Republic, Denmark, Russia (4-2), Germany, Switzerland (3-3), Finland (1-5), Italy, Norway (0-6)
