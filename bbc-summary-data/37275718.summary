During her final appearance on the show on Monday afternoon, she thanked viewers and her fellow panellists for their support over the years.
Hewson said: "Thank you to everybody out there who has cared about me and my family, and watched them grow up.
"It has been fantastic. Thank you so much for everything, every tweet, every message you have sent me."
Hewson received a collage of some of her most memorable moments on the show and one of her co-stars, Coleen Nolan, sang her a song in tribute.
She thanked her fellow panellists for being there for her during "those very bad times" over the years.
"I love them all, they've been so good and wonderful," she added.
Hewson was also surprised by appearances from her Benidorm co-star Jake Canuso and former Coronation Street co-star Kevin Kennedy.
This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes also paid tribute to Hewson in pre-recorded messages.
Hewson announced in August that she would be stepping down from her role as a Loose Woman, stating that the programme was "in my DNA".
