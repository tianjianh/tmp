Rio 2016: What was your weekend's Olympic highlight?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's been an action-packed, and medal-packed, weekend at the Rio Olympics for Team GB.

A 15th gold of the Games has put Team GB second in the table, with 38 medals in total by the end of the weekend.
And it wasn't just Team GB that did well, super sprinter Usain Bolt claimed a record third 100m title.
So what was your best moment from this weekend's Olympic action? Was it gymnast Max Whitlock winning two gold medals or maybe it was Usain Bolt's incredible win?

I have watched the athletics that Mo Farah has won in, the swimming, the gymnastics, the cycling, the rowing and many more but Newsround has kept me updated with all the top Olympic stories.

My favourite moment of Rio 2016 was when Jessica Ennis-Hill won her silver medal as she is my true athletic idol.  I actually woke up at 2:45 am to watch her 800m.

Our favourite part about the Olympics was seeing our dad - who's a GB coach - on TV and how happy he was when GB won the gold medals.

My favourite moment of the Olympics this year so far has been Giles Scott securing a gold medal with a race to spare in the sailing men's single hander class - the Finn.
