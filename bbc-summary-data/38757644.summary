Aberdeenshire Council pushes ahead with Inverurie HQ move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeenshire councillors have agreed to move forward with plans to relocate the authority's headquarters from Aberdeen to Inverurie.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The current offices at Woodhill House in Aberdeen and Gordon House in Inverurie would be moved to a purpose-built facility at Harlaw in Inverurie.
Councillors instructed officers to negotiate a deal and a masterplan will be drawn up.
The aim is smaller, more flexible and cheaper offices.
Plans will also be considered to consolidate existing offices in Ellon and expand facilities in Stonehaven.
Aberdeenshire is the only local authority authority in Scotland to have its headquarters outside its boundary.
