[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron's victory over a Cobblers side watched from the stand by newly appointed boss Justin Edinburgh closed the gap at the top to just one point after Sheffield United went down 4-1 at Walsall.
A tepid opening period came to life when Kevin Van Veen twice went close, heading wide from close range before seeing Adam Smith save his low drive from the edge of the box.
Cobblers created a couple of openings, Matt Taylor being denied by Luke Daniels who then thwarted Marc Richards.
But Scunthorpe broke the deadlock in the 21st minute when Stephen Dawson's cross was headed home by Van Veen from close range.
John-Joe O'Toole fired wide and Hoskins was denied again by Daniels. But Cobblers equalised three minutes before the interval when Alex Revell headed home Taylor's near-post cross.
After the restart, Van Veen fired wide before Cobblers got on top and Zander Diamond twice went close. From Taylor's cross, Diamond saw his header thump the upright before heading over from close range.
But Scunthorpe also had a couple of decent chances as the half progressed, Van Veen firing over before Morris hit the bar from a free-kick with Smith well beaten and Craig Davies headed over for the visitors.
Scunthorpe had the better late chances, as Harry Toffolo headed over, Smith denied Duane Holmes and when the ball ran loose Morris volleyed over. But the visitors won it in the 83rd minute when Diamond's clearing header only fell to Morris on the edge of the box and he curled into the top corner.
