The uprising lasted just six days before the rebels surrendered. The insurrection was not universally popular, but when 16 of the leaders were put to death, anti-British sentiment began to take hold in Ireland.
The Easter Rising laid the foundations for an Irish civil war six years later, and eventually the formation of a new Republic of Ireland.
