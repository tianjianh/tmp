The Australia head coach, captain and chairman of selectors will all report to the 37-year-old former rugby union international.
Howard has previously served as Australian Rugby Union's (ARU) high-performance manager.
"It is a great opportunity for anybody interested in sports leadership," Howard said.
The job is a new position, recommended by the Argus Review instigated in the wake of the Test team's 3-1 Ashes series defeat at home to England.
Howard, who played 20 times for the Wallabies, added: "The timing of the new role off the back of Argus Review makes this an exciting time in Australian cricket."
The Queenslander will start work in Brisbane in mid-November.
Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said that Howard's experience in elite sport was a key factor in his appointment.
He said: "He has a background of success as a player, selector and coach, including 20 Tests as an Australian [rugby] player, as well as playing and coaching success with Leicester Tigers in England.
"He was also a high-performance GM [general manager] with the ARU.
"He brings vital qualities in what is a pivotal new role with a singular focus on Australian team performance.
"His priority will be ensuring that all of Australia's high-performance cricket programmes dovetail in a manner that helps us produce the best men's and women's teams in the world."
One of Howard's first tasks will be helping to choose a new head coach to replace Tim Nielsen, who quit after the recent tour of Sri Lanka. Australia are currently touring South Africa, with Troy Cooley acting as interim coach.
