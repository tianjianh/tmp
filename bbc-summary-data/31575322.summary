The latest march, in central Istanbul, was one of the demonstrations prompted by the recent murder of a 20-year-old Turkish woman.
Ozgecan Aslan, a university student, was killed in an attempted rape.
"The way of thinking that 'a woman wearing a miniskirt deserves rape' is sick," said Ali Erkazan, who represented the men wearing the skirts.
"We demand, as democratic and intellectual men of this country, freedom for women, free expression, opportunities for women, and equal rights for women as for men."
Men and women marched through the streets carrying photographs of Aslan, whose body was found on 13 February in a riverbed in the southern province of Mersin.
She had last been seen two days earlier on a minibus, the driver of which has since confessed to killing her and mutilating her body, Turkish media reports.
He was arrested along with his father and one other man.
