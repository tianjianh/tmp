Hull FC hopes to raise Â£50,000 from supporters and businesses for youngsters to attend matches in the 2016 season that kicks-off in February.
Hull is ranked as the third most deprived local authority in England.
Gareth Ellis, the club's captain, said: "As a club we can make a massive difference to people."
The scheme is to give youngsters from some of the city's less affluent areas a chance to see live sport at the KC Stadium, where the rugby league club plays its games. It includes transport to games, food and the chance of an arts qualification.
Luke Medcalf, from community centre Hessle Road Network, that is involved in the scheme said: "There used to be a hustle and bustle around this area with the fish trade.
"That went and left a big hole where people filled it with a lot of bad things including drugs, domestic violence and crime."
The scheme is also in memory of Bradley Parker, a former Hull FC and England youth rugby league player who died in a car accident.
According to The Index of Multiple Deprivation, that includes income, employment and health among seven components, in 2015 Hull was the third most-deprived local authority in England (out of 326).
Seven of Hull's wards are amongst the 1% of the most-deprived in England.
