[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge University is looking for a 'doctor of chocolate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scientists and chocolate fans are being given the chance to indulge their sweet tooth by becoming a doctor of chocolate at Cambridge University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A researcher is being sought for a PhD on chocolate by the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
The challenge is to stop chocolate melting in warm climates by studying the "fundamentals of heat-stable chocolate".
Candidates wishing to study chocolate need to apply by 29 August.
The would-be doctor of chocolate will be expected to "investigate the factors which allow chocolate, which has a melting point close to that of the human body, to remain solid and retain qualities sought by consumers when it is stored and sold in warm climates".
The research project is "mainly experimental", but will require good mathematical skills, the advertisement says.
