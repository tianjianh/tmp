The 27-year-old, nicknamed 'Beef', broke into the world's top 100 by finishing eighth at Royal Troon.
That came three months after he won his first European Tour title with victory in the Spanish Open at Valderrama.
"At The Open I'd come off and maybe sign five or 10 autographs... now it's more like 40, 50, 60," Johnston told BBC Radio 5 Live. "It was crazy."
The Englishman is preparing to play in the US PGA Championship, which starts on Thursday.
"You've got to find the right balance," he said. "I love spending time and signing stuff. I think that is really important, but you have to find that balance.
"To have won the Spanish Open and come eighth at The Open... it's great, but there are seven people ahead of me, so it could be better."
Johnston has been grouped with the United States' Scott Piercy and Swede Alex Noren for the opening two rounds at Baltusrol in New Jersey.
The trio will tee off at 17:35 BST on Thursday.
