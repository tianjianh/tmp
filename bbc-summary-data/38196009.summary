[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Nisbet, 72, died after his cab was involved in collision on the A1 in East Lothian at around 12:30 on 27 November.
Police believe he picked up his last customer at about midnight, before dropping them in the Wallyford area 30 minutes later.
Sgt Roger Park said the person might have information which could help the police investigation.
He added: "We continue to work to establish the full circumstances surrounding John's death and our condolences remain with his family and friends at this difficult time.
"As part of our inquiries, we're very keen to trace the person or persons who used this taxi shortly before the collision itself.
"I want to stress that they are not in any trouble whatsoever, but we believe that they may have information which can help with our investigation."
Mr Nisbet, from Edinburgh, was driving his London Taxi TX1 when it collided with a Peugeot Boxer.
The accident happened on the southbound carriageway between Old Craighall and Wallyford, near Musselburgh.
Earlier this week Mr Nisbet's son Eddie said his father's death "left a void that will be impossible to fill".
