Mike Forney put them into the lead late in the first period with Kris Beech making it 2-0 early in the second.
Michael Dorr scored Fife's goal but further scores in the final period by Beech and Mike Radja wrapped up the Belfast victory.
The Giants are now just three points behind  leaders the Cardiff Devils.
Cardiff, level on points with second-placed Sheffield, still have to play the Giants three times in the title run-in.
The Giants face Braehead on Saturday night, this time at the SSE Arena in Belfast.
