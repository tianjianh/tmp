The rock music festival, which takes place at Donington Park, in Leicestershire, will have armed police at the site over the weekend.
Supt Martyn Ball, from Leicestershire Police, said armed police would help make people feel "safe and secure".
About 80,000 people are expected to attend the site over the next few days.
Supt Ball said armed officers would be there to support their unarmed colleagues.
"Following the tragic events that happened in Manchester and London, I think there's a public expectation in relation to this.
"The feedback we've had has all been positive over police carrying firearms.
"In fact we've had comments from parents on social media suggesting that their son or daughter wouldn't come to the festival unless there were armed officers there to make sure they felt safe and secure."
However, he said this would not stop officers having fun with festival goers.
"Download has got a great reputation, as have Leicestershire Police, for being so engaging.
"Selfies with the cops, smiling, swapping hats, absolutely all that sort of stuff, I'm still anticipating on happening over the next few days."
Festival goers are advised to leave extra time to get through enhanced security searches.
