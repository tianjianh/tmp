[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool defender Joe Gomez looks set to miss the rest of the season after suffering a serious knee injury.

The full-back, 18, suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in England U21s' 3-0 win over Kazakhstan.
Gomez had made five Premier League appearances since joining the Reds in a Â£3.5m move from Charlton in June.
He was replaced with 10 minutes remaining of England's European Championship qualifying victory at Coventry's Ricoh Arena on Tuesday.
England U21 manager Gareth Southgate had initially played down the injury as "nothing too serious".
But new Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp looks set to be without the defender for the duration of his maiden campaign at Anfield.
