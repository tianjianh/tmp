[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Calum Butcher is available for Millwall after missing Tuesday's league win over Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Ben Thompson and forward Lee Gregory are both rated as 50-50.
Goal-shy Leicester have problems up front as record signing Islam Slimani, who has six goals in 18 games, misses the trip with a groin problem.
Leonardo Ulloa is also likely to be unavailable due to a thigh injury as manager Claudio Ranieri prepares to make wholesale changes.
Guy Mowbray: "The last time Millwall faced the previous season's Premier League champions was in the 2004 FA Cup final. By then, Manchester United had already lost their crown (to Arsenal's 'Invincibles') but they were never in any danger of losing to the Lions.
"Leicester could be - and manager Claudio Ranieri knows it to the extent of labelling his side 'underdogs' in the tie. Yes, really. The boss of the champions of England has hinted that they're second favourites against a team from the third tier - albeit one in flying form with a fireproof defence.
"Clever reverse psychology to get his much-changed team up for the test, or just muddled thinking that sums up the Foxes' current mess?"

Millwall manager Neil Harris: "The team spirit is excellent and individually and collectively we are playing really well.
"This is a huge game for us, the players and the fans are really looking forward to it but I will admit that my mind has already turned to Chesterfield on Tuesday."
Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri: "Our target is the Premier League - that is it. Of course we play in the FA Cup and Champions League and we want to do our best, but our aim is to be safe at the end. The goal is the Premier League.
"I want to give another opportunity to the players who played against Derby for them to show how good they are.
"Believe me, I don't think about Sevilla (in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday), I think about Millwall."
Leicester are in a serious mess if they can't go away to Millwall and avoid defeat at the very least.
Prediction: 1-2
