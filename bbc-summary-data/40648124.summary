After the first-leg 1-1 draw, Dundalk looked on course for a famous European success as Brian Gartland headed them into a 12th-minute advantage.
But after David McMillan missed a great chance to extend Dundalk's lead, Yann-Erik De Lanlay levelled on 43 minutes.
Matthias Vilhjalmsson nodded Rosenborg's winner early in extra-time.
Ciaran Kilduff struck the Rosenborg crossbar with a fierce half-volley just before the end of the first period of extra-time but Dundalk were unable to get on terms as they bowed out of Europe after their long run last season.
After their heroics in reaching the group stage of the Europa League last season, Dundalk looked in line for another notable European triumph as Gartland's downward header put them ahead on 12 minutes after a Michael Duffy corner.
The key moment of the match then came four minutes as the unmarked McMillan had a pointblank headed chance to double Dundalk's head but his powerful effort was directed straight at Rosenborg keeper Andre Hansen.
After looking decided shaky early on, Rosenborg began to gather themselves with Mike Jensen impressing in their midfield.
Outstanding Dundalk defender Niclas Vemmelund made a couple of brilliant blocks to keep the Irish champions ahead as half-time neared.
However just as was the case at Oriel Park, Rosenborg levelled just before the interval as a clever flick on by former Arsenal player Niklas Bendtner allowed Jensen to release De Lanlay to equalise.
The home side had the better of the second-half action and Bendtner missed a fine opportunity to put his side in front.
But the Norwegians did take the lead eight minute into extra-time as Icelandic substitute Vilhjalmsson looped a header over Gary Rogers.
Dundalk sub Kilduff struck the Rosenborg woodwork before the end of the first period of extra-time but the home side controlled the second period to progress.
