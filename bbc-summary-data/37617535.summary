Wales lock Jake Ball is also back along with Scotland back-rower John Barclay.
It is only the second time this season for Davies to partner Williams in Scarlets' midfield.
Former Wales and Scarlets scrum-half Mike Phillips returns to west Wales with Sale, as does lock Jonathan Mills.
The Sharks make three changes with a first start of the season for full-back Mike Haley, and Dan Mugford coming in at fly-half and Ross Harrison at prop.
Sale lie seventh in the English Premiership with two wins in six games while Scarlets are also seventh in the Pro12 with three wins in their six matches.
Holders Saracens travel to deposed champions Toulon earlier in the day in the same group.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac: "What is clear is we're in a very tough pool, but having said that, the majority of them are pretty tough.
"I think it's a good thing from a players' point of view, if I was a player out there I'd want to pit myself against some of the best.
"We'll be going out giving it everything we've got to get a result.
"We'll worry about the other games when they come along. The home games are must wins if you want to get out of the pool."
Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond: " We're probably two or three points behind where I thought we would be at the break.
"We worked hard for the whole of last year to qualify and it is a fantastic group I think. We are up and down at a team at the minute and we need to get some consistency.
"I think I've been there five times as a player and coach and lost five times, it is a difficult place to go as they are a massive club.
"It will be a big test for us as I think we're about equal as teams."
