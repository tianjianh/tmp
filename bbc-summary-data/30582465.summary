2014: Things we now know... that we didn't a year ago

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Last Christmas you probably didn't know the following things.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From biting at the World Cup to random acts involving very cold water - Newsbeat looks at the mad, bad and sad things we've learned in the last 12 months.
When Uruguay's star player Luis Suarez bit a rival player at the World Cup we all though it was game over for the then Liverpool striker.
It was, but not for long.
He was banned for four months but did it dent the 27-year-old's long-term career like all the pundits said it would? Not really.
Despite the fact he'd been accused of biting opponents several times before, he signed a deal reportedly worth Â£75m with legendary Spanish club Barcelona. And he earns around Â£10m a year.
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014. Nothing has ever been found; no debris, nothing.
Initial theories suggested the aircraft had exploded mid-air but no fragments were discovered in the epic search across thousands of miles of ocean.
The fate of the 227 passengers and 12 crew on board may never be known.
With this photo, taken during the 2014 Oscars ceremony, Ellen DeGeneres did what every social media editor, showbiz journo and marketing exec dreams about: she created the monster meme. It's probably the most copied photo of the year - and if it doesn't make you smile, you are probably Kim Jong-un.
The image of host DeGeneres with Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep and Kevin Spacey has since been valued, a bit crazily in our view, at $1bn in terms of its social media and marketing power.
Oh look it's Russell Brand confusing himself with the Messiah.
Quite a few TV shows also appeared to do the same and may well have built a little Russell shrine in their offices. It wasn't so fun engaging with those pesky newspapers.
Brand did serious battle with the Daily Mail and The Sun who said his revolutionary talk was hypocritical, because of his personal wealth.
In response Brand, with his lovingly straightened chest hair (Google it), said things like this about the "system" that made him a star: "A system that has posited me on a lilo made of thighs in an ocean filled with honey and foie gras'd my Essex arse with undue praise and money."
It was too close to call for a long time there but in the end Scotland voted no to splitting up with the rest of the UK.
The referendum on independence did something a bit special, though. It proved there's a *HUGE* appetite for politics among 16 to 25-year-olds, and it reopened the debate over whether 16-year-olds should get the vote in all future UK elections.
Meanwhile at Westminster the big conversation was around bacon sandwiches and how weird party leaders look eating them.
Gary Lineker once said this about the beautiful game: "Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win."
And for once England fans found themselves enjoying a German triumph at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Why? Because England had the decency to bow out of the tournament without raising any hopes of glory whatsoever (in the group stages, for the first time since 1958).
*We may have already known Germany always win
Apple marked the iPhone 6 launch by slipping a copy of the ageing Irish band's latest album into every account, deliberately "infecting" gadgets with some people's idea of musical malware.
Newsbeat showed you how to zap it off your iTunes for good.
Just about everybody did the Ice Bucket Challenge, from former presidents to Justin Bieber (pictured), to your brother.
Here's a gallery of lots of people trying not to swear as ice-cold water sloshes down their tops.
But what was the charity you were all raising money for, hmmmm?
It was the story that itself could have been a movie plotline.
Sony Pictures prepares to release The Interview, a fictional tale about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, starring Seth Rogen.
Sony then suffers a string of cyber attacks, which the FBI later confirms came from North Korea. Emails are leaked which don't make Sony execs look very good*.
The hackers then issue a threat to cinemas, warning of a "bitter fate" to any venue planning to screen it. Sony then pulls the film. President Obama says that was a "mistake" - and asks why didn't they call him first? (Because we all have POTUS on speed-dial, right?)
The latest in the saga is that a small chain of theatres in Texas will show the comedy (Note: COMEDY, not real) on Christmas Day.
*The emails make Sony execs look pretty bad. Two of those who featured a lot, Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin, have since apologised.
If anyone could broker world peace in these fragile times, Newsbeat's vote goes to Dolly Parton.
Not only did she manage to pull the biggest crowd of any artist at Glastonbury 2014 (beating fellow headliners Metallica and Arcade Fire), but the country legend said awesome things like this: "I grew up in the country, so this mud ain't nothing new to me - and it ain't nothing to you either."
One flag in the crowd read: "Dolly, take me to your bosom."
