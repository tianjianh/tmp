Yoann Barbet, Tom Field and Lasse Vibe were all on target for the Championship outfit in the opening 23 minutes.
Eastleigh midfielder Ayo Obileye pulled one back, but Field grabbed his second and Romaine Sawyers also struck for the Bees before the break.
Brentford dominated possession as they saw out the second half to progress.
Former Brentford boss Martin Allen only named four substitutes on his return and his Eastleigh side got off to the worst possible start when goalkeeper Graham Stack brought down Vibe in the area and Barbet netted from the spot.
Winger Field then nodded in at the far post from Sawyers' clever cross to score his first senior goal and double the hosts' lead on 17 minutes.
Vibe smartly curled in Brentford's third before Bees keeper Daniel Bentley spilled a corner for Obileye to tap in, but any hope of an Eastleigh comeback was short-lived as 19-year-old Field slid an effort beyond Stack and Sawyers fired in from outside the box.
Brentford are back in Championship action next Saturday (15:00 GMT) when they face promotion-chasing Newcastle, while Eastleigh host Forest Green in the National League on Tuesday.
Brentford boss Dean Smith: "I wanted work-rate, attitude and application - and they gave me all three.
"When I picked my team the fans knew we wanted to progress to the next round and we were very professional throughout.
"I knew they would pose problems from set-pieces but I expected us to be quicker, fitter and stronger. We knew we had to apply ourselves and that's exactly what we did."
Eastleigh manager Allen: "I thought our players were superb from start to finish. We had good chances at 3-1 down. I asked them at half-time to do their families proud - it could have been a real tanking - and they did that.
"I couldn't ask any more from them and they got a standing ovation from the Brentford fans. Despite the result it was a great day for me personally.
"I've been here a month now and we have got a mix-and-match squad still. It's like a box of Quality Street."
