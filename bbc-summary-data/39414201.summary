Winger Marc Albrighton is available after missing the win over Stoke due to sickness, although Demarai Gray is likely to keep his place in the side.
Sunderland's top scorer Jermain Defoe is a doubt with an unspecified problem.
Manager David Moyes said at Monday's pre-match press conference: "Defoe didn't train yesterday. I can't give you any more of an update than that."
Lee Cattermole could his first appearance since September after a hip problem, while Victor Anichebe might also be available.
Conor McNamara: "Just over a month ago these clubs were both in the relegation zone with only two league places separating them.
"It seems incredible, but if Craig Shakespeare's side win this game - and other results go their way - Leicester could be 11 places ahead of Sunderland by Wednesday night.
"Shakespeare has been like a defibrillator for Leicester. The Foxes heartbeat is pumping again with five wins in a row in all competitions.
"Sunderland - without as much as a goal in their last five games - can only dream of such a jolt, their pulse still stubbornly flatlining at the foot of the table."

Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: "I'm not looking too far ahead in terms of where we can finish. I'm just making sure there's no complacency and we stay focused for the next game.
"We want to make sure that not only are we safe but that we climb up the league, and the only way to do that is to approach every game as if it's a cup final."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "While there's still a mathematical chance [of survival] we need to keep going. This was always going to be a pivotal week.
"In the position we're in it's going to take a really good go. We need to start winning games back to back.
"Leicester are in good form but they have some big games coming up. Hopefully we can catch them on an off night."
