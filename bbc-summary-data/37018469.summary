[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an even opening, the hosts took the lead when Oliver Hawkins flicked on a long ball and Luke Guttridge caressed the ball over the onrushing Paul Farman.
Adam Marriott tried to respond for the Imps in the second half, but shot just wide.
Lincoln boss Danny Cowley was left to rue a big miss for his side 15 minutes from time. Jack Muldoon and substitute Harry Anderson delivered the ball to Jonny Margetts, who lashed over when well-placed from 12 yards.
The Daggers were content to hold on and see out a third win in four to start the campaign.
