The 34-year-old was released by Doncaster in the summer after scoring 21 goals in 80 games in two seasons.
Tyson, who scored a second-half goal for the Cumbrians in the friendly against Queen of the South on Monday also had spells at Wycombe and Derby.
"We're always on the hunt for good players and there are no strings attached to trial periods like this," manager Keith Curle said.
