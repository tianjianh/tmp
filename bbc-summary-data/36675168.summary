[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Toye, 29, of St Nicholas Road, Great Yarmouth, jailed for six years for killing his son Baylee Varley who died in 2014.
Norwich Crown Court was told Baylee had suffered brain and retinal injuries in 2008 consistent with shaking.
A detective said it had been their intention "to give Baylee a voice".
Judge Mr Justice Spencer said Toye's failure to acknowledge his involvement in his son's death six years after he was injured in 2008 was "an aggravating factor".
He told Toye though there was no doubt that he loved Baylee "your culpability remains high because the victim was a tiny, defenceless baby".
Det Con Mike Proctor said: "This has been an extremely tragic investigation from the very beginning, an investigation which has spanned several years and resulted in the eventual conviction of a father for the death of his own son.
"Baylee's early death was sadly inevitable given the extent of the catastrophic injuries he suffered when only a few weeks old.
"Our intention throughout this investigation has been to give Baylee a voice and to seek appropriate justice for him as today's sentence reflects."
