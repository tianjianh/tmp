It was held to commemorate the 96 Liverpool fans who died during the crush at the FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
Former Liverpool player Alan Kennedy, politician Andy Burnham and ex-Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm ran at the event in Liverpool's Stanley Park.
Liverpool FC Foundation and Everton in the Community also supported the event.
Actor Les Dennis said he was taking part to "keep the memory alive" of what happened at Hillsborough.
It was organised by Dom Williams, who created the annual Hillsborough-Anfield Run that involves runners completing 96 miles between the stadiums of Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool FC.
Later, Liverpool will face Aston Villa in the 2015 FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.
On Wednesday, bells in Liverpool tolled 96 times to mark the disaster's anniversary.
Thousands of people also joined the victims' families and Liverpool FC footballers at a memorial service in Anfield stadium.
The new inquests into the deaths of the 96 fans will resume on 20 April at Birchwood Park in Warrington.
They started in March 2014 and are expected to continue until early 2016.
