Hull's Arsenal loanee Chuba Akpom broke the deadlock shortly into extra time but Matt Crooks equalised.
Greg Luer's header put Hull back in front three minutes later, but Terry Gornell took the game to penalties.
Both sides missed two of their first five penalties to send the spot-kicks into sudden death before Crooks fired over after Curtis Davies scored.
Hull City boss Steve Bruce told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I thought they were well organised, well drilled and have got some good players as well.
"We were lackadaisical and we weren't playing as quick as we should do. We played like it was a pre-season friendly and sometimes that happens when you come to places like this and that's what it looked like tonight.
"We've got a lot of young players and the experience of tonight will do them well."
