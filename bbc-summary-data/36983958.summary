Greyhound breeder George Thompson jailed over drugs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 60-year-old greyhound breeder who trafficked drugs in the Lothians and Borders has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Thompson, from Livingston, was convicted of supplying cocaine and amphetamines worth Â£500,000 between July and November 2014.
Some of the drugs were found in his van when police stopped and searched it on the A7 two years ago.
Thompson was ordered to serve nine years following a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The court heard that surveillance officers had watched as he made contact with three men who were stopped in possession of illegal drugs shortly after meeting him. All were later convicted of drugs offences.
They then stopped Thompson's transit van on the A7 road, near the village of Heriot, in Midlothian, in November 2014 and found a kilogramme of cocaine hidden in a compartment.
A search of his home later revealed two bags containing more than 82g of amphetamine stored in freezer drawers.
Three kilogrammes of high-purity cocaine and a kilogramme of amphetamine were also recovered at kennels used by Thompson.
Lord Bannatyne told him that the offences were "undoubtedly serious matters" and "involved a large amount of drugs and those drugs had a substantial value".
The judge said it was not a case, such as often came before the courts, of a courier caught on one day who often had a drug problem and debts.
Sentencing Thompson to nine years behind bars, Lord Bannatyne said he considered that in the circumstances "a very substantial period of imprisonment" required to be passed.
