Father-of-three Eifion Gwynne, 41, an electrician who played rugby for Aberystwyth and Llandovery, died in October after an accident in Malaga.
On Saturday, his casket was escorted to Morfa Chapel in Aberystwyth by former players from the town's rugby team.
His family described him as a "caring giant".
In a tribute, relatives - including his mother Anne, wife Nia and children Mabli, Modlen and Idris - said Mr Gwynne "lived life to the full".
"His vitality and kind nature inspired many. His smile lit up the room, his caring nature would see him help anyone and he treated everyone with the same respect," they added.
They thanked the local community and Aberystwyth and Llandovery rugby clubs for their kindness.
A plot was secured for Mr Gwynne at Plascrug Cemetery in Aberystwyth, where he had wished to be buried, after someone who had reserved it offered it to his family following a campaign.
A memorial fund has also been set up in Mr Gwynne's memory, with more than Â£15,000 raised in donations.
