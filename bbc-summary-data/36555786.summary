Sebastian Movila was a passenger in the car when it lost control and struck a tree on the M57, near Prescot, on Saturday evening.
He was being treated in hospital but on Thursday Merseyside Police confirmed he had died.
His parents paid tribute to their "wonderful" son, and said they would "miss him more than words can explain".
"Sebastian was a loving seven-year-old who loved life, his football and tennis, and living here in the UK, where he had been since August 2015," they said.
"We felt it fitting to allow his organs to be donated to other children in order that they live."
Officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
PC Kurt Timpson said: "The events of last Saturday evening have devastated a lovely family.
"They wish to thank everyone who stopped on the motorway to help them and for those who gave first aid to Sebastian and themselves."
