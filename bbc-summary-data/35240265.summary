Pathankot: Pakistan media attack 'baseless' India allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Indian security forces battled militants inside the Pathankot air base, defence analysts and media commentators in Islamabad lashed out at India for "typically" and "prematurely" blaming Pakistan for the attack.

This is despite the United Jihad Council (UJC) - a rebel alliance based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir - saying it carried out the attack, three days after it began.
Even so, some Pakistani commentators have continued to blame Indian authorities and media for their accusations against Pakistani organisations and individuals.
Analysts believe that the Pakistani media resorts to self-censorship and follows the official line on matters of national security - and recent rhetoric on the Pathankot attack can be seen in that context.
In the four-day battle, Indian troops killed six militants who had stormed the base in Punjab near the Pakistan border. Seven Indian soldiers also died in the clashes.
The attack dominated talk shows on at least eight TV channels over the weekend, before the UJC claim.
Ghulam Mustafa, a retired lieutenant-general, told Channel 24's DNA (Debate, News, Analysis) programme that the attack was an "India-backed, India-engineered and India-sponsored incident".
He rejected allegations of Pakistan's involvement, saying he was not happy with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's decision to invite his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to Lahore.
Hopes for a thaw in relations were raised after Mr Modi paid an unexpected visit to Mr Sharif on his way back from Afghanistan in late December.
Ajmad Shoaib, another retired lieutenant-general, said on ABB Tak TV's "Tonight with Fareeha Idrees" programme that the Indian allegations were merely a continuation of an ongoing trend.
He recalled that India had blamed Pakistan for a fire on a fishing boat on 31 December 2014 as well as for the Gurdaspur police station attack in July 2015.
He said some groups in India did not want peaceful relations with Pakistan.
A few Indian voices were also heard on Pakistani TV channels.
Speaking on the phone from India, former Indian intelligence chief AS Dulat said that Indian media blamed Pakistani elements for involvement in the Pathankot attack because there was enough proof.
Some TV anchors in Pakistan also took to Twitter to "refute" India's claims.
Moeed Peerzada, a TV host on Dunya TV, said that India would benefit from the Pathankot attack and did not change his stance even after the UJC claim.
Television anchor Ahmed Quraishi initially expressed scepticism over India's "rush" to blame Pakistan, and then after the UJC claim, said it was a result of "India's own internal mess".
Taking the argument one step further, Farhan Khan Virk, a social media activist, said the attack seemed like a scripted Indian TV drama.
Popular TV anchor Mubashar Lucman commented on the duration of India's counter-operation.
But Pakistan's social media discourse was not entirely dominated by what some people called hawkish reactions.  Some showed sympathy with India.
Imtiaz Alam, a veteran journalist and the Secretary General of the South Asian Free Media Association, noted that it was not always easy for Pakistani commentators to take a neutral position.
