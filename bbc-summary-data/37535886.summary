The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said almost 900 jobs have been cut while passenger numbers keep going up.
It accused Tube bosses of compromising "safety and customer service across its stations by cutting jobs".
London Underground chief Steve Griffiths said there were more staff in public areas and crime was at an all-time low.
The union said 3,800 workers were involved in an "on-going battle" including a row over ticket office closures and cutting control room jobs.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "A responsible employer would reverse the job cuts and put staff back into station control rooms.
"If London Underground really cares about passengers it would reverse the ticket office closure programme."
The union said the Tube aspires to provide a "world-class service" but "a self-service railway that can't staff its control rooms to monitor fire alarms, lift alarms and passenger help points would struggle in League Two, let alone be considered world class."
Mr Griffiths, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: "The safety of customers and staff is our top priority and our hardworking people ensure London Underground remains one of the safest metros in the world.
"As the mayor announced last month, an independent review into the ticket offices is being carried out by London TravelWatch to ensure that it's delivering for our customers."
