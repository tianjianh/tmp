Kenwick Park leisure centre, near Louth, was hit by a major blaze in October.
At its height, 40 firefighters tackled the fire, believed to have been caused by an electrical fault.
Owner Stuart Flynn said plans to rebuild it were well under way and he expected contractors to start work in the next two weeks.
Mr Flynn said "it was awful" to see the aftermath of the fire.
However, he said: "You've got to get over that and think what it's going to be like."
Plans for the complex, which had more than a 1,000 members, are being considered by the local authority - East Lindsey District Council.
If approved, it is expected to open in December.
Temporary facilities have been set up on the site, and a neighbouring hotel evacuated at the time of the blaze remains unaffected.
