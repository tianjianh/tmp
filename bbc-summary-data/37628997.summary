Ched Evans rape trial: Alleged victim 'shocked' man in bed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who slept with a woman two days before footballer Ched Evans allegedly raped her has told a court he was "shocked" by her sexual behaviour.

He said she told him to "go harder," a phrase similar to what Mr Evans claims she used with him in a hotel room.
The Chesterfield striker denies raping a 19-year-old at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, on 30 May 2011.
Mr Evans, 27, was found guilty of rape at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, but his conviction was quashed in April.
The former Manchester City and Sheffield United player denies having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent.
He insists she agreed to let him "join in" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27, after a night out in Rhyl.
A man who said he slept with the complainant multiple times in the months leading up to the alleged offence said he picked her up after a night out on 28 May 2011 and described her as being drunk when he took her home.
The man - who cannot be named - said she "came on to" him in bed, saying: "Are you not even going to rip my clothes off?"
"I was quite shocked," he said. "At the beginning I was a little bit nervous. The relationship we had was purely based on sex.
"I was very shocked with the words - she was expecting sex to happen as soon as we got into the house."
He said the complainant "dictated" how the sex occurred and told him to "go harder".
"She was a lot more confident. There had been a break between that time and the previous that I had slept with her, so I was a bit shocked to how much more confident she was," he added.
Prosecutor Simon Medland QC asked why he never mentioned the phrase "go harder" in his initial statement in September 2011 but did in a statement in December 2015.
He said he was not asked for details in the first interview and did not feel comfortable discussing it in that way over the phone.
The second interview was in person, and he was "made to feel at ease" and asked for more details, he added.
Mr Medland asked the witness if he was aware of a Â£50,000 reward offered for any information that might lead to Mr Evans' acquittal before he gave evidence at the footballer's appeal.
"No," he replied, saying he would have a "lot more to lose than to gain" if he had given evidence for money as he would most likely lose his well-paid job.
"The money I could get paid in the next 20 years outweighs a small lump sum," he said.
The trial continues.
