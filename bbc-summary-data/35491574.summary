Defender Callum Booth has signed up for another campaign with Partick Thistle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The one-year extension was triggered by the full-back playing his 25th game of the season in the 1-0 win over Motherwell on Tuesday.
The 24-year-old joined the Premiership club permanently in the summer, having been on loan from Hibernian for the second half of last term.
He has been ever-present in Alan Archibald's side this season, playing every minute so far.
