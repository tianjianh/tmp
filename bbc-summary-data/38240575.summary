Glasgow Warriors: Keith Earls' claims Fraser Brown milked a dangerous tackle 'disappoint' the hooker

Glasgow Warriors hooker Fraser Brown says he's "disappointed" by Munster centre Keith Earls' claims he milked a dangerous tackle during their European Champions Cup clash in October.

Earls was sent-off and suspended for two weeks after upending Brown.
He told Irish media last month he felt the Scotland hooker "could have done more to protect himself" - a remark Brown finds disrespectful.
"As professional players we've got a duty of care for each other," he said.
"If you do something wrong, it's being big enough to put your hand up and say you got something wrong. So for me, it's disappointing he could come out and put the blame somewhere else."
The fixture was racked with emotion, six days after the death of Munster's head coach, Anthony Foley.
The rampant hosts overcame Earls' 19th-minute dismissal to hammer Glasgow 38-17.
The Ireland centre, however, was left incensed by his ordering-off, and while he apologised for kicking water bottles as he left the field, he felt the red card denied him the opportunity to honour Foley with his performance.
Brown says the tip-tackle showed the fine margins between hard but fair rugby and dangerous play.
"It's such a physical sport, rugby," he said. "Every single moment in the game, you can be right on the edge of doing something really well or you can just go past that edge.
"I don't think anyone goes out there to deliberately hurt anybody - he certainly didn't. In my mind, it's a 50-50 tackle; it's almost the perfect tackle and it's just gone over the edge to being a bad tackle.
"I think afterwards claiming that I could probably have done more is a bit disrespectful to myself and to other guys in that situation.
"The incident for me is a non-incident because it happens all the time in rugby, it's just that fine edge you can be on both sides of.
"We spoke after the incident and we actually messaged each other a couple of times and that was put to bed - I'd just say it's a little bit disappointing to hear what he's come out with the last couple of weeks, but I'm not going to go into it in too much detail.
"It was dealt with by the disciplinary panel, they felt it was a dangerous tackle and he got an appropriate sanction."
Warriors have lost three successive Pro12 games for the first time under head coach, Gregor Townsend.
They resume their Champions Cup campaign on Saturday away to Parisian giants Racing 92.
Brown, 27, believes the players' intensity and drive has been below par in patches, but admits he can't pinpoint precisely why standards have slipped.
"It's very much a personal thing," he said. "When I joined Glasgow there was a great culture here and it's something we've maintained and continued.
"We've maybe lost a couple of guys the last couple of years, and it's about continually developing that culture within the group, new guys that have come in, younger guys from five or six years ago are now senior guys in the squad.
"It's how we keep developing that culture and make sure we keep the standards high, the hard-working ethos we have. We are a team that have had relative success the last few years, and with that success you can sometimes get a little bit of complacency, and it's how we maintain our standards and drive so we don't let that complacency creep in."
