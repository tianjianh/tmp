[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 1-0 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln City substitute Harry Anderson netted a first-half winner as the Imps beat Chester to go clear at the top of the National League table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Just six minutes after coming on for the injured Lee Angol, a hard, low cross from the left broke kindly and Anderson scored from close range.
In a game of two red cards, Danny Cowley's side climb three points clear of Tranmere Rovers, beaten at home by Forest Green.
But Lincoln were given a stern examination by a battling Chester side still needing points to be sure of staying up.
The hosts had to play a man short from the 75th minute after substitute Alan Power was sent off for a late challenge on Chester captain Luke George just three minutes after coming on.
But Chester then had Kane Richards red carded at the start of the seven minutes of injury time for a late challenge on Bradley Wood, an incident that culminated in an angry mass exchange between both benches.
Nathan Arnold and Elliott Whitehouse both shot over from an angle before the break for the Imps, but Chester pair Wade Joyce and James Alabi both struck powerful drives only just over.
And a mix-up left Richards clear on goal only to be denied by a superb piece of defending by Sean Raggett, who got back to clear the danger.
After the break, Alabi had a low left-foot shot cleared from almost off the line, Chester were denied a penalty when Richards went down under Alex Woodward's challenge, and it need a spectacular save by Paul Farman to claw away Elliott Durrell's long-range drive.
