Emergency services were called to Longtown Bridge, near Carlisle, on Tuesday after a 32-year-old man got into difficulties in the water.
The man had just rescued a young girl from the river, Cumbria Police said.
Chief Fire Officer for the county, Jim Onions, warned people against swimming during heatwaves because of strong currents.
Divers and rescue crews were involved in the search, along with the coastguard and an RAF helicopter with thermal imaging equipment.
The body has not been formally identified.
Mr Onions said: "We are really worried that during a hot spell - especially in the school holidays - people enter the water for a cooling dip because the water looks calm on the surface.
"But I've seen highly skilled firefighters in the water struggling because of strong undercurrents."
The rescued girl is at Cumberland Infirmary receiving treatment.
