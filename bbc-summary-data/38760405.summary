Robbie Neilson: 'Nobody wants to give up too many players' says MK Dons boss

The change in the emergency loan system in England means clubs are less likely to let players leave, says MK Dons' boss Robbie Neilson.

This is the first season no loans are permitted outside of transfer windows.
"Everyone's getting used to it. In Scotland the emergency loan has been gone for a long time," said Neilson.
"Nobody wants to give up too many players. They'd rather have too many players and deal with it than have too few and get caught out."
Since leaving Scottish Premiership side Hearts to become Dons boss in early December, Paisley-born Neilson has brought in striker Robbie Muirhead from his former side and Leicester City midfielder Harvey Barnes.
Neilson said on Wednesday he had a three-and-a-half-hour meeting to go over transfer targets, with less than a week to go until the deadline and the club 16th in League One.
He continued to BBC Three Counties Radio: "A lot of Premier League clubs don't really want to let their players out nowadays. They want to keep them in-house with the under-23s league.
"The market's not really moved, but expect it to in the last couple of days. Somebody might move and that might open up the door for somebody else."
