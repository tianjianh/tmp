London Oratory School 'ranked' baby baptisms in school place policy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top Catholic state school ranked the timelines of baby's baptisms as part of its admission policy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Office of Schools Adjudicator (OSA) found the London Oratory School wanted proof a child of six months had been baptised.
The school has been told aspects of its admission policy "do not conform" and must be revised within two months.
It said it no longer used the same policy to deal with over-subscription and the OSA was "not fit for purpose".
More than 800 11-year-olds apply annually for 160 places at the school, which was founded in 1863.
The OSA, in its fifth review of the admissions policy, found the school "specifically requests proof of the child's baptism within six months of birth, [and] date and place of first Holy Communion" to demonstrate the family's alignment with the school's ethos.
Schools adjudicator Andrew Bennett said: "I cannot understand how the time at which a candidate was baptised, for example, would make her or him more or less likely to be committed."
A request was also made by the school for clarification on the regularity of the family's attendance both at Sunday Mass and Mass on Holy Days of Obligation.
In his conclusion Mr Bennett said there was "no dispute" the schools officered a "distinctive" education but warned "applicants choose schools, not vice versa".
The school's headmaster David McFadden said: "What have we learnt? That it is profoundly regrettable that the school - and other schools - have to expend precious resources, year after year, in standing up to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator.
"I believe the Office of Schools Adjudicator is just not fit for purpose."
Previously, the OSA found the school's selection process to be socially selective and discriminatory, but a High Court judge ordered those rulings to be quashed.
