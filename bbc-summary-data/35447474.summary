The League One match between Oldham and Blackpool has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

The referee was happy with conditions when he arrived at 11:00 GMT, but the situation deteriorated and he called the game off after a 13:00 inspection.
"The persistent rainfall over the last 18 hours has meant that the pitch is unfit and the referee had no choice," said Oldham chief executive Neil Joy.
No date has yet been agreed for the rearranged fixture.
