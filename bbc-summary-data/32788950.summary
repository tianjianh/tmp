Root, a winner alongside women's captain Charlotte Edwards, averaged almost 95 in Test cricket under Moores, who was dismissed on 9 May.
"A lot of credit for that has to go to Peter Moores," said the 24-year-old.
"Over the past year, he has definitely got the best out of me - along with the rest of the coaching department."
Root was left out of the England team for the final Test of the Ashes whitewash in January 2014, but was recalled after Moores was appointed coach for the second time a year ago.
The Yorkshire right-hander has since amassed 1,135 Test runs.
"When I came back from Australia, I realised a lot of the time out there I was trying to work on things I wasn't too good at - and putting all my energy into that, rather than spending more time strengthening the stuff I am good at," added Root
"Peter saw that - and I simplified things as well."
Root, named player of the year for the men's side after a vote of cricket media, was last week appointed Test vice-captain by new director of cricket Andrew Strauss.
"I was delighted, so I accepted straight away," said Root. "I don't think things will change much - just a bit more responsibility on my part.
"If Alastair Cook wants to come up to me for ideas, I will make sure I have something to help him out."
As well as being named as the women's player of the year, Edwards was presented with a silver cap to mark her 200th game as England captain against New Zealand in February.
In addition to leading England to four series wins, Edwards averaged more than 75 in one-day internationals and almost 60 in Twenty20s.
