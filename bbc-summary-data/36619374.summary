But among the selfies, smiles and proud-as-punch parents, there's an air of uncertainty as these European citizens prepare for the working world.
Vladislavs Ignatjevs, from Latvia, imagined he would begin his career in Dundee, but now the 23-year-old is not so sure.
"I'm upset with the result," he said. "It will be harder for younger people to come to the UK and get the high level of education."
BBC Scotland took to the streets of towns and cities across the country to find out what people feel about the decision to leave the EU.
Computer games programmer Thomas Kronberg, 36, said: "It's terrifying, because I've been living in Scotland for the last 10 years and I came over from Germany to work in the games industry.
"Suddenly, overnight, it feels like my whole future in this country is in question. It's a scary day."
Ross Turriff, owner of Turriff's Garden Centre in Broughty Ferry, has already received an email from a Dutch flower supplier offering reassurance, but is still concerned.
He said: "With tariffs and restrictions that are added on as we pull further out of the EU, it's only going to affect prices. I can't see us being out of the EU making flowers any cheaper.
"The closer we are, the more links we have and the fewer restrictions keeps us and the importers happy."
Dundee, like the rest of Scotland, voted to remain, but those in the city who backed Brexit are not shy in saying so.
Cleaning supervisor Maureen Bennett, 56, said she was "over the moon".
"I'm glad we're out of it," she said. "Why should we be letting working class people be giving millions to other countries?"
Some are simply confused by the whole affair.
One City Square passerby said: "It was a mess already. Maybe it will just be a different mess."
