Luton Town: Matt Macey, Ollie Palmer & Stuart Moore join League Two club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town have signed Leyton Orient striker Ollie Palmer and goalkeepers Stuart Moore and Matt Macey on loan until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Palmer, 25, has five goals from 23 games this term, scoring against Luton in his side's 2-1 defeat in October.
Arsenal keeper Macey, 22, made four appearances for Accrington Stanley on loan last season.
Moore, 22, has joined from Reading, where he has yet to play for the first team since coming through the ranks.
He made two appearances for their Under-21s in this season's EFL Trophy, conceding six goals, and also featured in four League One games on loan at Peterborough last season.
The two keepers come in after Christian Walton was recalled from his loan spell at Kenilworth Road by parent club Brighton.
