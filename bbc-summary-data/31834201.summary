Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis has returned to training after fainting in their 3-2 Premier League defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 4 March.

Gomis, who collapsed three times in 2009, appeared to fall down immediately after Spurs took a sixth-minute lead.
The Frenchman, 29, left the pitch on a stretcher and was taken to hospital.
Swansea confirmed Gomis was back in training but it is not yet known if he will be fit to face Liverpool at Liberty Stadium on Monday.
After the incident at White Hart Lane, Gomis tweeted: "I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health that requires me to go back and forth to France."
Team-mate Neil Taylor described the Frenchman's collapse and on-field treatment as "frightening".
Wales international Sam Ricketts said the incident brought back memories of the day in 2012 when his then Bolton team-mate Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest at the same ground.
