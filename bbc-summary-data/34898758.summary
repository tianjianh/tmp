[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Lancaster Infirmary ward closed by norovirus outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly care ward at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary has been closed to admissions after an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug norovirus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Visiting restrictions have been put in place while the outbreak is managed.
People are being asked not to visit patients if they have been in contact with anybody experiencing the symptoms of the bug, or had it themselves.
A spokesman for the hospital said the highly infectious norovirus can be "highly disruptive to patients".
The bug - which causes vomiting, stomach cramps, fever and diarrhoea - is easily spread from person to person.
Symptoms usually begin between 12 to 48 hours after a person becomes infected, with most healthy people making a recovery within one to three days.
