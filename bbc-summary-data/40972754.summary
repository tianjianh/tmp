West Brom "don't need or want to sell" captain Jonny Evans, says manager Tony Pulis who went on to concede "every player is for sale at the right price".

Albion have rejected an £18m bid from Manchester City for the defender, 29, who has two years left on his contract.
Pulis said it would be "crazy" to say they would turn down a big offer, but added: "We're not desperate for money."
City boss Pep Guardiola said Pulis' comments were "clear" and added: "He is a player of West Brom."
"Some things are possible and some things are not. I believe my players are the best. We will decide what is the best to make our club stronger," the Spaniard went on to say.
Northern Ireland centre-back Evans missed West Brom's opening game of the season against Bournemouth with a hamstring injury and he remains a doubt for the Premier League game at Burnley on Saturday.
Pulis said: "He will have a late fitness test today [Friday]. One thing we don't want to do is play him and then it gets worse and then we lose him."
It would need to be a very good offer. If that offer came in then we would sit down and talk to Jonny
Evans, who spent nine years at Manchester United, was the subject of a bid from Arsenal last summer while Leicester have also had a £10m offer for the defender turned down during the close season.
Pulis said: "When it's Man City or one of the top four or five clubs, it's very, very difficult then because it affects the player because they have the chance to better themselves.
"We don't want to stop him from doing something he wants to do. We don't want to have a player that stays at the football club and is disappointed.
"He's been in this position before here and he understands the situation, until all parties agree then he won't go anywhere.
"He has been made club captain and he wants to get on with his football."
The Baggies won their opening match of the Premier League season against Bournemouth, but Pulis warned that without additions to his squad, "it could be a long season".
Pulis has signed four players so far this summer, including Jay Rodriguez from Southampton for £15m.
He confirmed that West Brom are interested in signing Tottenham defender Kevin Wimmer although he said that reports of an agreement being close were wide of the mark.
The club are also reported to be interested in Liverpool's £30m-rated French defender Mamadou Sakho.
"We've got a lot of irons in the fire and we hope to get deals done and they have to be right for the football club," he added.
