[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hamilton Academical 0-1 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scrambled Danny Devine goal was enough for Inverness Caledonian Thistle to overcome 10-man Hamilton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first-half effort, from Iain Vigurs' free-kick, settled a fairly even game, although the home side were hamstrung by poor discipline.
Darian Mackinnon was dismissed following his verbal reaction to a booking after a tussle with Vigurs.
Hamilton had half-chances to equalise but Greg Docherty spurned the best of them, shooting over from close range.
The critical matters have already been decided, but these two sides still nurtured their own ambitions. For Hamilton, having secured their Premiership safety last weekend, the intention was to mark their last home game of the season with a heart-warming performance and result for their fans.
Inverness were motivated by the desire to finish top of the bottom six, and maximise the amount of prize money that the team can add to next season's recruitment budget.
Hamilton threatened first when Eamonn Brophy's direct run into the penalty area ended when he tumbled over an Inverness defender. It did look as though the attacker had run deliberately into his opponent, and referee Stephen Finnie was certainly not moved to award a spot kick, much to the annoyance of Hamilton manager Martin Canning.
The officials were prominent early on, with an offside flag ruling out a goal after Danny Williams had clipped Miles Storey's cross into the net from close range.
Inverness tended to be the more assertive side, although much of the game was contained to the centre of the pitch with little width or penetration. Hamilton were enthused by a couple of half chances, with Carlton Morris shooting just over from distance and Steven Boyd, making his debut, slashing the ball wide from the angle.
The visitors' maintained their edge, though, and it came to count just before half-time. Following Vigurs' free-kick, Devine and McGovern challenged each other for the ball, and the former prevailed to steer it into the net.
There should have been more command to Inverness's lead, with Liam Polworth sent clean through on goal after the interval. McGovern rushed out to close him down, and the midfielder could only shoot straight at the goalkeeper's body.
Hamilton retained their determination, and that delivered moments of hope. They came close when the substitute Docherty met a long ball into the penalty area, but from almost directly underneath the bar, he skied his shot over.
As if that miss wasn't galling enough, Hamilton had to endure a further setback when Mackinnon was booked twice within seconds.
The midfielder tried to protect the ball from Vigurs using his body, but also used his elbow. No direct contact was made but Finnie reached for his card and brandished it again on hearing what the offender had to say.
Mackinnon was incensed, as were the Hamilton coaching staff, and he had to be urged from the field. The home side retained that fiery sense of purpose and it almost delivered an equaliser.
After a period of pressure on the Inverness goal, Danny Redmond's free-kick bounced straight though a crowded penalty area and Owain Fon Williams leapt to his left to push the ball way.
