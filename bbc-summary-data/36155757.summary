John McGinn: I'm happy to stay at Hibernian even if we don't go up

Hibernian midfielder John McGinn says he will be happy to continue playing Championship football next season if the Edinburgh club are not promoted.

McGinn, 21, has been nominated for PFA Scotland's Young Player of the Year award after an impressive campaign.
But despite admitting it will be a "failure" if Hibs don't return to the Premiership, he has no plans to leave.
"I have got three years left at Hibs so unless someone tells me otherwise then I will be a Hibs player," he said.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my season, even being in the Championship, so I would have no hesitation playing another season there.
"It is a privilege to be at a club the size of Hibs. I had opportunities last year to go to Premiership clubs but I just felt I would be involved in high-pressure games, and I feel that has been justified.
"I am just determined to get Hibs back playing top-flight football. It is important for someone of my age to be playing at the highest level I can and that is the same for the other boys in the dressing room.
"I took a drop down when I signed [from relegated St Mirren, last summer] but the aim was to take the club back to the Premiership. If we don't do that, we will have failed, and I don't want to be put down as a failure."
McGinn was the only player from a Scottish Championship team named in Gordon Strachan's Scotland squads for the recent friendlies against Czech Republic and Denmark.
In a season where Hibs have reached both the Scottish League Cup final and Scottish Cup final, his personal highlight was an impressive international debut in the 1-0 win over the Danes at Hampden Park.
"I don't think anything will beat playing for my country," McGinn added. "At 21, to put on the blue jersey was an incredible feeling and it has made me hungry to get more caps.
"Hopefully, if I keep playing well for my club, then that could happen.
"I feel as if I made a good impression so I want to keep doing that and get better and better."
