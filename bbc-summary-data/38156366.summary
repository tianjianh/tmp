EIS teaching union warns over new fast-track teacher plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's biggest teaching union has voiced concern over a proposal to fast-track new teachers into classrooms.

Education Secretary John Swinney has made public his "innovative plan" to "broaden" routes into teaching.
The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said there was "much to welcome" in the raft of measures which include enticing former teachers to return.
However, it was unhappy at the idea of combining post-graduate learning with the one-year classroom probation.
Mr Swinney believed this particular measure would help to find the right people to teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects.
The Scottish government's Attainment Scotland Fund will pay for the package of proposals, at a cost of Â£1m.
Mr Swinney, who announced the details at the University of Dundee, said: "Teachers are the bedrock of Scotland's education system and I want to ensure we do everything we can to attract talented graduates to a career in teaching.
"The quality of teaching is key to helping pupils achieve and to our aspiration of closing the attainment gap.
"These innovative proposals are designed to do just that while, crucially, maintaining the traditionally high standard of teaching in Scotland."
Mr Swinney is aiming to recruit 200 new teachers into the profession.
General Secretary of the EIS, Larry Flanagan, said his union was behind the teacher recruitment drive but he warned against "short-cuts" which might undermine the "high standards of Scotland's teaching profession".
He believed the current arrangement whereby post-graduate training is followed by an induction period of a year in the classroom was the right one.
Mr Flanagan said: "A key strength of the Scottish system is an all-graduate teaching profession, coupled with a guaranteed induction year in a school to provide all new teachers with practical experience to complement their theoretical study.
"Our consistent view is that one-year of postgraduate training followed by a one-year induction period is the minimum period for any individual to become fully comfortable with both teaching theory and its practical application.
"To suggest moving to a shortened fast-tracking route is inconsistent with the need to maintain and enhance the highest standards."
General secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), Seamus Searson, said his biggest concern was keeping current teachers in the profession.
He added: "We cannot rely just on recruiting teachers and not address the issues of teachers pay, career structure and workload.
"It is important that we focus on all the aspects and not just turn on the tap of recruitment when the plug of retention has not been fixed in the bath."
However, the General Teaching Council Scotland - which controls entry into the profession - said it was confident the changes would not lead to a fall in standards.
Its chief executive, Ken Muir, said: "Flexibility is crucial when trying to attract new people into the teaching profession and to address the issue of teacher shortages. GTC Scotland is at the forefront in promoting a wide range of new and innovative routes into teaching for those wishing to join the profession in Scotland."
Responding to Mr Swinney's recruitment proposals, Scottish Labour's education spokesman Iain Gray MSP said that "whatever the merit", Â£1m was not going to solve "our teacher recruitment crisis".
He added: "The SNP has cut over 4,000 teachers from our schools, and axed hundreds of millions of pounds from the council budgets which fund them."
Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens said recruiting more teachers was "essential", but taking on 200 new teachers fell short of what was needed.
He added: "Investing just 0.13% of the Â£750m Attainment Fund suggests Scottish ministers haven't yet grasped how important it is to give teachers more time to teach."
