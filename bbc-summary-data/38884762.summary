Jane Collins libel case: Three Labour Rotherham MPs awarded £54,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Labour MPs have each won £54,000 High Court libel damages from UKIP MEP Jane Collins over remarks she made about Rotherham's child abuse scandal.

She claimed Rotherham MPs Sir Kevin Barron, John Healey and Sarah Champion knew about child exploitation in the town but did not intervene.
The case was sparked by a speech the Yorkshire and Humber MEP gave at UKIP's conference in September 2014.
Her attempt to obtain immunity from prosecution failed in October.
Ms Collins, who was sued by the MPs for libel and slander, had alleged that each of them knew many of the details of the exploitation yet deliberately chose to do nothing.
She made the speech a month after a report found that about 1,400 children in the area had been abused between 1997 and 2013.

The High Court heard the MEP also expressed the opinion that the MPs had acted out of political correctness, political cowardice or political selfishness and were guilty of misconduct so grave that it was or should be criminal, as it aided the perpetrators.
Ms Collins had refused to withdraw her comments throughout the whole of the campaign, had not apologised and had repeatedly tried to delay the litigation.
Gavin Millar QC told Mr Justice Warby that the allegations had been the "talk of the tearoom" in Parliament in the run-up to the 2015 general election, and caused "extreme distress".
The judge said all three MPs found the experience "genuinely and significantly distressing".
He said: "They felt that their careers were at stake, and that their integrity was under serious attack."
Ms Collins argued she had made a political speech that did not contain any allegation of fact, but expressed an opinion to the effect that the MPs were likely to have known that sexual exploitation was a serious problem in the area.
She made an offer of amends which was accepted, but the amount of compensation could not be agreed.
