Mr Molenda was found in an empty room of the bedsit in Durham Road, Sparkhill, He died from head injuries.
Nine people from the property were subsequently arrested over the death, which West Midlands Police said was a misunderstanding between the pair over rent.
Boroweic was charged with murder but later admitted manslaughter.
Heath Westerman, from West Midlands CPS, said: "Damien Boroweic killed Wojiech Molenda by attacking him outside and inside the house they co-shared over a dispute about money.
"The defendant denied any involvement in the death of Mr Boroweic, however, CCTV evidence, witness accounts, forensic reports and blood stained clothing belonging to the victim, which was hidden in a cupboard, was forensically examined and matched the blood of the deceased meaning that his original account was not true."
