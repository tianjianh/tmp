[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The organisations said the new memorandum of understanding formalised a long-standing relationship.
UHI and CNPA said areas they worked together on include forestry, land use and conservation and outdoor pursuits.
UHI principal Prof Clive Mulholland and CNPA chief executive Grant Moir signed the agreement.
The national park covers parts of the Highlands, north east Scotland and Perthshire.
Prof Mulholland said: "We are excited to be formalising and extending our relationship with the Cairngorms National Park Authority.
"The national park has an international reputation as a tourist destination and for its nature conservation and there are many links between our aims, specialism and challenges.
"We look forward to working together to maximise the opportunities for those living, working and visiting the national park and the Highlands and Islands region."
Mr Moir added: "There are already numerous connections between the Cairngorms National Park and the University of the Highlands and Islands and we are delighted to be strengthening our relationship in this way.
"Many areas of the university's research are directly relevant to management challenges here in the Cairngorms and, in turn, the national park provides a fantastic learning resource for students at the university."
