The 49-year-old beat former X Factor contestant and bookies' favourite for the title Jake Quickenden.
TV presenter Melanie Sykes finished third in the final of the ITV show, which is hosted by Ant and Dec.
Fogarty lasted three weeks in the Australian jungle taking part in various bushtucker trials to beat 11 other celebrities.
The star, who's from Blackburn, cried as he took his place on the I'm A Celebrity "throne" in front of fellow camp-mates before hugging his wife.
He told presenters Ant and Dec: "I just think it's all a dream, someone's playing a trick on me.
"This is the best thing that has ever happened. It's absolutely mental. I don't know what, but I must have done something right."
His final task saw him tackle a meal of mealworms, cockroaches, tarantulas, ostrich anus and camel penis.
Quickenden came second after braving burrowing cockroaches and crabs in his final task.
The singer, who appeared in X Factor weeks before entering the jungle, joked how "people voted for me more on this then when I was a singer".
Sykes was the first of the three finalists to be voted off the show after being forced to submerge herself in a tank filled with eels and crabs.
After leaving she said: "I'm a bit gutted that I'm not in the final because you get so close and you think I might do it.
"It was better than I expected. I had fun, I made great friends. I don't want to sound corny but it's exceeded all my expectations."
She said she mastered "counting to 10" in the camp after admitting it was hard for her to watch other people cooking.
The finalists enjoyed a decent meal to mark their last night on the show after all three won the final tasks.
Former BBC newsreader Michael Burke, ex-footballer Jimmy Bullard, actor Craig Charles, Gemma Collins, model Nadia Forde, 'Allo 'Allo star Vicki Michelle, rapper Tinchy Stryder, former Playboy Playmate Kendra Wilkinson and former Conservative MP Edwina Currie also took part this year.
