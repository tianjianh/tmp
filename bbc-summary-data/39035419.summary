[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage produced a professional display to beat struggling Leyton Orient in League Two at a wet Broadhall Way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated the opening exchanges and it was no surprise when an unmarked Ben Kennedy headed home Jobi McAnuff's cross in the 18th minute.
It was 2-0 four minutes later when Nicky Hunt dragged Luke Wilkinson down in the area and Matt Godden smashed the penalty into the top corner.
Orient responded almost instantly when Paul McCallum headed Michael Collins' expert free-kick into the corner.
Danny Webb's team pushed for an equaliser but it remained 2-1 at the break - although not for long.
Stevenage needed only three second-half minutes to extend their advantage when Wilkinson headed in McAnuff's cross.
Tom Pett made it 4-1 just past the hour mark after good play on the left despite Sam Sargeant getting a hand to his shot.
Although Orient pushed for a consolation, it was comfortable for Stevenage, who moved up to seventh in the table.
