The Open champion moved to five under for the tournament, eight behind leader Victor Dubuisson, who carded a 64.
Nearest challenger Danny Willett saw his chances fade with a 76 to be tied for 51st on one over.
Sweden's Alex Noren (69) is joint 13th, needing a top-two finish to put pressure on compatriot Stenson.
World number two Rory McIlroy, who needs to win and hope that several other permutations fall into place for him to finish number one on the European Tour for a third straight year, is tied on five under with Stenson after scoring a four-under 68.
Having continued his struggles of the first two days into day three, with bogeys on holes four, six and 10, Stenson finally clicked into gear in the afternoon sunshine in Dubai as he holed five birdies in the last seven holes - including chipping straight in from the greenside rough on 16.
He said: "I turned it around at least and, yeah, I've got to be pretty pleased with the way we managed to play on the way home."
Stenson, who won this tournament with a course-record 25 under total at the Earth Course in 2013, leads the Race to Dubai by 299,675 points from Masters champion Willett.
