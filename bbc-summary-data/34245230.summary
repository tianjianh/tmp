A Silicon Valley executive who lost a high-profile sexism case against her former employer has decided not to appeal against the verdict.

Ellen Pao wrote in an article that she cannot afford to continue fighting the case.
Following the trial she was ordered to pay $1m (Â£650,000) of venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers' legal costs.
The firm said at the time it would waive the costs if she did not appeal.
The case gripped the tech community as diversity within the industry is a topical issue - the sector is generally dominated by a white male workforce, and many of the larger companies have pledged to address the imbalance.
Ellen Pao had claimed in court that she missed out on promotions during her time as a junior partner at Kleiner Perkins because of her gender, and was fired after she complained.
The firm maintained its decisions were related to her performance in the role and the jury agreed.
"We remain committed to gender diversity in the workplace and believe that women in technology would be best served by focusing on this issue outside of continued litigation," said Christina Lee, a spokesperson for the investor, at the end of the trial in April.
" My experience shows how difficult it is to address discrimination through the court system," Ms Pao wrote.
She added that the case had been painful "personally and professionally" for both her and her family.
In her article for the website Re:code, Ms Pao criticised the legal system and the huge financial costs involved.
"I have a request for all companies: Please don't try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns," she said.
"Instead allow balanced and complete perspectives to come out publicly so we can all learn and improve."
Ms Pao stood down in July as chief executive of her subsequent employer, community website Reddit, following a huge backlash against some of the changes made by the site.
