Resistance from Alastair Cook. Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell stuck around too.
Then it rained. Cook out at resumption - four wickets for nine runs.
Mitchell Johnson the hero. Quick and chirpy. James Anderson sledged, then the end came. Australia 1-0 up.
Full day four report from Brisbane
Match scorecard
England wanted rain - and lots of it. When an almighty thunderstorm hit the Gabba midway through the afternoon session, with England 142-4 and skipper Cook his usual obdurate self, they were happy to run for cover and watch time tick by. But the 90-minute break only served to disrupt England's rhythm - Cook out for 65 from the second ball he faced following the rain delay. England's 142-4 quickly became 151-8 and any thoughts of an unlikely escape were over.
Mitchell Johnson is a figure of fun no more. He lived up to his billing as a potential match-winner in spectacular style - plundering 113 runs and, more importantly, taking nine wickets in the match. Bowling as fast as anybody in the world, and not shy of a sledge or two from behind his handlebar moustache, he's going to be giving Jonathan Trott nightmares for days. And one or two others.
Pint-sized Ashes: A two-minute round-up of the day
England captain Alastair Cook: "It's a very disappointing game for us. We had a good first day, but Australia have outplayed us since then. We didn't score enough runs. Johnson bowled well this game. Sometimes it goes that way and sometimes it doesn't. We have to look at a few things. I can look back at a number of games when we have bounced back from defeats, India springs to mind."
Australia coach Darren Lehmann: "It's a long series and we'll enjoy this match but we've got to get back on it for Adelaide. We thought we played well at the back end of the England tour and we also felt our players had more time in the middle building up to this game. Mitchell Johnson has got his confidence back and he was the difference here - first with the bat, then he blew the game away with the ball on day two."
Australia captain Michael Clarke, after being asked about his sledging of James Anderson (see below): "Through my career, there has always been banter on the cricket field - and I cop as much as I give, that's for sure. All the England players know we certainly respect them, and we understand we have to be at our best to beat them. I've heard a lot worse said on a cricket field than what the Australia players or the England players said throughout this Test match."

Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "This could have long-term effects on England because they have been blown away. People are trying to avoid facing Johnson. They will know they have a lot of soul-searching to do. They have to come out with a different mindset in Adelaide. This is one tall order, a bigger challenge than coming back to win in India."
Ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott: "I think Alastair Cook would bite your hand off if you offered him retaining, rather than winning the Ashes. Perth should have more pace and bounce than Brisbane, so England could easily go 2-0 down in that match (the third one). They need to find a way of winning matches on these wickets."
Australian fast-bowling legend Glenn McGrath: "Mitchell Johnson has come back mentally tougher and sorted out a few technique issues. He's happier off the field too, with a young family, and hopefully he's going to be around a long time for Australia."
Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports: "It's very worrying (to have lost by such a distance). They were bullied. It wasn't as though Australia started well and then continued - England were bossing the game. A lot of it has to do with the opposition, Mitchell Johnson is unrecognisable from the bowler we have seen in previous Ashes battles, the confidence and the togetherness are unrecognisable from the team we saw in England, thanks to (coach) Darren Lehmann.
Listen to Test Match Special highlights and commentary clips
Australia were all over England on Saturday, both with the ball and the barbs.
Johnson chatted away to Joe Root after almost every ball, calling him a "pretty boy" and mocking his innocent smile. And poor tailenders Chris Tremlett and Anderson looked like wounded animals being encircled by their prey as they were surrounded by chirping Aussie fielders in the closing stages.
At one point, Anderson complained to the umpires about the constant sledging from George Bailey at short leg.
Clarke then waded in and was heard on the stump microphones apparently telling Anderson to prepare to have his arm broken by Johnson.
England's Kevin Pietersen: Hey - if we all accept the good days in life, we all have to accept the bad ones! Horrible Test for us that.. 4 to play!
England wicketkeeper Matt Prior: Outplayed this week. It happens. This team knows how to bounce back and that's exactly what we'll do! It's a long way to go.
Australia bowler Mitchell Starc: Outstanding from Australia! Well done fellas. Johno brilliant, so good to watch.
Former Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne: Message to all my English followers who have been sledging me during the last Ashes series: Hope you're enjoying Brisbane.
Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff: Got to admire the brand of cricket Darren Lehmann is endorsing. It's exciting and expressive, great for the game! Well done.
Nathan Lyon might appear to be one of the most mild-mannered players in the Australian team, but he's been the man entrusted with leading the team song - called Under the Southern Cross - which is belted out in the dressing room following each Australian victory. "Mike Hussey handed the team song over to Nathan Lyon when he retired in January, and he's not had chance to sing it until today," said ex-Australia bowler Glenn McGrath on Test Match Special.
"This will be a special one for him - they will savour and enjoy it and there might be several renditions. There are a couple of fruity words in the team song, and you have to sing it with all of your heart and lungs. People tend to be husky after singing it - you have to give it everything."
