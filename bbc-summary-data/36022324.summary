Adrian St John, 22, who played for the Chris Gayle Academy in London, is understood to have died on Sunday.
West Indies cricketer Gayle tweeted: "Such sad news to hear. My condolences to his family & friends. Adrian St John was the captain of the academy. #Sigh."
The Foreign Office said it was in contact with authorities in Trinidad following the death of a UK national.
Local media reports suggest Mr St John was attacked after he had stopped his car to pick up two friends, and was shot as he drove away after they had been robbed.
Donovan Miller, programme manager for the Chris Gayle Foundation, said: "I'm really finding it hard to come to terms with it, how someone could do something like that to such a lovely person."
He said Mr St John was one of the first members of the Chris Gayle Academy in London, adding: "He wanted me to support him to go to the Caribbean and to kind of push hard with his cricket."
Friends have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to Mr St John.
"In utter shock to hear that one of my good friends Adrian has passed away. One of the funniest and nicest people," Tommy Smith tweeted.
"Tragic news. A lovely lad and a talented cricketer. Thoughts are with his family and friends. RIP Adrian St John," tweeted Surrey-based Southern Railway, Kenley and Selsdon Cricket Club.
Alleyn Cricket Club, based in south London, tweeted: "Adrian St John, who played for us 85 times from 2009 to 2014, has been murdered in Trinidad. We're devastated."
"Saddened by the news of the death of one of our Alumni, Adrian St John. Our prayers are with his family. RIP Adrian," the University of Hertfordshire men's cricket team tweeted.
The Chris Gayle Foundation aims to "improve access to good-quality education, training and employment for at-risk young people in Jamaica and the UK".
The cricket academies it runs offer young people a chance to play matches "as a focus for the development of their communication skills, teamwork and collective pride in their achievements".
