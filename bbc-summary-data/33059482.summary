The competition attracted thousands of comments from Chinese women.
You have been sharing your thoughts via @BBC_HaveYourSay on Twitter. Here is a selection of your tweets:
@jen_vorhaut  in Washington DC, US, chooses not to shave her armpits.
@MARKDIDDY  from Nigeria and @Jenn_Abrams from the US share their reasons for preferring armpits to remain hairless.
But not all readers agree that shaving armpits is the best way forward. @bijubelinky  in London, UK, thinks it is down to the individual to choose.
@YHHSulami  from Manhattan, Kansas, US, thinks that shaving armpits is a way to keep clean.
@ennisorca is from Australia and says that shaving, or choosing not to shave, is a seasonal choice.
And finally, @WomenAlso_ from the UK raises the point that shaving armpit hair has nothing to do with hygiene.
