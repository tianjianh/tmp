[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An application has been submitted to carry out research and development into kite energy technology on part of a military range in south west Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kite Power Solutions is behind the proposal at West Freugh near Stranraer.
An application to Dumfries and Galloway Council said the company would "continue to engage" with the community over the plans.
If the bid is successful, KPS could move its operations to the region, which it said would bring 19 jobs.
West Freugh has operated as a military base since the 1930s and is currently run by QinetiQ on behalf of the Ministry of Defence.
The application relates to part of the site and would only be used in the summer months.
The technology sees two kites tethered to spool drums and as they fly they turn the drums to produce electricity.
The company said research and development success was a "crucial step" in achieving its business aspirations.
It estimated that it could employ up to 500 people by 2025 if the project entered the manufacturing stage.
