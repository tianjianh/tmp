[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town v Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town could include forward Izzy Brown in their squad after he joined on loan from Chelsea on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Town winger Sean Scannell (ankle) is out, along with midfielder Jonathan Hogg.
Port Vale will be without striker Alex Jones after Birmingham City recalled the loanee and sold him to Bradford City.
The absence of Jones means that veteran winger Jerome Thomas could be used as a striker.
