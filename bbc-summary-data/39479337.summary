Rodrigo Bentancur: Juventus medical for 19-year-old Boca Juniors midfielder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italian champions Juventus are close to signing teenage midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur from Boca Juniors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bentancur, 19, was in Turin on Monday to have a medical before joining the Serie A leaders.
The Uruguay Under-20 international is a product of Argentine club Boca Juniors' youth team.
Juventus negotiated a purchase option on Bentancur when striker Carlos Tevez moved back to Boca Juniors from the Turin club in June 2015.
Juve are six points clear at the top of the table with eight games remaining as they chase a sixth successive Serie A title.
Massimiliano Allegri's side are also in the quarter-finals of the Champions League where they face Barcelona over two legs on 11 and 19 April.
