The next EU president has told the BBC "the Irish border issue" must be settled before talks on Brexit can start.

Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat made his comments as a British-Irish council meeting was being held in Wales.
The implications of leaving the EU were discussed at the summit by the first and deputy first ministers.
The talks were hosted by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.
In a BBC interview, Mr Muscat, whose country assumes the EU's presidency in January, said: "There will be issues relating to borders, especially the Irish issue, which I think is one of the most politically sensitive issues. I think there is a political willingness from everyone to have it resolved."
The prime minister of Malta also said EU leaders were not "bluffing" when they said the UK will be left without access to the single market when it leaves the bloc if there is no free movement of people.
"This is really and truly our position and I don't see it changing," he said.
The talks in Cardiff were also attended by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, as well as Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it was still not clear what Brexit would involve and said Prime Minister Theresa May should have been there.
"I think the British prime minister should have been here today," he said.
"She is a new British prime minister, this was her first opportunity to attend the meeting of the British Irish Council and to meet with the devolved institutions and the crown dependencies and I think it was a missed opportunity on her behalf."
This is the third summit for the normally biannual group in 2016, after an emergency session also hosted in Wales following the EU referendum.
Varying approaches to early years education and child care are also expected to be on the agenda.
