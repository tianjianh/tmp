Bieber's What Do You Mean became the singer's fastest-selling single and his first UK number one when it topped the charts at the beginning of this month.
His return to the top sees Sigala slide to number two, closely followed by Calvin Harris and Disciples at three.
Stereophonics score their sixth number one album with Keep The Village Alive.
It was a close call between the Welsh band and Bring Me the Horizon's album That's The Spirit, with just 1300 combined chart sales between the two
"To have got to Number 1 on our own record label is amazing," said Stereophonics' Kelly Jones, "Twenty years in fans old and new have got us to the top."
Libertines entered the album chart at number three with their first studio album in 11 years following cancelled events in London and Manchester and a Radio 1 Live Lounge appearance earlier this week.
Frontman Pete Doherty was understood to have suffered an "anxiety attack" but was reported to be back on form at a small gig in London on Wednesday.
Meanwhile former chart-topper Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh slide two places to number four, with '80s favourites Duran Duran rounding out this week's Top 5 with Paper Gods.
