Reigate and Banstead Borough Council has agreed in principle to use compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) for the land off Balcombe Road, Horley.
"It was a very big shock. We are in a very bad state," said Suresh Mara, manager of Jai Ho restaurant, which might be forced out.
The council said major international businesses wanted to move to the area.
Its executive discussed the business park and expressed its willingness to use CPO powers to buy the land on Thursday.
But, residents said they knew nothing about the plan in advance.
Mr Mara, whose business would be affected, said he did not know what was happening.
"Nobody consulted us and suddenly we are getting this news," he said.
"There are 15 or 16 staff whose families will be jeopardised."
Green county councillor Jonathan Essex said the development would use up green space, which separated homes in Horley, Surrey from the West Sussex airport.
"Horley should be a separate town, not just part of the urban sprawl of Gatwick," he said.
Conservative councillor Natalie Bramhall said information about the plans could not be made public previously because it was "commercially confidential".
"Now we have made the decision we will be talking to and consulting with residents, employers and landowners who could potentially be affected," she said.
"Attracting investment is really important in delivering economic benefits for the borough and jobs for residents.
"We have already had offers from major international businesses that want to move on to this site so we could be providing fantastic jobs for the local residents."
