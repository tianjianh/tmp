[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Biggar has recovered from a back injury to be on Ospreys' bench for their Pro12 trip to Zebre on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Davies starts at fly-half instead of Biggar, who is joined as a replacement by Wales team-mate, lock Alun Wyn Jones.
Paul James returns at prop following injury and flanker Justin Tipuric leads the Welsh region at open-side.
Former New Zealand full-back Mils Muliaina makes his Zebre debut after joining from Connacht in the summer.
Ospreys lie eighth with three wins from eight competition starts this season while Zebre are 11th win two wins.
Biggar came off in their 13-6 win over Cardiff Blues because of a back problem.
Hooker Baldwin (calf) and prop James (shoulder) missed that game because of injuries suffered in Ospreys' 34-29 European Champions Cup defeat at Clermont Auvergne.
Ospreys' ex-New Zealand scrum-half Brendan Leonard will return to Zebre for the first time since joining from the Italian team before the 2015-16 season.
Head coach Steve Tandy hopes Ospreys' recent form will continue to improve against Zebre.
"They've got an excellent record at their place, are a very dangerous side, and if we are just a couple of percent off our game then we won't get what we need from the game," said.
"Our slow start in the Pro12 means there's no margin for error for us. Our form over the last few weeks, in the league and in Europe, has been better, but there is still some way for us to go."
