Tom Cairney, Liam Cooper and Ryan Fraser are potential debutants for Scotland against Canada but James Morrison is an injury doubt.

Matt Phillips, James McArthur and Grant Hanley pulled out of the squad for the games against Canada and Slovenia.
Leeds United defender Cooper was then added to Gordon Strachan's pool.
Canada's squad for the friendly includes Falkirk duo Fraser Aird and Luca Gasparotto, Cardiff's Junior Hoilett and Burnley's Scott Arfield.
Gasparotto and fellow defender La'Vere Corbin-Ong, who plays his club football in Germany with FSV Frankfurt, could make their senior international debuts.
Dundee forward Marcus Haber is also in interim head coach Michael Findlay's squad, with Ecuadorian Octavio Zambrano taking charge after Wednesday's match.
The match at Hibernian's Easter Road will be Scotland's first since their 3-0 defeat by England in November.
That result left them next-to-bottom of their World Cup qualifying group - four points behind Slovenia, who visit Hampden on Sunday in the fifth round of qualifiers.
Strachan has said striker Leigh Griffiths is the only one of six Celtic player in the squad who will be considered for Wednesday's friendly, which means midfielder Stuart Armstrong will need to wait for his debut.
Griffiths has not started any of the past 13 games for the Premiership leaders, who were in action at Dundee on Sunday.
Morrison missed West Brom's win over Arsenal on Saturday and even if he does not feature on Wednesday, the midfielder could play against Slovenia.
With no regular right-back in the squad, Ikechi Anya is likely to fill in, although Russell Martin has also played their for club and country.
