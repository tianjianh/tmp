[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portugal coach Paulo Bento has left his role by mutual consent after last week's 1-0 defeat at home to Albania.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bento, 45, had been in charge since 2010 but failed to steer his side out of the group stages at this summer's World Cup in Brazil.
The Portuguese Football Federation say his replacement will be announced soon, though it gave no date.
Portugal's second Euro 2016 qualifier is against Denmark next month, after they play France in a friendly.
Under Bento, Portugal reached the last four at Euro 2012 before losing a penalty shootout to eventual winners Spain.
They qualified for the World Cup by beating Sweden in a play-off but were thrashed 4-0 by Germany in their opener and were eliminated at the group stage.
