[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 2-1 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matthew Connolly's last-minute own goal helped Rotherham secure their first league victory of the season against 10-man Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe's penalty put the Millers ahead after Cardiff keeper David Marshall was sent off for kicking out at Matt Derbyshire on 40 minutes.
But Peter Whittingham's fierce penalty after Farrend Rawson brought down Fabio levelled things before half-time.
Rotherham won it when Connolly turned Chris Maguire's cross into his own net.
Despite the victory Rotherham remain bottom of the Championship while Cardiff suffered their first defeat away from home in the league this season.
After a dour first 40 minutes the game exploded into life when visiting keeper Marshall lashed out at Derbyshire off the ball, getting himself sent off and conceding a penalty, which Odjidja-Ofoe tucked away for his first Millers goal.
Steve Evans's side could not take their lead into half-time though as Whittingham smashed home a spot-kick down the middle of the goal following Rawson's clumsy foul on Fabio.
The home side started brightly in the second-half as Jonson Clarke-Harris's half-volley was superbly saved by substitute goalkeeper Simon Moore.
Joe Newell's thunderous volley struck the post late on as Rotherham seemed destined to remain winless in the league, before Maguire's dangerous cross was inadvertently deflected into his own net by Connolly, sending the home crowd wild at a first three points of the season.
Rotherham United manager Steve Evans: "The win has been coming for me. I think if it would have been anything other than a win it would have been a travesty. We've been the best side by a million miles from the first minute.
"I thought we were battering them at 11 versus 11. They showed no interest in going forward in the second half and were camped behind the ball. The question was in the second half could we get the goal that our momentum deserved? You think it's not going to be our day.
"I think we were fantastic. We beat a top side full of quality players. We gave them a bit of a hiding."
Cardiff City manager Russell Slade on David Marshall's red card: "It's clearly a free-kick to ourselves because the player (Derbyshire) has pulled David Marshall and then David has lashed out. So yes it is a sending off - but it's not a penalty, it's a free-kick to ourselves.
"Should we have been down to 10 men? Yes we should. It's frustrating but he's left the 10 out there in a very difficult position. I'm sure he'll be very regretful of what's happened today. Occasionally players see the red mist.
"I thought we'd done enough in terms of digging in and defending as a group. We made big sacrifices to ensure that we could take a point back down the motorway but it wasn't to be."
