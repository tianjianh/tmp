AEL Larissa and Acharnaikos players observed two minutes' silence after kick-off in Friday's second-tier game.
In the latest incident, at least 39 migrants drowned trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece.
"It is in memory of the hundreds of children losing their lives every day," said a AEL Larissa statement.
