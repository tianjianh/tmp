The 20-year-old from Bournemouth, in her first European Tour appearance of the 2017 season, finished with a six-under 67 for 11 under overall.
South Korean duo Hae Rym Kim and Seon Woo Bae contested a play-off after both finished on 14 under over three rounds, with the former holding on for victory.
"I played well and my long game was really good," Hall said.
"If I had reached the hole with more of my putts then I might have been in a play-off, but I'm joint third and I'm very happy with that."
Also tied for third were South Korea's Lee So-young and Min Sung Kim.
Scotland's Kylie Henry, 31, finished 13th on six under par.
