[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Safety railings are set to be installed on a path alongside a stretch of the River Avon in Bath where six people have drowned since 2009.

The Environment Agency will put in temporary railings along the downward slope from Green Park Road, Bath and North East Somerset Council has said.
It is hoped the temporary fix will cover the busy festive period until permanent fencing goes in next month.
The recommendation was made by a multi-agency river safety steering group.
The group has been reviewing the circumstances around student Sam Amin's death in the River Avon in September.
Mr Amin had just finished his A-levels and was due to start university.
Permanent fencing will be installed on the 19 January, the council said.
The council's strategic river group has been allocated Â£400,000 to improve safety in the area.
Three people have died after falling into the river, within the past year alone.
