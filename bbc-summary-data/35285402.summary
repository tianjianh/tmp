[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mrs Cameron is following in the footsteps of another prime ministerial spouse, Sarah Brown, in appearing in a Sport Relief edition of the show.
Other contestants in the show include former Labour MP Ed Balls.
Mr Cameron told the Stylist magazine that he would "rather fight an election than make pastry from scratch".
The prime minister said he was a fan of the show and watched it with his daughter Nancy when his official duties allowed.
"We backed Nadiya (Hussain) to win in the last series. We're hoping our support will have the same effect on Sam when she appears on The Great Sport Relief Bake Off in March.
"I don't envy her. I'd rather fight an election than make pastry from scratch."
Mrs Cameron is one of 16 high-profile figures taking part in The Great Sport Relief Bake Off to raise money for charity.
