Royal Navy sailor denies beer bottle indecent assault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sailor indecently assaulted a drunk colleague with a beer bottle and filmed it for the "amusement of others", a court martial heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Donaldson, 34, denies assault by penetration on board the Plymouth-based frigate HMS Northumberland in August 2013.
The court martial heard the victim had been drinking heavily while the ship was docked at Bournemouth.
The trial at Portsmouth Naval Base continues.
Logistician Donaldson also denies a charge of disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind.
The victim had drunk six cans of cider in an hour and Nadim Bashir, prosecuting, said he had fallen asleep at an event in the petty officer's mess.
Colleagues took photographs sticking their tongues out next to the unconscious victim's bare bottom.
Mr Bashir said: "Matters were to escalate rapidly. Donaldson took hold of a beer bottle and made a statement for those viewing the video of his intentions."
The victim, who said in a statement he was very drunk and had been sick "several times", recoiled and woke up during the assault, the hearing was told.
Senior officers judging the case were shown video footage.
The trial was told that Donaldson does not deny carrying out the action, although he cannot remember it and denies that it was of a sexual nature.
Leading Seaman Christopher Cook, 31, denies a separate charge disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind.
Leading Logistician Roger Spratt, 28, who recorded footage on Logistician Donaldson's mobile phone, has already been dealt with by the court.
