Eastbourne taxi misconduct hearing for senior policeman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior Sussex police officer cleared of allegations he made racist remarks to a taxi driver in Eastbourne has attended a misconduct hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The allegations concerned an argument with two taxi drivers in the East Sussex town on 5 September.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found the officer's behaviour fell short of that expected from a police officer.
The force says he has now been given management advice.
It followed a misconduct meeting on 30 March chaired by a chief officer from another force.
The officer was suspended from duty last year but the suspension was lifted on 17 February.
A spokeswoman said his role would be "considered" when a number of senior officer changes took place in the next few weeks.
The IPCC also investigated allegations that an East Sussex-based inspector unlawfully accessed a force IT system in relation to the incident.
A file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decided to take no further action.
The two officers were off-duty at the time of the argument.
