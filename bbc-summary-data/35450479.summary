Lawrie, 47, who led Grace by two shots on 11 under overnight, carded a 78 to finish seven strokes behind in Doha.
Grace, 27, shot a three-under 69 to finish on 14 under, two strokes clear of Spain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Thorbjorn Oleson of Denmark.
"I hit it poorly, putted awfully and got unlucky a few times," said Lawrie.
England's Andrew Johnstone and Lee Slattery tied for third with Bradley Dredge of Wales.
Lawrie, the 1999 Open champion, found the water to card a double bogey on the seventh, and lost the overall lead two holes later.
Grace mastered the windy conditions in Doha with four birdies as he claimed his seventh European Tour title.
"This is a tournament that kicked my season off last year and hopefully it can take me to even better things this time round," he said.
