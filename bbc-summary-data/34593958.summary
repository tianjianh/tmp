A driver who took a wrong turn and drove on to tram tracks caused almost an hour of delays while his vehicle was removed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 4x4 disrupted rush-hour services between University Boulevard and the Toton Lane terminus in Nottingham.
The tram operator said the driver, who was not familiar with the area, "became embedded" in a tram-only section of track.
The motorist was "extremely apologetic", the spokesman said.
A Nottingham Express Transit spokesman said: "Although it is clearly signposted as a tram only route, the driver took a wrong turning and unfortunately ended up with his vehicle stuck on the tracks.
"Our technicians removed the vehicle and the driver was extremely apologetic about what had happened.
"Services were delayed for around 40 minutes while we resolved the incident."
A police spokesman said they were informed of the delays but were not involved in the removal of the vehicle.
