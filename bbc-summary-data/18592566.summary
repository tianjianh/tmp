MP challenges Nottingham's Decent Homes funding cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Nottingham MP is to challenge the government over plans to almost halve the funding for a project which improves social housing in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lilian Greenwood, Labour MP for Nottingham South, has questioned housing ministers about reductions to the Decent Homes programme.
She said the coalition was to cut the remaining project from £91m to £45m.
The government said the funding was the highest allocation for anywhere in the country outside of London.
The Decent Homes initiative was established by the Labour government in 2000 and is provided through Nottingham City Homes.
Ms Greenwood has secured an end of day adjournment debate in Parliament on the future of the programme.
The move follows the  
          publication of a report by Nottingham Trent Business School 
in March, which found that the housing projects have reduced the energy consumed by council properties and cut burglaries by up to 42% on some estates.
The study also found the housing scheme had improved people's health.
The Nottingham South MP said: "Thanks to Nottingham Trent University's study we have hard evidence that Labour's Decent Homes programme led to real, measurable improvements to the quality and security of homes in Nottingham and made life better for council tenants and the neighbourhoods they live in.
"I hope that Tuesday's debate will draw attention to the important work that Nottingham City Homes is doing, and the need to protect funding for future improvements."
Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said: "Despite inheriting a huge economic deficit, we are committed to investing over £2bn in the Decent Homes programme to bring 127,000 council homes up to standard.
"In recognition of the large number of homes they have in disrepair, Nottingham City Homes has confirmed funding of over £40m funding, with a further funding of £46m to be confirmed in due course - the highest allocation for anywhere in the country outside of London.
"This is on top of £78m for new homes and regeneration in the city.
"Nottingham Trent University's study shows the important economic and social benefits that this programme can bring, which is why we remain committed to the Decent Homes programme."
