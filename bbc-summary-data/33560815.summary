[SN]TITLE[SN]
Canoe fraudsters John and Anne Darwin 'have no assets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Canoe fraudster John Darwin and his ex-wife Anne have no known assets after the seizing of his £40,000 pension, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The couple, from Seaton Carew near Hartlepool, were jailed in 2008 for making false insurance claims after faking his death in the North Sea.
A total of £541,762.39 has been repaid by the couple, according to the CPS.
The couple's fraud was exposed when a photograph of them in Panama appeared on the internet.
The CPS said Mrs Darwin, 63, had repaid more than £500,000, while the £40,000 her husband paid in July last year from his pension meant he no longer had any assets.
While Mr Darwin hid in the marital home, his wife pretended to be a grieving widow, fooling even their two sons.
The couple then moved to Panama to start a new life.
But their story unravelled when Mr Darwin returned to the UK, claiming to have amnesia, in December 2007.
The couple, who have since split, have been subject to Proceeds of Crime hearings.
Following his conviction, the court found Mr Darwin, 64, had benefited by £679,194.62 but as he had pretended to be dead, all assets were in his wife's name.
The court therefore made an order for £1 allowing the CPS to amend the order should any assets, such as the pension, become available.
The CPS spokesman added: "The Darwins now have no known assets remaining for confiscation."
Nick Price, head of proceeds of crime at the CPS, said: "When John Darwin devised his plan to defraud insurance companies, he didn't think he'd get caught at all.
"But he also didn't bank on the dedication and determination of my team to recover the money he stole - even seven years later."
