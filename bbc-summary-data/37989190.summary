[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a memorial garden for Sir Nicholas Winton, who rescued hundreds of children from the Holocaust in the months before World War Two, has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Nicholas, who died last year aged 106, brought Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia to the UK.
The garden at Oaken Grove Park in Maidenhead will include an ornamental pond, a fountain and an information panel which will display a number of quotes from Sir Nicholas.
It is expected to open in spring 2017.
Samantha Rayner from Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said: "Sir Nicholas was a quiet and humble man despite his global fame and we wanted to make sure that any tribute to him respects that side of his character.
"We have worked very closely with his family to find the most fitting memorial and we feel that an outdoor space for relaxation and contemplation will do just that.
"Sir Nicholas' bravery will always be a proud part of Maidenhead's history and I am glad that we are able to create this wonderful new space right round the corner from where he once lived."
In 1939, Sir Nicholas organised the rescue of 669 Jewish children destined for Nazi concentration camps, arranging for trains to carry them out of German-occupied Prague to the UK.
He lived much of his life in the village of Pinkneys Green until he died last year at the age of 106.
