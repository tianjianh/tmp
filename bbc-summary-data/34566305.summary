Tata Steel is expected to announce 1,200 UK job cuts next week.
The firm is expected to significantly reduce the workforce at its Scunthorpe plant, which employs 4,000 people and is one of the UK's biggest.
Andrew Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, said he had spoken to the prime minister about support for the steel industry.
The company declined to confirm the job cuts, but said it had been facing challenges in the UK such as a surge in steel imports, and the relative strength of the pound.
A spokesman said: "We've made a number of structural changes to our UK business over the last months and years to make us more competitive.
"Like all companies we continue to review the performance of our business."
Mr Percy said that many of the problems facing the steel industry were "subject to decisions elsewhere, be that in the EU or indeed internationally".
"There are actions the government can do to help," he said. "But as Tata has made really clear even if the government does everything that's asked of them, that is no magic bullet and that does not solve the issues.
"So I can assure them [steel workers] that where the government can act here, myself and other local MPs and the local council will push to the absolute  maximum on that."
Tony Gosling,  a steelworker in Scunthorpe and a Labour councillor, said the job cuts would be "absolutely devastating".
"This area is still heavily dependent on the steel industry - a lot of the other small manufacturing companies all rely on it," he said.
