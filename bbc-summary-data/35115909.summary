The 28-year-old has not played for the Lilywhites since the start of October as he hoped the problem would heal.
The Jamaica international joins striker Stevie May in missing the rest of the campaign through injury.
"Chris has had some bad news that he's probably going to miss the rest of the season," boss Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"The injury which he picked up, which was a freak injury, we thought it might be able to heal but he had the scans the other day and it's not got about healing.
"He'll have some form of operation on that which will unfortunately rule the lad out."
Grayson added they would look at bringing in some cover in January because of the injury.
