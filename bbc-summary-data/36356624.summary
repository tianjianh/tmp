The current mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson and Luciana Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, are also considering standing.
Last week Merseyside-born Andy Burnham announced plans to run for a similar post in Greater Manchester.
Elections for mayor of the Liverpool City Region will be held in 2017.
The area covers five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton and Wirral - as well as Halton in Cheshire.
Mr Rotheram said: "I have received such an overwhelming number of individuals and organisations who have contacted me encouraging me to do what they believe would be the right thing for the whole city region and its people."
Pledging that no borough would be "left behind", he added: "I will be announcing a number of priorities over the coming weeks that will provide the basis for my manifesto for change and outline my strategic vision for the City Region."
