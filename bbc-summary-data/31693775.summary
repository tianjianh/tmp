The Thai businessman officially took over the club from Milan Mandaric on Monday after a deal worth Â£37.5m.
The Owls, currently 10th in the table, celebrate their 150th anniversary in 2017 and Chansiri is hopeful they can be in the top division by then.
He told BBC Radio Sheffield: "We want to be back for our anniversary."
Chansiri added: "We will do whatever is appropriate to invest in the club to get them to the Premier League."
Wednesday have not played in the top flight since suffering relegation in 1999-2000 and they are 14 points off the play-off places with 12 games left to play this season.
Chansiri, whose family owns Thai Union Frozen Group, said he had purchased the club with his own personal money and that the club was now debt-free.
He added that he is not looking to replace manager Stuart Gray and said he was persuaded to buy the club by his son.
"My son was one of the big factors in making this decision," he said. "During the period when I was deciding whether or not to go through with it, he was very insistent that I do so."
