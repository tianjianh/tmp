[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset secured a home One-Day Cup quarter-final after a 10-run win over bottom side Sussex at Taunton.

Tom Abell's 106 off 117 balls, his first-ever one-day century, rescued the hosts' innings which ended on 237, while Sussex's Jofra Archer took 5-42.
But Sussex, who have won just once in the competition, failed to recover from a poor start and regularly lost wickets as two batsmen top-scored with 39.
Tim Groenewald took 3-30 for Somerset, while Max Waller had figures of 2-36.
Sussex had Somerset on the ropes as early as the second over as 21-year-old Archer took the wickets of Mahela Jayawardene (3) and Peter Trego (0) to leave the hosts on 17-2.
But 22-year-old Abell, making just his second appearance on the One-Day Cup this season, played an innings beyond his years as he hit nine fours and a six.
Apart from a fourth-wicket stand of 70 with James Hildreth (26), none of his team-mates could forge a decent partnership with the youngster as former West Indies Under-19 bowler Archer showed his potential.
However Sussex's miserable season continued, losing opener Philip Salt for a duck with just one run on the board before Abell ran out Harry Finch.
With Sussex 95-7, Archer and Ajmal Shazhad put on 61 for the eight wicket - a record partnership for Sussex in matches against Somerset - to add some respectability to the score before Archer was bowled by Waller.
Abell capped off his great day with an excellent diving catch to dismiss Shazhad as Somerset secured a home tie in the knockout stages.
