Jordan McClure's Mini Cooper crashed at about 15:20 BST on Burgh Road, near Kirkandrews-on-Eden, on Easter Sunday.
The 18-year-old, from Carlisle, was pronounced dead at the scene.
In a tribute, his family, friends and colleagues said he was "like a firework, full of light and life" and he would be "sadly missed".
He worked for Eden Construction Services, "often returning home dirty and tired but happy", his family said.
