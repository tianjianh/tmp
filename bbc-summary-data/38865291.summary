However, Ramadan Sobhi is available following the completion of the Africa Cup of Nations.
Luka Milivojevic is available for Crystal Palace after securing a visa, while Mamadou Sakho could also make his debut for the club.
Fellow new signing Jeffrey Schlupp is in contention after a hamstring strain but Scott Dann is injured.
John Motson: "Only goal difference is keeping Crystal Palace off the foot of the table. Their league position can't get much worse but you have to wonder when, or if, it will improve.
"Under Alan Pardew and now Sam Allarydce, Palace have only won seven of their last 45 league fixtures - losing 27.
"One of those wins was a 4-1 thumping of Stoke in September but the current bad run started after another victory against the Potters, at the bet365 Stadium in December 2015.
"Can they emulate that win? Well, mid-table Stoke have only won twice in 10 games but a point might be viewed as a step in the right direction for Palace."
Stoke City manager Mark Hughes: "The game will be difficult for us because clearly Palace had a poor performance and result last time out, and you would imagine without a doubt there will be a reaction from them.
"They are struggling a little bit for form and in a bad place - but actually I view it as probably the worst result for us because you know they will be better than they were last week.
"We have to be ready and make sure that we impose our game on them, and not vice versa."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce on last week's 4-0 home defeat by Sunderland: "By the end of Sunday morning it was all clear what we'd been through and how we'd let ourselves down.
"It is something we don't want to do again, I don't want to bring them in at seven o'clock in the morning just to get it out of the way but hopefully it has had the desired effect.
"Last Saturday at home, it was like a hot knife through butter as they say, we were wide open and had no defensive solidarity so we have got to get back to knowing what gets us out of the position we are in."
Stoke did not create many chances in their defeat at West Brom last week but they always cause teams problems at home, which is bad news for Palace.
