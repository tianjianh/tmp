[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Female police officers were secretly filmed in changing rooms for the "sexual gratification" of a voyeur.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Richardson-Blake, 32, of Redbridge, Peterborough, was contracted to carry out electrical work at Abingdon police station.
Oxford Crown Court heard he fitted a camera in the women's changing room at the station to record officers getting changed.
Richardson-Blake admitted voyeurism and will be sentenced on 3 April.
He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register by Judge Patrick Eccles QC.
The court heard how Richardson-Blake recorded others "doing private acts" for his own sexual gratification or for that of a third party.
He also admitted stealing a laptop belonging to Thames Valley Police from the station in Colwell Drive.
It was subsequently discovered at his home.
Supt Andy Boyd said: "This was a particularly brazen offence in which Christopher Richardson-Blake installed a camera in a female changing room.
"This demonstrated a complete lack of respect and a deliberate intrusion into their privacy."
