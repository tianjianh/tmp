Close to 22,000 runners are predicted to take part in the race that will be shown on BBC Two Wales and online.
Organisers say the numbers confirm Cardiff's place as the UK's second-biggest half marathon and claim it is the third-largest road race behind the Great North Run and London Marathon.
There is also a new start time of 10:00 BST.
"With such strong competition from so many races across the UK, Run 4 Wales is delighted to be able to announce record entry figures for this year's event," said Matt Newman, chief executive of the event organisers.
"We've also assembled the best elite field in the race's history and are confident we will see new event records in both the men's and women's competitions."
