It is a sight that would surely strike fear into even the most battle-hardened opponent.

The hurlers of Ruairí Óg Cushendall have been backed to "bring home" an All-Ireland title by Hollywood hero Liam Neeson.
The club, based in Neeson's native County Antrim, will take on Na Piarsaigh of County Limerick in the senior club final in Dublin on St Patrick's Day.
The Taken star won a schools' hurling crown with St Patrick's College in his hometown Ballymena back in 1966.
And he proved he hasn't lost his touch in the short video clip, catching a sliotar, the small leather ball used in the game, before sending it into the distance as he roared on the Ruairís.
The All-Ireland club hurling final will be live on the BBC Sport website and BBC Radio Ulster 1341MW from 13:30 GMT on Thursday 17 March.
