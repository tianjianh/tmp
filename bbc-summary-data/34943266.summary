[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mill Green stores project given Cannock Chase council go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a Â£110m designer outlet shopping village have been approved by Cannock Chase District council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project at Mill Green, Cannock would feature about 130 shops and restaurants and create up to 1,200 jobs
The council said due to its size it has to be referred to the communities and local government secretary to decide whether it would be 'called in' for determination at national level.
The first phase could be open during 2018, the authority stated.
The planned 23,758 sq m (255,728.98 sq ft) site includes a play area and a visitor centre.
Gordon Alcott, portfolio leader for economic development & planning at the council, said he hoped "most of the new jobs will go to people from the Cannock area and surrounding District".
