Leeds United's Scotland international striker Ross McCormack has joined Championship rivals Fulham for an undisclosed fee, believed to be Â£11m.

McCormack has signed a four-year contract with the Cottagers, with the option of a further 12 months.
The 27-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds he felt he had been "hung out to dry" over the move.
Leeds said last week they were under no pressure to sell their captain after he handed in a transfer request.
McCormack, the subject of a failed bid from West Ham in January, was last season's top scorer in the Championship, netting 28 goals as Leeds finished 16th.
He said the Elland Road club would "always have a special place in my heart" but was "no longer the Leeds United I fell in love with".
The Glasgow-born forward started his career at Rangers, before spells at Motherwell and Cardiff City prior to his switch to Leeds in 2010.
McCormack has been capped 11 times by Scotland and has scored twice for his country.
He is Fulham's fifth summer signing following their relegation last season after a 13-year stay in the Premier League.
Cottagers manager Felix Magath has already recruited former Schalke defender Tim Hoogland, Australia striker Adam Taggart, defender Kay Voser from Basel and Motherwell defender Shaun Hutchinson.
