House of Cards author Michael Dobbs has revealed he is working on a "very major project" with the creator of Danish political drama Borgen.

The Conservative peer said the project had "a pretty good pedigree" and would "hopefully be on BBC screens" in 2014.
Dramatised by the BBC in 1990, Dobbs' House of Cards novel recently inspired a US remake starring Kevin Spacey.
Borgen, created by Adam Price, tells of a politician who becomes Denmark's first woman prime minister.
Lord Dobbs confirmed to Sunday's edition of The World This Weekend on Radio 4 that he had "got together" with Price to work.
No details of the collaboration were forthcoming, though the author and politician did express an interest in telling the "real story" of Denis Thatcher.
"What a brilliant, brilliant character to base a play on," he said of Margaret Thatcher's late husband, describing him as "misunderstood" and "wonderfully strong".
The original House of Cards told of a conniving chief whip, played by Ian Richardson, who uses duplicity and guile to have himself elevated to the post of Conservative prime minister.
The US remake, produced by the online streaming service Netflix, stars Kevin Spacey and relocates the action to Washington DC.
