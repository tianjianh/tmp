Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha says he has cleared the air with Aberdeen counterpart Derek McInnes over a glass of Portuguese wine.

Caixinha told McInnes not to come into his office following the Dons' midweek 2-1 victory at Ibrox, after the Portuguese felt slighted at Pittodrie.
However, Caxinha says the situation has been resolved between both managers.
"With a fantastic glass of Portuguese wine, everything stays clear, that's what matters," he said.

The Rangers boss had said McInnes did not join him for a post-match drink when the teams met at Pittodrie last month.
McInnes, however, insists the Portuguese was "mistaken", adding "every manager is welcome in my office".
Speaking on Friday, Caixinha indicated that the issue between the pair had been resolved and that their relationship was respectful.
"We had a very good glass of fantastic Portuguese wine," he said. "One glass of wine clarifies everything. It's done and everything stays in my office. What's private is private."
Aberdeen's victory at Ibrox was their first at the stadium since 1991, with Graeme Shinnie and Ryan Christie scoring before Martyn Waghorn's reply for the hosts.
McInnes was, on Friday, reluctant to discuss the situation with Caixinha.
"I don't want to comment any further other than really a couple of things have been said that disappoints me," he said. "I think it's a wee bit of a sideshow.
"But other than that I just want to focus on the performance and result of the team, which were excellent."
When asked whether he had had a glass of wine with his Rangers counterpart, McInnes said: "Like I say, I will just concentrate on the result."
