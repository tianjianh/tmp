Power has been restored to the stages at Glastonbury after an electrical storm caused the festival to be shut down temporarily on safety grounds.

Pop star Lily Allen stepped on to the main Pyramid Stage at 19:00 BST, 30 minutes later than planned.
Dance collective Rudimental had their set cut short as the storm approached.
Rudimental had just two songs left to play when the technical crew were seen running on stage and guiding group members out.
The crowd started to boo, unaware of the situation until another stage manager explained an electric storm meant it was not safe to continue.
"We're quite upset but we had a great time anyway," said Rudimental's multi-instrumentalist producer Amir Amor.
"We managed to shut down Glastonbury," he joked. "We called upon the gods to have some lightning strike at the right time.
"Unfortunately, we had to get off the stage. They forced us off, which is a bit annoying, because we wanted to finish our set."
The band were allowed to return to the stage to take a bow, but the electricity had been cut and they missed the last two songs from their set list, including the number one single Feel The Love.
"We thought we were going to go back on," said keyboard player Kesi Dryden, "but unfortunately it was the end of our set.
"But before that it was an amazing show. We had a lot of fun and hopefully we can come back next year and give them our full set."
During the storm, Elbow singer Guy Garvey - whose band were due to play the Pyramid stage at 20:00 BST told the BBC: "All the power has been switched off.... it sounds quite dramatic to me. I really hope everybody gets to play."
But he added: "This looks like it's going to pass. It looks like it'll scooch through."
Live streaming of Glastonbury on the BBC website was interrupted by the storm just before 18:00 BST.
A message on the large screens either side of the Pyramid Stage had read: "Thank you for your patience, we apologise for the inconvenience.
"In the interests of safety it was necessary to temporarily stop the show. Live music will return to the stage shortly."
By 18:30 BST, the rain had eased off and the sky on the horizon had cleared.
Glastonbury organisers tweeted: "All stages are up and running after the short delay. Some set times are being adjusted slightly."
Kaiser Chiefs kicked off the first full day of music on Friday. Other acts due to appear in the evening include Lily Allen and Paolo Nutini.
In separate incidents, two people have died on the festival site since the gates opened.
A 26-year-old man from Reading in Berkshire died on Friday from a suspected adverse reaction to the illegal drug ketamine.
He was initially taken to hospital on Thursday, but police at the Glastonbury site confirmed he has since died and that his family have been informed.
On Wednesday, a 67-year-old woman died in her sleep. Police said the festivalgoer died in her tent overnight from what they believed to be natural causes.
