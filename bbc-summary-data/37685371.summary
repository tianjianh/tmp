Charges dropped in Aberdeen and Maribor fan disturbance case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors have dropped all charges against 10 Eastern European men alleged to have been involved in a disturbance following a Uefa Europa League game at Pittodrie in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sixteen men were charged in connection with a "minor disturbance" on Chapel Street in the early hours of 28 July.
Three of the men lived locally and the rest were from Eastern Europe.
The Crown Office has now dropped all charges against the Eastern European men.
Only a handful of supporters attended the game from Slovenia to watch Maribor draw 1-1 with the home side.
A Crown Office spokesman said: "The procurator fiscal in Aberdeen received a report concerning 10 individuals in connection with alleged offences on 29 July, 2016.
"After full and thorough consideration of the facts and circumstances, the procurator fiscal decided there should be no further action."
