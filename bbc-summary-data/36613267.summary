Spain repeat election: Party leaders woo voters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigning has intensified in Spain ahead of Sunday's repeat parliamentary election, with opinion polls suggesting another four-way race.

The ruling conservative Popular Party (PP) led by acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is expected to take the largest share of the vote.
A leftist coalition, Unidos Podemos, would come second, followed by the Socialists and Ciudadanos.
But no party is seen as coming close to an overall majority of seats.
The vote was called after the parties failed to form a new government following December's inconclusive election.
Since then, the country has been ruled by the PP in a caretaker capacity.
The campaign has been marked by a lack of enthusiasm among voters, with abstention predicted to be higher than at the last vote.
With an unemployment rate at 21%, the economy remains the main concern for Spaniards.
However there are signs that confidence is recovering as the country emerges from the 2008-2013 double-dip recession known as "la crisis".
