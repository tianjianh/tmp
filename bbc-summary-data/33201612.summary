[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition revealing the hidden treasures of the Mayans has opened at the Liverpool World Museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The free exhibition, which has 385 objects from museums and historical sites in Mexico, runs until 18 October.
Museum director Steve Judd said it was a great honour for the museum as it was the only UK venue for the exhibition.
Objects range from a court ring and ceramic figurine of a ball player to a small golden frog with turquoise eyes.
Accompanying the exhibition is a programme of free events, including a celebration weekend in July; Mexican folk dance and traditional music; workshops for schools, as well as craft activities exploring Mayan culture.
