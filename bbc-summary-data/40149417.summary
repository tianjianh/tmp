"It was an incredibly close race," Heath said.
"I gave as good as I could have out there today in a slight headwind coming into the finish. I don't think I was firing on all cylinders today."
The 32-year-old is now focusing on the European Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which begin on 23 July.
"It's been a very good start to the season and it shows that our training is in the right place and we've got a good block of training now before the Europeans," he said.
"Next week I'll drop down with a bit of gym work, then I'll have a little break with my wife before getting back to hard training."
