[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is to stand trial charged with raping a woman in Edinburgh while she was asleep.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rory Crawford, 33, from the city, is said to have carried out the attack at a flat in the East Craigs area days after Christmas last year.
Prosecutors claim the woman was initially sleeping and "incapable of giving or with-holding consent".
Mr Crawford entered a not guilty plea. Judge Lord Burns set a trial due to take place next May in Edinburgh.
The case is expected to last about three days.
It is claimed that after the woman woke, Crawford restrained her, struggled with her and continued to have sex with her.
The hearing took place at the High Court in Glasgow.
