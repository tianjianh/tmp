[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torino 0-0 Empoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England goalkeeper Joe Hart kept a clean sheet on his home debut for Torino as they drew 0-0 with Empoli.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hart was not forced to make a save until the 63rd minute and the visitors had only two shots on target.
The 29-year-old, on loan with the Italians from Manchester City, was initially left off the teamsheet on Torino's website in favour of Daniele Padelli, but the mistake was rectified.
Last week Torino got his name wrong on the teamsheet for his debut.
In his first game against Atalanta, Hart failed to deal with a corner and conceded an equaliser, but he was assured against Empoli at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino.
He saved a Vincent Laurini shot at his near post and was quick off his line to smother the ball as Manuel Pucciarelli ran on to a through ball.
