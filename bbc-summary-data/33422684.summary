[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A building where William Shakespeare went to school and saw theatre performances is to be restored thanks to a £1.4m lottery grant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Guildhall, which dates back to 1420, at King Edward VI School in Stratford-upon-Avon, includes his schoolroom and a theatre.
The project includes repairing the timber structure and conserving medieval paintings.
Work is scheduled to end in April 2016, 400 years after Shakespeare's death.
It will include upgrading the heating system and installing an accessible toilet and a lift.
The Guildhall, not far from Shakespeare's birthplace, was where he saw some of his first theatre performances, the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) said.
It is still used for teaching every day, but the project will allow children from Coventry and Birmingham to have a lesson where Shakespeare once sat.
Under the initiative, there will also be creative writing sessions for members of the public at the Guildhall, along with lessons for children in a Tudor style, interactive displays and performances being shown on screens.
Head of HLF West Midlands Reyahn King said: "This project will enable the wider public and tourists from around the world to sit where Shakespeare sat and gain an insight into the world which helped inspire him to become the world's greatest playwright."
The school, known to have been in existence from 1295, is a state-funded academy trust selective school for boys.
The Guildhall has also been used as a base for Stratford borough council.
