Redcar steel aid package to fund training

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A task force set up following the closure of Redcar's SSI steel plant has released details of how it will spend the first tranche of an aid package.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government pledged up to £80m to help the 2,200 workers who lost their jobs when the Thai-based owners went into liquidation.
The first £7.3m to be released will be used for training purposes.
It includes £1.7m to encourage other employers to take on one or more of the 50 ex-SSI apprentices.
A £3m package will fund education and training for former workers, or people who have been made redundant in the supply chain as a result of the closure, at four Teesside colleges.
There will also be a flexible support fund of £2.6m, to address any barriers individuals have to securing new jobs or training provision.
Chair of the SSI task force, and chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland Council, Amanda Skelton said: "We know many workers are already highly skilled but this will give them the extra support they will need to secure alternative employment."
