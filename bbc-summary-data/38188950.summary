The robbery happened at the Bank of Scotland in High Street, Dunkeld, at about 11:25 on Tuesday.
Officers had appealed for any drivers who were in the area at the time and had dashcam footage to contact them.
They have now urged anyone who recognises the man in the images to get in touch.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Officers believe that the man shown in the attached images may have information that will assist them with their investigation.
"He is described as being white with fair eyebrows, 20-30, about 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in, medium build, wearing a black-hooded top with a red or orange design on the front and blue jeans. He is understood to have a Perthshire accent."
