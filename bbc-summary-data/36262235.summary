England manager Roy Hodgson is delaying announcing his 23-man Euro 2016 squad until Monday to "better assess players' fitness" after the final round of Premier League fixtures.

It was due to be revealed on Thursday.
The official deadline for the Football Association to submit its squad to Uefa before the tournament is 31 May.
England have warm-up games against Turkey, Australia and Portugal before the finals, which are being played in France between 10 June and 10 July.
Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck is expected to be ruled out of the Euros with an injury to his right knee picked up in Sunday's 2-2 draw against Manchester City.
His team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 22, is already missing the tournament.
There are also fitness concerns over another Gunners midfielder, Jack Wilshere, who has just returned to Arsenal's first team after 10 months out with a broken leg, while Liverpool's Jordan Henderson suffered knee ligament damage last month.
However, his manager Jurgen Klopp says "there is no doubt" the 25-year-old Reds captain will be ready for the tournament.
