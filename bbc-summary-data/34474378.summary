[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of people have applied to buy homes for £1 in Liverpool.

In total, 2,750 people have expressed an interest in buying empty terraced properties in the Picton area.
The scheme, which was started by Mayor Joe Anderson in 2013, aims to regenerate deprived parts of the city and help the economy.
In the successful first tranche, 20 homes were sold around Granby Four Streets and Arnside Road.
Tony Mousdale, empty homes manager of Liverpool City Council, told the BBC: "All the plumbing and the electrics and fixtures and fittings have been ripped out - so it is pretty much a shell.
"It's a blank canvas and people can put their own stamp on it."
Garrick Street, off Smithdown Road, is one of nine roads in Picton to be released for sale.
A total of 250 applicants who were not successful in the last project were contacted by the local authority before the scheme was reopened to the general public.
The applicants will be contacted by the end of the month to let them know about the next stage in the process.
Mr Mousdale said some homes are "worse than others" with old wallpaper and tiles around the fireplaces and no kitchens or bathrooms.
To be eligible for the £1 homes, applicants must have lived or worked in Liverpool, be employed and be first-time buyers.
Those with children and a good credit history also have priority and must "demonstrate they have the resources to undertake the cost of the refurbishment work".
Mr Mousdale acknowledged it was "very much" a challenge for owners, adding: "The appeal is they can put their own stamp on it."
Some of the properties have been empty for at least 10 to 15 years.
