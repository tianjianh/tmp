The men wore balaclavas and used a battering ram to enter David M Robinson Ltd in Railway Street, Altrincham, at about 12.20 BST on Wednesday.
A security guard was ordered to lie on the floor while the robbers smashed cabinets and placed the watches in a bag, police said.
They then escaped in a Land Rover.
The vehicle was later found abandoned on Ashworth Close in nearby Bowdon.
The robbers remain at large.
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said the precise value of the goods was still being quantified but gave an estimate of between £250,000 and £750,000.
Det Insp Carl Gilbert said the robbery was "a planned and calculated heist, resulting in a hugely valuable haul being stolen".
He added: "They were heavily armed, knew exactly what they were doing, and were in and out in a matter of minutes.
"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the heist itself, or the offenders in the act of escaping, to contact us."
