[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bank of England committee unanimous on holding rates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bank of England policymakers voted unanimously to hold interest rates at their current historic low of 0.5% again in April, the minutes of the latest meeting show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes as inflation sits at a record low of 0%.
Bank policymakers expect the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to fall into negative territory in the coming months and to remain low this year.
And they remain concerned about low wage growth, the minutes show.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this month showed average wages excluding bonuses rose by 1.8% in the thee months to February compared with the same period a year earlier.
But while wage rises are now well ahead of inflation, Bank policymakers fear they are not rising quickly enough to meet the Bank's 2% inflation target in the medium term.
The minutes come a week before the ONS publishes its first estimate of UK economic growth for the three months to the end of March.
