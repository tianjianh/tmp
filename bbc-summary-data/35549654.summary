[SN]TITLE[SN]
Surgeon guilty of biting secretary at Bristol hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A private surgeon who has treated Premier League footballers and champion tennis players has been convicted of biting his secretary on the arm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bristol Magistrates' Court heard David Johnson, 57, bit his secretary Krysha James so hard he left a bruise.
The court heard he bit her after she put her arm across him as she reached for paper, at the private Spire Hospital in Bristol last September.
The judge found Johnson, of Sea Walls Road, guilty of assault by beating.
He was ordered to pay £1,500 in compensation and £6,00 in costs.
The hospital said it had withdrawn his rights to work there, while the court heard his departure had effectively cost the victim her own job working for him.
The knee surgeon, who has treated Premier League footballers and Wimbledon champions, had denied the charge, saying he had simply "nudged, pecked or kissed" Ms James while they worked together in a cabin in the hospital car park.
District judge Lynne Matthews said: "You have been convicted of a criminal assault in a moment of madness.
"Your assault of her was not borne of malice but arrogance that you could treat your secretary in this way."
Ms James told the court she felt his teeth sinking in and said the injury remained painful for 10 days afterwards.
She said: "I don't know why he did it. There was no horseplay previous to that.
"We hadn't had an argument so there was no aggression. It just came out of the blue."
The knee surgeon was suspended from the private hospital following the allegation.
A hospital spokeswoman said the surgeon's "practising privileges" had since been withdrawn.
The court heard Johnson, a father-of-two, had lost more than £100,000 in earnings since the incident, while his suspension meant his victim had also lost her job - costing Ms James her "main wage" of £1,300 a month.
