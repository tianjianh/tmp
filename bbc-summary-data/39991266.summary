Flanker James Davies produced the latest in a string of man-of-the-match awards this season for Scarlets as they beat Leinster in the Pro12 semi-final.

The 26-year-old has been left out of caretaker Wales coach Robin McBryde's squad for the two Test summer tour against Tonga and Samoa in June.
But Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac believes Davies is the best seven in Wales.
"If we had a choice of him over other open-sides in the country we would take James every day," Pivac said.
Despite Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric being away with the British and Irish Lions there was no space in the Wales squad for Davies, with Cardiff Blues' Ellis Jenkins, Thomas Young of Wasps and Dragons' Ollie Griffiths selected ahead of him.

Olympics sevens silver medallist Davies was instrumental as Scarlets overcame the first-half dismissal of wing Steffan Evans to claim a 27-15 win in Dublin on Friday.
Davies, brother of Lions and Wales centre Jonathan, played out of position on the wing in the second half, after Evans was red carded for a tip tackle on Leinster centre Garry Ringrose.
"If you put him on the wing he doesn't flinch, just goes out there and does the job," Pivac added.
"He has a great skill set and a very big heart.
"I have said from day one he is a fantastic player and I rate him very highly.
"His performances over three seasons have been top drawer and not just one or two weeks like some of the other players.
"As a group we support James and think he is a fantastic player."
