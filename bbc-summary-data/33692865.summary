A youth club has been reunited with eight of its stolen footballs after a dog found them in bushes that border a playing field.

Meg Brace's border collie has retrieved more than 20 balls on the open space behind her home in Glemsford, Suffolk.
After a public appeal, the Epic Youth Club recognised the balls had been taken from its kickabouts at the nearby village hall.
Stuart Ayling, youth club manager, said: "It's one remarkable pet."
The border collie, called Maggie, soon revealed her skill at retrieving balls and was featured in the East Anglian Daily Times.
"She's sometimes hard to get on with, but she has this talent," said Ms Brace.
"My other border collie Gizmo picks up litter from the same playing field and brings it to me to put in the bins.
"I just wish the kids would do it themselves."
Mr Ayling, who runs the youth club as part of the Edens Project based in neighbouring Sudbury, said: "We have had problems with our footballs being taken to the rec by older teenagers who weren't part of the youth club.
"We used to take several outside at once, so people walking past could easily take one without us noticing.
"They were being kicked into the bushes rather than brought back to us."
