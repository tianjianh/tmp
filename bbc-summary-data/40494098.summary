The bird was found hanging from a cliff in Dunbar on Sunday and freed by three members of the public and the Scottish SPCA.
They used a ladder and made an instrument to cut the seagull down.
It is thought the bird became tangled while trying to eat the Kittiwake eggs or chicks on the cliffs. The bird is being looked after by the SSPCA.
Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted on Sunday 25 June after a seagull was discovered hanging 30ft up a cliff in Dunbar.
Animal Rescue Officer Sarah Auldsmith said: "I think the gull got trapped whilst up there trying to eat the Kittiwake eggs or chicks as the whole wall is full of nests.
"I wasn't sure how I was going to get it down until three very helpful members of the public, Joel, Neil and Finlay McIntosh, came to the rescue. They managed to get ladders and made an instrument to cut the seagull down whilst I waited at the bottom to catch the bird.
"We successfully managed to untangle the seagull from the fishing line which was round its legs and wings and I was then able to take him to our National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fishcross where he will get some rest before being released back into the wild.
"Joel, Neil and Finlay were great, without their amazing help I would have had to call the fire brigade for assistance, so we'd like to say thanks very much for their quick thinking."
