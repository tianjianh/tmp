One Love Manchester is raising money for those affected by the suicide bombing at the end of Ariana Grande's performance at the Manchester Arena.
She is returning to the city, joined by stars including Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry and Take That.
It is not yet known how the unfolding London attack might affect the event.
Grande tweeted after the incident in the capital that she was "praying for London".
The Manchester attack killed 22 people - including children and teenagers who saw the show as well as parents arriving at the arena to pick them up at the end of the night.
The youngest victim was just eight years old.
Ariana Grande is going to be performing, having said she wanted to return to the "incredibly brave city" to spend time with her fans, and to "honour and raise money for the victims and their families".
She's bringing a host of stars with her - Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Usher, Pharrell, Little Mix, Robbie Williams, Black Eyed Peas, Niall Horan and Take That are all on the bill.
The Old Trafford cricket ground has a 50,000 capacity and tickets sold out within 20 minutes when they went on general sale.
Some tickets were set aside for fans at the original concert, who were promised free entry. Ticketmaster said 14,200 tickets were being held for them.
People have been asked not to bring bags, "for speed of entry", and will be searched as they enter the grounds.
Full details are here.
Proceeds will go to the We Love Manchester emergency fund, which has been set up by Manchester City Council, in conjunction with the British Red Cross.  Organisers expect at least Â£2m to be raised from the event.
