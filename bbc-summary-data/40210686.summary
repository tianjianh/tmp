Mr Watson said after the ballot: "The next few hours, maybe the next few days look very uncertain but one thing can be sure, Theresa May's authority has been undermined by this election.
"She is a damaged prime minister whose reputation may never recover."
He added the public had "responded to a positive campaign".
"We don't yet know how this election will turn out, but we know the people voted for hope."
