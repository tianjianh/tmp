The hosts made a flying start, with Dan Baker and Olly Cracknell scoring excellent team tries to give them a commanding 14-0 half-time lead.
Prop Nicky Smith powered over for a third try, before Sean O'Brien earned Connacht a late consolation score.
Even with fly-half Sam Davies in the sin-bin, Ospreys sealed the bonus point with Ashley Beck's last-minute try.
That gave Steve Tandy's men a Pro12 double over Connacht for the season, and added a final gloss to their eighth successive victory in all competitions.
Starting the game in third place and two points behind leaders Munster, Ospreys blew Connacht away with a high-octane first quarter.
The home side attacked with purpose and pace, fly-half Davies setting the tempo and the forwards carrying powerfully.
It was that combination which paved the way for the opening score, as Davies' perfectly-timed flat pass allowed flanker Cracknell to gallop deep into Connacht's half.
Ospreys maintained that momentum with a slick sequence of phases, and number eight Baker was on hand to plunge over from close range.
They had a second try with just 15 minutes gone, with Cracknell picking another fine angle and accelerating clear to touch down.
After encountering a little more Connacht resistance in the second half, Ospreys scored their third try as Smith wrestled his way over.
They were already 24-0 up when Davies was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on John Cooney, rendering O'Brien's score from a turnover a mere consolation for the visitors.
Ospreys' confounded their numerical disadvantage to score their bonus point-securing fourth try with the final play of the game, as Beck squeezed over in the corner.
