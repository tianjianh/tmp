Rhys Priestland believes new recruits Taulupe Faletau and Luke Charteris will "add something" to Bath this season.

The Wales forwards made their debuts for the west country club in Saturday's 32-17 win over Scarlets.
Priestland lasted only 10 minutes against his former team before leaving the field after a knock to the head.
"They're a couple of of boys I know pretty well and they've both settled in well," said the 48-times capped Wales fly-half.
"Taulupe started today and Luke came off the bench and they both added a lot to the squad.
"Hopefully throughout the season we'll see just how good they are and they can bring their experience and knowledge and add something to the squad and I'm sure they will do."
Number eight Faletau joined Bath from Newport Gwent Dragons at the end of the 2015-16 season while second row Charteris was at Racing 92 in France.
The 29-year-old Priestland is in his second season with Bath after eight years with Scarlets.
He was understudy to England fly-half George Ford last season, but says he is enjoying playing at the Recreation Ground where former All Black Todd Blackadder has taken over as coach from Mike Ford following Bath's ninth-placed Premiership finish.
"I'm really enjoying it," added Priestland, who has been linked with Bristol and Worcester despite having a year left on his contract with Bath.
"It's a very talented squad and a good group of people involved in the club.
"We were all disappointed with the way the season went last year but fingers crossed this year we've got new coaches, hopefully we'll have some fresh ideas and it's been a good pre-season."
Priestland, a Six Nations Grand Slam winner with Wales in 2012, was disappointed not to get more time against the Scarlets.
"It was pretty strange. It's the first time I've ever played against a team I've played for before and it's just a shame it lasted about 10 minutes," he added.
"I just got a bang on the head - I passed all the tests in there but I think these days everyone wants to play it safe when it comes to head injuries and the doctor made the call it was out of my hands
"I'm showing no symptoms now and hopefully I can play next week if selected against Leinster."
