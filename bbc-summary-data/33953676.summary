The Great Britain pair comfortably beat Belgians Kenny De Ketele and Moreno De Pauw by 11 points at the Derby Arena.
Manxman Cavendish, 30, earlier finished second in the omnium behind GB team-mate Ed Clancy.
Briton Laura Trott beat Jolien D'Hoore by three points in the women's omnium as British riders began their campaigns to qualify for Rio 2016.
Trott, 23, who won the Olympic and World Championship titles in the event in 2012, held on to top spot despite coming second behind the Belgian in Sunday's points race.
Cavendish had competed on the track only twice since the 2008 Olympics - in Gent and Zurich last winter - but wants to qualify for Rio in the omnium.
Third after Saturday's events, he moved up one place following Sunday's time trial, flying lap and points race.
Yorkshireman Clancy, 30, an omnium bronze medallist at London 2012, finished on 228 points, 18 ahead of Cavendish, with fellow Briton Chris Latham third.
Cavendish and Wiggins, the Olympic time trial champion and former Tour de France champion, won Sunday's final race, the 40km madison over 160 laps.
Wiggins, 35, was earlier fined 200 Swiss Francs (Â£130) by race organisers for failing to attend the presentation after helping GB win gold in the team pursuit on Friday.
Jason Kenny, Trott's fiance, beat fellow Briton Lewis Oliva to gold in the keirin.
The first round of the Revolution Series marks the start of qualifying for the Rio Olympics, offering points for riders to enter the three World Cup events in October, December and January.
After Derby, the series visits Manchester in October, and London and Glasgow in November, before concluding with two more rounds in Manchester in January.
Riders must compete at two Olympic ranking events - World Cups, European Championships and World Championships - to qualify for Rio.
Britain can select one athlete for each track discipline in Brazil.
