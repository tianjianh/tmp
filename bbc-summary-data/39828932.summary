Abosede Adeyinka, 52, from Hayes, has been charged with attempted murder.

"It's completely gut wrenching and it really broke my heart and upset me that somebody... could go and do that to a 90-year-old," she said.
"I haven't got any nans and granddads left so I think elderly people just need to be bubble-wrapped and protected.
"I started the page to show that the community isn't all the same and to restore her faith in [that] and turn a negative into a positive."
So far, Â£1,900 has been raised and well-wishers have also been leaving messages of support at the nearby George and Dragon pub.
Its assistant manager Anne-Marie Portch she had been heartened by the response and messages had come from as far as Qatar.
"We knew the lady that it happened to and knowing that a member of our community had been assaulted - it's awful," she said.
"The amount of people that have come in and sent messages... has been everybody from 15 years old right up to 80."
Ms Adeyinka, a carer, has been remanded in custody until 30 May when she will appear at the Old Bailey.
