[SN]TITLE[SN]
OAP sentenced over Rev Thomas Sinclair's death in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner who caused the death of a church minister after he drove over him has been banned from driving for four years and given a restriction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kelman Edwards, 78, from Edinburgh, hit the accelerator instead of the brake.
Edwards had previously pled guilty to causing the death by careless driving of Rev Thomas Sinclair, 76, last May.
Edwards had been dropping off his daughter at Waverley station on 19 May 2014 when he found the ramp blocked by a new security barrier.
As he reversed back up on to the main road his foot hit the accelerator instead of the brake.
His automatic car sped across the road, hitting Rev Sinclair and then a bus on the other side of the road.
As he drove forward his car hit the minister again.
Thomas Sinclair, from East Tarbet on Lewis, had been attending the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He died at the scene.
As well as the driving ban, Edwards was given a restriction order confining him to his home at night for six months.
John Cunningham, Presbytery Clerk of Lewis, said: "This has been a great tragedy for all involved.
"As a Presbytery, our prayers are with Mrs Pam Sinclair and her family who are now reliving the horror of 2014.
"But our prayers are also with Mr Edwards and his family as he tries to come to terms with the life changing consequences of this dreadful accident. Above all, we commit all concerned to the love and care of our sovereign God who works out all things for good for those who trust him."
