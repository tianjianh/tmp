[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 3-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham got their Championship play-off push back on track with a comfortable win over Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Whites took the lead when Floyd Ayite scored his third goal in four days after Town goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski could only parry Chris Martin's effort.
Scott Malone made it 2-0 before the break before Stefan Johansen made the points safe with a measured finish.
Christophe Berra headed in a stoppage-time consolation for the visitors.
Despite the victory, Slavisa Jokanovic's men remained seventh after Sheffield Wednesday's win over promotion-chasing Newcastle in Saturday's late game.
Fulham, who had fallen to a 4-2 defeat at Derby on Tuesday, had almost secured victory within the first 30 minutes after Malone's goal added to Ayite's strike.
Mick McCarthy's men improved after the break and David McGoldrick twice went close before Johansen scored the home side's third.
Defeat left Ipswich in 17th, nine points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play.
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: "I am always happy when we have won three points.
"I am happy with the reaction with the defeat against Derby, we were a little bit confused why we lost the game.
"Today, we showed character and ambition and we played with confidence. We scored three goals and we could have scored more."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It's frustrating really, we made good chances and in the second half we had three great chances. But it's the tale of our season.
"I didn't think we were bad in the first half, we just gave two soft goals away. But they were good finishes by Fulham.
"Scoring goals was the difference today. Reality is, we should have scored after half-time but their keeper has made good saves and we've not managed to score.
"It was a much better team we played today, they're a really good side."
