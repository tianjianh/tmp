US elections 2016: Clinton outpaces Trump in fund-raising

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has a huge advantage in campaign funds over Republican rival Donald Trump, figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mrs Clinton's campaign began June with $42m (Â£28m) in the bank; for Mr Trump it was $1.3m.
The businessman has claimed to have self-funded his campaign, portraying himself as an outsider not linked to special interests.
Since securing his party's nomination, fundraising has intensified.
His team have sought to quash concerns about finances, saying money is "pouring in".
The latest federal disclosures however show the Republican National Committee, which is likely to pick up any shortfall, began June with about $20m in the bank.
By contrast, four years ago, when Mitt Romney was running for president, the figure stood at about $60m.
In May, donors gave Mr Trump's campaign just over $3m. Mr Trump lent another $2.2m, bringing his total loans over the past year to $46m.
The advantage will enable Mrs Clinton to take on more staff and launch an onslaught of attack adverts against Mr Trump.
The disclosures follow a difficult period for Mr Trump, with polls showing him trailing Mrs Clinton and criticism from top Republicans unhappy at his personal attacks against a Hispanic federal judge overseeing two lawsuits against him.
On Monday, Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired.
But he told CNN he had "no regrets", adding: "It's been an honour and a privilege to be a part of this."
