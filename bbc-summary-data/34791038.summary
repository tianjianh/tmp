[SN]TITLE[SN]
Princess Royal writes of her passion for lighthouses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Princess Royal has written about her passion for lighthouses in the foreword for a new book.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Princess Anne is patron of the Northern Lighthouse Board and a lighthouse "bagger".
Balmedie-based Ian Cowe spent seven years putting together his book Scottish and Manx Lighthouses.
In the foreword, the princess has written of the "remoteness and exceptional natural beauty" of the sites captured in Cowe's images.
The lighthouses were constructed to designs drawn by engineers working under or after renowned Scots engineer Robert Stevenson in the 18th Century.
Princess Anne said: "Ian Cowe's journey by foot, car, boat, plane and helicopter around our coast capturing the great lights built by the Stevenson engineers shows a real dedication,"
"The lighthouses stand testament to the dedicated work of the Stevenson engineers - built to last for the benefit of the mariner. Each light being quite different from the next as the generations of an engineering dynasty developed their own style but still very obviously and easily recognisable as Stevenson lighthouses."
The book will be officially launched at an event on the former Royal Yacht Britannia in Leith next week.
