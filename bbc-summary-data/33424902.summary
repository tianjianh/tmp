Nathan Sykes shares his photo album

With boyband The Wanted on what appears to be a permanent hiatus, Nathan Sykes has struck out on his own.

Now rebranded as a singer-songwriter, the 22-year-old has received glowing reviews for his jazzy, funky single Kiss Me Quick.
MTV praised his "incredible vocals and silky smooth tones", while Metro said he had the "confidence and charisma of a young Robbie Williams".
For his debut album, the Gloucester-born singer has worked with R&B heavyweights Harmony Samuels (Ne-Yo, Jennifer Lopez), Babyface (Whitney Houston, Toni Braxton) and Diane Warren (Aerosmith, Beyonce).
A carefully-plotted publicity campaign has seen Sykes undertake a low-key tour, and appear in fashion magazines like Hunger and Schon, as he establishes the distinction between baby-faced boyband singer, and fully-fledged solo artist.
All the while, he's been documenting his journey on camera - and he agreed to share some of those moments with the BBC News website.
This was my first performance after the band decided to take a break. It was such an honour to perform with Jessie J, she is one on the best female vocalists we have.
For me, this was my way of letting everyone know that I would be continuing with music.  It's all I've ever known and all I've ever wanted to do and I felt like, at 21, I was too young to stop doing what I loved.
Shortly after this performance I went to LA and started work on the album.
This was from a studio session with Ldn Noise. We never sat down with the purpose of writing Kiss Me Quick, we were just chatting one day and I said that I was really bad at flirting, so we wrote a song that could flirt for me!
I didn't know back then that it would be my first solo single but I think it's a great introduction to the sound. I think a lot of people were expecting The Wanted part 2 but I've always been inspired by jazz, soul and funk and I think that's apparent in the album, although it's still very much a pop album.
People will be surprised that I co-wrote every track on the album with the exception of the Diane [Warren] trackâ€¦ She's sold a billion records so I think she knows what she's doing!!
This is Babyface's actual piano!  Before I started the album, I came up with a list of people that I wanted to write with and Babyface was on that list. I didn't think for one second he would say yes but we sent him some clips and he came back straight away so that was my first "pinch myself" moment.  The second was actually being in the studio with him.
The song we wrote together is the total opposite to Kiss Me Quick. It's a ballad, and I really pour my heart out. It was such an emotionally draining day!  One of the things I am most excited about is for people to hear the contrasting sides to the album. There's the fun, playful up-tempo numbers and then the deep and meaningful ballads. People are really going to get to know me!
For the Kiss Me Quick video, I worked with the director Emil Nava, who has shot videos for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Calvin Harris. I really wanted to focus on the musicality of the track - it's got such a big sound that I wanted a simple but big idea that really brought out the energy.
That's one of the things I'm loving most about my solo projectâ€¦ the creative freedom.  In the band, there were four other people to please, as well as the label. Sometimes when you have different ideas for things they just don't come out the way that you hoped because everyone has a different view of what they want.
Now, I collaborate with the team but I am very much driving the project.  I think everyone was relieved when I approved the final "mixed and mastered" album as my notes were literally driving everyone mad! But I know every note on that album and it's important to me that it is the absolute best that it can be.
Once I'd written and recorded the album, I wanted to be able to share the music with fans, so I announced a run of intimate shows in the UK.
I was so nervous putting them on sale but they literally sold out within minutes. The first night in Glasgow was so much fun but a little strange as they only knew two songs, [teaser track] More Than You'll Ever Know, plus a cover of Adele's Rolling In The Deepâ€¦ They hadn't even heard the single at that point!!  By the second night in Newcastle they'd been watching videos on YouTube and knew every single word.  I love being on stage, and having an eight-piece band with me is so much fun.
I'm a massive fan of John Legend and had been obsessed with the track he did with Meghan Trainor called Like I'm Going To Lose You.
Meghan was playing in the venue next door to me in Birmingham on the same night and we only confirmed we would do a duet the night before the show. I got a call from my manager saying: "I hope you know the words" and that was that.  So the first time we performed together was in soundcheck and the second time was on stage in front of a sold-out audience!
As I finished my show I had to run from the stage, through the fans who were leaving my show and in to the room Meghan was playing. Everyone was a bit confused as to why I was running through the venue and I had to just say, "Check Twitter in 10 minutes."
Seconds before I was meant to join Meghan on stage I had a complete mind-blank and forgot the words! I had to Google them and, luckily, as I read the first line they came flooding back, just as Meghan said my name.
I've been lucky enough to perform at Wembley Stadium on a few occasions. One of the most memorable was making my comeback with The Wanted after surgery [for a haemorraged vocal cord in 2013] but playing the Summertime Ball this year was also an incredible experience.
I'm just a 22-year-old from Gloucester so to be up there performing my debut solo single in front of  80,000 people was the most amazing feeling.
The fans really are important to me. They've been really patient and supportive.
So to celebrate the release of Kiss Me Quick I wanted to do something special.  We came up with the idea of Sykes' Secret Show (SSS) where I performed an acoustic set and played a couple of tracks at the piano, as well as answering questions. The best bit was those that got to come to the actual event in London were nominated by friends and then I went to deliver some of the invitations personally.  It was so much fun surprising them.  I literally turned up on doorsteps, in schools... I even surprised one fan whilst she was at work!!
Kiss Me Quick is out now.
