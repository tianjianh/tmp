Australia international Kurtley Beale is close to making his Wasps debut after seven months out through injury, says director of rugby Dai Young.

Beale agreed to join Wasps on 13 May, but suffered a serious knee injury less than a day later while playing for New South Wales Waratahs in Super Rugby.
The 27-year-old's contract, which expires at the end of the season, makes him the Premiership's best paid player.
He could feature in Sunday's European Champions Cup game against Connacht.
"Kurtley's got to come through the first part of this week, but things are looking really promising that he'll have some involvement at the weekend," Young told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"He's been impressive, as he is as a person first and foremost. It's very difficult when you sign somebody and he's injured, but he's handled himself really well.
"He's really excited about playing and I think with the glimpses we've seen over the last couple of weeks everyone can see the quality that he's got."
Beale, who tore the patellar tendon off his kneecap, said he "couldn't ask for more" from the club while he was recovering.
"It's very exciting for myself, it's great to be able to get out and mix it with the full training squad," he told BBC Midlands Today.
"I can't be putting the team in jeopardy, so it's a matter of fully going out there and growing that confidence back into my knee.
"Hopefully if all goes well, I'll be up for selection."
