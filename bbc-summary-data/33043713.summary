The man is understood to be Vitautas Jokubauskas, who rented a room in a shared house in Peterborough where the suitcase was found on Friday.
Cambridgeshire Police said it was no longer searching for the Lithuanian national.
Police were called to the house in Mayor's Walk after other tenants reported a "pungent smell".
They found the woman's torso in a suitcase, which did not contain her legs, arms or head.
Police said the murder suspect had been arrested in Clipston Walk, Peterborough, at about 19:00 BST on Sunday.
The woman's body has been removed from the house and a post-mortem examination is due to take place at Peterborough City Hospital on Monday.
A police spokesman said it had not been identified but officers were keen to trace a woman, believed to be Mr Jokubauskas's partner.
She was described as being about 40 years old, slim, with black hair and also Lithuanian, he said.
