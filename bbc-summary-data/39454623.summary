[SN]TITLE[SN]
Defence begins in psychiatrist Dr Brian Harris sex trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The defence case has begun in the trial of a psychiatrist accused of rape and assaulting patients.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Brian Harris, 77, denies 13 counts of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault against five men between 1991 and 2011.
The jury at Merthyr Crown Court was told on Friday he will not give evidence in his own defence.
Dr Harris had worked for the NHS and in private practice in Cardiff for 40 years.
His legal team told the court he had been assessed by a clinical psychologist last July and August who concluded Dr Harris was likely to have experienced significant cognitive decline, more than would be expected as part of normal ageing.
There was strong evidence, the court was told, of a significant decline in his intellectual ability and his ability to recall.
The trial began three weeks ago.
