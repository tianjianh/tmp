The Olympic gymnastic silver medallist, who won Strictly in 2012, earned his latest success on the night that Sir Bruce Forsyth returned to the show.
Smith and professional partner Aliona Vilani earned a perfect score of 40 points from the judges for their quickstep to Jingle Bells.
They won after the judges' and studio audience's scores were combined.
Smith competed against other contestants from previous series - Rachel Stevens, Lisa Riley, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Chris Hollins and Russell Grant.
The 25-year-old said of his win: "It's a nice present, I am not going to lie! We've had such a fun time although the first week of rehearsals was hard.
"But since then we have just been chilling out, laughing and giggling, messing around on the dance floor, it's been really good fun."
The contestants and judges adopted the roles of pantomime characters.
Sir Bruce, who stepped down as the regular weekly host of the programme this year, came back to present the show with Tess Daly and also sang a version of Winter Wonderland.
