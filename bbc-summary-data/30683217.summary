The woman, believed to be in her 20s, was discovered just before midnight on Sunday in the grounds of Harlescott Junior School on Featherbed Lane.
Police are carrying out forensic examinations at the school, which will remain closed until Wednesday.
The woman has not yet been formally identified.
Forensics officers also searched a nearby property.
Two men, aged 32 and 39, and a 31-year-old woman, all from Shrewsbury, are being questioned on suspicion of murder, West Mercia Police said.
"Pupils were due to return to school tomorrow following the Christmas holidays but the decision has been taken to keep the school closed while investigations continue," a police spokesperson said on Monday.
The death is not thought to be linked to that of another woman in the area almost two weeks ago, according to the police.
