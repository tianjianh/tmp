Anglers in 'lucky escape' after boat gets into difficulty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three anglers had a "lucky escape" after their boat got into difficulties off Portrush, Country Antrim.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three men managed to scramble to the safety of the rocks before their boat was overcome by waves on Saturday.
Coleraine Coastguard led the men off the rocks, while a crew from Portrush RNLI towed the half-submerged boat into the harbour.
Rescuers said the boat had suffered mechanical failure and had "lost the ability to manoeuvre".
The incident happened near Ramore Head at about 18:30 BST.
Coastguards issued the men with general safety advice, including calling the coastguard as early as possible, making sure life-saving equipment is on board and checking the weather before setting out.
