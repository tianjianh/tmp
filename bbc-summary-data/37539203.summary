Police investigating the abduction and rape of a schoolgirl in Oxford say they are focusing on a city meadow as the attackers remain at large.

Thames Valley Police said officers would be patrolling and speaking to locals in Marston Meadow.
The 14-year-old was raped after being snatched on her way to school from the Banbury Road area of Summertown between 08:15 and 08:40 BST on Wednesday.
Det Supt Chris Ward said they would continue "extensive CCTV inquiries".
"We are taking every step necessary to ensure we have all the relevant information to bring the offenders to justice", he said.
The force said it was not releasing any further details and was "trying to gather information as part of the wider ongoing investigation".
Last week, the force asked drivers and cyclists who were travelling through the area on Wednesday to check head or dash camera footage in case they contained any clues.
Descriptions of two men have been released by Thames Valley Police.
The first offender was a white man who spoke with a northern accent.
He was described by the girl as aged in his mid 20s, balding with shaven dark blonde hair and blue eyes. He was of medium build and about 6ft (1.82m) tall.
Police said he was described as wearing black trousers and a hooded top with one pocket on the front and no drawstrings or logo.
The second man was white, with brown gelled hair, the girl said. He was cleanly shaven and had brown eyes.
He was aged in his late teens or early 20s and described as slightly smaller in build than the first offender.
The teenager was found by a member of public at midday after knocking on doors to get help in Cavendish Drive, Marston.
At a press conference on Thursday, it was said the girl was approached and possibly hugged, something that could have looked relatively innocent to witnesses.
An Oxfordshire County Council spokesman said the authority had spoken to independent and state schools across the county to offer safety advice and support.
