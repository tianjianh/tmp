The pair, believed to be a couple in their 60s, were hit in a lane behind Finsbury Terrace, Brynmill, at around 09:20 GMT on Sunday.
The woman was flown by air ambulance to hospital and was conscious on Sunday afternoon, South Wales Police said.
A neighbour said the man and woman were unloading shopping when it happened.
"I came out my back garden and saw two people trapped under a car," the neighbour said.
"The couple had just come back from shopping when they were run over by their own car.
"It's awful, they were a lovely couple. I didn't know their names but they would always say hi and were very polite."
A blue Peugeot was loaded into a container and removed from the scene on Sunday afternoon.
South Wales Police said the incident was being investigated.
Resident Myra Evans heard emergency services arrive.
"The ambulance, as I looked through the window, was screaming very fast... and then the helicopter was above it and hovered round for about 20 minutes, half an hour."
Ellie Rowley, who also lives nearby, added: "I could hear sirens going and then there were fire engines outside and I could hear a helicopter and it landed in the field."
Insp Jason Herbert, of South Wales Police, said initial reports suggested "a vehicle has rolled down the street trapping a male and female underneath".
A spokeswoman for Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said two ambulance crews and an officer attended at 09:21 GMT.
"We released two casualties from underneath the vehicle. There was a helimed there and a rapid response vehicle," the spokeswoman added.
