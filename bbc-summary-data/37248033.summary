Sussex resumed their second innings on 42-2, but Chris Nash and Luke Wells both fell to Hardus Viljoen for 23.
Craig Cachopa, who top-scored with 34, was caught behind off Matt Coles as the hosts were bowled out for 189 at Hove.
With two matches remaining, Kent are 24 points behind leaders Essex - who beat Worcestershire by an innings and 161 runs at Chelmsford.
Victory was Kent's first win in nine Championship matches at Sussex while the home side, who have three matches remaining, are off the pace in the race for promotion to Division One.
Sussex coach Mark Davis told BBC Sussex:
"To lose in seven sessions is not good enough, we accept that. That said, we played a very young side.
"We've had a few injuries, so we've got few young guys in.
"I've said all year that we weren't going to get any loan players, we wanted to see what our players could do.
"But yes, it was poor batting. We shouldn't lose that number of wickets that quickly. We will address it and have done after this innings already."
