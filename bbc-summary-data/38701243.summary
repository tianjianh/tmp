[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 0-0 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot Town and 10-man York City played out a goalless draw in the National League at the EBB Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vadaine Oliver was twice denied early on by Shots goalkeeper Jake Cole, who pulled off two superb reflex saves as his team flew out of the blocks.
His opposite number Kyle Letheren got in on the act by blocking Shamir Fenelon's close-range effort after 20 minutes, but it was the hosts who asked the most questions.
When Oliver did manage to beat Cole from close range just after the hour mark, the post came to York's rescue.
The visitors had Jon Parkin sent off in stoppage time, but it was too late for Aldershot to take advantage.
