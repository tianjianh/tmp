[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norfolk children's services commissioner appointed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norfolk's failing children's services will be overseen by a commissioner under new government measures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Hill, from Essex County Council, has been appointed in the role, and will report to the education secretary every three months.
If it does not improve within a year, the entire department will be taken over by another authority or trust.
Director Michael Rosen agreed the situation was "embarrassing" but performance had been improving.
The department was rated inadequate in 2013 and "widespread weaknesses" were found earlier this year.
In its last inspection, Ofsted said leadership, management and governance still needed improving and the pace of change was too slow.
A report in October said the council had lost contact with 190 children who had been in care, 26 of whom were aged 16 and 17 and could still be at risk.
It also found 16 out of 1,052 "in care" children did not even have their own allocated social worker.
Just seven out of 35 children who could be reunited with their parents had been returned home.
In once case, it took four months to hold a meeting about a five-year-old in care.

Mr Rosen said "children were being let down right across the system in 2013".
"The inspection we have just had shown that we have made a lot of improvement, in terms of health and protection, and we now have an effective system of school support.
"What remains to be improved is the service for looked-after children.
"It's great that the government wishes to put this extra pressure on us and I think staff will react in exactly the right way, which is 'come on, let's get the job finished'."
