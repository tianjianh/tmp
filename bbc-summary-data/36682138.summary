The group beat Adele, Little Mix and Ed Sheeran to win the award, despite currently being on a break.
One Direction scored more than 60% of votes to take the prize - the only award at the ceremony to be voted for by the public.
Other winners this year include Olly Murs and Florence Welch - who have won best male and best female respectively.
The awards ceremony took place on Friday afternoon, though all the winners were announced in advance.
One Direction said: "Thank you to all our fans for voting. Our live show is so important and it is amazing for this to be recognised... for the second time."
Lionel Richie was announced as the winner of the top honour - the Silver Clef Award.
Jess Glynne won best newcomer, while Craig David scooped the innovation award.
Patti Smith took home the outstanding achievement prize, while Jeff Lynne was the recipient of the icon award.
Violinist Andre Rieu was the winner of the classical award, while Irish musician Hozier received the international award.
Speaking before the ceremony at London's Grosvenor House Hotel, Murs said he was "very proud" to be recognised at an event in aid of the Nordoff-Robbins charity.
Glynne also said she was "really excited" to be recognised, calling the charity - which funds music therapy sessions for children and adults - "a special thing to be a part of."
ELO's Jeff Lynne said of his accolade: "I'm always shocked when I get anything but this is up there at the top. This is a beautiful thing and I'm very proud of it."
Richie, who received his award from Bee Gees star Barry Gibb, said his Silver Clef award was "the best thing in the world because attached to it is a charity".
"Attached to it is some kids that are probably going to use music therapy as I used it - to pull themselves back together again," added the 67-year-old singer.
