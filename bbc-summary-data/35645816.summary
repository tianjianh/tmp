The project, estimated to be worth up to £14m, will see film production facilities and workshops built at Giant's Park on the North Foreshore.
The planning application was submitted by Belfast Harbour.
Permission for the scheme was granted during a meeting of the committee on Tuesday evening.
Councillors were told the project would "create and support hundreds of jobs during construction and operation phases".
A late objection to the project was received by the committee from Titanic Quarter Ltd.
However, as this was not an objection to a planning matter, it did not impact the committee's decision.
A statement from the council said: "The objection lodged by Titanic Quarter was not based on planning issues, but procedural ones, which have been addressed."
Northern Ireland has become a popular filming location for international crews in recent years, with the US TV drama Game of Thrones among its best-known productions.
In 2014, analysis by the government-backed film and TV agency, Northern Ireland Screen, suggested that existing studios have been worth £120m to the local economy.
The North Foreshore of Belfast Lough is former landfill facility which has been transformed into the largest development site in the city.
