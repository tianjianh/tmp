A controversial sculpture by Sir Anish Kapoor on show at the Palace of Versailles in France has been vandalised for a second time.

The huge installation, called Dirty Corner, was covered with slogans, some of which were anti-Semitic.
The British-Indian artist's work was splattered with yellow paint in June before being cleaned.
But this time Sir Anish said he would not remove the graffiti, in order to highlight intolerance in society.
The artist, who is Jewish himself, has recently distanced himself from earlier comments comparing the sculpture to "the vagina of the queen who took power", saying the work was open to interpretation.
The installation is on show at the Palace at Versailles, which was once home to Marie Antoinette, the ill-fated queen who was guillotined during the French Revolution.
In the latest attack, the sculpture and the rocks around it had French phrases sprayed on it in white paint, including "the second rape of the nation by deviant Jewish activism" and "Christ is king in Versailles".
Sir Anish said he would stop the graffiti being removed from his piece, which due to be displayed in the palace gardens until 1 November.
"The sculpture will now carry the scars of this renewed attack. I will not allow this act of violence and intolerance to be erased," he said.
"Dirty Corner will now be marked with hate and I will preserve these scars as a memory of this painful history. I am determined that art will triumph."
French President Francois Hollande called the vandalism "hateful and anti-Semitic", while Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned that the perpetrators would be severely punished.
