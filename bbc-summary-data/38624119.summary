Scottish League One: Airdrieonians move level with second-placed Alloa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Leitch's late equaliser brought Airdrieonians their first point of 2017 against in-form East Fife at the Excelsior Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leitch snatched a 2-2 draw to move the hosts level on points with second-placed Alloa Athletic, who lost 1-0 at home to 10-man Peterhead.
Stenhousemuir won 1-0 to send opponents Stranraer to the foot of the table.
Livingston v Albion Rovers and Brechin City v Queen's Park were called off due to frozen pitches.
In Airdrie, the hosts had taken an early lead when Andy Ryan finished clinically for his 15th goal of the season.
Former Hamilton striker Ryan looked a threat the whole game and did well to find the net via the far post after good work by Scott Stewart and Adam Brown on the counter attack.
Centre-back Jason Kerr's header for the Bayview men was his fifth goal of the season and when Ross Brown added the second from Kevin Smith's cross it looked like Airdrie were on course for a third defeat in a row.
But Leitch steered home Jack McKay's cut-back at the near post for his first of the campaign.
That equaliser brought an end to the six-game winning run East Fife were enjoying under new manager Barry Smith.
In Alloa, Leighton McIntosh struck Peterhead's winner but was later sent off for violent conduct.
Stenny had started the day bottom but Kieran Millar fired them above Stranraer, who are now one point adrift of the Ochilview side and five off Peterhead.
