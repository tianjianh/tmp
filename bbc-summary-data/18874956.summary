On arrival, Prince Charles and Camilla opened a newly-renovated building at Grainville School in St Saviour.
They went to an open air States sitting in the Royal Square before meeting stallholders at the Central Market.
The royal couple's visit is part of their tour to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.
During the visit to Grainville, the royal couple met members of the Prince's Trust working within the school.
Janni Boon, 21, told Prince Charles how the trust helped him find a job as a youth worker after years of struggling to find permanent work.
He took part in a 12-week personal development course.
Mr Boon said: "I always thought I wanted to be a chef, so I didn't pay much attention to my school grades.
"But when that didn't work out, I was stuck with few qualifications and little work experience, which made it very difficult for me to get a job."
The Prince of Wales also tried wall-climbing while visiting Grainville School earlier.
John McGuinness, head teacher of the school, said: "The prince did quite a stretch in his suit and he drew a gasp from everyone including the duchess."
In a special meeting of the States in the Royal Square, Jersey's Bailiff Sir Michael Birt reaffirmed the island's loyalty to the English Crown.
During the sitting, Prince Charles said: "I can assure you that the Queen will be deeply touched as my wife and I have been to learn of the warmth of the welcome you have extended to us here today.
"In return I know Her Majesty will wish me to express how this great island of rich history and strong loyalties will remain so very dear to her heart now and in the years to come."
A commemorative granite feature and a specially-commissioned artwork of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant was unveiled in the square.
Prince Charles and Camilla then met stallholders at the Central Market and visited the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society showground in Trinity where they met winners of the Queen's Award for voluntary service.
The royal couple saw the St Clement's Battle of Flowers float which is being built in a tent nearby.
Later they will see the restoration work on the 13th Century Town Church in St Helier.
Prince Charles, who is patron of the National Trust for Jersey, will also visit the trust's newly restored property at 16 New Street.
He last visited Jersey in 2004, a year before his marriage to the Duchess of Cornwall.
