The inclusions of back row Caplice and lock Fryday are among 10 changes from Sunday's 12-10 defeat by England.
The pack is totally changed with Paula Fitzpatrick named captain and Munster trio Fiona Hayes, Zoe Grattage and Fiona Reidy picked in the front row.
Back three Mairead Coyle, Alison Miller and Niamh Kavanagh are retained with centres Nicole Fowley and Sene Naoupu.
Fryday will be partnered in the second row at the UCD Bowl by her Leinster team-mate Katie Norris while skipper Fitzpatrick and Caplice will be joined in the back row by Ciara Cooney.
The only Ulster starter in Saturday's contest against the beaten finalists at the 2014 World Cup is fly-half Nikki Caughey who will be partnered at half-back by Connacht's Mary Healy.
Ireland coach Tom Tierney said that he took "lots of positives" from last weekend's narrow defeat by the world champions.
"We will be looking to build on that over the next two weeks against Canada and New Zealand," added the Ireland coach.
"This weekend, Canada will present us with a new and different challenge.
"They have a very strong rugby programme in Canada and were runners-up at the last World Cup, so we will have to play smart rugby against them and stick to our game plan."
Larissa Muldoon, Lindsay Peat and Ailis Egan drop to the replacements after starting against England but fly-half Nora Stapleton is among those to drop out of the squad despite scoring a try in last weekend.
Captain Niamh Briggs remains out as she continues to cover from a hamstring injury she picked up in a recent club game.
Ireland (v Canada): M Coyne; N Kavanagh, N Fowley, S Naoupu, A Miller; N Caughey, M Healy; F Hayes, Z Grattage, F Reidy; K Norris, N Fryday; C Cooney, A Caplice, P Fitzpatrick.
Replacements: L Lyons, L Peat, A Egan, E Anthony, C Pearse, L Muldoon, J Shiels, C McLaughlin
