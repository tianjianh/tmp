Coroner asks CPS to probe Freckleton baby death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inquest into a baby boy's death at a vicarage in Lancashire has been halted and the coroner has referred the case to prosecutors.

Blackpool coroner Alan Wilson made what he described as the "rare" intervention as new medical evidence emerged about Jonathan Percival's death in 2014.
A doctor giving evidence said the baby could have survived with resuscitation.
The Rev James Percival and daughter Ruth were held on suspicion of murder but the CPS decided to take no action.
Ms Percival, 30, gave birth to Jonathan in a downstairs bathroom of the vicarage in Freckleton, and her father, 66, the then vicar of Holy Trinity CE Church, helped her.
Mr Percival told the police the child appeared "sallow and lifeless" and he thought was "obviously deceased" but Blackpool Coroner's Court was told the baby could have survived for up to 15 minutes after delivery.
The inquest which was attended by both Mr Percival and Jonathan's mother was told the baby was not seen by a medical professional for about two hours and was left alone in the house wrapped in a towel on a sofa as the pair visited their GP.
Consultant neonatologist Dr Ruth Gottstein told the court statistics showed that when babies were born with the cord around their neck there was an 80% survival rate if resuscitated.
Miss Percival and her father were due to give evidence on Wednesday as part of the three-day hearing but Mr Wilson told them it would not be "appropriate" to do so after Dr Gottstein's evidence.
The coroner said it was "incumbent" to refer the matter to prosecutors to consider if a criminal offence had occurred.
The wife of Mr Percival was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to conceal the birth of a child but was released with no further action.
