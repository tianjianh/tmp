First-time buyers in Scotland boost housing market

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First-time buyers in Scotland were key to helping increase activity in the housing market during 2014, according to industry figures.

However, the level of mortgages being agreed fell away in the second half of the year.
Lenders advanced 27,700 loans to first-time buyers over the 12 months, totalling £2.9bn.
This was 16% up in volume, compared to the previous year, and 23% up in value.
The average first-time buyer's loan was 2.9 times gross income, of nearly £34,000, compared with a UK average of 3.4 times.
In the fourth quarter of the year, the average first-time buyer loan was £97,400. With interest rates low, the cost of servicing that averaged 17% of gross income.
With other lending seeing slower growth, house price activity was up by 6.6% of all UK activity, down from a 6.9% share in 2013.
Within that, home movers in Scotland - selling and then buying homes - took out 31,800 loans, 5% more than the previous year. The value of these loans was up £4.6bn, or 10%.
This was 2.6 times average £51,000 gross earnings for those taking out loans, whereas the UK average was 3 times.
There were 23,400 loans for re-mortgaging homes during last year, totalling £2.6bn. This was 14% down on 2013 by volume of transactions, and 9% down by value.
Linda Docherty, chair of Council of Mortgage Lenders in Scotland, commented: "More people bought a home in Scotland last year than in any year since 2008, with a pronounced increase in first-time buyer activity in particular.
"As in the UK overall, there was a quarter-on-quarter dip in activity in the final quarter of the year. However, with inflation being low, employment increasing and there being signs of growth in household income, we believe there are grounds for optimism for continuing growth, albeit at a likely slower rate.
"The introduction in Scotland of Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, replacing stamp duty from April, should help provide a boost to the housing market, which could see half of new borrowers paying no tax when purchasing a home."
Meanwhile, Homes for Scotland, the construction industry body, called on the Scottish government to follow the example of the Welsh Assembly administration, in extending the Help to Buy shared equity scheme, which quickly ran out of funds last year due to the level of demand.
Chief executive Philip Hogg said more than 4,000 properties have been purchased through the Scottish Help to Buy scheme since it was launched, boosting the construction industry.
"The lending slowdown in the last six months of 2014 matches with our concerns regarding the impact the interruption in Help to Buy funding has had on the home building industry and our projections that total new housing output will have been chiefly flat over the last calendar year," Mr Hogg explained.
"With the need to ensure we have enough homes in the right locations to meet Scotland's diverse housing needs fundamental to the First Minister's objective of improving opportunity for all, we therefore keenly await the next Scottish Government housing statistics which are due to be published shortly."
