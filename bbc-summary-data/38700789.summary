The German forward, signed from Union Berlin, opened the scoring for the Championship side from close range.
Izzy Brown, on loan from Chelsea, doubled the lead from the penalty spot before Michael Hefele added the third.
Rochdale's misery was complete when Hefele added a fourth, his side's third goal in 18 second-half minutes.
Reaction from all of Saturday's FA Cup fourth round ties
The home side started strongly but ultimately paid the price for failing to take their chances.
Peter Vincenti headed narrowly over the bar before a poor back-pass by Mark Hudson let in Ian Henderson, but he fired wide.
Huddersfield's win was their biggest FA Cup away success since January 1960, when they won a third round replay 5-1 against West Ham.
Rochdale boss Keith Hill: "If we'd scored it would have been a different game.
"The only goal of theirs I could really applaud was the fourth because the other three were down to mistakes."
Huddersfield manager David Wagner: "It was not the type of football match and style that I like but I loved the result."
On Collin Quaner scoring in his first game: "It was a fantastic performance for his first game in difficult circumstances.
"He scored what we in Germany call the 'tin-opener' and he had some good moments. He gave a great assist for the fourth goal so you cannot really ask for more."
