BBC man in India child worker rescue drama

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rakesh Sinha of the BBC Delhi office recently found himself at the centre of a late-night drama when a young girl employed as a domestic help in the flat above his climbed down into his balcony with the aid of a sari. The girl alleged that she was being harassed by her employers and was later found to be a minor. Mr Sinha gives his account of how the events unfolded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a routine evening for my wife and son at our new home in the Delhi suburb of Noida. My son was finishing his homework at the dining table, which overlooks the drawing room and the kitchen.
At around 21:30, my wife first heard a gentle knock on the door of the kitchen balcony, which became increasingly frantic.
When she went to investigate, she saw to her astonishment that a young girl, barely 13, had managed to climb down into my 12th-floor balcony from the flat above with the aid of a cotton sari.
Afraid to open the door and let her in, my wife asked her what was wrong. She said she was trying to escape her abusive employers. My wife was reluctant to open the door. She tried unsuccessfully to call the building security. Meanwhile, the girl kept banging on the glass door hysterically, threatening to jump off if she was not let in.
My wife told our son to call our neighbours and the building security, while she kept the girl engaged in conversation.
Once the neighbours and the guard arrived, the door was opened and the girl was allowed inside the house. She tried to escape, pleading that she be allowed to run away because of the way her employers treated her.
My wife did not want to let her go, given the time of night and how unsafe the area could be for a young girl.  By this time the girl's employers had arrived - they told everyone that she was a "perpetual eloper", dragged her out of our house and took her away.
My family narrated the entire incident to me when I got home soon after.
I alerted the other residents though our WhatsApp group. It was soon discovered that the girl was a minor and must have been in great distress to attempt such a dramatic - and dangerous - escape.
We sent the security supervisor to the house and the girl was escorted to the building office along with her employers.
They said the girl had come to work for them of her own free will. But we were not convinced and called the police.
The girl told the police that she had been treated horrifically and alleged that she was not allowed to speak to her family.
Arrangements were made for the girl to stay the night with a family in the building. The next morning, police handed her over to an NGO who are in touch with her family.
The incident has traumatised my 10-year-old son who cannot stop looking towards the kitchen balcony at least once every five minutes.
Of course, the girl is now safe and we feel relieved. But there are countless other girls - and boys - who are in similar exploitative situations in India who need to be rescued.
The authorities and the citizens must join hands to end child labour and exploitation of children on an urgent basis.
