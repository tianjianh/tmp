There had always been rumours the actor would take on the part since Marvel announced the film's production.
Cumberbatch will play the neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, who suffers a car accident and gets involved in a world of magic and alternate dimensions.
The film is due for release in November 2016.
Announcing the casting, producer Kevin Fiege said: "Stephen Strange's story requires an actor capable of great depth and sincerity."
Doctor Strange has featured in numerous Marvel comics since the 1960s. He first appeared in a book called Strange Tales in July 1963.
In 1978, actor Peter Hooten played Strange in a TV movie, which was created as a pilot for a proposed series. It was never commissioned.
In October, Marvel announced a roster of film releases for the next five years, of which Doctor Strange was one.
Others include a new two-part Avengers film, Black Panther, Captain Marvel and a sequel to Guardians Of The Galaxy.
Before Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch will be seen in four more episodes of Sherlock and will also be the voice of Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.
