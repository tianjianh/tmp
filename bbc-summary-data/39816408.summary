Local election reaction from Devon and Cornwall
The Tories are the largest group with 46 seats but they would need need 62 seats to have overall control of Cornwall Council.
They could form a minority administration or there could be deals to be done.
Over the weekend there will be talks going on between all the main parties to decide who is going to be in charge for the next four years.
The council has been led by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and Independents since 2013.
In that election the Liberal Democrats took 36 seats, the Independents took 35, the Conservatives had 31, Labour had eight, UKIP had six, Mebyon Kernow had four, the Greens had one and candidates declared as "unspecified" took two.
