Luke Berry's penalty opened the scoring after Aaron McGowan brought down Harrison Dunk inside the box.
Dunk doubled the lead with a deflected shot and then headed in his second, before goals from Ben Williamson and Mark Roberts made it 5-0 at the break.
Zeli Ismail fired in the sixth from 18 yards, and Berry finished the scoring from the penalty spot in injury-time.
The result lifts the U's to ninth in the table, five points outside the play-off spots, while Morecambe fall to 20th.
Cambridge's previous biggest win in the Football League was 6-0, a scoreline they managed against Darlington in 1971 and also against Hartlepool in 1989.
Forty-six Morecambe fans, some of whom made a 462-mile round trip from Lancashire to see their team in action, saw their side suffer their heaviest league defeat since being promoted to the Football League in 2007.
But there was some comfort for Shrimps fans, with their hosts giving them all a free food and drink voucher "as a thank you for (their) superb effort in travelling so far to support (their) team".
Cambridge United manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"It's a fantastic night. I wasn't imagining that was going to happen. It's really difficult when you've had such frustration on Saturday (0-0 at home to Carlisle), to bounce back in the way we did was a credit to the boys.
"I've been on the end of a 6-0 and it's tough. I'm sure (Morecambe manager) Jim (Bentley) will respond because he's a good man and good manager, but obviously I'm really proud of the boys.
"Everything came right tonight. I felt all of the boys that pulled on the shirt played to their full maximum. That's not going to happen every week, but on our night, we looked like a really good team."
