Solihull travel firm closes over 'political instability' in Turkey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A travel firm specialising in holidays to Turkey and Northern Cyprus has ceased trading over "political instability" in its destinations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Akin Koc, who has run Anatolian Sky in Solihull for 26 years, said terror attacks had had a "devastating effect" on the company.
He apologised to customers and agents for the disruption to any holidays.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was helping about 1,200 holidaymakers following the collapse.

Turkey tourism: an industry in crisis
About 150 people were abroad when the company stopped trading on 1 July, with a further 460 bookings affecting 1,020 people.
Customers who are yet to travel, but have paid in full for flights and packages, can either go ahead with their holidays as planned or seek refunds, the CAA said.
Mr Koc said he was "very sad" to close the company, and called for more people to support tourism in Turkey.
He said: "It has become impossible to cope and sustain the business, particularly through recent attacks."
Last month a gun and suicide attack on Istanbul's Ataturk airport killed 42 people, including 13 foreign nationals.
