Nursery assistant faces 'cat drowning threat' hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nursery assistant is to face a disciplinary tribunal, accused of threatening to drown a six-year-old girl's family cat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kelly Cameron is also said to have threatened to take a fish belonging to the girl out of its tank and "dangle it by its tail".
Ms Cameron was working at an Aberdeen after-school club at the time of the alleged incidents in August 2013.
She will face a hearing in Dundee later in April.
The charges against her allege that she also called the girl "mink", "skank", and "sexy", called another child, aged nine, "ugly", and told a group of children to "shut up".
It is alleged that by these remarks, Ms Cameron "failed to communicate in an appropriate manner" with the children and placed them at risk of harm.
The nursery assistant, who could be struck off if the charges are found proven, is further accused of failing to inform a later employer, Bright Horizons Family Solutions Ltd, that she was under investigation by the Scottish Social Services Council.
The charge sheet states that the charge against Ms Cameron is current at the date of its publication, but may be amended during the hearing.
