The 31-year-old winger, who played two Tests for England in 2008, has combined playing with coaching the club's academy since the start of this season.
"There is so much excitement surrounding the club at present and I want to be a part of what we are striving to achieve," he said.
Scrum-half Brendan McKibbin and back Greig Tonks have also agreed new deals.
McKibbin, 31, and Tonks, 27, have also re-signed with the Exiles for an undisclosed period.
Ojo recently passed 400 career points and 80 tries for Irish as they look to make an immediate return to the Premiership.
