Scout Moor Wind Farm expansion plans scaled back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to double the size of a wind farm on the Lancashire moorland have been scaled down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peel Energy and United Utilities had wanted to double the 26 existing turbines at the Scout Moor wind farm between Rochdale and Rossendale.
Following consultation with local communities, however, the companies will only install 16 extra turbines.
A joint planning application will be submitted next year to Rochdale and Rossendale Borough Councils.
Jon England of Peel Energy said: "We received some really useful feedback and have changed our expansion plans in response."
He said the companies would seek feedback on the new proposals prior to submitting the planning application.
The revised plans involve increasing the distance between the proposed new turbines and important recreational routes, and placing them where they do not disturb areas of deep peat on the moor.
Before the wind farm opened in 2008 it faced opposition from residents' groups, Rossendale, Rochdale and Lancashire County councils.
It was given the go-ahead in May 2005 after a public inquiry.
