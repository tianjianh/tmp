They were part of 50-strong group from Dalbeattie High School on a trip to Normandy when their coach was involved in a collision with a car.
The incident happened near Alencon on Monday afternoon and parents were informed later.
None of the Scots casualties is thought to have life-threatening injuries.
Eight pupils were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure and three were kept in overnight, but they have since been discharged.
One teacher remains in hospital.
However, the driver of the car is believed to have been seriously injured.
A tweet sent from the school's Twitter account at about 14:00 on Monday had shown a view from the bus window with the comment: "View from the Dalbeattie High adventure bus is not too shabby! Had our lunch & 2hrs from the Chateau de Tertre."
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said on Tuesday morning that they were in contact with the authorities in France and with the school to offer consular assistance to those involved.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "We are closely monitoring the situation in France following a bus crash involving a school trip from Scotland and our thoughts are with those affected and families worried about loved ones.
"The Scottish government is in direct contact with Dumfries and Galloway education department and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and we stand ready to offer support and assistance as appropriate."
Dumfries and Galloway Council confirmed all the pupils were set to return home following the accident.
Director of Education Colin Grant said: "The well-being of all those on the trip is our priority.
"Following discussions, we have decided to bring the group home.
"The group has been given excellent support locally. We are in regular contact with the group and are continuing to monitor the situation."
