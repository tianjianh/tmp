[SN]TITLE[SN]
John O'Neill named as man who must tell police of sex plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who must notify police 24 hours before he has sex can be named, a district judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John O'Neill, 45, from York, was cleared of rape at a retrial last year but was made the subject of an interim sexual risk order (SRO).
An order prohibiting his identity from being made public has been lifted at York Magistrates Court.
North Yorkshire Police has applied for the SRO to be made permanent after Mr O'Neill allegedly breached it.
The single father-of-two has said he had an interest in sado-masochism and used to visit a fetish club.
He said the order violated his human rights and meant he could not have an intimate relationship.
"It's absolutely devastating. I don't have a life," he said.
SROs were introduced in England and Wales last year and can be applied to any individual who the police believe poses a risk of sexual harm - even if they have never been convicted of a crime.
The order requires Mr O'Neill to disclose any planned sexual activity to the police or face up to five years in prison.
Mr O'Neill is accused of breaching one of the conditions of the order by not giving police the Pin number to his mobile phone.
He has threatened to go on hunger strike in protest of the SRO.
A judge is to decide on the police's application at a hearing at the same court next month.
