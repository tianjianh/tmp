When a housing regeneration scheme was nominated for the art world's top award in 2015, a workshop was set up on the street so the homeware designs could be sold online.
That led Ms Khader back to her old road and she is now employed by Granby Workshop with Jade Crompton to make tiles, lampshades, handles and other items to be dispatched around the world.
