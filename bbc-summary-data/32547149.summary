Nuthall bus lane fines prompt appeal call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A motorist has urged fellow drivers, fined for being in a controversial bus lane in Nottinghamshire, to come forward after it emerged more than 80% of appeals were successful.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The banning of cars on a short stretch of Nottingham Road on to the A610 at Nuthall Island began in February 2014.
Nearly 21,500 fines have been issued but 51 of 62 appeals have been upheld.
The campaigner said the idea was poorly implemented but the county council insists signage has been improved.
Restrictions were put in place 10 years ago to stop Nottingham Road being used as a "rat-run" and help buses get on to the Nuthall roundabout.
However, the council said the restrictions were widely ignored and cameras were then fitted.
Local resident Steve Strickland was caught using the lane on a bank holiday but successfully took his case to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, which ruled the signage was inadequate.
He said the high rate of successful appeals showed the signage was "not fit for purpose".
"There are not enough signs, inaccurate guidance, difficult placement and no road markings.
"The council legally don't have to put down road markings but it is acknowledged, certainly at the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, that road markings are the most obvious way to get the motorists' attention.
"My advice is to appeal."
Peter Goode, Nottinghamshire County Council's traffic manager, said: "We were assured by consultants from day one that signage was adequate but we have [been] taking account of what adjudicators have said.
"The adjudicators sometimes look for something more than is legally required and in fact current rules lead us to believe road markings are not appropriate."
