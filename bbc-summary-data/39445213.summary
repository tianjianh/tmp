The Northern Ireland international, 29, is in the final few months of his contract, having first joined the Dons in 2012.
"His agent has indicated that there may be (English) Championship interest in Niall, which I am not too surprised about," said McInnes.
"And it's difficult for us to compete with Championship clubs."
With Aberdeen aiming to finish second in the Premiership and a Scottish Cup semi-final to look forward to, McInnes is hoping McGinn can end his Dons career with a flourish.
"He's still got plenty to offer," he said.
"I don't want to talk in the past tense; we're looking forward to the remainder of the season. He's been a real key player for us over the years.
"The financial gains often come into it, with players of a certain age.
"Niall has been very respectful. He accepts that our offer was a very good one and he's thought long and hard about it.
"We pushed for answer and, unfortunately, it looks like his destination will be the Championship."
McGinn first joined Aberdeen during Craig Brown's spell as manager, having been at Celtic for three years during which time he had a loan spell at Brentford.
He was part of the Dons team that won the Scottish League Cup in 2014 and he won the Scottish Cup with Celtic three years earlier.
Capable of playing in wide and central positions, McGinn has made over 200 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 67 goals.
He has also won 50 international caps and has three goals for his country, including one against Ukraine at Euro 2016.
