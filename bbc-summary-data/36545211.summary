Mickelson, who celebrates his 46th birthday on Thursday, is a six-time runner-up in the year's second major.
"This is the tournament I want to win most to complete the four majors," said Mickelson. "I think about it all the time.
"I have to put that out of my head, be patient and not think about results."
Only five players - Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, and South African Gary Player - have won a Grand Slam in the modern era.
Mickelson has won five majors, the most recent of which was the Open in 2013.
He said: "I'm excited I'm at one of my great opportunities. I view this week as a great opportunity to complete something that would be historic in my mind.
"This is a whole different style of golf, something that over the years I've become very effective at playing.
"I feel like I've learned how to play that style of golf, and this golf course, specifically."
Mickelson will play alongside England's Justin Rose and Swede Henrik Stenson for Thursday's opening round.
Masters champion Danny Willett will be alongside 2011 winner Rory McIlroy for the first two rounds. Victory would put him halfway to becoming the first man to win all four major tournaments in a calendar year.
Englishmen Lee Westwood and Luke Donald will start together, while world number one and defending champion Jordan Spieth begins alongside fellow American Zach Johnson.
