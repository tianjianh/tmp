[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fraser Franks own goal helps Doncaster move back to the top of League Two with a 1-0 victory which ended Stevenage's impressive run of away wins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender bundled into his own net in the 84th minute after attempting to keep out Tommy Rowe's rasping low drive from 15 yards.
It broke the stubborn resistance of a Stevenage side that had won their previous six away league matches.
And it was nothing more than Doncaster deserved after dominating the ball for long periods of the game on the 10th anniversary of their move to the Keepmoat Stadium.
Darren Ferguson's side did lack an incisive touch in the final third and it appeared their efforts would go unrewarded.
Conor Grant made a second debut for Doncaster after joining on loan from Everton and was a lively presence in midfield.
The closest the hosts came to breaking the deadlock was when Mathieu Baudry had an effort hooked off the line and Harry Middleton hit the crossbar via a deflection with a volley from close range.
Stevenage threatened a late equaliser when substitute Charlie Lee powered a header on goal but Baudry flicked over on his own line.
