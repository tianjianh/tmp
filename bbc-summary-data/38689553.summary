This is the first time in 15 years that Britain have had two men in the fourth round of a Grand Slam.
The last time this happened was in 2002 when Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski reached round four at Wimbledon.
Top seed Murray breezed past American Sam Querrey, beating him in straight sets 6-4 6-2 6-4 .
He is now the firm favourite to take the title, after last years winner Novak Djokovic was knocked out by wild card Denis Istomin.
Murray was joined by British number three Dan Evans, who continued his stunning run of victories by beating Australian 27th seed Bernard Tomic in straight sets.
This is the first time the Solihull born 26 year old has ever made it past the third round in a Grand Slam tournament.
Oddly enough he's having to buy his own t-shirts to play in after sports company Nike terminated his sponsorship deal recently.
With it looking likely that he'll now move in to the world's top 50 players, something tells us he might be getting a few phone calls!!
