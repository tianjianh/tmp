Opener Najeeb Tarakai hit 90 in India as Afghanistan made 184-8 with Barry McCarthy taking 4-33.
Ireland were 65-2 after 6.1 overs when rain halted play and they were set a revised target of 111 in 11 overs.
The Irish were undone by Rashid Khan's 5-3 in two overs and managed just 93-9 with Paul Stirling top-scoring on 34.
Afghanistan won Wednesday's opener by six wickets and a formidable total of 184 set them on course to clinch a series win.
Tarakai's 90 came off 79 balls while Mohammad Nabi (34) and Karim Janat (20) also added quick runs.
Ireland were in good shape on 65-2 when the covers came on and they would have levelled the series if no further play had been possible.
But they came back out and the fall of captain William Porterfield for 22)triggered a collapse with seven wickets falling for a mere 14 runs.
"It was frustrating when the rain came down," said Porterfield.
"We had momentum before it, and it was quite a long break which meant we didn't have the full 20 overs to play with.
"It was always going to be difficult needing to score 40 odd off four-and-a-bit overs."
The teams return to the Greater Noida Sports Complex Ground for the final T20 on Sunday before five ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup game at the same venue.
