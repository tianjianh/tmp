Health Minister Mark Drakeford said authorities were "doing all we can to offer practical support and assistance".
The free number - 0800 107 0900 - is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or people can text help to 81066.
It offers a confidential listening and emotional support service and contacts to other NHS sources of help if needed.
