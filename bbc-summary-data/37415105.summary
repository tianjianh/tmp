[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 1-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Terry Gornell rescued a point for Accrington after Chris Clements had put Mansfield ahead in a 1-1 draw at the Wham Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had a chance to get into the play-off places with victory but they had to share the spoils in a tepid encounter.
Jordan Clark fired wide for Stanley in the third minute and that was the closest either side came in the opening half-hour.
Mansfield had forced a number of corners and won a free-kick on the edge of the box on 31 minutes after a trip on Mitchell Rose.
Clements fired home the set-piece, off the underside of the crossbar, to make sure the Stags avoided beating an unwanted record of going five league games without a goal, which they set in 2000.
Stanley huffed and puffed but Mansfield still looked the main threat with Kevan Hurst testing Elliot Parish before half-time.
Whatever John Coleman said at the break worked as the Reds came out pressing with Stanley levelling on 56 minutes.
Janoi Donacien's free-kick in his own half was flicked on and fell to Gornell in the area and the striker's composed finish was his first goal of the campaign.
Winger Clark had two chances to put Stanley ahead - both efforts looping just over the bar - but neither side really looked like grabbing the victory.
