Emma Welch, 14, died on Thursday after complications during surgery to correct curvature of the spine.
Four days before her operation, she had led the bid to set a record for the largest number of teddies assembled on a mountaintop.
Emma and a team of volunteers climbed Snowdon with 135 soft toys in tow.
The teenager, of Chilcompton, Somerset, had also completed a 1,000-mile (1,609km) bike ride and scaled a height equivalent to Mount Everest on a climbing wall in aid of Brain Tumour Research.
Her fundraising efforts were inspired by Andrew Stammers, her minister at the Radstock Baptist Church, who has a brain tumour.
Mr Stammers, who is in close contact with Emma's parents Tony and Lesley, said she was "an amazing young woman" who "put everyone before herself".
"Her passion and determination was exceptional," he said.
"Emma did consider delaying her ascent of Snowdon until after her surgery, so I am so glad she went ahead with it."
"We now have such wonderful memories and pictures of her from that day as a lasting legacy."
Liz Fussey, of Brain Tumour Research, said Emma, who was diagnosed with scoliosis in 2012, had raised more than Â£5,000 for the charity.
"I have never encountered anyone like her, such drive and tenacity in someone so young," she said.
"I am deeply saddened and my heart goes out to Tony and Lesley for the loss of their adored daughter."
Emma's family have asked well-wishers to make donations through her Justgiving page as an alternative to flowers.
