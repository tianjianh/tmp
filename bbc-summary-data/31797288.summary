The Dutchman, 25, led 6-5 before racing to victory and the Â£60,000 first prize with five consecutive legs.
"This is a really big tournament to win and a difficult tournament too, so I'll enjoy this," said the world number one.
Wright defeated Phil Taylor at the quarter-final stage and whitewashed Stephen Bunting in the last four.
But the colourful 44-year-old from Mendham in Suffolk was unable to clinch his first major Professional Darts Corporation title, losing to van Gerwen, who also beat him in the 2014 World Championship final.
"It's been a long weekend and I think I ran out of energy in the final, and Michael was too good," said Scotland-born Wright.
"I'm really pleased to have got to the final though and I'm getting closer to a big TV title."
