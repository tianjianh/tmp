Kenny McLean converted an early penalty and Niall McGinn steered in a clever volley from a Shay Logan cross.
Rooney, on as a substitute after 10 weeks out, slammed in his 20th goal of the season from close range.
Ash Taylor's own goal reduced the deficit before Jonny Hayes scored from a great solo, while Motherwell lost Keith Lasley to a late red card.
With a visit to Celtic Park to come next weekend, the Dons are nine points behind the defending champions with three matches remaining but they trail by a colossal 35 on goal difference.

Aberdeen can delay the Celtic party further if they win in Glasgow and they can travel in confidence after an assured display.
The home fans were subdued after Celtic's lunchtime win at Hearts but the Dons began brightly and took the lead after just six minutes.
A determined burst from Hayes was halted when defender Louis Laing clipped the winger's heels and McLean sent goalkeeper Connor Ripley the wrong way from the spot.
Motherwell had plenty of possession in midfield but struggled to make any impact in the final third.
Aberdeen doubled their advantage on 26 minutes when the lively Hayes thrust through the middle to thread a pass to galloping full-back Logan. His cross was met by McGinn and the Northern Ireland international was able to angle a side-foot volley into the corner of the net.
Rooney was introduced in the last few minutes of the first half, with Simon Church limping off.
It was the striker's first appearance since mid-February and the club's top scorer was inches away from making an immediate impact as a McGinn cross flashed past his outstretched leg.
Within 10 minutes of the re-start, Rooney had found the back of the net.
An Andrew Considine header from a McGinn free-kick was brilliantly tipped onto the crossbar by Ripley but Rooney was first to react and hammered the ball home.
Motherwell had rarely threatened in attack but pulled one back after 64 minutes.
Substitute Chris Cadden fired in a shot that looked destined to be gathered by debutant goalkeeper Adam Collin but Taylor attempted to clear with a diving header and deflected the ball into the net.
Louis Moult then shot wide from a great position and that miss was punished when Hayes restored the hosts' three-goal cushion in style as he sprinted clear of the Motherwell defence on the left and his shot from a tight angle squeezed under Ripley.
Motherwell skipper Lasley was shown a red card for the second time this season for an ugly challenge on McLean and assistant Steve Robinson sent to the stand for his protests as the visitors slipped back to fifth place in the table.
