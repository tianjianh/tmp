[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester Riders and Great Britain forward Drew Sullivan insists next month's BBL Trophy final against Newcastle will not be about revenge.

Riders were beaten by Newcastle in January's BBL Cup final in Birmingham.
And following Leicester's two-legged semi-final win over Sheffield Sharks, the sides will meet in another showpiece final later this month.
"If we do our job and win it's not like the cup gets taken away from them," Sullivan told BBC Radio Leicester.
"They would still have the Cup and we would have the Trophy, so it's not a revenge game.
"It's for us to play our style of basketball and see where the dust settles at the end of the game.
"We have a team that can complete with them and can beat them, but we should only be focused on that game and nothing else."
The BBL Trophy final will take place at Glasgow's Emirates Arena on Saturday, 27 February.
