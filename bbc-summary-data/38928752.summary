Markus Stockl, known as 'Mad Max', beat his own record when he reached a whopping speed of 104 miles per hour - that's much faster than a car is allowed to travel on the roads in the UK.
He set the record in the Atacama desert in Chile. To make him as safe as possible, he had a special suit, an airbag - like the ones ski racers use - and a self-made helmet in two parts.
Take a look at the speedy racer above.
