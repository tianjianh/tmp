The Loons were comfortable 4-1 winners while Clyde won 2-0 at Elgin City.
Berwick Rangers leapfrogged Arbroath into third thanks to a 2-0 victory at Cowdenbeath as Arbroath grabbed a late 1-1 draw against Annan Athletic.
And Montrose beat bottom side Edinburgh City 1-0 to go eighth and leave City on one point - four points adrift.
Andy Munro headed home a David Cox corner to give Forfar the lead before Sean Dickson levelled for the visitors on the stroke of half-time with a superb strike from the edge of the area.
Forfar went in front again when Gavin Swankie teed up Josh Peters, who soon grabbed his second with a shot from distance. Danny Denholm completed the scoring in added time as Forfar maintained their 100% league record.
Sean Higgins' early strike was added to by Peter MacDonald for Clyde, who had Martin McNiff sent off near the end.
Gary Fraser's close-range strike was enough for Montrose to secure victory away to City, despite Terry Masson being dismissed.
Two first-half goals from Steven Thomson moved Berwick up to third in the table.
Ryan McCord's stoppage-time equaliser denied Annan at Gayfield. Earlier, Arbroath goalkeeper Robbie Mutch could only parry Omar Kadar's shot into the path of David McKenna, who put the visitors ahead.
