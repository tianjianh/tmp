Wales play Portugal today and again on Saturday as they prepare for the Fifa Women's World Cup Qualifying campaign, which begins in the autumn.
"It has been a gradual progression, since the turn of the year we've been really happy with our form and individual and collective performances," Ludlow told BBC Wales.
"But there is a lot still to do."

"And hopefully these two games are a stepping-stone to that."
Wales have only lost once in their last eight games.
They have opted to rest midfielder Jess Fishlock for the friendlies against Portugal.
The 100-cap star is replaced by Chloe Chivers.
Fellow midfielder Alice Griffiths is also added, as Amelia Ritchie has been ruled out through injury.
England, Russia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Kazakhstan will be Wales' Group One opponents in World Cup qualifying.
Wales Women squad to face Portugal: Claire Skinner, Laura O'Sullivan, Emma Gibbon, Loren Dykes, Hannah Miles, Sophie Ingle, Gemma Evans, Hayley Ladd, Alice Griffiths, Rhiannon Roberts, Shaunna Jenkins, Chloe Chivers, Angharad James, Charlie Estcourt, Georgia Evans, Bronwen Thomas, Nadia Lawrence, Rachel Rowe, Natasha Harding, Kayleigh Green, Melissa Fletcher, Peyton Vincze, Ffion Morgan.
