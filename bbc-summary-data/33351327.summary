MSPs launch inquiry into 'end of life' care

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs have launched an inquiry into the quality of palliative and end-of-life care in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after problems with palliative care were highlighted during scrutiny of the Assisted Suicide Scotland bill.
The bill, which would have allowed those with terminal illnesses to seek the help of a doctor to end their own life, was rejected by MSPs in May.
Those who opposed the legislation said improvements should be made to palliative care instead.
Holyrood's Health Committee will be seeking views on how to provide high quality care for the terminally ill.
It will also examine whether access to care varies across the country and if those with certain conditions are more likely to get support.
The inquiry was launched at a Marie Curie hospice in Glasgow by committee convener and deputy convener Duncan McNeil MSP and Bob Doris MSP.
Mr McNeil said: "The recent debate on assisted dying highlighted that the provision of palliative care in Scotland is not good enough.
"Our committee heard that access to palliative care is not available on an equal basis.
"When faced with a terminal condition, it's clear that the priority must be to put patient's needs at the heart of their treatment and care.
"We want this inquiry to shine a light on access to palliative care in Scotland and what more can be done to improve care for people at the end of their lives."
Richard Meade, Marie Curie's head of policy and public affairs for Scotland, said: "We know that palliative care provides great care and support for people living with a terminal illness, but unfortunately thousands of people in Scotland are missing out or receiving it much later than they should.
"This inquiry will help us to complete the picture of unmet need and identify clear recommendations to address this."
The Assisted Suicide Scotland Bill was originally brought forward by the late independent MSP Margo MacDonald, who died last year after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, and was taken up by Green MSP Patrick Harvie.
It was rejected by MSPs by 82 votes to 36.
