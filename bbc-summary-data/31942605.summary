On the eve of the final round of games in the Six Nations Championship, with three teams still in with a chance of winning the title, Stephen Watson presents a special hour-long interactive programme from BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast.

As Ireland prepares to take on Scotland, with the Six Nations trophy up for grabs, Stephen will be joined in studio by current Ireland internationals and Ulster players Andrew Trimble and Chris Henry, and former Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan, to look back at the Championship so far and a look ahead to the crunch final round.
During the programme a studio audience made up of keen rugby fans from across Ulster will be giving their views on all the action so far and the audience at home will have a chance to vote for their favourite Irish try from down the years and send in their questions and comments for the panel.
This can be done by sending your comments and questions to Stephen and our panel of rugby greats using #asksix via the programme's special live blog page.
Ireland winger Andrew Trimble said: "I look forward to spending Friday night with Chris Henry and Eddie O'Sullivan, two of the finest rugby minds in the northern hemisphere, hosted by the tie connoisseur himself, Stephen Watson."
Presenter, Stephen Watson, says: "On the eve of an exciting Six Nations finale we have a great opportunity for rugby fans to get involved. Ahead of the last game against Scotland I look forward to putting some of your questions to our distinguished panel.
"It's the first time we have broadcast a sporting interactive programme like this, and I am looking forward to an hour of healthy rugby debate, plus we'll be revealing your favourite Irish Five or Six Nations try of all time."
Six Nations Special will be broadcast on Friday 20 March at 20:00 GMT on BBC Two Northern Ireland.
