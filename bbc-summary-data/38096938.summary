Domestic abuse victim describes 'scary' IS promises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was almost lured to Syria by so-called Islamic State after seeking help over domestic violence has said the experience was "scary".

Extremists targeted the woman, whose identity is being kept secret, after she said she appealed on Facebook for help after being abused by her husband.
She said they offered her protection, gifts and a house if she went to Syria.
But Derby-based project, Tackling Terrorism Through Women, intervened and persuaded her to stay.
The woman, known as Sophia, said: "I was upset and miserable at the time, I was confused and did not know where to go."
After seeing publicity which mentioned the targeting of vulnerable women, Sophia asked about the course.
"The centre talked to me about women's rights in Islam and how this country can offer your rights," she said.
"I learnt about vulnerability and how isolated I was and I realised IS were painting a wrong picture.
"They [the extremists] would say to me come to Syria, come and get married...There won't be any domestic violence.
"It was convincing at the time. They were trying to lure me in to go abroad. They offered me gifts and money to go...I did consider going.
"But then I came to the centre and realised I'd been misled," she said.
Sophia, who is no longer with her husband but still lives in Derby, added: "I had a lucky escape.
"If I hadn't had the advice and direction from (the anti-extremism group), I would have been in a big mess.... It's really scary."
Tazim Fayaz, one of the women heading the scheme, said: "People are more aware now what's happening online, how people are groomed and lured into travelling.
"And women know we'd be able to guide them to the relevant agencies - if needed and if they wanted to go."
The project, which is part of the controversial Prevent programme, claims to have stopped several Derby people from travelling to Syria.
