Wokingham travellers' injunction racist, Gypsy Council says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has been accused of racism for refusing planning permission for a gypsy camp after approving a housing estate in a field next door.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wokingham Borough Council served a High Court injunction on travellers for setting up "unauthorised" pitches and an access road on the private land.
The Gypsy Council said the authority had been quick to get an injunction but refused to provide enough gypsy sites.
The council said it "utterly refutes" the accusation of racism.
Housing applications in the area had been judged acceptable against the borough's planning policies, drawn up following a statutory process including consultation, it said.
Caravans arrived on the Berkshire site on 24 April with the permission of the landowner, who is part of the gypsy community.
But the council has taken legal action because developments that have since taken place do not have planning consent.
It obtained the injunction to prevent further caravans and development on the Berkshire site, after its deadline to exit the site by Monday 27 April was ignored.
"This is not a site allocated for development in the council's local plan," said director of environment, Helen Thwaites.
"It is located within the countryside where the council's policies seek to protect the rural character."
Residents near the site, in Blagrove Lane, have also expressed concern.
Ian Andrews, of Evendons Area Residents' Association, said there was unhappiness at "a total disregard for the planning process in a quiet rural location".
"Hedgerows have been ripped out during nesting season and more than 50 giant lorry loads of rubble have been dumped into what was the flood plain for several hundred homes," he said.
Residents had also expressed fear of a rise in crime, which Thames Valley Police said was "unfounded".
Joseph Jones, of the Gypsy Council, said: "Councils need to fulfil their target for gypsy community site provision.
"Local authorities would much rather refuse planning permission and take legal action than tackle what they perceive to be the thorny issue of gypsy site provision.
"The council can merrily grant planning permission for houses in the next field, but when a gypsy site application comes in from a gypsy family for a small number of pitches then there's hell to pay.
"That's racism."
