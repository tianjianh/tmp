[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A football fan said he felt "scared and intimidated" by a group of youths before two men he was with were beaten, leaving one in a coma, a jury has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nic Cruwys was kicked and punched after a match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Watford on 7 March 2015.
Louis Parsons said the youths, some in hoods and scarves, confronted them as they walked to get a train.
Four 19-year-olds and a 15-year-old deny grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mr Parsons told Wolverhampton Crown Court that some of the group of men he was with fled, but he remained in Little's Lane in the city with two others, including Mr Cruwys.

He said he felt scared and intimidated by their appearance and demeanour and wanted to walk away from them.
As one man came towards him with a bottle, he said he turned and ran.
As he looked back, he told the court he saw both men being attacked and then Mr Cruwys lying on the floor with blood coming out of his nose and members of the public coming to his aid.
Mr Cruwys suffered serious brain injuries and was in a coma for three months after the "unprovoked attack".
The court heard earlier this week that Watford fan Mr Cruwys had travelled with friends by train to watch the match and visited several pubs before the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw.
The attack happened as they made their way back to the city's train station and had planned to visit a pub for a drink.
The defendants are Daniel Lloyd, of Longfellow Road, Dudley; Joseph Lister, of Palmer Close, Wednesfield; Robert Beech, of Springfield Road, Wednesfield; and Ryan Meer, of Watling Street, Gailey, Staffordshire, all aged 19. A 15-year-old boy cannot be named for legal reasons.
The trial continues.
