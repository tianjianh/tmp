Jenny Pyper has said the cross-border link must be in place by 2019 "to keep the lights on and prices low".
The plan is to connect the grids using 138km of overhead lines between County Meath and a new substation near Moy in County Tyrone.
Ms Pyper said an alternative "plan b' of underground cables was "a myth."
Speaking at a conference in Belfast, she said that option would take too long and be "five times more expensive."
Environmental and health campaigners had wanted the cables placed underground.
The project, which will take three years to complete, was meant to have been ready by 2017.
In the Republic of Ireland, the state-owned commercial energy company, EirGrid, has submitted plans for the southern half of the project.
In Northern Ireland, the lead is being taken by System Operator for Northern Ireland (SONI).
A separate planning application is before the Planning Appeals Commission, with a hearing likely to take place early next year.
