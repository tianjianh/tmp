Portsoy bans 'bad luck' bananas ahead of boat festival

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bananas have been banned from an Aberdeenshire village ahead of a boat festival - as they are believed to bring bad luck.

The banana ban has been introduced in Portsoy as it prepares for the Scottish Traditional Boat Festival.
Seafarers regard bananas as bad luck on board boats.
Festival organisers are hoping to ward off any potential misfortune from the event which takes place on 4 and 5 July.
Banana ban signs have been posted, a banana amnesty has been introduced and local businesses have come out in support of the action, with Portsoy Ice Cream removing banana-flavoured items from its range until after the event.
Chairman Roger Goodyear said: "Bananas may be a delicious fruit but they are considered bad luck on boats.
"We want to do everything possible to make sure our 2015 festival is a success and we don't want to take any chances.
"Our ban on bananas is a tongue-in-cheek nod to our seafaring heritage and is a reminder that the ocean can be a mystical, but dangerous, place and, as such, there are many traditional superstitions among fisher people."
Seven years ago, a whistling ban was imposed on the village before the festival.
This was due to the maritime superstition that whistling attracts bad weather.
The festival had a day of glorious sunshine, although this was followed by torrential rain on the second day.
There are several theories about why people believe bananas are bad luck for a boat.
One is that in the early days of the banana trade, crews would overload the banana boats when leaving the tropics, resulting in the boats capsizing in bad weather.
Another is that wooden sailing boats involved in the Caribbean trade of the 1700s had to move so quickly to deliver bananas before they spoiled that the crew had a hard job catching fish.
It is suggested that bananas harboured dangerous spiders whose bite could be painful or even fatal. Or could it be that discarded banana skins left on deck could cause crew members to slip and fall?
At the event traditional wooden boats will converge on the 17th Century harbour while visitors will have the opportunity to build and restore traditional vessels, learn how to sail a coracle and watch the skiffs go head to head for the open seas regatta.
The festival attracts 16,000 visitors, generating more than Â£1m for the local economy.
Mr Goodyear added: "As one of Scotland's leading events, The Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Traditional Boat Festival is renowned for its creative offerings and 2015 is no different.
"As the festival attracts more historic vessels, craft exhibitors, artists, performers and musicians than ever before, visitors will be involved, inspired and engaged throughout.
"From toe-tapping folk music and unique handmade products, to delicious fresh smoked kippers and seasonal treats, there will be something for the whole family to enjoy."
