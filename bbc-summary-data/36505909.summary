[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portugal 0-0 Austria

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cristiano Ronaldo missed a second-half penalty on the night he became his country's record appearance holder as a hugely frustrating match for Portugal and their captain in Paris ended goalless to leave Group F wide open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronaldo struck the base of the post with his spot kick after Austria defender Martin Hinteregger had wrestled him to the ground and later headed home only to be denied by the offside flag.
But huge credit for Austria's point must go to keeper Robert Almer, who made a string of sensational saves.
He stopped a crisp low strike and a header from Ronaldo as well as blocking from Nani, who struck the post with a first-half header as Portugal looked to pick up their first win of the competition.
Portugal dominated large swathes of the first competitive meeting between the sides since 1995 but were almost caught out several times, in particular when Stefan Ilsanker forced a good save with a crisp low strike shortly after the restart.
The result means that Hungary top Group F with four points, Portugal and Iceland both have two and Austria one - a situation which leaves all four in with a shout of reaching the last 16.
It might have been a record-breaking night for Ronaldo, who was making his 128th appearance for Portugal, but he can't have endured few more frustrating ones since making his debut against Kazakhstan in 2003.
With Luis Figo, the man whose record he eclipsed, watching in the stands the scene was set for the 31-year-old to steal the headlines with his penalty but after sending Almer the wrong way he drilled his effort into the base of the post.
Ronaldo had become something of a pantomime villain after criticising Iceland's "small mentality" following their 1-1 draw in their opening match.
And his Euro 2016 didn't improve much during an opening half at Parc des Princes when he was a largely peripheral figure - save for one poor miss after a neat one-two involving Raphael Guerreiro had carved open the Austrian right side.
Seemingly unwilling to run at opponents and settling instead on probing along the Austrian defensive line, the Real Madrid forward seemed to take an age to make his way off the field at half-time, a dejected and troubled figure.
However, he nonetheless rebounded after the break, troubling Almer and forcing the game's best chance after Hinteregger fouled him.
But his failure to score means that his wait to become the first man to score in four European Championship finals goes on.
Way back in 2000 Austrian FA technical director Willi Ruttensteiner began reshaping Austrian football, introducing what was known as Project 12 with the aim of identifying and nurturing the best talent in the country.
Four from this venture started on Saturday, while another, defender Aleksandar Dragovic, was suspended. Marcel Sabitzer, one of the graduates, almost created a goal in the opening two minutes with a superb cross from the right but Martin Harnik could not convert his superb headed chance, scuffing the ball wide.
Austria were also denied by a superb defensive header at the end of the first half by Vieirinha after David Alaba, another of the scheme, whipped in a free-kick from a tight angle.
And Ilsanker also threatened at the very start of the second half and although Marcel Koller's team were largely second best on the night they are nonetheless still in contention for a place in the last 16.
For a team that climbed from 105th to a record high of 10th in the world rankings during their journey to qualifying for the finals in Paris, there is still hope.
However, they will be looking for more from key player Alaba, who played in an advanced role on Saturday but who was surprisingly withdrawn with more than 25 minutes remaining.
Portugal boss Fernando Santos: "Fair or unfair is a moot point, the only difference in the two matches we've played is that against Iceland we scored one and conceded one, here we didn't score but we didn't concede either.
"We had plenty of chances, but we didn't score. Now we have to think about the next match.
"Iceland wasn't great, if we had won it that would have been a major step forward. Today we had another very positive match but what we need now is to play the next one and to win it; that will make the team grow.
"Hungary will be happy to draw against us, they are primed to go through. They will be highly motivated but we will have to break that wall down."
Austria coach Marcel Koller: "It was important not to lose this game. Portugal had more chances but we have won a point with a good defensive effort.
"Normally that's not our type of game but you have to be flexible in a tournament and adapt to the teams you are playing.
"We are still in the race. We're in very different place mentally now compared to the last game; now the players are happy and that makes it easier for us. We have a final in the last game, and I hope we can win it."
Group F concludes on Wednesday, with both games kicking off at 17:00 BST. Portugal finish their group campaign with a match against Hungary in Lyon. Austria face Iceland at the Stade de France in Paris, which is obviously pretty handy for their fans.
