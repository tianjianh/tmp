Paraguay is ending the diplomatic immunity of the headquarters for South America's Conmebol football association, the latest fallout from the corruption scandal engulfing Fifa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The senate voted to strip the offices in the capital Asuncion of the status, which prevents it being raided.
It is expected to be signed into law by President Horacio Cartes.
Top Conmebol officials are among those indicted in a US investigation into football's world governing body Fifa.
Two former Conmebol presidents, Eugenio Figueredo and Nicolas Leoz, have both been charged with corruption.
In other developments:
The Conmebol headquarters in Asuncion have enjoyed the legal status similar to that of foreign embassies since 1997.
"My greatest fear is that all the important documents may have disappeared by now," Hugo Rubin, the Congressman who drafted the new legislation told the BBC.
Mr Leoz had lobbied for diplomatic immunity, AP reports, boasting that only the Vatican enjoyed the same "immunity and total privileges''.
The Paraguayan national is now under house arrest, awaiting a decision on his extradition to the US.
