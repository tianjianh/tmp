The Duke of Cambridge has launched a new award programme in his name to help children gain confidence, during a visit to a Monmouthshire school.

Prince William visited Llanfoist Fawr Primary School in Abergavenny on St David's Day and joined pupils in making a tower out of marshmallows and straws.
About 80 children took part in team building exercises during the visit.
Headteacher Jon Murphy said the pupils could "barely contain their excitement" at meeting the prince.
Aimed at six to 14-year-olds, the SkillForce Prince William Award draws on the skills of ex-service personnel and aims to help schoolchildren build character, confidence and resilience.
The launch follows a year-long pilot at 37 schools across England, Scotland and Wales.
Abigail Squirrell, 10, from Llanfoist Fawr, said the challenges helped her feel more confident.
Pupils from Caldicot School, Monmouthshire and Bishopstone Primary School in Swindon, Wiltshire also joined the prince in a series of team building exercises.
This included making a free-standing tower from marshmallows and straws, pretending a ball is a 'radioactive cell' and carrying it to safety and putting up a tent wearing blindfolds.
