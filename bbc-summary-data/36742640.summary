The blast hit a train at Taipei's Songshan station before midnight leaving some passengers badly burned.
Police told local media they found a broken tube with explosive material inside that looked like a firecracker.
Premier Lin Chuan told media it appeared "malicious" but police have not ruled out an accident.
Police bomb squad chief Lee Tzu-wen told local media that investigators found "a 15cm-long, broken metal tube stuffed with explosive material inside a black backpack" that they believe could have caused the blast.
"There was a blast and the carriage went dark. People were panicking and screaming," one passenger is quoted as telling a local news channel.
Other eyewitnesses cited in local media reported seeing a man carry a rectangular object onto the train carriage shortly before the explosion.
