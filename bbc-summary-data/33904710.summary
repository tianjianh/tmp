[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a Cheshire wood flour mill destroyed in a fatal explosion have denied claims staff facing redundancy are not being paid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The GMB union wrote to Wood Treatment Ltd claiming the firm was refusing to pay 45 workers during a 30-day consultation period starting 7 August.
Four people are believed to have died in the fire on 17 July which destroyed the mill in Bosley, near Macclesfield.
Wood Treatment Ltd described the claims as "misinformation".
GMB said mill staff who had attended a meeting with the owners on Friday had left "with the understanding that they would not be paid their normal wages throughout the consultation".
In a statement, the owners said: "We are fully aware of our obligations to pay staff and have at no point communicated that they will not be paid.
"It has always been our intention to pay staff and we have made regular payments since the fire.
"We will continue to focus on supporting our staff through the consultation period and we ask that other parties refrain from spreading misinformation about non-payment of wages."
Ray Carrick, regional officer for the union, said: "GMB welcome this statement and we believe that this meets the demands we had made in our formal grievance which was submitted to the company on Monday, that staff must be paid their normal wages throughout the consultation period.
"We note with regret, however, that it has taken the company some six days to make their statement."
The union said the matter had now been "resolved with a satisfactory outcome".
The four people missing after the blast were Derek Moore, 62, from Stoke-on-Trent, William Barks, 51, from Leek, Jason Shingler, 38, from North Rode, and Dorothy Bailey, 62.
Will Barks, Derek Moore and Dorothy Bailey have been identified as victims. Other remains have been found. Jason Shingler is still missing.
Temperatures reached 1,000C in the blast and it was described by rescuers as the "worst incident of its kind" in a decade.
The Bosley Disaster Appeal Fund has raised more than Â£72,000 for the families of the victims and workers left without jobs.
WTL previously said it "could not predict" when the factory would be operational again.
An investigation continues into the cause of the explosion.
