Denmark coach Morten Olsen has stepped down after 15 years in charge following his side's Euro 2016 play-off exit against Sweden.

Olsen, 66, announced in March he would leave when his contract expired at the end of the campaign.
Following the 4-3 aggregate loss, he confirmed he would leave immediately.
"I have told the players that the Danish FA and I have agreed I stop," said Olsen. "In recent months, we have been too unstable in our performances."
Olsen, who won 102 caps for Denmark as a player between 1970 and 1989, took charge after Euro 2000.
He has taken the Danes to four major finals, qualifying for the 2002 and 2010 World Cups, and the European Championships in 2004 and 2012.
But they failed to reach next summer's finals in France, losing in the play-off after finishing third in their qualifying group behind Portugal and Albania.
"It hurts to end this way after more than 35 years as a player and coach but I feel most sorry for the Danes, for the fans, " Olsen added. "I feel empty with regards to the match."
The Danish Football Association (DBU) said it hoped to appoint a new coach before the end of the year.
"I have great respect for Morten and his results. It is important for both Morten and I that the end of his phenomenal career in Danish football is done in a dignified and orderly manner," added DBU president Jesper Moller.
