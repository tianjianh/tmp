The US women's ice hockey team have called off a boycott of their home world championships - just two days before the event is due to start.

The team had been in a long-running dispute with governing body USA Hockey over equal pay and support.
The two sides have reached an agreement but are keeping the terms private.
"We stood up for what we thought was right and USA Hockey's leadership listened," said women's team captain Meghan Duggan.
As well as a pay deal, the new agreement will see more marketing, promotion and fundraising for the women's team and extra support at grassroots level, USA Hockey said.
Many players had complained during the 14-month dispute that they were paid only $1,000 (Â£800) a month during a six-month Olympic period and nothing for the remaining three-and-a half years.
They also cited the extra support structure in place in the men's game.
The US women - who are world champions - will now look to defend their title on home ice, starting with a game against Canada on Friday, 31 March.
