ScotRail said a revised timetable would come into place on 22 October, lasting until December.
Some services are being cancelled and many journey times will be longer during the works.
The engineering is being carried out to increase "overall reliability" and to pave the way for new electric trains, ScotRail said.
An interactive timeline has been created by the rail operator to help customers plan their journeys. Some services will be replaced by buses and queuing systems will be in place at key stations.
Special arrangements will be made to help people travelling from the Aberdeen area to the Betfred Cup semi final at Hampden and those going to the autumn rugby internationals at Murrayfield.
Jacqueline Taggart, ScotRail Alliance customer experience director, said: "We are going through a massive period of change on Scotland's railway. The work that we are carrying out over the next few months will bring about a revolution in rail - with more and better trains, more services and more seats than ever before.
"However, while we transform the railway, there is inevitably going to be some impact on people's services.
"We are doing everything we can to minimise this, and to keep people moving."
Ms Taggart added: "No-one likes having their journey changed. However, this short term disruption will lead to a more reliable, better rail network that will rank amongst the very best."
