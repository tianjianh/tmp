World War Two veterans invited to a special ceremony in Cardiff by the Russian government had to wait two hours after the wrong medals were sent.

The 67 navy veterans who served with the Arctic convoys were being given Ushakov medals for their role supplying the Eastern front.
But the ceremony was delayed when officials realised the personalised medals were still in London.
Each Ushakov medal is individually numbered with a recipient's name on it.
The medals intended for Wednesday's ceremony at City Hall had the names of other veterans inscribed on them for a forthcoming ceremony with other UK veterans, but not the event in Cardiff.
Sergey Nalobin from the Russian Embassy in London, who was supposed to present the veterans with their medals, told those attending that the correct medals were on their way to Cardiff in a diplomatic car.
Veterans were urged to wait to collect their medals, although those who could not stay have been promised that they will receive them in the near future.
On Tuesday, 11 veterans received their medals at a ceremony at Bodelwyddan Castle, Denbighshire.
