For 15 years the Ceredigion community campaigned to save the site which has been restored into a heritage attraction and events venue, with holiday accommodation and a restaurant.
Restoration work included roof repairs, landscaping and reconstruction of the castle's walls.
The site will open to the general public on Wednesday.
The Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust, made up of 250 local people, secured investment for the restoration, including more than £6m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £4.3m from the European Regional Development Fund.
Hundreds of local volunteers took part in fundraising, raising more than £200,000 to save the 900-year-old site.
A remake of Wales' original Eisteddfod chair has been returned to the castle following the restoration as it believed to have been home to the first ever recorded Eisteddfod in 1176.
The site also has a dedicated Eisteddfod exhibition along with exhibitions telling the story of the castle and the people who lived there.
Cardigan Castle spokeswoman Sue Lewis said: "The castle's commercial streams are absolutely vital in generating income for the upkeep of the site.
"Our target is to attract more than 30,000 visitors to the castle in its first year of trading."
But a row has broken out over plans to invite an English folk group to headline the opening concert in July.
