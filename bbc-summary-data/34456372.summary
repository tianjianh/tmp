At the moment, only five out of 20 clubs have the amount of wheelchair spaces in their stadiums that they're supposed to.
This makes it tricky for some disabled supporters to buy tickets or sit with their family and friends.
The government says Premier League clubs should not only have enough seats for disabled fans, but those seats should be in both home and away sections.
The Premier League say they want to make changes and have agreed to improve access for disabled supporters by August 2017.
