Centre-back Giorgio Chiellini and midfielder Claudio Marchisio are both doubtful for the Italian champions.
Porto are looking to become the first team to progress in a Champions League tie after a 2-0 first-leg home defeat.
Left-back Alex Telles is suspended after being sent off in Portugal.
Juventus are heavy favourites to reach only their second quarter-final in four years after goals from Marko Pjaca and Dani Alves in Porto.
The Serie A leaders are on course to win a sixth successive Scudetto but have struggled to replicate that domination on the European stage.
The 1996 winners last reached the last eight in 2015 on their way to a 3-1 defeat by Barcelona in the final.
"I'm aware of the importance the Champions League has for the Bianconeri family and for the history of the club," Brazil right-back Alves said.
"I too, like all Juventus fans, want to dream and I'm convinced that if we continue down our path calmly, with personality, and without fear of making a mistake then we can get right to the end."
Porto face a Juve side that has not lost at home since August 2015, a run spanning 46 matches.
The Portuguese leaders, who have won their past nine league matches, have won only one of their previous nine Champions League second-leg matches away from home.
"We know it's going to be difficult for us after the result in the first leg. But a lot of things happen in football - we've seen it all," said Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who appeared to be referring to Barcelona's comeback against Paris St-Germain last week.
