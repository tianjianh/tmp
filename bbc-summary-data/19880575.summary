Should there be a limit on how much TV you can watch?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
How much time do you spend watching TV or playing on the computer?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Well a new study reckons that too many kids are having too much screen time.
The report found that by the time a child is seven they could have spent around a year of their life looking at TV and computer screens.
Some experts think that if you're between 7 and 12-years-old you should limit yourself to an hour a day to help your brain develop better.
We asked if you thought there should be a limit on how much screen time you have and if children spend too much time watching TV and playing on computers?
Here are a selection of the comments you sent in...

"I don't think it's fair that there is a limit on how much TV we watch or how long we play on a computer for. If we play educational games then you won't need a limit. Also, some adults who are suggesting these limits probably watched loads of TV as kids."
Hannah, Somerset, England
