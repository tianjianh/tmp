The Leicester striker netted in the first half of his side's 1-1 draw against Manchester United.
Dutchman Van Nistelrooy achieved his feat for Manchester United across two seasons in 2003.
Vardy's run has included 13 goals, making him the league's top scorer with 14 goals in total so far this season.

Vardy, who four years ago was playing for Fleetwood in the Conference in front of 768 people, said he was "taking each match as it comes".
He added: "The record was not in my mind, it would have affected my performance and the team's, and that's the last thing I wanted to do.
"I can think about it when I am home but as soon as I cross the white line all I should be concentrating on is my football.
"That's what I have been doing and exactly what I will continue to do."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri said Vardy's record was "an incredible achievement".
"We had two objectives - to win the match and try to help Vardy break the record," he said.
"Jamie made the record, it is fantastic for us. Five years ago he played in non-league, it is difficult to grow up so quickly and this fantastic man is not only our goalscorer but he presses, he works hard, he is important."
Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal also praised Vardy's "amazing and fantastic" feat, saying: "The goal he scored is also amazing because it is not so easy.
"I can say our organisation is bad but he is provoking that also. It is a fantastic record to have, 11 matches in a row. Not many players will do that."
So how did Vardy do it? Four goals after the 80th minute, three from the penalty spot and some while bones were broken, BBC Sport takes a look at how Vardy's magnificent streak took place.
