HSBC considers moving HQ out of UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
HSBC has said it is considering moving its headquarters out of London.

The bank said the review followed "regulatory and structural reforms" since the financial crisis.
HSBC's board has asked its management to "look at where the best place is for HSBC to be headquartered in this new environment," the bank said.
"The question is a complex one and it is too soon to say how long this will take or what the conclusion will be; but the work is under way."
Shares in the company jumped 3% higher on the news.
Regulatory pressure, political attacks following revelations of errant behaviour and hefty new taxes have sparked the decision.
HSBC has also said that uncertainty over Britain's future in the European Union is weighing on its future as well as new rules which oblige banks to split their retail and investment banking activities - the ring-fence.
The pressure to launch this review has come from the HSBC board which has been pushed by investors worried about sub-par performance. Profits are down at the bank and the share price is under-performing.
If HSBC were to move - and that is a very big, costly, politically difficult if - it would be a significant moment for the City and Britain's place as the home of major global banks.

The review follows plans announced in the Budget to increase the bank levy from 0.156% to 0.21%.
The levy particularly affects banks with large balance sheets, such as HSBC.  Last year it paid Â£750m of the Â£1.9bn raised by the government through the tax.
HSBC also said that questions over the UK's continuing membership of the European Union were a source of "economic uncertainty".
The bank may also decide to sell its retail bank, originally called Midland Bank, said BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed. HSBC, along with the UK's other banks, will be required to separate its British retail business from the rest of the group by 2019.
The bank has had its headquarters in the UK since 1992 but makes most of its money overseas, with Asia accounting for about 80% of its profit.
HSBC has not yet said where it may consider moving its headquarters to, although many expect Hong Kong to top the list.
"The only even faintly credible option is Hong Kong," said Alex Potter, banking analyst at Mirabaud Securities.
However, a move to Hong Kong may not necessarily help the bank cut costs.
"HSBC will pay several hundred million dollars more in tax in 2015 [if it stays in the UK], but it would cost several hundred millions of dollars to move the bank to another country," says Mr Potter.
And "the Chinese government may prove to be less predictable than the UK's," he added.
HSBC's profit dropped 17% in 2014. HSBC blamed its "challenging year" on the $2.4bn it was forced to pay in fines and settlements in relation to foreign exchange manipulation and mis-selling of payment protection insurance.
The scandal-hit bank has also faced allegations that it helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva.
Politicians were quick to react to the news.
When asked about his view on HSBC's potential move on 5Live, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: "They can make their own mind upâ€¦ but I hope they will stay in the UK."
Chancellor George Osborne echoed that sentiment but added that it also was a warning about the dangers of anti-business policies.
Labour's Chuka Umunna said that HSBC's comments on Europe served to illustrate that it was "irresponsible...to play fast and loose with the UK's membership of the EU".
Meanwhile UKIP leader Nigel Farage also said he was worried by the news.
"There is genuinely a feeling (among workers) in the financial services industry that everybody hates them. And that suddenly London isn't a great place to be."
