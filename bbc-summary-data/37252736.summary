Gareth Bale: Real Madrid star 'not fussed' by losing most expensive player tag

Gareth Bale says he is not bothered by losing the tag of the world's most expensive player to Paul Pogba.

Bale's three-year reign ended when Pogba joined Manchester United from Juventus for £89m last month.
That fee eclipsed the £85.3m Real Madrid paid Tottenham to sign Wales forward Bale in the summer of 2013.
"I'm not fussed and I couldn't care less," said Bale, who is with the Wales squad preparing for Monday's World Cup qualifier at home to Moldova.
While Wales aim to reach a first World Cup since 1958, Bale is also hoping to become only the sixth player to win the European Cup or Champions League in their home city.
The 2017 final is being held at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, with Real Madrid looking to successfully defend the trophy they won for a record 11th time in May.
"It would be amazing to get there," said Bale, part of the Real side which beat Sevilla at the Cardiff City Stadium to win the 2014 Super Cup.
"I haven't been asked [about Cardiff] yet but the players have had experience of Wales and the weather from the Super Cup.
"I am sure if we get closer they will be asking."
Bale has won the Champions League twice in his three seasons at the Bernabeu.
Real have been drawn in the same Champions League group as Borussia Dortmund, Sporting Lisbon and Legia Warsaw.
And Bale is expecting a strong British challenge with Premier League champions Leicester joined by Arsenal, Manchester City and his old club Tottenham.
"It is great to see Tottenham back and doing well," he said. "I wish them well in the Champions League... until they play us.
"Man City came close last season, making the semi-final against us, and I see no reason why Leicester can't do well.
"I suppose the excitement and enthusiasm they will have for this tournament will make them even more difficult as opponents.
"[The] Champions League means more games, so you don't know how it will pan out for them. But I am sure they will give a good account of themselves."
