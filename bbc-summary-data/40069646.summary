The 2010 US Open winner dropped shots at three consecutive holes on his front nine and ended the day seven shots behind leader Webb Simpson of the USA.
McDowell, 37, had been two off the lead overnight after rounds of 66 and 70.
England's Paul Casey, without a win on the PGA Tour since 2009, is two shots behind Webb after a 68.
