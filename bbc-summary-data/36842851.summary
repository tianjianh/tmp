Falls Park rape court: Man charged with assaulting teenage boy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Belfast man has appeared in court charged with raping a 16-year-old boy in the west of the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager was attacked as he walked home in the early hours of Saturday, in the Falls Park area.
Gerard Scannell, 39, of Ballymurphy Road was charged with three counts of rape and one of sexual assault.
There was no application for bail, but Mr Scannell's barrister said there were consistent denials of the allegations during police interviews.
The prosecution said any future bail application would be objected to strongly. The accused was remanded in custody.
