[SN]TITLE[SN]
Major Swansea city road to have 30 mph limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major road in Swansea will have its speed limit set to 30mph for its entire length following more than 100 accidents over three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carmarthen Road is the main route into the city centre from junction 47 of the M4 and some parts of it has a 40mph limit.
But Swansea council has acted in a bid to cut the number of accidents and fatalities.
As well as reducing the speed, cameras will also be installed at junctions.
