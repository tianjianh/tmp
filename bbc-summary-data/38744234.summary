RNLI submits plans for new Burry Port lifesaving centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been submitted for a new lifesaving centre in Carmarthenshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RNLI wants to replace Burry Port's aging boathouse and bring both lifeboats under one roof.
The centre will include modern training and changing facilities for the volunteer crew, which will help speed up launches, a workshop and a public viewing area.
It would be sited between the existing lifeboat station and the western slipway, adjacent to the cycle track.
Alun Wells, Burry Port RNLI Lifeboat press officer, said the plans were a "major step forward in the regeneration of Burry Port Harbour" and will ensure "an RNLI presence and legacy for the local community for many years to come".
