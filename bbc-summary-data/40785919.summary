[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 2-1 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic booked their place in the second round of the EFL Cup - but Blackpool will wonder how they slipped to defeat at the DW Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite dominating the first half, the Seasiders somehow found themselves trailing 2-0 at the break.
Josh Laurent marked his first Wigan start with the opening goal on 17 minutes. and Jordan Flores - who spent the second half of last term on loan at Bloomfield Road - doubled the advantage on the stroke of half-time.
Armand Gnanduillet pulled one back with a header from a corner just before the hour mark.
But substitute Jamille Matt squandered three gilt-edged opportunities inside the final quarter to take the game to extra-time.
After firing wide from a good position, the lively forward then saw a flick header glance the bar on the way over.
But arguably the best chance came deep in stoppage time, when Matt ignored the supporting Nathan Delfouneso to go it alone, only to drag his shot wide of Owen Evans' far post.
