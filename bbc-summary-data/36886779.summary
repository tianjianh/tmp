An exhibition of Scottish architecture held as part of a major festival in Italy is to be staged for the first time in Scotland.

Prospect North, one of three architecture exhibitions being staged in Oban, was first shown at the Venice Architecture Biennale.
It explores the stories of 15 Scots communities who have used design and architecture to make a difference.
It forms part of the Oban Festival of Architecture and opens on 30 July.
The festival has been organised by the Oban Communities Trust.
In Venice, Prospect North featured a virtual reality experience that involved viewing Scottish locations while using animal-shaped headwear is coming to Scotland.
The VR included a 3D, 360 degree visual of Boreraig, a village on Skye ruined in the Highland Clearances.
It is hoped that some of the experience might be available during Prospect North at the Rockfield Centre, but the heads suffered wear and tear after being well used in Venice.
The headwear used were in the shape of a polar bear and moose - animals representing the Arctic and Nordic regions - and the mythical unicorn, Scotland's 'national animal'.
Inside each head was Google Cardboard, a foldable unit made of cardboard to which mobile phones can fitted to give users 3D virtual reality experiences.
