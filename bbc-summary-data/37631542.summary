1881 J&D McGeorge Ltd has bought the Langlands Mill site to start production of the McGeorge of Scotland knitwear.
The firm will bring the property back to its original use as a textile mill creating 20 posts by spring next year.
A spokesman for the firm said it was delighted to revive the brand in Scotland aimed at "top-end couture houses around the world."
The J&D McGeorge brand has its history in Dumfries with a mill on the town's St Michael Street which operated until the early 1990s.
Scottish Development International (SDI) managing director Paul Lewis said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland's textile sector and reinforces our world-wide reputation as a textile producer with a proud heritage and an enduring place on the world's fashion stage."
Councillor Stuart Bell, of Scottish Borders Council, added: "Knitwear manufacturing still plays a key role in our local economy and is an important part of our approach to inclusive growth.
"It is great news for Hawick that this textiles inward investment is being made just now and I hope that the excellent work that SDI do in encouraging companies to invest in Scotland can stimulate further capital investment and jobs in a sector which is such an important part of our heritage.
"This business investment powerfully demonstrates the provenance, skills and high quality product that is available in Hawick, and which makes it an excellent inward investment location."
