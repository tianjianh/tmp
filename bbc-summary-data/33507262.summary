A total of 550 incidents of theft from the person were reported on the route in 2014.
Oxford Circus was the worst individual station on the entire network, with 144 reported incidents.
However, the total number of thefts was down 30% compared with 2013.
The figures were released by the British Transport Police (BTP).
Detective Inspector Paula Jones said: "While crime on the underground network is down for the ninth successive year, theft of passenger property is an issue - particularly as a lot of passengers now carry high-tech devices."
She added that the BTP deploys specialist covert pickpocket officers in a bid to deter thieves who target "unsuspecting commuters and tourists".
The figures also showed:
Steve Burton, TfL's director of enforcement, said: "The Central line is the second busiest Tube line on our network as it passes through key night time spots and is heavily used by commuters and tourists.
"Our busiest lines and stations will often have higher levels of pickpockets than quieter areas and we and our policing partners focus our efforts in these areas for this very reason."
