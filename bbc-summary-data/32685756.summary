Georgina Campbell was the surprise winner of best actress - beating the likes of Sarah Lancashire and Sheridan Smith. The young actress won for her portrayal of a domestic violence victim in BBC Three's Murdered by My Boyfriend.
"This is insane," she said. "The women who are in this category are absolutely brilliant. If I have the career they have in a few years time I will count myself very, very, lucky."
Jason Watkins won best leading actor for his portrayal of Christopher Jeffries, whose life was turned upside down by a fortnight of press intrusion in 2010, when he was arrested and released without charge over the murder of Bristol architect Joanna Yeates.
Poldark stars Heida Reed and Eleanor Tomlinson made an impact on the red carpet in their contrasting gowns.
Double winners Ant and Dec commiserate with Mary Berry, whose Great British Bake Off failed to win any prizes this year.
Bafta host Graham Norton won best comedy entertainment programme for his BBC One chat show, exclaiming "yay, me!"
Jessica Hynes scooped best comedy performance (female) for her role as Siobhan Sharpe, a babbling BBC brand consultant in W1A.
Gemma Jones won best supporting actress for her portrayal of Mary Baldwin in Marvellous - a biopic about Neil Baldwin, who refused to accept the limitations of his learning disability.
Speaking backstage the actress, who played Bridget Jones's mother in the two hit films, said they had better "hurry up" filming the third book or she would be "on a zimmer frame".
Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams was on hand to present the award for best scripted comedy to BBC Four's Detectorists.
But her own show lost out on a fiercely-contested Audience Award to hit drama Sherlock.
Hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkelman, along with 2014 contestant Judy Murray were on hand to support Strictly Come Dancing. Ultimately, though, the show went home empty handed.
Tamsin Greig, Russell Tovey and Emma Willis were among the attendees.
James Corden, whose comedy series The Wrong Mans was up for an award, jetted in from the US, where he recently started presenting his own chat show.
"I landed at 14:00 BST and I leave at 09:00 tomorrow morning," he said. "I'm on the plane longer than I'm here!"
Homeland star David Harewood was nominated for best sitcom along with the rest of the cast of mistaken-identity thriller The Wrong Mans.
