A council has praised the response of a volunteer community group that helped to "minimise the impact" of flooding in a Borders town following summer storms.

Heavy rainfall moved across the Borders on Wednesday with Eyemouth particularly badly affected.
The local resilient communities group notified residents and helped put out sandbags and put up floodgates.
Scottish Borders Council said its efforts had "undoubtedly" helped reduce the impact of the incident.
Emergency Planning Officer Jim Fraser said: "The response in Eyemouth to the potential for flooding, and after the extremely heavy rainfall, has once again highlighted the value of having locally trained and equipped volunteers in these situations.
"There is no doubt that their efforts, and those of local residents and business owners, helped to minimise the impact of this event."
Scottish Water is continuing to work with the council on a solution to sewerage issues in the town.
Regional community team manager Bill Elliot said the rainfall had been "exceptional" and had led to foul water flooding affecting a small number of streets and some properties.
"We are progressing with a permanent solution to the underlying issue in Church Street and are continuing to liaise closely with Scottish Borders Council and shortly SEPA to move towards implementing the required engineering solution," he said.
