Det Supt Jon Betts, of Cheshire Police, said Jade Lynch's "very active" social media behaviour had changed significantly since she went missing.
Jade, who lives in St Helens, Merseyside, told family members she was going to meet someone in the town on 26 March but has not been seen since.
Her sister Stephanie said: "It is not like her not to be in contact."

The teenager was last seen in the Duke Street area of St Helens by her two younger brothers.
Her sister Stephanie Lynch described Jade as a "really loving girl" who is "always talking to friends".
She added: "She's a typical teenager, she's always in contact with someone online or on her phone - always talking to someone - that's why we are so worried.
"We just want to know she is ok because as she's got older we have got so much closer."
Det Supt Betts said Jade was "vulnerable".
"If something has happened whilst you've been missing there is nothing that we can't deal with. All we are interested in, is bringing you home safe and well," he added.
It is understood the 14-year-old has links to the Merseyside and Manchester areas but may also have connections in Cumbria and Bristol. She is originally from Warrington.
She was last seen wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and white Nike trainers and is described as white, about 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, of medium build, with long straight black hair.
Anyone with any information about Jade or her whereabouts is asked to contact Cheshire Police.
