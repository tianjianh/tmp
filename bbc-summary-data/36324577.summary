#Bringbackourgirls became one of the biggest social media campaigns ever.
It got the support of celebrities from the US First Lady, Michelle Obama, to Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai and US chat show host Ellen DeGeneres.
Now that the girl, identified as Amina Ali Nkeki, has been found, people have taken to Twitter again.
Many people welcomed the news, and hoped that the other girls abducted by Boko Haram militants would be found soon.
