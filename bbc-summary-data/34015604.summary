"Today I can confirm that Avid Life Media is offering a $500,000 (Â£241,065) reward to anyone providing information that leads to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person or persons responsible for the leak of the Ashley Madison database," said acting staff superintendent Bryce Evans.
Mr Evans appealed to the hacking community to "do the right thing", adding that those responsible for leaking the names of Ashley Madison users had "crossed a line".
"This hack is one of the largest data breaches in the world and is very unique on its own in that it exposed tens of millions of people's personal information," he said.
The police also revealed that two Ashley Madison clients had committed suicide after the publication of information from the website, which matched married people seeking to have affairs.
