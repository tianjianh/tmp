The figure, from a survey of its members, represents a rise of about three million journeys on the Friday before Christmas last year.
Hundreds of rail services are also set to be disrupted by engineering work between Christmas and New Year; Thousands of people will also take to the sky on flights to visit family and friends.
However you choose to travel, you might encounter traffic or delays. So which is the best way to get to family and friends and when are the worst times to make the journey?
Chris Rea might have sung fondly of driving home for Christmas but for most families it is a necessary evil.
Highways England is promising to lift almost 400 miles of roadworks by 06:00 GMT on 23 December, which it says will leave 98% of the motorway and major road network clear. However 43 sets of roadworks will remain in place for safety reasons.
According to the AA, which surveyed its members, about 6.7 million journeys of 20 miles or more are expected be made on Christmas Day.
But the survey reveals the busiest day of the festive period is expected to be 18 December, when schools break up for the holidays.

Spokesman Gavin Hill-Smith said: "It will be a combination of parents picking the children up from school and heading away, people going Christmas shopping and, of course, the normal commuting traffic.
"It's also advisable to try to avoid driving near town and city centres or out of town shopping centres on the Saturday as that is shaping up to be a very busy day."
The AA survey revealed 45% of its members were planning to travel at least 20 miles on the Friday before Christmas, with another 41% on the Saturday, 19 December. Things then quieten down towards 25 December.
