Rowena Kincaid, 40, of Cardiff, died from breast cancer on Friday, seven years after she was first diagnosed.
The BBC Wales picture editor wrote and presented two Before I Kick the Bucket documentaries about living with the disease.
She also campaigned to raise awareness of how early diagnosis can save lives.
In the months before she died, Ms Kincaid, who defied the doctors telling her she would never see her 40th birthday, wrote a letter to her cancer, telling the disease she would not go down without a fight.
BBC Cymru Wales director, Rhodri Talfan Davies, paid tribute, describing her as a "wonderful, generous and life-enhancing colleague".
"Her courage and humour in confronting her illness inspired millions of viewers across the UK through the remarkable documentaries she made, which told a story about life much more than death," he said.
"Their impact was enormous with everybody who saw them.
"I was privileged to meet her while she made these extraordinary programmes and I will never forget her determination, in the face of such a cruel illness, to live well and to treasure every second.
"Our thoughts, of course, are with her family and many, many friends."
