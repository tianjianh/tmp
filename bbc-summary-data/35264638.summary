[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who posted lit fireworks through the letterbox of a mosque has admitted it was a religiously-motivated attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Hall, 38, had admitted causing criminal damage to the Islamic Centre in Rhyl, Denbighshire, on 11 November but denied a second charge of religiously motivated criminal damage.
But he changed his plea to guilty before his trial was due to be heard by Prestatyn magistrates on Friday.
Hall, from Rhyl, will be sentenced on Monday.
Prosecutor Wyn Jones told the court that Hall was seen by another man crossing the road to the mosque with a lighter in one hand and something else in his other hand. Three loud bangs were then heard.
The letterbox and its mounting were damaged in the incident.
