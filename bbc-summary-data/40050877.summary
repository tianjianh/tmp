Jamieson carded a five-under-par 67 to finish in a three-way tie for second behind Sweden's Johan Carlsson.
Englishmen Ross Fisher and Graeme Storm are a stroke further back, alongside Bradley Dredge of Wales.
"We had the best of the conditions, not a breath of air, and the greens are so good this year," said Jamieson, who was in the first group out at 07:00 BST.
Jamieson's score was matched by Kiradech Aphibarnrat and Francesco Molinari, with Open champion Henrik Stenson and Ryder Cup star Thomas Pieters part of a nine-strong group on four under.
A round of 69 kept England's Tyrell Hatton in touch, but two bogeys saw compatriot Justin Rose end on level par with Danny Willett, also of England.
Defending champion Chris Wood began his title defence with a level-par 72 that included three birdies and three bogeys, throwing his ball into the water after dropping a shot on the 18th.
"I couldn't hit the hole from three feet," said the Englishman. "I'm pretty disappointed and not in the best frame of mind now."

Branden Grace received a controversial drop after his approach on the 13th landed in the bank of a bunker.
Having taken his stance, the South African called in a rules official to say his feet were touching the rubber sheeting at the base of the bunker.
However, the decision was criticised by Willett, Masters champion in 2016, and former Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley.
Willett wrote on social media: "European Tour please explain that drop!? Burying feet in to get to the base of the bunker???"
McGinley added: "If you twist your feet enough you're bound to eventually reach the bunker lining.
"That means any time a player wants relief from a poor lie he can simply twist his feet until he reaches the bunker lining. That can't be right."
But Grace, who bogeyed the 13th and dropped another shot on the 16th in an opening round of 68, said he had simply applied the rules.
"I can understand if some people criticise you for standing in the middle of the bunker and going too deep, but if you're standing on the upslope it's not always easy getting a stance," he said.
