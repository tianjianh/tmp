[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides spurned chances early on but it was the Minstermen who took a 25th-minute lead thanks to Vadaine Oliver, who collected possession from Amari Morgan-Smith's through ball before slotting home.
Elliott Durrell went through on goal but was denied by York goalkeeper Scott Loach while at the other end Jon Parkin's long-range effort struck the inside of the post before bouncing clear.
Either side of half-time, Lynch expertly saved twice from Morgan-Smith, who struck the post on the hour mark, but the visitors guaranteed victory 15 minutes from time courtesy of Danny Holmes' half-volley.
York move up to 19th in the table and a point above the bottom four after Torquay and Woking were held to draws at Aldershot and Barrow respectively while Braintree were beaten at home to Dover.
