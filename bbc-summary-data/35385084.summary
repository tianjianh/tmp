Port Vale defender Richard Duffy is keen to sign a new contract with the promotion-chasing League One club.

The 30-year-old Welshman is tied to Vale until June 2016, having signed a two-year extension to the contract he originally signed when he joined from Exeter City in July 2012.
"There's a few of us out of contract at the end of the season, including myself," he told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Who they want to keep is down to the manager but I want to stay," he added.
"I'm in a good place with my family. I'm settled here and hopefully I can impress the manager (Rob Page) enough to earn a new deal."
Meanwhile, Vale are still waiting on fitness reports on fellow defender Ryan Inniss, who limped off 36 minutes into Sunday's 1-1 draw with Coventry City with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.
Ninth-placed Vale, who are just three points adrift of the play-off zone following Sunday's draw with one of Duffy's former clubs, are currently up for sale.
Chairman Norman Smurthwaite is still understood to be in negotiations with three interested parties as he looks to get back the estimated £3m he has put into the club during his three years in charge, as well as the initial £1.25m he and then partner Paul Wildes paid to buy the club in October 2012.
