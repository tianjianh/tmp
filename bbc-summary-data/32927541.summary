Plans to give a Lake District promenade a Â£250,000 makeover have moved a step closer.

Popular attraction Waterhead, on the northern shore of Windermere, is home to a ferry pier, hotels and cafes.
South Lakeland Council has agreed proposals to spruce up the area including new seating and an information board to identify key local landscapes.
Plans also include widening part of the promenade and new bicycle stands.
Lake District National Park planners will have the final say on the development, which if approved, work could start on later this year.
