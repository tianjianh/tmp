Metal detectorist Christopher Preece, along with his wife June, found a number of small metallic objects under a slab of clay on Sandown Beach.
The couple, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, took the finds to a visitor centre where staff passed them on to experts.
The copper alloy knife, most likely used as a leather working tool, has been dated to 800-1000BC.
The couple also found a button from the 17th Century during their holiday last month.
Mr Preece said: "I have a keen interest in history and immediately thought they were very old, because the knife has a green colour which is often found on old copper."
His wife added: "To be told the knife is several thousand years old is just incredible.
"As it was found on the island, we are very keen for residents and visitors to enjoy it and were happy to donate it to the council's museum's service so it can go on display."
The knife and button are now on display at Newport Roman Villa.
