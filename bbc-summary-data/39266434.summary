The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said crews battled the grassland fire in the Covesea Links area in a bid to prevent it spreading further.
Crews were called out at about 10:45. Smoke could be seen over a wide area.
Police Scotland said some roads closed as a result. Moray Council said more than 20 people staying at the nearby Silver Sands caravan site were moved as a precaution.
The council later said firefighters brought the gorse fire under control by the early afternoon, allowing the caravan site to reopen.
Teams were remaining at the scene to make sure it was safe.
