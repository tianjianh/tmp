The National League side, 57 places below their opponents, led through Bobby-Joe Taylor's first-half penalty after Niall Canavan fouled Jamar Loza.
But Camps' deflected stoppage-time 20-yard free-kick prevented an upset.
Maidstone's Anthony Acheampong was sent off after the final whistle for dissent at the award of the free-kick.
Rochdale, who had lost their two most recent first-round ties against non-league opposition, had earlier thought they had levelled on the half-hour but Steven Davies' effort was ruled out for offside.
The visitors, who had struggled to get to grips with the Stones' artificial surface, enjoyed a strong start to the second half as Davies' clever flick released Oliver Rathbone but he could not beat Lee Worgan at his near post.
Davies then nodded just over the crossbar as the visitors began to turn the screw, although both Liam Enver-Marum and Alex Flisher came close to doubling Maidstone's lead.
Taylor came within inches of a second as he fired narrowly over with just five minutes left but a moment of quality from Camps ensured the sides will do battle once again for a place in the second round.
