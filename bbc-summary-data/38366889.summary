Carlisle chief executive Nigel Clibbens says Gary Rowett's sacking as manager of Birmingham, after the club acquired new owners, highlights the need for thorough negotiations with investors.

Rowett had led the Blues to seventh in the Championship before his exit.
The Cumbrians are currently in talks with an overseas party with regard to a financial involvement in the club.
"We need to nail down what happens, because we're quite happy with [boss] Keith Curle," Clibbens said.
He told BBC Radio Cumbria: "I don't know the details [of the Rowett departure] but these are the realities of the world.
"Having a load of cash is only part of what we need to deal with here."
Carlisle have been linked with new investment for almost two years, while recent negotiations have accelerated to a point where finer details are being discussed.
On the field, manager Curle has assembled a team which is two points behind leaders Plymouth and second in League Two after 21 games.
"The investor has outlined his overall vision of what he thinks he would do with his club," Clibbens added. "We've got to drill down and see what that means in reality.
"That, being brutal, means right down to who will manage the team."
