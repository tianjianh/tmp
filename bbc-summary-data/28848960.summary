[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Women managers in Wales earn almost £4,000 a year less than their male counterparts, new research has shown.

Figures from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) show a gender pay gap of more than £3,771 between women and men in managerial positions.
Their average salary was £30,387 for men and £26,616 for women.
However, the situation is better than other parts of the UK where the gender pay gap is nearly double that in Wales.
The CMI's annual Gender Salary Survey looked at 68,000 professional UK managers.
It analysed the pay of 1,620 workers in Wales and found the widest gap between men and women was between the ages of 45 and 60.
There is also a persistent gap involving bonuses.
The CMI's Petra Wilton blamed apathy and ignorance for people not knowing there was a gap.
"It's the 41st year of our gender pay survey and it's found a very disturbing picture - a 23% gap in the UK," she said.
"There's a much better picture emerging in Wales where it's 12%. That's still a big gap.
"Probably one of the reasons is that Wales has quite a different economy in terms of high levels of public sector employees, in heath and education, compared to say the financial sector in the south east of England."
