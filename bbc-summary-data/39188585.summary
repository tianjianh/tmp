[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury moved six points clear of the League One drop zone after a home win over 10-man Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Sinclair handed the hosts the initiative when the Pirates midfielder was sent off in the 39th minute after being booked twice for simulation.
Bury then broke the deadlock with a 50th-minute penalty by James Vaughan before Greg Leigh and half-time substitute George Miller ensured the Shakers' ended Rovers' nine-match unbeaten run.
Rovers trio Luke James, Billy Bodin and Lee Brown were all off target before Sinclair got his first booking in the 24th minute.
Bury keeper Joe Murphy then tipped over a Byron Moore shot and moments later the visitors were down to 10 men.
The Shakers responded with Andrew Tutte and Vaughan firing over, and shortly after the break Leigh was fouled in the box by Lee Mansell.
Vaughan fired the penalty high past Joe Lumley for his 21st goal of the season - and 11th in 10 games.
Rovers almost hit straight back, though, as Tom Lockyer's long-range shot deflected against a post and Brown's follow-up was blocked on the line by Tom Pope.
The hosts doubled their lead in the 65th minute when Vaughan crossed for Leigh to head home his first Bury goal.
Miller then latched onto Kean Bryan's 75th-minute pass to cut in from the left and fire into the top corner, making it five wins from eight for the resurgent Shakers.
