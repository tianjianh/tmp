Bosworth had been among the leading group for the first hour of the race but Wang and Cai Zelin raced clear in the closing stages.
Wang, who finished third at London 2012, won in one hour, 19 minutes and 14 seconds, with Cai also improving on his fourth from four years ago.
Australia's Dane Bird-Smith finished in the bronze medal position.
"I can't be disappointed with sixth place at the Olympics but I could have done better as I had a dodgy stomach last night and that affected me a little bit," said Bosworth.
"To break the British Record by such a margin and at the Olympics is a dream come true. It was just an amazing experience. I'm so happy I cannot put it into words."
