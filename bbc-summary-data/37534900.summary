However, Northern Irishman Rea improved his chances of retaining the title as second place saw him extend his lead over team-mate Sykes to 48 points.
There are four races left with the last two rounds in Spain and Qatar.
Once Ducati rider Davies got past the Kawasaki pairing of Rea and Sykes, he pulled away to repeat Saturday's win.
Earlier in the campaign the 29-year-old from Powys won both races at Aragon and Imola.
Rea will head to Jerez content with a 48-point cushion at the top of the championship standings.
Englishman Sykes had led for most of Sunday's race but, when Rea briefly got past with five laps left, Davies pounced to snatch the lead.
Rea, 29, slipped to third but got past his chief title rival Sykes to finish runner-up.
"I am happy with second place - it was the best I could do today," said the defending champion.
"I put everything into that race."
