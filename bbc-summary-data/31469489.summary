Storm-hit Guernsey pool repairs 'may cost £200,000'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repairing Guernsey's storm-damaged Victorian bathing pools could cost up to £200,000, the culture and leisure minister has said.

The pools at La Valette were badly damaged by large granite boulders thrown up to 40ft (12m) by huge waves which battered the coast last February.
Deputy Mike O'Hara said it was unclear where the funds would come from and when the pools would reopen.
He said the cost of maintaining the pools would also be substantial.
The pools are used all year round by swimmers and were built after the loss of beachfront due to the extensive development of St Peter Port Harbour.
The ladies' and children's pools reopened last year but the men's and the horseshoe pools still remain closed.
