The teenager was taken into custody following a police raid at his home in Croxteth, Liverpool, at 07:30 BST.
Detectives are investigating allegations that someone illegally accessed an Instagram account before attempting to blackmail its owner.
An online shopping account was also allegedly accessed in order to buy and steal goods.
Computer equipment and other electronic devices were seized at the house, and the boy was taken into custody for questioning.
Det Ch Supt Chris Green, head of Titan, the North West's organised crime unit, said: "Cyber-crime is increasingly common with criminals turning to the internet to commit the same kinds of offences as traditionally would be committed in the real world such as theft, blackmail and fraud.
"As we now all spend more and more of our daily lives online, we need to take the same precautions and care about our personal details as we would on the street."
