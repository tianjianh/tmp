Plymouth Argyle manager Derek Adams is hopeful he can keep his squad together once the January transfer window opens.

Argyle have a number of key players out of contract in the summer including top-scorer Graham Carey.
Adams believes the League Two leaders may get offers they cannot turn down.
"We've got a very good squad and every time a transfer window comes along and somebody bids money for a player that we can't refuse then that's the way it is," Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"The football club has got to move in the right direction, it's a selling club when it has to be a selling club and it wants to keep its best players when it is possible.
"We'd like to have everybody here when the transfer window closes at the end of January."
Adams says other clubs wanting to sign his players is natural due to the good season they are having.
"I'm delighted that people are interested and I'm sure that the players are as well because we've had a lot of good performers this season," the 41-year-old added.
"I'm sure there are scouts and managers watching our games on a weekly basis because they want to see why Plymouth Argyle are at the top of the league and the reason is we've got a lot of talented individuals."
