Ex-Sunderland player Cabral says accuser 'wanted sex'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Premier League footballer accused of raping a woman he met in a nightclub has told a court she wanted to have sex with him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adilson Tavares Varela, known as Cabral, told Hull Crown Court he had consensual sex with the 22-year-old woman at his flat in Gateshead.
The ex-Sunderland midfielder denied being "persistent, forceful and aggressive" and said he stopped having sex with her when she asked him to.
He denies two counts of rape.
The woman has told the jury Varela pinned her down on his bed and raped her after they met during a night out in Newcastle.
But the footballer said they kissed and danced together before going back to his home with friends, including retired French international Anthony Reveillere.
He said the woman asked him to go into the bedroom.
When asked about her behaviour, Varela said: "It was normal. It was a normal girl who wanted to have sex with me.
"It seemed to me she was used to doing this as she was in no way ashamed."
He told the court he removed all of his clothes except for his socks and that he and the woman had sex in two positions.
Speaking through an interpreter, Cape Verde-born Varela told the jury the woman asked him to stop after around 15 minutes because she was tired.
He said he stopped and swore at her in French because he felt "frustrated".
Varela, who has a fiancee and a three-year-old son who live in Switzerland, told the court he got dressed and returned to the others in the living room, where he sent a message to a woman he described as a "sex buddy".
He said the complainant later left his flat with the others and was upset because she thought her mother would be angry with her.
Varela now plays for Swiss team FC Zurich. The trial continues.
