Rail workers have discovered a south London "ghost" station which closed a century ago.

Engineers on the Thameslink Programme uncovered the former ticket hall and platforms of Southwark Park station.
The long-lost station only served passengers from 1902 to 1915 before shutting for good.
The Â£6.5bn Thameslink Programme is rebuilding railway lines from New Cross Gate through London Bridge to Blackfriars and St Pancras.
Located on a viaduct above Rotherhithe New Road, Southwark Park was one of several stations in the area, including Spa Road, which closed because of competition from trams and buses and the outbreak of World War One.
The station was discovered as engineers constructed the Bermondsey Dive Under, which will see two Victorian viaducts partially-demolished and rebuilt to allow trains from south east London and Kent to dive down, under a new route carrying Thameslink services from Croydon.
Project manager Greg Thornett said: "We uncovered the footings for the former platforms while we were preparing the top of the viaduct for new track and we are now working up in the roof space of the former ticket hall to fill in the old skylights, ready to carry the final track alignment.
"Much of the existing stretch of viaduct will be replaced by the ramps into and out of the new dive under, but the arch that used to house the old booking hall will remain."
