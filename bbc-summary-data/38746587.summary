Lee Clark hopes to sign attacking reinforcements after Kilmarnock sold Souleymane Coulibaly for money that "was too good to turn down".

Coulibaly, 22, signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Egyptian side Al Ahly, who paid a fee in the region of Â£800,000 for the Ivorian.
Manager Clark now hopes to sign two forwards in the January window.
"I would just say that we had a head-turning amount of money offered to us," said Clark.
"The way it was structured was all in Kilmarnock's favour for a player we only got six months ago on a free transfer.
"Every player around the world has his value and I have seen some very talented players in Scotland since I arrived go for a lot less than the money we received for Souleymane.
"As the manager I now need to replace him but it helps the club in many, many different ways. You get out of the top three or four clubs in Scotland and clubs would find it hard to turn this kind of deal down.
"We saw Motherwell have to do it with Marvin Johnson in the summer and Dundee with Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart. We're not the only club in this position."

Kilmarnock - knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Hamilton Academical on Saturday - are 10th in the Premiership, a point above Hamilton and four in front of bottom side Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
"I spoke to the board via phone calls, emails and I will sit down with them later on today now the deal has been ratified and give them my ideas and thoughts and where we should go if I am lucky enough to get some of those funds," Clark added.
"Even if we had kept [Coulibaly] I was always looking to bring another striker in, so I am in the market for a couple now."
