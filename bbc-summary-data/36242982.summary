The 25-year-old, who returned in February after 10 months out, limped off during his team's 2-2 draw at City.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he was "worried" about the injury, adding that Welbeck would have a scan on Monday.
England coach Roy Hodgson will name his 23-man squad for this summer's tournament in France on 12 May.
Welbeck sustained a left knee injury in April 2015. He eventually had surgery on it in September.
"The first signs look like lateral meniscus," said Wenger after Sunday's match, which saw the Gunners twice come back from a goal down to claim a draw that strengthens their hopes of securing a top-four spot at City's expense.
"He looks down, and he's not a guy who likes to go off. I'm a bit worried. I don't want to say about the Euros - let's be a bit more optimistic."
England will already be without one Arsenal player this summer after midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain suffering his second knee injury of the season this week.
However, another England international, Jack Wilshere, made his second appearance of the campaign at the Etihad, coming on in place of Welbeck to continue his comeback after undergoing surgery on his fibula in September.
"I feel good. That was just what I needed, a game of that intensity with the pressure," said the 24-year-old.
"I don't want the season to end - I'm just getting started, I feel fresh, hopefully I can get more minutes next week and then we'll see what happens."
