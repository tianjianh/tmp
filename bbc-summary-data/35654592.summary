Former Tottenham and Wales winger Cliff Jones has compared Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino to legendary double-winning boss Bill Nicholson.

Jones believes Spurs are well placed to win a first title since the side that won the double under Nicholson in 1960-61.
Tottenham entertain another of Jones' old clubs, Swansea City, on Sunday.
"My roots are in Swansea, but Tottenham are my team and on Sunday I have got to fancy Spurs to win," he said.
Jones, who played 318 games for Tottenham, won the double, two further FA Cups and the European Cup Winners' Cup during his time at White Hart Lane.
Hailing the impact of Pochettino, Jones feels the feelgood factor in North London is currently giving Tottenham an edge over their rivals.
Spurs can still do their own version of the double as they sit second in the Premier League and face Fiorentina in the Europa League on Thursday night.
"Spurs, I am very excited about their season, the team has really come together and there is a great buzz and expectancy around White Hart Lane," Jones told BBC Radio Wales.
"Mauricio Pochettino has done a great job and it is looking really good, really exciting.
"There is a commitment to the supporters and the football club, the same as Bill Nicholson instilled in the club.
"There is that same attachment now, it is very important. These days it is not the same as it used to be at most clubs, but Spurs have that [relationship with supporters]."
Despite being just three points outside of the dreaded drop-zone, Jones is confident Swansea will remain in the Premier League.
"I don't know what has really happened but I am disappointed about where they are in the Premier League," he said.
"Last season they were the team to watch in the Premier League, but they have too much talent in the squad to not have a good spell again."
