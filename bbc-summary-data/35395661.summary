The Olympic bronze medallist won synchronised 10m gold alongside new partner Dan Goodfellow on Saturday.
Daley scored 545.80, with Matty Lee second and Goodfellow third.
Rebecca Gallantree took the individual 3m springboard crown ahead of Leeds diving team-mates Alicia Blagg and Katherine Torrance.
Daley revealed that he had been unable to train for 10 days ahead of the competition due to a stomach bug and struggled with his opening routine.
However, his other five were near flawless - a positive sign at the start of a year where he hopes to claim both European and Olympic medals.
"Every year that goes on I start the year just a little better than I was the year before so it's all going in the right direction," Daley told BBC Sport.
"I'm really excited about the year and do feel I'm in the best shape I've been in for a very long time."

Lee, 17, claimed European Games gold in Baku last year and hopes he has now done enough to compete at February's Rio World Cup - the final opportunity for divers to claim Olympic berths for Team GB.
"I think I've learnt so much from all the competitions I've been in over the last year," he told BBC Sport.
"I got a personal best today, I couldn't be any happier and hopefully that's enough for a place in Rio, because that would be amazing."
Gallantree, 31, will next compete in the synchronised event alongside Blagg in Rio next month, having secured an individual place for GB at the 2015 World Championships.
"The younger divers are coming up really quickly, which is scary but thankfully I managed to hold them off for at least one more year," she said.
Blagg's score of 321 was a new personal best and an emotional result for the 19-year-old who has struggled with wrist injuries for the last few seasons.
"I've had three years of wrist injections and months out and competitions missed and it's really beaten me down," she told BBC Sport.
"To come out with this result is just amazing."
