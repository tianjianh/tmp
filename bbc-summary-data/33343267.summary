A specialised engineering firm in the Borders collapsed after losing a major contract, its liquidator has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Border Precision Engineering was "heavily reliant" on the deal, according to Robin Knight of liquidators Alix Partners.
He said the firm faced "severe trading issues" after the contract ended.
Staff were turned away from the factory in Kelso on Monday and later learned that the company was in liquidation, with the loss of 80 jobs.
It is understood that the contract was terminated about 10 days ago.
Mr Knight said: "The business experienced severe trading issues with the loss of a major contract and it was heavily reliant on one contract."
The company previously went into administration in 2013 - but was saved by a management buyout, backed by investors syndicate Tri Cap.
The liquidator said they were working to find a "viable solution" for the firm.
He said: "This is a highly skilled workforce working in a precision market and we will be doing our very best to find a viable solution."
SNP MP Calum Kerr, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said it was a "big blow" for Kelso and the Borders.
He added : "I am currently seeking urgent meetings with those involved to see if I can be of any assistance and if there may be a future for the business.
"I will also be contacting Fergus Ewing, the enterprise minister in the Scottish government, to arrange an urgent discussion and to find out what kind of help he may be able to make available."
