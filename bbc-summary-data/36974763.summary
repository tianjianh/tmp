When presenters can't stop giggling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC weather presenter Louise Lear had an attack of the giggles in the middle of a live broadcast on Wednesday.

She struggled to contain her laughter after newsreader Simon McCoy went to her for a weather update.
It was not clear what caused her such amusement, but she is certainly not the first TV presenter to suffer from uncontrollable giggles.
Louise Minchin
Weather forecasters appear to be repeat offenders - with one particular broadcast from July 2014 proving a case in point.
BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin indicated to weather presenter Carol Kirkwood that her forecast was being somewhat upstaged by the dog in the background.
Charlotte Green
Of course, it is not just TV presenters that suffer from a sudden fit of giggles.
One favourite among BBC Radio 4 listeners was this news item from 2008 when Charlotte Green struggled to finish a Today programme bulletin.
She later admitted it was the clip from the previous item about the earliest recorded sound which had caused her to laugh her way through the final story.
Naga Munchetty
BBC One's Breakfast programme does seem to be particularly guilty on the giggle front.
Last Halloween, Steph McGovern's item on carving pumpkins proved a little too much for presenter Naga Munchetty, who cracked up after an aside made by her co-presenter Charlie Stayt.
Tomasz Schafernaker
Perhaps the figure who can be most relied upon for a good outtake is Lear's fellow weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker.
There was the time he forgot the presenter was in Edinburgh and the time he neglected to wear his microphone.
He was also reduced to hysterics by an unfortunate rude slip of the tongue while trying to say "muddy site" during a BBC Radio 4 forecast in 2009.
Sian Williams
Former BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams was particularly tickled by a joke from Reginald D Hunter.
The comedian was appearing on the show to promote his tour - and picked up on something Bill Turnbull said about his co-presenter.
