Fed up of having to scroll through your Twitter feed to see what you've missed?

Fear not. The site is rolling out a recap service for its iOS app from Thursday.
The "while you were away" tweets, first mentioned in November, will appear when you open the official app on an Apple device.
Your feed will now show you a snapshot of popular or relevant tweets that you missed from accounts you follow since last checking in.
The company says the feature will be launching on its Android app and twitter.com soon.
In a blog post, Twitter explained: "Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up - with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter.
"With a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of Twitter."
The change was first announced by boss Dick Costolo in November.
The company's stock price rose after the announcement, something vitally important to Twitter's financial future given the competition it faces from other social media companies.
