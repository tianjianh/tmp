[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The paedophile priest Fr Brendan Smyth challenged a former leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland over the response to his child abuse conviction.

Smyth wrote a letter from his prison cell, castigating the then Bishop Cathal Daly for stating that he (Smyth) had "done severe damage to the Church".
The serial child abuser's letter also blamed the media for creating an atmosphere of "shame" over his crimes.
His letter was read out at Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry.
The inquiry, which is being held in Banbridge courthouse, County Down, is examining child abuse allegations in church, state and voluntary children's residential institutions dating back to 1922, but has set aside a dedicated module on the case of the late Brendan Smyth.
Writing from his cell in Magilligan prison in 1994, Smyth said that he wanted to express his "anger and disbelief" that Cathal Daly had said the case had damaged the Catholic Church.
Describing the then Bishop Daly as "lofty and intellectual", the convicted child abuser went on to blame the media.
He said: "Whatever my failings - and there are many - it is not they, but the media reporting of them which has created an atmosphere of mixed shame and embarrassment."
The HIA inquiry also heard the only sanction the Catholic Church imposed on Smyth was to stop him hearing confessions.
The decision to withdraw Smyth's right to hear church-goers' confessions was made by Bishop Francis McKiernan in the Irish cross-border diocese of Kilmore.
The bishop's sanction followed a "secret" inquiry into allegations against the paedophile priest in 1975.
The 1975 inquiry was conducted by three priests, including Fr John Brady - who later became Cardinal Sean Brady and replaced Cathal Daly as the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland.
Cardinal Brady resigned last year.
The HIA hearing, which began examining Smyth's case on Monday, has been told that there is nothing to show that any other action was taken to stop his abuse or to help the children he had abused.
