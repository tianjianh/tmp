Almost 50 designs from architects in the UK, France, Sweden, Germany and the United States were submitted as part of a competition.
Two finalists will be chosen and the winning design will be announced in September.
A planning application was submitted for the Â£100m development in January, but it will not be looked at by council planners until the autumn.
