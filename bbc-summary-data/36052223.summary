[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother already serving a jail term for killing her daughter has been jailed for murdering her baby son, after confessing to the crime in jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harley Dunford was found dead in his cot at their East Sussex home in 2003, the Old Bailey heard.
Lesley Dunford, 37, formerly of Windermere Close, Exeter, pleaded guilty to his murder in March after changing her plea twice.
She was jailed for seven years in 2012 for killing Lucy, aged three, in 2004.
Dunford was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 13 years, for murdering seven-month-old Harley at the house in Camber, on 27 August 2003, six months before Lucy's death.
While serving her sentence for the killing of Lucy, she admitted involvement in both deaths to prison staff, saying she was "riddled with guilt".
She told officers that she had been having "flashbacks and nightmares" about what she had done.
In her confession, she wrote: "Something clicked in my head and I went back into the room walked over to his cot and pushed his face into the mattress until he stopped breathing.
"And then I put his head to the side and noticed there was blood and foam coming out of his nose. That's when I knew I had hurt him and I don't know why I had done it."
Jailing Dunford, Mr Justice Baker said: "The reality is, had you not confessed to killing Harley whilst in custody, it is highly likely there would not have been a police investigation into his death and you would not have faced prosecution for murder."
No inquest was held into Harley's death at the time as he was believed to have died from natural causes.
In a statement following the sentencing, Dunford's husband Wayne said he "forgives her".
But he said: "This has been a very difficult time for myself. Lesley lied to me about what had happened with the children.
"She was very good at this and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to family and friends for this deceit that lasted for a decade."
The jury at her first trial was told Dunford had epilepsy but had not been diagnosed with psychiatric or autism problems.
After she was convicted of the three-year-old's manslaughter, Sussex Police said Harley's death was fully investigated at the time and there were no plans to re-open the case.
But, detectives started a new investigation into how he died in June 2014, after Dunford wrote the confession in prison.
Sussex Police said specialists in paediatric pathology and forensic pathology reviewed Harley's death and concluded the evidence, alongside Dunford's verbal and written confessions, was "consistent with suffocation".
Senior Crown Prosecutor Libby Clark said Dunford showed "no remorse" by keeping "her silence over Harvey's death" for more than a decade.
"Lesley Dunford has lied for many years about what happened to her son, before finally confessing the truth.
"This was a terrible crime - her confession clearly stated that she deliberately suffocated her son."
