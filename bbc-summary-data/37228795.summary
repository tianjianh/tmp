'Love locks' to be removed from Leeds Centenary Bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Love locks" are to be removed from a bridge in Leeds over concerns they could cause damage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The padlocks, inscribed with the names of people, usually couples, have been fastened to the Centenary Bridge.
Leeds City Council will cut off the locks claiming they can cause "structural problems".
In 2014, part of the Pont Des Arts bridge in Paris collapsed under the weight of thousands of padlocks attached to a parapet.
More on this and other West Yorkshire stories.
The council said the locks started appearing on Centenary Bridge in 2013 but had recently "appeared in much larger numbers".
In a statement, the authority said: "Although we understand that people have attached them to the bridge as a sign of affection, the locks can cause corrosion to metalwork and structural problems for bridges.
"The number of locks fixed to the bridge in Leeds is now significant and after careful consideration it has been concluded that in order to avoid any future safety or maintenance issues they should be removed."
The council said the removed padlocks would be stored to allow people to reclaim them.
