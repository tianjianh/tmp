[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry has overturned on the M2 in north Belfast causing major congestion for commuters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened close to the Yorkgate rail halt, heading north.
No one was seriously injured but traffic was extremely heavy earlier on Friday. All the lanes on the M2 leaving the city have now reopened.
Earlier, the Department for Regional Development said traffic was particularly slow on the Westlink and Sydenham bypass.
Trafficwatch NI says there are tailbacks to Holywood Exchange heading into Belfast.
