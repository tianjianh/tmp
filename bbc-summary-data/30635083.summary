Get Inspired HQ is in the heart of BBC Sport, both physically and metaphorically. Top athletes love their sport, so inspiring people to get active is what a lot of sports personalities are passionate about. This means that when they come to visit the BBC they like to stop by and impart some of their knowledge and experience onto you. Browse the Tips, Hints & Insights section on our homepage where you'll find a wide range of films that could help you.
People get inspired in different ways. For some it's finding out how elite athletes achieved their success, for others its hearing about how people like them find the time and motivation to make a change. Tell us, and everyone else, your story. Email or get in touch over Twitter or Facebook and help motivate someone else.
Throughout the year we find schemes, programmes or campaigns that you can get involved in. Being a part of something bigger than your usual circle can be incredibly rewarding, and the good news is that there are different ways to participate - it could be through social media, playing in a national tournament, or engaging with local schools or communities. Keep an eye out on our homepage for a project that you can sink your teeth into.
If you run a not-for-profit or public service organisation who run activities that involve active participation, why not become a partner? The Activity Finder is a hotline to people who want to find out about physical activity near them. If you match the criteria, sign up to be a partner and we'll have your taster sessions, classes and participation events searchable soon.
We're not here to tell you to get active - you've got enough people telling you to do that. We're not even here to tell you how to get active - we're not the experts. But we do have a load of different resources, stories and features for you to spark some of your own motivational ideas.
We know everyone is different and what inspires you is different to the next person. That's why you'll see all kinds of different stories, links, films & information on our website and social media accounts.
Use us selfishly. We like it.
