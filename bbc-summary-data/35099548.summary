An extreme adventurer who became the first person to run, swim and cycle the length of the UK has completed the journey a fourth time - by boat.

Sean Conway, from Cheltenham, completed the "ultimate triathlon" between Land's End and John O'Groats in May.
And just before 21:00 GMT on Monday, he crossed the finish line again - in a racing yacht.
It is thought Mr Conway is the first person to complete the trek using the four different methods.
He was part of a three-man crew, with skipper Phil Sharp from Jersey and boat owner Alex Alley.
They completed the journey in just under three-and-a-half days.
The trio left Land's End in their Class 40 racing yacht at 08:55 GMT on Friday and arrived in the north of Scotland - 620 nautical miles (1,150 km) way - 83 hours and 53 minutes later.
Mr Conway said it was "amazing" to have completed the challenge.
"This was a very different experience to my previous adventures because they took weeks and months to do.
"I didn't get a lot of sleep and we were battered at sea. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be.
"I think this is it now. I think I'm done with Land's End to John O'Groats.
"No doubt I'll row it or do it on a pogo stick at some point, but for now I'm happy with my four records."
Mr Sharp said: "We are tired but feel quite ecstatic to have finished.
"It was a bit hairy towards the finish... with strong tides and big overfalls in the dark.
"Overall having done it, I think this a good course, and we have now set a benchmark which we think others will go out and challenge."
