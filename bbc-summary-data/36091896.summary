Monarch aircraft jobs at risk at Manchester Airport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 100 jobs are at risk at Monarch's engineering base at Manchester Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monarch Aircraft Engineering Ltd, which carries out aircraft repairs and maintenance, is considering closing the facility and relocating elsewhere.
The union Unite said 109 jobs in Manchester, 12 in Luton and two in Birmingham will be axed.
Monarch said the decision is dependent on the outcome of consultation with its Manchester-based employees.
Interim managing director, Andy Mackay, said the company is "fully committed to retaining talent, skills and expertise within our business."
"In the event that redundancies become necessary, we will offer alternative roles to all those affected, with relocation to our other facilities."
Unite's national officer, Oliver Richardson, said it is "very disappointing" and a "severe blow".
"Eighteen months ago, our members at Monarch made significant sacrifices in terms of their pay, and terms and conditions to help secure a deal with Greybull Capital.
He said it is a blow to the union's engineering members who "have played their part in turning around Monarch" and making it a "profitable business".
