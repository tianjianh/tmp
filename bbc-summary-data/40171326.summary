The nation gathered in towns and cities to grieve for the dead and think of the injured in the wake of the third such onslaught in three months.
The silence was marked at 11:00 BST.
Seven people were killed and 48 injured, 15 of whom remain in a critical condition.
Hundreds of people stood in the rain at locations across London to pay tribute to the victims of Saturday's attack.
One of them, Andrea Liddel, who travelled from Kent for the occasion, said: "I thought it was my duty to come here today - to stand where many lost their lives. I'm here for them."
Flags on official buildings were flown at half-mast and London mayor Sadiq Khan visited the headquarters of the London Ambulance Service to mark the moment.
New Zealand and England cricketers paused during the ICC Champions Trophy match at Sophia Gardens cricket ground in Cardiff.
A large crowd gathered on the steps of Manchester's Central Library, despite blustery showers.
Lucy Hardman, a 26-year-old council worker from Glossop, said it was about the city standing "shoulder to shoulder" with London.
"I think there was so much support shown to Manchester after the attack here, it felt right to show some solidarity," she said.
Debbie Peel, 60, of Saddleworth, added: "It's still a very sad city here, but there has been a lot of positivity too. A lot of people have come out today and it just feels like the right thing to do."
Angie Goff, of Audenshaw, said: "We all stand together and we won't stand for it. It's very upsetting what's happened in both cities. The victims and families, it's just unbearable. To be honest it doesn't feel real."
Ahmed Bhayat, a worker at Birmingham City Council, said he joined the minute's silence as a "mark of respect" to the victims. "People are doing these terrible acts and we should demonstrate we are united as one," he said.
Chris Illsley, who's from Yorkshire and is currently working in Birmingham, was among a small gathering joining the minute's silence outside the city council offices in Victoria Square.
"The reason I'm here is because I'm human," he said.
"I personally have a large family and the thought of what has happened to these families - it would tear you apart, wouldn't it?"
Emma Angell, of Kidderminster, who works in Birmingham as a civil servant said it was "important to pay your respects".
"These people were out enjoying themselves and you wouldn't expect this sort of thing to happen really - but this has followed attacks in Westminster and Manchester," she said.
Ms Angell said she was angry that "all Muslims were being blamed for the attacks when their ideology was peaceful and does not support such actions".
Bristol's Cabot Circus shopping centre fell silent at 11:00 BST as centre staff, customers and shopkeepers lined the balconies of the centre to pay their respects.
There was a low key police presence in the centre, the entrances of which are heavily fortified with steel bollards.
As the announcement was made shoppers stopped what they doing and stood with their heads bowed.
Amanda Black, 43, a civil servant, working for the DWP, is from Washington. She observed the silence at Newcastle Central station where she was waiting for a train to London to see a gig at the Hammersmith Apollo. She said: "I booked the tickets a while ago and will let not the awful events of the last few weeks put me off. I see a lot of police here and I find it reassuring, but I am still apprehensive about travelling to London and going to a concert. But we cannot let terrorism stop us going about our lives and it is important to remember the victims."
Oil rig worker Ron Charlton, 58, of Tristley Wood, Sunderland, was waiting for a train to go back to work in Aberdeen.
He said: "The thing that stands out for me - especially from the London attack was the swift response of our emergency services. They had taken out those responsible within eight minutes from the first call which is so reassuring. I think it is time that we started to consider more extreme measures to deal with the terrorist threat such as  internment. It is very important that we never forgot those who lost their lives - a minute's silence is the least we can do for those who have suffered."
Syed Ahmed, a local market trader, said he thought it was important to remember the innocent people who lost their lives.
Mayor Sarah Barber led the town's official tribute, and said: "It is particularly sad that we have gathered here again, so soon after we stood here following the Manchester atrocity.
"And now more innocent lives have been lost and families have been torn apart with grief. But we must all stand together in the face of evil and I thank you all for expressing solidarity."
Among shoppers in Inverness' Eastgate Centre was Sandra Lowe, of Kingussie.
She said she observed the silence out of respect of those who had lost their lives in the London Bridge attack, and also those affected by the Manchester Arena bombing.
"It is heart-breaking," she said, before adding: "It is a disgrace and something needs to be done. I am all for live-and-let-live and this is a United Kingdom for everybody from everywhere, but you live by the laws of the land in which you live."
Margaret Abraham, from Marske-by-the-Sea near Redcar in Cleveland, was one of those to gather in Nottingham, where she is visiting her brother.
"We need to realise that this terrorism is going on all the time all over the world, and we need to not forget that but think about it more. We haven't got to be afraid, we've still got to go about our everyday lives."
Rosey Palmer, from the city said: "I think it's important that we stand together. I wasn't able to be here for the Manchester one, so I felt I had to make more of an effort today."
Bishop James Stapleton, chaplain to the Lord Mayor of Nottingham, said: "To see so many turn out in the rain really shows solidarity with the people of London.
"We just had the same for Manchester, and it was shocking to see what has taken place. We stand together with them in their grief and sorrow."
Emma Sibley and Karl Hucker observed the silence with their young daughter, in their home city of Southampton .
Ms Sibley said they were there "just to remember and pay respect to the families and loved ones. It's horrible we have to do it, it's not right, but it's just out of respect. When you have little ones of your own it makes you think."
Bashir Chohan, 59, said: "The only straightforward message is to unite us. Terrorists would like to divide us and we would like to have unity with our communities.
"We don't want to see this kind of atrocity again, let's hope that it never happens again in our life."
The silence was observed at Mold Crown Court. Judge Niclas Parry said: "This morning, at this time, throughout the country, millions of lives are being paused in memory of those who lost their lives and for all the others injured or affected as a result of the tragic events in London on Saturday night."
Conwy county borough council chairman Brian Cossey said: "It's something that is really touching every member of the population of Britain.
"Our hearts go out to those who were injured, to the families of those who died, and to the people who witnessed this who weren't injured themselves. The tragedy will live with them forever."
John Lowe said he used the silence to "reflect on the loss of life and the impact it's having on the population in general. There is an element of fear involved. You have to turn out for these things to mark this occasion."
Nona Dean said she was there "out of respect for all of those who've died in London as well as Manchester. We're just so lucky to live where we do [in Truro]. I just feel so sad for everyone who's been lost and their families and the ones that are in hospital."
