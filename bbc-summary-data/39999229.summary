The 29-year-old was attacked on Glasgow Road, near Braehead shopping centre, at about 20:40 on Friday by a man who parked behind his car.
The victim was assaulted after getting out his vehicle. The suspect then drove off.
Police believe it was a "specifically targeted" attack.
The victim was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow where he was treated for a serious chest injury before being released.
Police Scotland have appealed for anyone with information to come forward after the incident outside the Porcelanosa building, which is near Braehead shopping centre.
Det Con Laura Durnie said: "We do not believe that this was a random attack and believe that the 29-year-old man was specifically targeted by the suspect, never-the-less we cannot tolerate this kind of violence in our streets in Renfrewshire.
"The area of Glasgow Road which is near to the Braehead shopping centre would have been busy with people coming to and from the centre and I appeal to anyone who either witnessed this incident or has any other information that could help identify the suspect to contact police."
