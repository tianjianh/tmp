The son of Frankel, ridden by Frankie Dettori, was one of a handful of horses to work on the track at the annual Breakfast with the Stars event.
Gosden said the Derby trip should suit Cracksman, who was added to the field last month as a supplementary entry.
"I think the mile and half will be right up his alley and we didn't supplement him for fun," he said.
"He goes there a fit, happy horse - a touch light on experience, but he is not the only one."
Cracksman beat subsequent Dante Stakes winner Periman in the Derby Trial at Epsom in April and is joint 4-1 favourite for the Classic on 3 June with Cliffs Of Moher, trained by Aidan O'Brien.
Surrey Police said security would be stepped up for the event, which attracts an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people, following the Manchester Arena attack.
"People attending will notice tighter security measures and firearms officers in and around the Derby grounds which we feel people have a right to expect and are commonly seen at large events of this type," said Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman.
