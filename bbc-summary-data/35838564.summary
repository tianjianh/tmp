[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police Federation investigated over fraud allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives have begun an investigation into allegations of fraud involving the Police Federation of England and Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Federation officials said they asked Surrey Police to investigate after identifying what they described as "potential fraudulent activity".
As the news emerged, the federation - which represents most police officers - separately confirmed that its vice-chairman, Will Riches, had resigned.
No reason has been given for Mr Riches' resignation. No one has been arrested.
Mr Riches, a constable with London's Metropolitan Police, had held the position since May 2014 when he lost the chairmanship of the federation on the toss of a coin.
He has not responded to requests to comment.
Officials from the Police Federation said the fraud allegations being investigated relate to bank accounts held by its Constables' Central Committee.
Surrey Police said it was investigating whether any offences had been committed.
During the day, detectives from the force carried out inquiries at the federation's headquarters in Leatherhead. No arrests have been made.
In a statement, the Police Federation said: "On Tuesday 15 March the PFEW (Police Federation of England and Wales) contacted Surrey Police to ask them to investigate potential fraudulent activity, relating to accounts held by the Federation's Constables' Central Committee.
"The issue was identified by the PFEW itself and we are fully cooperating with their initial investigation which is being undertaken to determine whether any offences have been committed.
"Until those enquiries are complete it would be inappropriate to comment further."
