Twenty-one-year-old striker Ollie Watkins and midfielder Ethan Ampadu, 16, have been linked with bigger clubs.
Watkins signed in July 2013 and has scored 30 goals in 55 appearances, whilst Ampadu was named Wales Young Player of the Year in November.
Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon: "I want to keep this team together for the season. Nobody is in a rush to sell."
He continued: "There's plenty of interest and enquiries but this is the best group of players I have had in a long time.
"The club is in a healthy place and doesn't need the money. It's a good quality problem to have."
