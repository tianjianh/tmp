Glasgow Warriors centre Richie Vernon faces up to nine months on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on an Achilles tendon injury.

The 29-year-old, who has won 24 Scotland caps, sustained the damage in the 47-17 thrashing of the Dragons earlier this month.
Vernon had returned from a 14-month lay-off in February, having struggled to overcome a shoulder problem.
The converted back-row is out of contract at the end of the season.
Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: "We're disappointed for Richie that he faces another spell on the sidelines, not long after he'd worked hard to get back to full fitness.
"The surgery was a success and we wish him all the best with his rehab."
