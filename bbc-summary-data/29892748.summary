We waved a tearful goodbye to Pat Butcher and those iconic earrings way back in January 2012.

But the EastEnders battleaxe is making a comeback and she's not alone.
Cindy Beale and Kathy Mitchell are also returning to the Square for a Children in Need special to be shown later this month.
They'll all be paying Ian Beale a ghostly visit after he is knocked unconscious by the door of a washing machine in the launderette.
The haunting trio will be joined by Ian's daughter Lucy, whose killer has not yet been found.
Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale said: "I don't want to spoil it but Ian is really happy to see some faces and completely knocked for six by others, but then again I think finding your late ex-wife in your kitchen is enough to shock anyone."
Gillian Taylforth, who was killed off-screen in 2006, said she's glad to be back.
"It was surreal being back but it was fantastic to have the chance to play Kathy again. Once I was back in the cafe with my apron on and stirring the beans it was like I had never left."
So with four women from Ian's past paying him a visit from the grave, does Woodyatt ever wondered if his character could be the next for the chop? Apparently not.
"Besides, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and I reckon that if a nuclear bomb went off in Walford, we'd be the ones walking out of the dust cloud saying: 'Did you hear a bang?"'
