[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 0-3 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jay Simpson scored twice as Leyton Orient moved out of the League Two relegation zone with victory at Colchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After Colchester had failed to clear their lines early on, Glen Kamara's stray pass inadvertently found Simpson who fired in low and hard past U's goalkeeper Sam Walker.
Walker denied Simpson a second before Kurtis Guthrie fired over for Colchester.
Orient doubled their lead less than a minute after the break, as Nicky Hunt picked up possession on the right and curled a low shot past Walker and in off his far post.
Guthrie then side-footed wide from 12 yards for Colchester and Orient keeper Alex Cisak denied Brennan Dickenson.
But Orient made it 3-0 midway through the second half when Simpson found space just outside the U's area and unleashed a fierce shot that flew past Walker.
