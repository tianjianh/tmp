Keeping your pets cool in the heatwave

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loads of us are sweating in the heatwave - but pet owners need to think about their animal friends too!

RSPCA chief inspector Dermot Murphy says: "Many animals can't sweat through their skin in the same way as humans and only cool down by panting and sweating through glands in their feet."
He advises simple things such as moving animals out of direct sunlight, topping up drinking water and waiting until the cooler part of the day to walk your dog or ride your horse.
The biggest issue is dogs being left in hot cars. Mr Murphy says: "Dogs should never be left alone in a vehicle."
The golden rule for animals, as with humans, is to keep them hydrated with a constant supply of clean drinking water.
We want to know how you're keeping your pets cool in the heat. Perhaps you're feeding them chilled pet food? Or taking them to the beach for a dip?

I put a few ice cubes in my cat's water dish which keeps her cool and she can play with them!

My dog Pippin has been sleeping and drinking water all the time. We have had the fans on around the house and she loves the fan blowing in her face.

I keep my three dogs cooled off by refilling their water a lot, making ice cubes in the freezer, and I have this thing where I cover one of their waterproof toys in water and put it in the freezer for a while. I take the toy out when there's frost on the toy.

I keep my hamster cool by feeding him carrots from the fridge.

We have two cats so we let them laze around in the day, but we let them out in the night when it's cooler for them to play.

I keep my puppy cool by having my swimming pool out and letting her in it.

I have a cat and a dog. We let the cat laze around in the sun and take the dog to the beach.
