Arsenal v Crystal Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Theo Walcott is expected to miss a second successive match for Arsenal with a minor calf problem.

However, Shkodran Mustafi is available following a hamstring injury, while Danny Welbeck is getting closer to a return after a long-term knee problem.
Crystal Palace will be without defender Damien Delaney as he is serving a one-match suspension.
Manager Sam Allardyce says James McArthur, Joe Ledley and James Tomkins have an outside chance of being fit.
Jonathan Pearce: "If Arsenal are to overhaul Chelsea in the title race, they'll realistically need to go to Stamford Bridge on 4 February on the back of six straight wins.
"The victory over West Brom was laboured. This must be a more comfortable win to calm anxiety. Bournemouth, Swansea, Burnley and Watford must also be dispatched in January.
"They need Alexis Sanchez to run the Eagles ragged with his clever movement.
"Palace will improve under Sam Allardyce. Again, an individual error cost them at Watford. Sam will cut those out.
"But recovery will be gradual and I can't see them getting anything at a ground where they've never won."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "The level of confidence or the level of urgency always goes a bit up when a new manager comes in, of course. That makes the game more difficult.
"When you look at their squad, it's a talented squad, because they have potential going forward, they are quick on the break and they are very versatile."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "Defensively we need to be a little better when we're out of possession. We have to defend as a team.
"We looked more resilient at Watford. It looks like we can get back to that. The creative side was pretty good - we can improve a bit."
It will take time for Sam Allardyce to have an effect. I think the Eagles' improvement will be a gradual process, and all their players will get feedback from their manager along the way.
It is hard to see them getting anything against Arsenal, who were not at their best against West Brom last time out, but still found a way to win.
