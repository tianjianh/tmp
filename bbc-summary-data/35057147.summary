Ms Merkel has been named the magazine's 'Person of the Year' and Davidson's portrait adorns the cover of the world-famous publication.
He did not meet her in person but took inspiration from photos and footage.
The Belfast-born artist told the BBC that the invitation from Time was "something you don't turn down".
"I'm sitting in my studio looking at the actual painting, and to see it reproduced on the cover of Time at this time of year and online worldwide is a remarkable thing," he said.
The artist, whose striking portraits can currently be seen in Belfast's Lyric theatre and in the Ulster Museum among many other places, said he was initially a little worried as it was not possible to get a sitting with Ms Merkel.
"All of my paintings, to date, have been the result of meeting and spending time with the person I've painted.
"With this particular commission I was told that the likeness was going to have to be gained through photographic source.
"But I decided to rise to the challenge."
Davidson immersed himself in finding out about his subject, studying photographs and film and reading books about Ms Merkel.
The process took about six weeks from start to finish, whereas he usually works on a portrait for about six months.
"I love nothing more than sitting in my studio and making work, so I just had to focus completely.
"I always paint my sitters in a very natural light. So I actually had to go back into my archive of personal sitters and look at how the light worked on their faces, so I used lots of my own sources from my studio as well as photographic sources for the portrait."
Davidson said that while he did not actually meet Ms Merkel, he felt that by painting her, he did get to know her.
"What I wanted to bring out was something that photography has never caught: a sense of compassion, dignity and humanity.
"I'm thinking particularly of her stance this year."
"What I wanted to do was to portray that, so that whenever people looked at her face and looked into her eyes in the portrait a sense of empathy and compassion would come through."
He found out on Wednesday afternoon that his portrait was on the cover of Time, being seen by people right across the world.
Mrs Merkel has not yet been in contact with the artist, but he said he would "jump at" an opportunity to meet the chancellor.
