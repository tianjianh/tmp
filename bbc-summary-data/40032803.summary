Asda is extending its Scottish craft beer offering north of the border, after collaborating with 10 breweries.

The move will bring an additional 25 new lines to its shelves, with a total contract value of Â£875,000.
The new deals mean that Asda stores across Scotland will now stock more than 100 Scottish beers, ales and ciders.
The supermarket giant said it was responding to growing demand for craft beer.
Five breweries - Black Isle, St Andrews, Bellfield, Tempest and Alechemy - are being listed with Asda for the first time.
Five other brewers will see their ranges extended, including Deeside Brewery, Belhaven Brewery, Wooha, Lerwick and Heather Ale Williams Bros.
Asda said it had worked with Craft Beer Clan, which promotes Scottish beer, to secure the new range of drinks.
Heather Turnbull, Asda's regional buying manager for Scotland, said: "The craft beer culture continues to grow, and it's clear customers are trading up to more premium beers, particularly ones which come from local brands."
