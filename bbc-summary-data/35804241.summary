Bournemouth's 3-2 win over Swansea on Saturday leaves them 13 points clear of the Premier League drop zone.
And the club's third successive league win has helped wipe away any relegation fears from the supporters.
"Everyone around us [thinks we are safe] and the fans I heard are singing 'we are staying up'," said King.
"But our mentality will not see us take the foot off the gas and relax now," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"We do not stop just because everybody from the outside thinks we are safe."
The 24-year-old scored his second goal in as many matches against Swansea to take his tally to five for the season.
King, who joined the Cherries after leaving Blackburn in the summer, admits he is beginning to feel at home thanks to Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe.
"The last few months have been amazing and I have learnt a lot from the manager," continued King.
"It's not been easy moving house, moving friends and everything.
"I was used to being in one place - in Manchester for seven years - but I am loving life and football at the moment, things are going well for me and especially for the club."
