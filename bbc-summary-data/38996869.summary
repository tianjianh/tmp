Ebbw Vale schoolboy Jackson Page had been given a wildcard entry and beat Jason Weston and John Astley in his first two games.
But Trump, 27, recorded breaks of 61 and 96 in the first two frames on his way to a comfortable victory.
Page, who attends Ebbw Fawr Learning Community in Blaenau Gwent, won £2,500 for reaching the second round and another £1,000 for progressing to the third.
"You can't ask for too much at my age against Judd... I'm glad it is half-term next week," said Page.
"I'd have been happy even if I got knocked out first round, as long as I gave it a good go.
"Even at the start of the tournament it was great, but as it went on it became more intense and real, it is all I want to do really is play snooker."
