First-half goals from Paul Robinson, Dean Parrett and Poleon effectively ended the tie as a contest.
The hosts continued to impress after the break, dominating a disjointed Bury backline and adding to their lead through Poleon and Lyle Taylor.
Robinson slammed the Dons in front on 27 minutes, converting Taylor's deft low cross from close range.
They doubled their lead five minutes later as Parrett sidefooted past goalkeeper Ben Williams after a mix-up in the Bury defence.
The visitors' defending was poor and they conceded a third in first-half stoppage time, Robinson unselfishly sliding in Poleon for the third.
AFC Wimbledon - who were without a win in four matches previously - were producing some excellent football in front of their home crowd and Poleon underlined their dominance by getting his second and the home side's fourth goal on 72 minutes.
The impressive Taylor then added his name to the scoresheet by ripping a powerful shot into the far corner 10 minutes from time.
The result piles more misery on the visitors, who have not won in their last 11 games in all competitions.
