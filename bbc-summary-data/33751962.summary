The 23-year-old died in hospital on Thursday after contracting meningitis.
He had been taken to Antrim Area Hospital the previous week, two days after playing a challenge game for his club.
The funeral of Mr Devlin took place at St Patrick's Church, Ballinderry, on Sunday.
GAA president Aogan O Fearghail said the player "represented both his native county Derry and his home club Ballinderry with distinction and was highly regarded across his native county and further afield".
