A project has been launched to raise up to Â£2m to renovate a medieval church in Leicestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Mary's Church in Melton Mowbray dates mainly from the 13th to 15th Centuries, with parts dating back to about 1170.
Parishioners say the building is "no longer fit for purpose" and "needs more fundamental" renovations to improve the organ, safety and accessibility.
They hope to give the church the "wow factor" when it reopens in late 2017.
The Heart of St Mary's project aims to restore the Malcolm Sargent organ, as well as repairing and renewing the floor of the "architectural gem".
The Rev Kevin Ashby, rector at the church, said: "This is a major project, but if St Mary's is to remain at the heart of the community for centuries to come, then we need to be brave about the renovations that are required and the amount of money we need to raise to fulfil them."
The renovation work will also include upgrading the electrics, improving the lighting and heating and upgrading audio visual and sound systems.
John Craig, chair of the project, said: "The wiring of the organ has deteriorated to such a point that it can't be kept going for much longer.
"We're hoping by the end of October 2017 all the work within the building will have been completed."
The last service at the church will be held on 1 January before the work begins.
