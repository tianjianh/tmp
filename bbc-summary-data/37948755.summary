Hiker runs into Hillary Clinton on New York trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Margot Gerster was "heartbroken" by the result of the US election and, to unwind, went on a hike with her daughter and dog through the woods in Chappaqua, New York.

The last person she was expecting to see, presumably doing the same thing, was the woman who lost to Donald Trump just two days earlier.
But that's exactly what happened.
A photo of the hiker standing alongside Hillary Clinton marks the first appearance of the Democratic presidential candidate since her concession speech on Wednesday.
She even said Hillary's husband, Bill, took the photo.
Ms Gerster, who lives in White Plains, shared her story on Facebook. The post had been liked more than 110,000 times and shared by some 9,000 users before she made it private.
"I got to hug her and talk to her and tell her that one of my most proudest moments as a mother was taking Phoebe with me to vote for her," she said.
"She hugged me and thanked me and we exchanged some sweet pleasantries and then I let them continue their walk."
The Clintons live in Chappaqua, in Westchester County - it's also where Mrs Clinton voted on Tuesday.
And it doesn't seem to be the first time Ms Gerster has met the former secretary of state.
She also shared a picture with Mrs Clinton that, she said, was from her high school years, at a fundraiser hosted by her mother where the Democrat was a guest of honour.
