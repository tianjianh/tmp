Exeter City 3-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City sealed a huge win in their quest for the League Two play-offs with two goals in stoppage time sealing victory over Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chances were few and far between in a rather turgid first half with Exeter missing the best of those.
However, the Grecians lifted after half-time and took the lead on 47 minutes when Ryan Harley's corner fell to David Wheeler and his scuffed shot somehow squeezed under Daniel Nizic and rolled over the line.
Joel Grant then missed a glorious chance when he blazed horribly wide on 62 minutes, but Morecambe equalised when substitute Kevin Ellison smashed a stunning volley across goal and into the top corner from 15 yards.
Exeter, however, went on to win it in stoppage time when substitute Reuben Reid, fouled in the penalty box by Michael Rose, picked himself off the floor to smash the spot-kick into the bottom corner.
Fellow substitute Liam McAlinden then added a third when Exeter struck on the counter attack as he waltzed across the penalty box before planting a shot into the bottom corner.
The win sees Exeter move up to fifth in the table, three points clear of Mansfield in eighth spot with two games to go.
