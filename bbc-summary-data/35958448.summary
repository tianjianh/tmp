The Lady Black Cats beat Reading 3-0 to make the semi-finals with Arsenal, Manchester City and holders Chelsea.
"If you want to win a trophy you've got to beat the best," Williams told BBC Newcastle ahead of Tuesday's draw.
"Whoever we get, we'll prepare appropriately. We're not going down without a fight."
Carlton Fairweather's side had drawn 1-1 with Reading in Women's Super League One on 26 March.
Ex-Doncaster defender Williams continued: "We played Reading in the league last week and we felt that we underperformed quite badly.
"So we had a chat first thing on Monday morning, we had a look through the videos, discussed what we needed to improve on and we applied that."
Sunderland Ladies have only played in an FA Cup final once, losing 2-1 to Arsenal in 2009.
"It would be massive if we get there [the final]," the 25-year old added. "It's every kid's dream, isn't it? You don't get many chances to play at Wembley and you've got to work hard to get there."
