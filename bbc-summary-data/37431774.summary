Anna Swabey, 25, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, was given three months to live in 2015. Shortly after, she met Andy Bell, 26, on a dating app.
The pair were due to marry on Saturday in the Yorkshire Dales.
Miss Swabey launched a fundraising appeal for Brain Tumour Research which has raised more than Â£70,000.
Her mother, Linda, said: "Our darling Anna would have been so proud to see how her story has touched so many people around the world.
"We have been overwhelmed at the messages of love and the donations which have been made in our daughter's memory.
"Many have come from people she never met but who have been affected by her story."
Mrs Swabey added: "We are determined to continue the work she started. If there is one good thing to come of this tragedy, we hope that Anna will have achieved her fundraising goal in order to help others."
Following her diagnosis, Miss Swabey described her treatment in a blog she called Inside my Head.
In her final post on 8 July, she said chemotherapy had left her feeling unwell but added her spirits had been lifted by her hen party in York.
