[SN]TITLE[SN]
Loughborough sex attacker Albert Newton jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed after befriending women online and then subjecting them to "nasty sexual attacks".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Albert Newton met the women on an adult services website and on three occasions arranged to meet them before raping or attempted to rape them.
The 32-year-old, found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court in August, was sentenced to 19 years in prison.
Police called Newton, of Woodgate, Loughborough, a "sexual predator" and said there could be more victims.
The defendant was also sentenced for one offence of false imprisonment where he held one woman against her will in her home.
The court heard he carried out the offences in Loughborough and Leicester, between April 2013 and December last year.
In another incident he violently assaulted a woman, kicking her in the abdomen.
Det Sgt Neil Holden said Newton was a "persistent offender", who changed his online profile name and phone number after each offence.
"He picked vulnerable women, exploiting them for his own sexual gratification, without their consent," he said.
"He ensured that when he arranged to meet them they would be at their most vulnerable, putting him in a powerful position to abuse them."
Det Sgt Holden urged anyone else who believed they had been attacked by Newton to come forward.
