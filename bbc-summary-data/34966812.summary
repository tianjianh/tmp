Rare medieval finds in Nottinghamshire declared treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three rare pieces of medieval jewellery and Viking gold ingots found in fields across Nottinghamshire have been declared treasure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The items were discussed at an inquest where landowners and finders discovered where they would go.
Assistant coroner Stephanie Haskey said they gave "a good and growing picture of medieval life".
The pieces will now form part of different museum collections in the county.
The finds include a silver gilt cross pendant dating back to the 13/14th Century, a silver hawking vervel ring thought to be worth Â£1,500 and gold Viking ingots.
Another gold ring was found in Newark by metal detectorist Maurice Richardson who previously found a 2,200-year-old gold necklace worth Â£350,000.
Speaking at Nottingham town hall, Ms Haskey, thanked attending landowners and hunters.
She said: "All of these add up to give us a good and growing picture of medieval life in Nottinghamshire.
"I've seen over the year how these collections are expanding and so our knowledge is growing and it's really valuable to us."
Colin McAlpine, who found the hawking vervel ring, said he first thought it was a washer.
"I was cleaning it in a bowl and when I washed it I realised it was silver," he said.
"These are found in some numbers in Norfolk but in Nottinghamshire they're very rare."
Glyn Hughes, from the Newark Civil War Museum, said Newark had become a "hot spot" for treasure finds.
"We have been fortunate that we have had some finds coming into the collection," he said.
"Most people who find things are interested in their historical value but it's really amazing to see their faces when they find out the financial value."
