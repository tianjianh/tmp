A statement on the band's website said he was diagnosed just before Christmas after a small cancerous tumour was found at the back of his tongue.
He has just completed a seven-week course of chemotherapy and radiology treatment and is expected to make a full recovery.
"As the tumour was caught in the early stages, the prognosis thankfully is extremely good," the statement said.
"Bruce's medical team fully expect him to make a complete recovery with the all clear envisaged by late May".
The statement also asked for patience and respect for the singer, who is also a pilot and businessman, and his family's privacy.
An update on his progress will be given by the end of May.
The tumour was discovered after a routine doctor's check-up led to tests and a biopsy.
The statement concluded that "Bruce is doing very well considering the circumstances and the whole team are very positive."
The veteran metal band finished a three-year world tour in July 2014 with a headline slot at the Sonisphere Festival.
While on stage Dickinson hinted a new album could be on its way.
