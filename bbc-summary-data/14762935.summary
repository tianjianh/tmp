Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean says that he is delighted with the additions that he has made to his squad over the summer.

Rovers have signed eight players, including deadline day trio Yakubu, Scott Dann and Jordan Slew, and let 12 leave Ewood Park.
Kean told BBC Radio Lancashire: "People thought we were going to lose players.  We've managed to keep the majority.
"We've managed to bring in fantastic quality right on the last day."

The signing of centre-back Dann could potentially become Blackburn's record transfer based on appearances and various incentives.
Kean said: "I've worked with him before. He's a fantastic leader but more importantly he's a top player."
Nigeria striker Yakubu agreed a three-year deal with Rovers after being out of favour for almost a year at Everton.

"When we found out his was available we moved swiftly," Kean said. "To get somebody with a track record of scoring goals at this level is great.
"Everybody knows that if you can get him in the box and get him the service then he scores, so I think it's a brilliant signing."
The capture of 18-year-old striker Jordan Slew from Sheffield United for around Â£1m will see him join the club's development squad.
