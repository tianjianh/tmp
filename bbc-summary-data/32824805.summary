Scarborough's new football stadium plan recommended for approval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a football stadium and swimming pool in Scarborough have been recommended for approval by council officers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed 2,000-capacity ground on the Weaponness car park would be home to Scarborough Athletic Football Club.
The council is selling the site of the town's former football stadium on Seamer Road in order to fund the scheme.
Councillors are due to consider the plans on 28 May.
In addition to the community stadium, the development would include a 25m swimming pool, sports hall, squash courts and dance studio.
The town's previous football ground - the McCain Stadium - was home to Scarborough FC, which was wound up in 2007. The club was formed in 1879 and played in the Football League from 1987 to 1999.
The stadium was demolished after the club went out of business.
Scarborough Athletic Football Club was formed in 2007 but plays its fixtures at a ground in Bridlington about 17 miles (27 km) away.
