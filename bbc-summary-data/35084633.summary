The so-called Islamic State (IS) says it was behind a bomb attack that killed at least 16 people in the government-controlled Syrian city of Homs.

The group said one of its militants set off the car bomb among "rafidis" - a derogatory term for Shia Muslims.
The attack comes just days after rebels began evacuating the area under a ceasefire deal with the government.
IS has been expanding towards Homs in recent months.
"Abu Ahmed al-Homsi parked his car in the Zahra neighbourhood and exploded it among the 'rafidis' before detonating his explosives belt," IS said in a statement.
It claimed to have carried out two blasts, killing more than 25 people and wounding 70. Officials say 16 people were killed in a single explosion.
The vehicle used was filled with 150kg (330lb) of explosives and caused a gas cylinder to blow up in a nearby shop shortly after, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (Sana) said.
The first bomb exploded near a hospital in the al-Zahra area on Saturday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.
Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi condemned the attacks, saying they would "not discourage the Syrian people", according to Sana.
Government forces were able to tighten control of Homs following the implementation of a UN-backed truce deal in al-Wair, the last rebel-held area in the city.
About 700 people, made up of rebels and their families, are thought to have left Homs and travelled to rebel-held areas of Idlib province on Wednesday.
Fighters linked to al-Qaeda were among those due to leave, but moderate groups who accepted the ceasefire were expected to remain.
