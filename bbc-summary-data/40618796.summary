Captain Heather Knight top scored with 67 as the hosts were restricted to 220-7, Afy Fletcher finishing with 3-33.
Natalie Sciver, who hit 129 against New Zealand on 12 July, took three wickets, including two in one over, as West Indies were restricted to 128-9.
England will face South Africa in the semi-final on 18 July in Bristol.
South Africa, who started the day third in the table, dropped to fourth after a 59-run defeat to Australia at Taunton.
India confirmed their place in the semi-finals with a 186-run win over New Zealand at Derby.
They will meet holders Australia in the other semi-final at Derby on 20 July.
The final is at Lord's on 23 July.
Having lost on the opening day of the World Cup against India on 24 June, England have recovered well to build momentum and finish top of the group.
Their emphatic victory over West Indies, runners-up in 2013, included a disciplined fielding display, while seven Windies wickets were lbw - a record in the women's one-day international game.
West Indies were 64-3 at one stage before losing five wickets for 36 runs to collapse to 100-8.
Earlier Knight played an intelligent innings, which included five fours, to steady England after they had slipped to 105-5.
Nat Sciver, who hit two swashbuckling centuries earlier in the tournament, made a second-ball duck but responded with two wickets in her first over and went on to claim 3-3 from four overs.
Captain Knight came to the crease in the 11th over with her team at 54-2 and was awarded the Player of the Match for her composed 88-ball innings.
"The support has been brilliant, particularly here at Bristol, and it really does make a difference," she enthused.
"Hopefully we will get a lot of people here on Tuesday for the semi-final and go from there."
The tournament's leading scorer, Tammy Beaumont, who made 42, added: "That performance was what we were aiming for, we knew it was a used pitch and their spinners would come into the game, they pegged us back but with 220 on the board we were pretty confident
"We fielded and bowled well and won by 90 runs in the end so it's good for us. At 90-4 it wasn't an ideal start but we back our batting line-up the whole way down.
"The best part about our squad is that someone steps up every single game, Heather had a crucial knock with the bat and then everyone did their bit with the ball and that's really important.
"We all need to be on form heading into a semi-final."
Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special: "Clearly England are favourites for the semi-final but South Africa will bring their spinners out - players like Nat Sciver like pace on the ball - and if the South Africans turn it it will be the spinners who decide it.
"South Africa have beaten England in recent times and on any day they can put their names in the hat."
