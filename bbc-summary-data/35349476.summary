Michael Rankine opened the scoring for the hosts from the spot after Bruno Andrade's foul, and Josh Ginnelly fired in to double the lead before half time.
Woking halved the deficit when Andrade was felled just outside the area and Giuseppe Sole swept home the free-kick.
But Altrincham sealed the points when Jonathon Margetts found the net from Rankine's cushioned header.
It was Woking's first league loss in eight games and means they remain a point outside the National League play-off places.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"No complaints at all. We were always second best and I'm disappointed to say that because we've had a great run, with only losing once in in the last 12.
"Sometimes you have a bad performance and we had a bad one, we never really got going early on.
"We were second all over the park and they seemed like they wanted it more than us. They won personal battles all over the park.
"It's the end of good run, (but) we've got ourselves in a good position and we find ourselves disappointed by not jumping into the top five - but on tonight's performance, we don't deserve to."
