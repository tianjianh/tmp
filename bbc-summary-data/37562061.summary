A couple may have survived a car crash if they had been wearing seatbelts, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The deaths of Tom Lawrence, 21, and Courtney Smith, 16, were a "tragic and needless loss", according to Gwent assistant coroner Wendy James.
Mr Lawrence crashed in Caerleon, Newport, on the way home from a friend's 21st birthday party in February.
The coroner recorded that the deaths were due to a road traffic collision.
Mr Lawrence's blood alcohol level showed he was over the limit recorded as 114mg per 100ml of blood compared with the legal limit of 80mg.
There were also traces of cannabis in his blood, the hearing in Newport was told.
A Gwent Police investigation showed the car was travelling at around 51mph when Mr Lawrence started to brake ahead of a 30mph zone, with tyre marks on the road indicating "heavy braking".
Ms James said that if the pair had been wearing their seatbelts "the chances of survival would have been increased".
Machine operator Mr Lawrence, from Caerleon, died at the scene and Miss Smith, from Pontypool, died in hospital.
