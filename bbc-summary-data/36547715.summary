[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Duffy, 31, was part of an armed masked mob which targeted a flat in Paisley on 11 May 2015.
Lisa Revie confronted the gang as they made off in a Mini, but she fell to the ground and Duffy drove over her.
The 36-year-old suffered a brain injury as well as fractures to her skull, ribs, pelvis and both ankles. Duffy admitted culpable and reckless driving.
Jailing Duffy at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bannatyne told Duffy: "The motive for this appears to have been revenge for something.
"Your victim sustained life-threatening injuries which have had a significant effect on her life and will continue to do so."
The court heard that Duffy, of Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, had borrowed the car used in the attack from a friend of his partner.
He and other men then used the car to get to the flat in Paisley's Blackstoun Oval.
Prosecutor Allan Nicol told the court: "Witnesses were returning (to the property) when they noticed a white Mini.
"The occupants all had their faces covered with masks described as a pig, a clown, a wolf and the devil.
"The people from the car then left it and chased them."
The court was told that the group being pursued managed to get inside the flat before the door was struck with a hammer and a knife.
Ms Revie then decided to go back out causing the gang to flee. Two of the mob jumped back into the Mini.
Lisa swung open the driver's door and punched Duffy, who was still wearing his mask.
Her friend David Soutar was hit as Duffy tried to speed off.
Ms Revie was then struck by the door of the car as it reversed.
Mr Nicol told the court: "She was thrown into the air and cracked her head as she landed.
"She fell under the car causing her to become trapped. The vehicle was then driven forwards and over her lower half as she lay on the ground."
Duffy escaped before the car's owner was told the Mini had been left near her house.
Ms Revie was taken to hospital with severe injuries and now walks with the aid of crutches, has memory loss and double vision as well as ongoing pain in her head and neck.
Duffy also admitted injuring David Soutar to the danger of his life and a further charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner as well as failing to show at a previous court date.
