They took two 43" televisions, 29 electric toothbrushes, 22 tubes of toothpaste, 10 DVDs and a beard grooming kit.
Their haul also included 66 packs of razor blades, five cans of hairspray and some back pain relief patches.
The theft happened at 04:30 BST on Wednesday at the Billingham store which is closed between midnight and 06:00.
It is believed two men wearing dark tracksuits with the hoods up were responsible, Cleveland Police said.
It is not known whether either of them had beards.
