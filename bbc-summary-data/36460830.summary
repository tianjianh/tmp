Former University of Chester lecturer Doreen Collyer, 60, was scuba diving in Perth when she was attacked on Sunday.
It is thought she was killed by a 16ft (5m) great white shark, ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) has reported.
Her husband David Collyer said she was a "beautiful person" and "loving wife".
The couple moved to Australia from Neston, Cheshire about five years ago.
Mrs Collyer held an advanced open water qualification.
ABC reported her diving partner managed to pull her from the water but she died from her injuries at the scene.
Prof Annette McIntosh-Scott, from the University of Chester, said Mrs Collyer was a "hugely valued and loved member of staff" and had worked at the Faculty of Health and Social Care for 15 years.
"She will be remembered as someone with a real commitment and passion for teaching and child healthcare - her students were at the heart of all she did," she said.
Arshad Omari, the acting vice chancellor of Perth's Edith Cowan University (ECU), where Ms Collyer worked as a nursing lecturer described her as "a much-loved and respected colleague, mentor and teacher".
Dozens of Ms Collyer's colleagues, students and friends paid tribute to her on social media.
Kelly Mills wrote on Facebook "RIP Doreen, you were an amazing lecturer, thank you for sharing your vast knowledge", while Nikki Vickers said: "Condolences and deepest sympathy to all family, friends and colleagues from ECU Nursing and Midwifery."
The beaches and water in the Mindarie area, where the attack took place, have been closed to the public and an order has been issued by the Department of Fisheries to deploy capture gear to catch the shark.
