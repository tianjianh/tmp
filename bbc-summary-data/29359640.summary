The 21-year-old midfielder goes straight into the squad for Saturday's trip to Accrington Stanley.
The former Cheltenham Town and Oldham Athletic loanee has made 38 appearances for City, but has only featured once for the first team this season.
Argyle manager John Sheridan had been looking to strengthen his midfield following the injury to Alex Bray.
Pilgrims coach Sean McCarthy said Reid had made a big impression since arriving at Home Park on Thursday.
"He trained for the first time this morning with his team-mates and he was outstanding," McCarthy told BBC Sport.
"Bobby's a bit different - he's an attacking midfielder who's got two good feet, a good engine and he can play."
"Of course he'd like to get in the first team at Bristol City but you're better off playing first-team games at Plymouth Argyle than playing in the Bristol City reserves."
"The gaffer (Steve Cotterill) told me on Saturday that Plymouth were interested and asked if I'd like to come down," Reid told BBC Sport.
"I spoke to  who said it was a nice club with good fans, so it was a no-brainer.
"I'm more of a creative type of player. I try to get goals and assists - my main aim is to help Plymouth win every week."
