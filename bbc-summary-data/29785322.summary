But they are subject to certain rules, including Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order, which states "a person must not recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property."
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also prohibits the flying of drones over or within 150m of built-up areas.
The UK Airprox Board deals with aviation reports concerning "near misses", also known as an air proximity hazards.
Members of its board were said to be "disappointed that someone would fly a quadcopter so high on the extended approach path to an airport".
They decided the quadcopter was flown close enough to the plane "to cause its pilot concern".
Unless CAA permission has been granted the pilot cannot:
