The shooting happened at an address on Bouncers Lane in Prestbury at about 22:45 GMT on Wednesday.
Gloucestershire Police said four women, four men and a 16-year-old boy had been arrested on "a number of conspiracy offences" related to the shooting.
The four "main perpetrators" have not yet been arrested, a spokesman added.
At the time of the shooting, in which nobody was injured, witnesses said they saw up to four men arrive at the house in two cars.
They went inside and fired a number of shots from a shotgun before driving off.
Det Insp Hannah Mackie, said: "It is vital that anyone who hasn't already spoken to us does so immediately, even if it is in confidence through Crimestoppers.
"This neighbourhood is a usually peaceful area and I understand that an incident like this is bound to cause concern, but I am keen to reiterate our message that this was not a stranger attack.
"The victims and offenders did know each other."
Police said women aged 61, 60, 55 and 23, men aged 56, 54, 25, 20 and a 16-year-old boy, who are all from Cheltenham, are in custody being questioned about the shooting.
