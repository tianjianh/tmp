[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Milburn, 19, of Crosby, was taken ill at the Cream Grand Finale at Nation in Wolstenholme Square on Saturday and later died in hospital.
Merseyside Police said post-mortem examination results had been withheld "pending toxicology reports".
A 47-year-old man, who was also taken ill, remains in a "stable but critical condition", police added.
The circumstances surrounding what happened to both men are being investigated by officers.
The so-called "super club" first opened its doors at Nation in 1992 and went on to become an international brand, branching out into Cream Ibiza and the Creamfields festival.
Nation is closing to be replaced by a new music venue.
