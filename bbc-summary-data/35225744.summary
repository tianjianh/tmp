That means that since 1 November at least 39 people have been killed by cold weather in Poland.
Six people slipped and fell to their deaths in the Tatra Mountains on the border with Slovakia.
Meanwhile in the German city of Bremen 300 migrants were reportedly evacuated from tents.
Since the New Year freezing temperatures have made conditions even more difficult for migrants living in temporary accommodation.
The water supply and heating to the tents in Bremen had stopped working, officials told the Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung newspaper.
Other German media said migrants waiting to be registered as refugees were standing in freezing temperatures outside government offices in Berlin, which have reopened after the holidays.
