Officers said they are concerned for the welfare of 35-year-old Anna Chudy, who left Northwick Park Hospital with a man.
She walked out on 16 October at around 10:30 BST having given birth via caesarean section to a "healthy baby boy" a day earlier.
Police have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
A spokesperson for the hospital said if the baby is left for more than three days, it will be referred to the local authorities.
The man is described as white, with short dark brown hair and tall with an athletic build.
He was wearing a black leather jacket with patches on the elbow and dark trousers.
