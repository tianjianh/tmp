Presenter Claira Hermet and her family have been speaking about the devastation of losing her mum and sister to breast cancer.

In a documentary airing on Tuesday night on BBC Radio 1, she talks with her dad about what it was like.
The 1Xtra DJ is recovering from a double mastectomy - a procedure she went through to reduce her chances of getting breast cancer.
Claira inherited a gene which increases the risk of developing the disease.
"I'm not depressed and upset and sad about it daily but it's always there. I think about it the whole time," says her dad Howard Hermet.
He says that when his wife, Jane, was first diagnosed at the age of 39, he believed her breast cancer was "curable".
"But as time went on it obviously progressed into something a bit more serious," he explains.
"As far as Jane was concerned, we sort of knew within the last five or six months that there was nothing more that could be done.
"I remember breaking down then and it was really terrible for a few weeks and so by the time she died I was sort of numbed to it because I'd done the crying and everything beforehand."
Jane died at the age of 43.
Claira's sister Emily was told she had breast cancer when she was 25.
"I think probably the worst thing was she went straight to the surgeon in Harley Street and he said that they had operated and that unfortunately it was an aggressive cancer," says Howard.
"The fact that he said it was aggressive was quite devastating. That word means that the chances are the patient is not going to survive."
Emily was 31 when she passed away.
Speaking about the aftermath of his wife and daughter's deaths he says: "We go forward and we do things and we keep going on but it's still affected everything.
"I can't change it. It's something in the past that I can't change but it has definitely affected the whole of my life
"And with Emily the same."
Claira says she decided to have the operation because it meant she didn't "have to worry" any more.
"I don't want my life to end and when I think about that it's heartbreaking because that must be the worst feeling in the world.
"You don't want to die, you're not ready to die and there's nothing you can do."
Howard says: "I don't think you ever come to terms with that [knowing you're going to die] apart from when your illness is getting so bad in the end all you want to do is relieve the pain.
"Emily was in such pain at the end and so was Jane."
