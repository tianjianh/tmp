The discovery was made by a dog walker on 17 December near West Calder but it has taken some time to establish the nature of what was found.
Further work is being carried out in an attempt to identify the person who died.
Officers said the death is being treated as unexplained and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
Det Supt Kenny Graham said: "This has been a painstaking process to recover the remains and we now await the results of scientific analysis.
"I am keen not to cause any unnecessary distress to families or anyone who is waiting for news of a missing loved one, and my officers will be in contact with the next of kin of any person who becomes relevant to the investigation.
"We will be continuing to conduct examinations with various scientific experts and specialists to establish the circumstances of the death, and so the area near West Calder will remain closed off whilst this takes place."
