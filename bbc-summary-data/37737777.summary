Gateshead 2-2 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham fought back for what had looked an unlikely point at Gateshead in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Aspin's side are now six games unbeaten, but squandered two points after goals from Sam Jones and Danny Johnson put them comfortably ahead.
But a strike from John Rooney, younger brother of Wayne, and a Hamza Bencherif header brought the Welsh side level.
Gateshead's Wes Yorke hit the post, but for new Wrexham boss, Dean Keates, it's two 2-2 draws in his first two games.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "This almost feels like a win. The lads showed everything we wanted of them to come back from 2-0 down, the passion and the drive.
"They showed character in abundance. This was an improvement again, showing the passion to get back in it, but the performance wasn't really good enough."
