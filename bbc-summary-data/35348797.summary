[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australian police have charged a boy, 17, over alleged social media threats that led to the evacuation of the Sydney Opera House last week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police evacuated the venue on Thursday and also conducted an operation at Manly ferry wharf.
Concerts at the Opera House were cancelled as the usually crowded tourist attraction was emptied out.
The surrounding ferry wharf area was searched, but "nothing of interest" was found, police said.
The boy will face court next month charged with false representation resulting in a police investigation.
The operation, which lasted about two hours, resulted in the cancellation of one ferry service between Manly and Circular Quay.
