Froome, a three-time Dauphine winner, remains one minute and nine seconds behind overall leader Thomas de Gendt of Lotto Jumbo.
Team Sky's Froome is bidding to win a fourth Dauphine title, which would be a record for the eight-day stage race.
"It was a demanding stage but I knew it could suit me," said winner Demare.
Four riders broke away up the cote de Croix Blanche before Astana's Alexey Lutsenko took the pace on himself with a brave breakaway which was only foiled three kilometres from the finish.
Norway's Alexander Kristoff (Katusha) looked in a perfect position to claim the stage but Demare (FDJ) squeezed past him to take his sixth stage win of the year.
