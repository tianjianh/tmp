Quarry plans address Ewieside hill fort concerns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to expand a Borders quarry have been approved after concerns over its impact on a nearby hill fort site were addressed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The archaeological officer at Scottish Borders Council and Historic Scotland originally opposed the extension to Glenfin Quarry near Cockburnspath.
Amendments to the Kinegar Quarries scheme have now seen them withdraw their opposition.
Planning officers had recommended approval with a string of conditions.
The proposals would increase the size of the current quarry by more than 50% to more than 34 hectares.
The site lies between the Berwick Coast Special Landscape Area (SLA) and the Lammermuir Hills SLA, however, it does not fall within either of them.
The Ewieside hill fort lies immediately to the western corner of the site.
There were concerns with original plans that the "understanding and appreciation" of the fort would be "heavily degraded".
However, those objections have now been withdrawn on condition that the site is fully restored once the quarry works are finished.
Scottish Borders Council was advised to give the scheme the green light but with 29 separate conditions attached.
Hill forts are one of the most prominent types of prehistoric monument across many parts the UK and mainly date back to the Iron Age.
