Scenes from the sci-fi universe have been painstakingly recreated with six-inch action figures.
Stuart Robertson's toy photography has attracted fans from all around the world. Now the dad-of-two, from Polmont in Falkirk, has had his work chosen to feature at Comic-Con in San Diego.
Factory worker Stuart, 43, only began his hobby two years ago.
"I started out with my son's action figures, just to give him a giggle," said Stuart.
"I'd joined Instagram and found a community of toy photographers, which inspired me to try it myself.
"I got a positive response and a friend encouraged me to take shots outdoors."
Stuart now has more than 13,000 followers on Instagram.
Beecraigs Country Park near Linlithgow is a favourite location for his work. The fir forest offers a Star Wars-style landscape similar to Endor in the film Return of the Jedi.
Stuart claims he has "no clue" about professional photography.
"I began taking photos on a compact camera," he said.
"I've only recently been given a second-hand DSLR that I'm learning how to use. I use free apps for editing and do everything on my phone.
"I have basic rules about angles and posing. I try out the pose myself, to make the composition and movement life-like."
Stuart also favours real-life atmosphere and practical effects.
He makes forest mist with a spray can of 'party smoke'. He created his Comic-Con shot with some clever lighting inside an old nappy box.
Stuart's picture was chosen from hundreds of entries by toymaker Hasbro to join the 24 on display at the San Diego convention at the weekend.
A Star Wars fan for 35 years, he says his photographs make him feel like he is a child again.
He admits it is not the most exciting hobby for his own kids, James, nine, and five-year-old Kayleigh.
"I don't take them out when I'm taking photos. It takes a wee bit of time to set up each shot and it's kind of boring to watch.
"They like seeing the finished scene though. James is my most valued critic."
Stuart says wife Lisa is also "supportive".
"She puts up with it," he said. "I think she thinks it's quietly cool.  Maybe my Comic-Con success has shown there's something to this."
