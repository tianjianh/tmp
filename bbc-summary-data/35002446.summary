[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLA Pat Ramsey has said he is stepping down from politics for health reasons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Foyle assembly member said his resignation will take effect at the end of this month.
Mr Ramsey has been an MLA since 2003 and is a former councillor in Londonderry and mayor of the city.
The 57-year-old said he had been "honoured to serve the community for over three decades" across his roles.
But he told the BBC "seven-day weeks" at Stormont have taken a toll on his health.
"My political philosophy was always simply to help people," he said.
"I strived to improve the quality of life for my neighbours, my city, and my constituents.
"I've been a passionate champion for the rights of disabled people, advocating for those disabled, their families and carers, and it is not a duty I give up lightly."
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mr Ramsey, the party's chief whip, had been an "honest and dedicated" politician.
"Pat's enormous work for people with disabilities and his unflinching dedication to helping the most vulnerable has made an indelible impact on the lives of so many," Mr Eastwood added.
"I have no doubt Pat will continue to make a significant contribution to the lives of people in Derry.
"He will remain a friend of the SDLP and we all wish him well in the time ahead."
Mr Ramsey said the party will hold a selection convention within two weeks to choose his successor.
