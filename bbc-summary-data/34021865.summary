[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who have been married for 45 years say they have been separated after immigration officials refused her visa as he began cancer treatment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Briton David Summers and his wife Maria left Canada for Hereford in 2013, but now Mrs Summer has left her husband in hospital to fly back to Canada.
The retired pair claim immigration officials said they failed to prove their love and lacked finances.
The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
The couple, who returned to Hereford to care for his mother, said they were "self-sufficient" with pensions and a mortgage-free house in Holme Lacy.
They have a son and granddaughter.
Mr Summers, 70, a Herefordshire councillor for Dinedor Hill, underwent surgery for bladder cancer on Thursday and remains in hospital.
Mrs Summers said she appealed to the authorities to be allowed to stay to care for her husband and his 95-year-old mother.
However, she said the Border Agency asked for documents to prove his ill health but Mrs Summers did not hear back before her time was up and she flew back to Canada earlier on Sunday.
"It's terrible that I can't be here for him," said Mrs Summers, a retired optician.
"First they said we could not prove we had an affectionate relationship, then they said we don't feel you have the money to support yourselves.
"But we both receive pensions from Canada, David has a salary as a councillor and I do optical consultant work."
The 67-year-old said she is "treated like a criminal" every time she enters the country.
"They take my fingerprints, they take my mugshot. It's extremely frustrating and humiliating."
Mrs Summers was born in the Netherlands and emigrated to Canada with her parents when she was 10-years-old.
Mr Summers, from Hereford, travelled to Canada when he was 18 and the pair met at a dance in 1966 and married four years later.
"To say our marriage isn't genuine after 50 years and a son together is ridiculous," said Mrs Summers.
