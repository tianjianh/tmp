The 24-year-old recently left Wrexham when his contract expired having scored 14 goals for them last season.
After starting his career in non-league football at Stalybridge Celtic, Jennings has had spells at Scunthorpe, Stockport, Macclesfield and Grimsby.
"He will offer us something different to the forward options we already have at our disposal," said boss Gary Brabin.
"Connor is technically very good, he's quick and he has plenty of experience and a good record at this level."
