Arlene Arkinson inquest: Brother tells court of family's pain over disappearance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The eldest brother of Arlene Arkinson has been giving evidence at her inquest, saying her disappearance affected every member of their family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-year old from Castlederg, County Tyrone, went missing after a school disco in County Donegal in August 1994.
At the time, she had been living with her brother, Martin Arkinson, and his wife and family in Castlederg.
He had become the schoolgirl's formal guardian because he did not want his younger sister to be taken into care.
At the inquest on Tuesday, a sometimes emotional Mr Arkinson said Arlene's death had affected every member of his family.
He told the court he had sometimes asked Arlene to stop coming in late from nights out and threatened to put her into care, but he added that he would never have actually done so.
The court heard that he considered these to be minor rows of little consequence.
Mr Arkinson said he did not believe Arlene had been pregnant at the time of her disappearance, and that from living in the same house he was sure of this.
"Absolutely not. That's what has dogged me, what the hell are they talking about?" he said.
He told the court that the morning after Arlene went to the disco in Bundoran, County Donegal he noticed she was missing.
He said checked with their other sister, Kathleen, who lived a few yards away, to see if Arlene was in her house.
He spoke to social workers a day or two later and explained that the teenager was missing.
Arlene's sister Paula took the stand and told the inquest that she always believed Robert Howard had killed her.
Paula Arkinson was five years older than her sister, and was living with her boyfriend and baby daughter in Strabane when Arlene disappeared.
Robert Howard was the main suspect in Arlene's disappearance, but was convicted of murdering another teenager in 2005.
The court heard Paula had told police: "I believed Arlene was murdered by Robert Howard.  I know for a fact, 200% certain that he had done it."
She added:  "It was the happiest day of my life when he was convicted."
Paula said she didn't believe her sister had simply left the area, describing Arlene as "a real homebird" who always kept in touch with her family.
Paula said she had never met Howard and was in Strabane when Arlene disappeared.
During her time giving evidence, she was also questioned about a phone call she had made to the police about the case at a time when she was suffering from depression and extreme stress.
Later, another of Arlene's brothers, Adrian, took the stand.
He had been living in England when his sister went missing.
The court heard a police statement where Mr Arkinson remembered returning to Castlederg, confronting Howard about his sister on two occasions more than a week after she went missing.
When asked "Where's Arlene?" Howard had said: "I never touched her."
When accused of murdering her, Howard had denied it.
