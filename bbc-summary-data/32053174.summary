Jeremy Clarkson's Top Gear contract will not be renewed after an incident with one of the show's producers, the BBC has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earlier this month, BBC bosses ordered an investigation, after Jeremy Clarkson was accused of attacking one of the other people who works on the show.
Now the BBC says that Jeremy Clarkson shouted at and then hit the man.
The boss of the BBC, Tony Hall, says that Jeremy Clarkson had to go
"I've always been a great fan of his work on Top Gear and I also believe his voice and voices like his have a place, an important place, on the BBC... but not at any price." said Lord Hall.
Many people think that the BBC was right to get rid of Jeremy Clarkson.
But lots of people support him. They say the BBC has handled the whole thing badly.
Since the whole thing happened a million people have signed a petition called "Bring Back Jeremy Clarkson".
The decision has caused a big argument.
Jeremy Clarkson is one of the most famous faces on TV in the UK and around the world .
Top Gear is shown in dozens of countries and watched worldwide by around 350 million people.
But the presenter won't be on the show again.
He should be brought back because he made Top Gear funny and it would not be the same without him.
Robert, London
I think Jeremy Clarkson should NOT be brought back because it is wrong to harm anybody in any way!
James, Blackpool
I don't think he should have been dropped because they are now thinking of stopping Top Gear!
Louis, Shropshire
I think he should get sacked because he has committed several acts that are bad.
Charlotte, Manchester
I think they made the right choice as violence is never the answer.
Olivia, London
I like Jeremy Clarkson, but he definitely did the wrong thing and should have been sacked. It's not a good example to set.
Grace, Birmingham
I have always loved the show but I would still love it even though he has gone!
Danny, Portishead
Yes and No, Jeremy does deserve to be dropped as its wrong to hit people. But the show was so funny when Jeremy was on the show.
Sophie, Surrey
I don't think he should stay on as he doesn't have a right to punch anyone. He might make it funny but it still doesn't make it right.
Farah, London
I think it is right to sack him as if you hit someone there will always be a consequence.
Thomas, Rugby
