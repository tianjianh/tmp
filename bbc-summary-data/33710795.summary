An 11-year-old boy was promoted to the role of manager for a pre-season friendly - and was an instant success.

Daniel Fryer, from Wesham, guided National League North team AFC Fylde to a 1-1 draw against Championship team Bolton Wanderers, who play four tiers above them.
A fellow Fylde supporter won the opportunity, but gave Daniel the role when he could not attend.
Daniel gave a team talk, held a press conference and made substitutions.
He also wore an initialled jacket with 'Boss' inscribed on the reverse for Wednesday night's game.
The Coasters battled to a hard-won draw after two penalties, with winger Dion Charles' spot-kick cancelling out an earlier strike from the away side.
Speaking after full time, the interim boss said: "I've got the coat, and the manager's notebook and I've really enjoyed myself.
"After this, it's really inspired me and I really want to be a footballer - even more than I did before."
The young gaffer, who is more often found working as a ball boy at the ground, had earlier hinted at his tactics before kick-off - making it clear that only 100% effort from his players would be enough.
He said: "I'll make sure to keep them high in confidence before the game.
"If they are not doing well at half-time then I will get in to them."
Dave Challinor, AFC Fylde's usual manager, said: "Dan's a massive help to the club on matchdays anyway, but he was obviously given a bit of a promotion.
"It's a great insight for him into what goes on in the dressing room and on the bench."
