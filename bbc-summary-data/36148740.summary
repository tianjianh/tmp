[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor and candidate in the upcoming police and crime commissioner elections has pleaded not guilty to 24 historical child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nottinghamshire County Councillor Jason Zadrozny, 35, denies charges including sexual activity with a child and indecent assault between 2003 and 2006.
He announced his candidacy in the PCC elections following a previous court hearing, claiming the allegations were a "politically-motivated attack".
A trial is due to start on 3 January.
The alleged victim was aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the offences.
Mr Zadrozny, of Sutton Road, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, was granted bail following the hearing at Nottingham Crown Court.
Speaking outside court he said: "I'm looking forward to my day in court because it's time people realised that people are the victim in this case.
"It does no real victims of child abuse any good. These things need to be aired properly and I'm here to prove that I'm innocent and the CPS and Notts Police have been wrong in this case."
Mr Zadrozny became the youngest council leader in England in 2007, and is currently an independent councillor on Ashfield District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council.
He stood for the Liberal Democrats in the Ashfield constituency in the 2010 general election, and was selected to fight the same seat in 2015.
However, the party suspended him after his arrest over the child sex allegations.
Five candidates are standing in the election to become Nottinghamshire's Police and Crime Commissioner. The list is available here.
