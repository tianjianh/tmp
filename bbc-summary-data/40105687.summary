Chloe Keegan, 41, of Marsden Terrace in Ramsey, failed a breath test after crashing her car into a field in Sulby on 18 April.
She was ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and was banned from driving for six years at Douglas courthouse on Tuesday.
Keegan resigned from her job with the Manx force after the incident.
Deputy High Bailiff Jayne Hughes said her actions had undermined the work of the police when it came to tackling drink-driving.
