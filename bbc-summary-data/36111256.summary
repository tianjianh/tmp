County Championship: Daniel Bell-Drummond century helps Kent recovery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent opener Daniel Bell-Drummond scored a fine century but Leicestershire took seven wickets to take control on the first day at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Opener Sean Dickson was out in bizarre fashion for a duck after handling the ball to stop it striking his wicket after he played a defensive shot.
After falling to 48-4, Bell-Drummond (124) and Adam Rouse (38) put on a century for the sixth wicket.
Wayne White (2-32) and Clint McKay (2-55) led the hosts bowling attack.
