[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United and Inverness Caledonian Thistle ended up with a point apiece in a hard-fought game at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy McKay gave the home side the lead early on but a Josh Meekings header salvaged a point for John Hughes' side.
United thought they had won the game late on but Simon Murray saw his effort ruled out for offside.
The boos rang out at the end as Jackie McNamara's men were perhaps unfortunate not to take all three points.
United's struggles continue with their winless run now stretching to six games.
The opening goal arrived early for the hosts. Darko Bodul set up Ryan McGowan down the left and his cross into the box was met by John Rankin.
His effort was blocked on the line but McKay was on hand to knock the ball into the net from close range for McKay's second goal since joining United on loan three weeks ago
It was no more than United deserved after a very strong start.
The lead should have been doubled four minutes later. Bodul was involved again along with Callum Morris who played in Rankin just eight yards out, but his shot was blocked by Owain Fon-Williams in the Inverness goal.
The visitors' keeper was again called into action, beating away a McKay drive from the edge of the 18-yard box.
Hughes' half-time team talk obviously worked as they took control after the restart.
Within the opening minute Ryan Christie was bundled to the ground just outside the box as he threatened the home goal, but no free-kick, said referee Kevin Clancy.
But the Caley pressure paid off when a corner from the right was met by Meekings who was unmarked at the back post and he thundered a header into the roof of the net.
United thought they had grabbed all three points with just four minutes left when substitute Murray knocked the ball into the net from six yards but the flag had already been raised for offside.
