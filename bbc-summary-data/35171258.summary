The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued dozens of warnings, most of them in Tayside.
People in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway have been asked to pay close attention to the weather forecast over Christmas Day into Boxing Day.
Warnings were also in place on Christmas Eve covering Strathglass and Callander.
Storm Eva is expected to bring further bad weather to areas which have already been badly affected.
A weather warning of heavy rain is in place for much of southern Scotland from 15:00 on Christmas Day through to 23:45 on Boxing Day.
Many roads across Dumfries and Galloway were affected by surface water or flooding on Christmas Eve and drivers were asked "slow down and take care".
The A76 Dumfries to Kilmarnock road near to Drumlanrig Castle was reported as "flooded but passable".
The B724 Annan to Dumfries "low road" was flooded with a road closure in place west of Cummertrees.
In Dumfries itself, the Whitesands car parks were closed due to flooding in the area.
High winds also affected the north of Scotland on Christmas Eve with gusty of 60mph to 70mph forecast and up to 80mph over the Western Isles.
Eleven out of 26 Caledonian MacBrayne routes were disrupted but the situation was improving.
