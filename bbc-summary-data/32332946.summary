[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gang of five men and a teenager who subjected underage girls to sexual abuse in Oxfordshire after grooming them have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defendants attacked seven victims, aged 13 to 15, in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury.
Oxford Crown Court heard they lured victims to parties organised on social media and were found guilty in March.
At the same court, each of the men were handed sentences of between three and nine years.
Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Glyndebourne Gardens, was sentenced to nine years imprisonment, with a further five years on licence; Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Orchard Way, was jailed for four years and nine months; Said Saleh, 20, of Orchard Way, was jailed for four years; Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Broughton Road, was sentenced to six years with a further four years on licence; and Kagiso Manase, 21, of Warwick Road, received five years.
Zsolt Szaltoni, 18, of Portway, was sentenced to three years in a young offenders institution.
Speaking after the sentencing, one of the gang's victims, who was 14 at the time, said she was attacked in a car after attending a party organised on Facebook.
"I got in the car because the others left and I was on my own and I didn't know what to do, so I just went with them," she told the BBC.
"I was in the back of the car but I was in the middle... I was just scared. I didn't know what to do, but they'd planned it beforehand.
"They would talk their language... and I didn't understand it."
The girl said, after the party, the abuse continued.
"It gradually started to become more people. He asked me if I would work for him and I said 'No' and I just laughed it off but, as I realise now, I did it without even knowing - [I did] sex work.
"I thought it was okay, because I was brainwashed. They made me think it was my decision but it wasn't."
The abuse was uncovered after a member of the Kingfisher team - a multi-agency operation tackling child exploitation in Oxfordshire - came to see the victim at school.
She said: "I know there's more girls so it's quite disappointing that they don't have the courage to come forward.
"I just think I'm so lucky because there are lots of other girls who aren't lucky."
The girl said it was her ambition to work in the Kingfisher team and help others who have been in her situation.
She said: "It's important for me to do that. It's closure isn't it?"
The verdicts were -
