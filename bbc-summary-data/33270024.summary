The Bafta-winning entertainer was one of 10 public figures chosen to be honoured by the university.
Hundreds of Dundee students are celebrating graduation this week.
Among them is Dennis Akande, who won a postgraduate scholarship at the university in an Apprentice-style radio contest in Ghana.
Mr Fletcher, who has won several Bafta awards for his CBeebies programme Something Special and was appointed an MBE in 2008, said it was "fantastic" to become a Doctor of Laws.
He said: "When I received the letter to say I was getting it, it was just wonderful. I'm very flattered indeed."
The presenter has been recognised for his work with children with communication difficulties, and bringing the sign language Makaton to a wider audience.
Honorary degrees are also being given to figures including BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor, writer Roddy Doyle, film director Bill Forsyth and graphic novelist Dave Gibbons.
Dennis Akande won the inaugural 2013 series of The Scholarship, a Ghanaian radio contest styled on the Apprentice to win a postgraduate place at the university including fees and living allowance.
Mr Akande, who has since landed a place as a community management intern in Paris, said he had built "a network of strong, lasting relationships with professors, fellow students and industry personnel" through the course.
He said: "The Scottish cultural experience has been amazing, from the ceilidh dinner and dance to the field trips of historic sites in and out of Dundee.
"I hope to use my experiences of the last year and a half to make a positive impact when I get back to Ghana."
