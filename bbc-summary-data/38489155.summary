Met Office issues ice weather warning in parts of Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice for many parts of north east, mid and south Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The warning begins at 02.00 GMT on Tuesday and ends at 10.00.
Untreated surfaces, such as pavements and some minor roads, are likely to turn "very slippery", the Met Office said.
A few freezing fog patches are also possible.
In the north, parts of Denbighshire and Wrexham will be affected.
Rhondda Cynon Taff, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Torfaen, Bridgend, Cardiff, Newport, and Vale of Glamorgan are also covered by the warning, as is Powys.
