George Best Belfast City Airport: DoE 'neutral' on seat inquiry outcome

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Department of the Environment is "neutral to the outcome" of a public inquiry into an attempt by George Best Belfast City Airport to change part of its planning agreement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The claim was made by a lawyer for the department on the inquiry's first day.
The airport wants the removal of a two million cap on the number of departure seats it can sell each year so it can pursue more direct European routes.
The lawyer said suggested replacement noise controls would be more effective.
The inquiry is being heard at the Planning Appeals Commission in Belfast.
After further days of evidence, the commission will make a recommendation to Stormont Environment Minister Mark H Durkan, who will make a final decision.
However, the hearing was told the minister is "not bound" by the recommendation.
The airport's plan is being objected to by residents' groups and Belfast International Airport.
A lawyer for Belfast International Airport claimed the "seats for sale" restriction influenced the size of aircraft that used George Best Belfast City Airport, and that there was a "correlation between size and noise".
He said there was "something very odd" that the department, as decision-maker, "was actively engaging in the debate" at the inquiry.
Residents' groups are concerned that if the restriction is lifted, it will mean a busier and noisier airport.
They are due to give evidence on Wednesday.
About 2.5 million passengers use the airport annually - a figure representing both departing and incoming travellers.
George Best Belfast City Airport is the only airport in the UK that has a limit on the number of departure seats it can sell, and it disputes claims that it would become noisier.
In 2008-2010, it was in breach of the restriction, but is now back under the cap.
Its lawyer said even if the cap was removed, the airport would continue to operate below the 48,000 aircraft movements permitted each year.
The inquiry is scheduled to run until Thursday.
