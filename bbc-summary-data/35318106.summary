London has "nothing to hide" over its successful bid to stage the 2017 World Championships, says the boss of UK Athletics.

The bid has been called into question after a damning report into IAAF governance claimed "corruption was embedded" within the organisation.
Authors of the report want police to investigate past bidding processes.
But UKA boss Ed Warner insisted: "All I know is that London's bid was completely by the book."
"We have nothing to hide and we would be delighted to spend any amount of time going through our processes with the investigators if that helps root out any miscreants," he added.
Richard McLaren, a member of the independent panel that produced the latest report on the world governing body, wants an investigation into how world championships were awarded under the regime of Lamine Diack.
The former IAAF boss, who stepped down in August last year, was accused of allegedly taking bribes to cover up positive drugs tests.
Information gathered by McLaren and the independent panel regarding the championships has already been passed on to French prosecutors.
"We don't have hard evidence, but it's enough information that we think it bears a serious investigation," he said.
McLaren, a renowned sports lawyer, added: "The process by which those decisions were made - who made them, why did they make them and why did other cities not get selected - needs to be investigated."
Asked if he would be prepared to make all emails and documents available, Warner said: "Absolutely."
He added: "It's right that these things are fair battles and the right city wins for the good of the sport and nothing more.
"There has been a very unhealthy smell at Fifa with some of football's World Cup bids and now it appears there may be some of that stench with some IAAF World Championships - and that is very unpleasant."
The report into IAAF governance was highly critical of Diack, who was in charge for 16 years.
It also said there "may be reason to believe" senior officials at the International Association of Athletics Federations and others acting on their behalf "may have benefited from decisions of the IAAF to award certain cities and countries" a world championship.
Moscow hosted the 2013 championships, followed by Beijing in 2015, with London and Doha due to stage the event in 2017 and 2019 respectively.
The decision to award the 2021 event to the American town of Eugene without the usual bidding process is already under investigation.
The report also raised questions about Tokyo's successful 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games bid.
The Japanese beat the Turkish and Spanish capitals of Istanbul and Madrid.
The report claimed that Diack allegedly dropped his support for Turkish city Istanbul after it did not pay sponsorship money of up to $5m (Â£3.5m) to the Diamond League or IAAF.
However, Japan did pay the sponsorship money, according to transcripts obtained by the independent panel.
In response to the report's claims, Hikariko Ono, spokeswoman for the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, insisted the bidding process had been fair.
She said the Games were awarded to Tokyo because the city "presented the best bid", adding: "The Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee considers that the note in the report is beyond our understanding."
Tokyo collected 60 to Istanbul's 36 in the final round of voting.
