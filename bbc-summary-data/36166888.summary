Colombia legalises gay marriage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colombia's top court has legalised same-sex marriage, making the country the fourth in Latin America to do so.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gay couples were already allowed to form civil partnerships, but Thursday's ruling extends them the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples.
Earlier this month the constitutional court dismissed a judge's petition against equal marriage rights for heterosexual and homosexual couples.
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay have previously legalised same-sex marriage.
Argentina was the first Latin American country to take the step in July 2010.
In Mexico, gay marriage is legal in the capital and in certain states.
