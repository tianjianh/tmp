Republic of Ireland assistant boss Roy Keane says he wants to return to club management - but after helping guide his country at Euro 2016.

Keane says he will discuss his future with Republic manager Martin O'Neill in the coming weeks as the duo plan the team's Euro 2016 challenge.
"I think that Martin knows I have that ambition to get back in the ring," said Keane, 44.
"I certainly want to stay on for the Euros, then we'll play it by ear."
Former Republic captain Keane has previously managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town.

Sunderland were 23rd in the Championship when Keane took charge of the club in August 2006 shortly after retiring as a player.
The Black Cats secured promotion in his first year in charge but Keane resigned in his second Premier League season at the Stadium of Light with the club in the relegation zone.
Keane's spell at Ipswich was unsuccessful and he was sacked by the Championship club in January 2011 after 20 months in charge.
Martin O'Neill's decision to appoint Keane as his Republic assistant surprised many but team's play-off second leg win over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday night ensured a Euro 2016 place after a tough qualification campaign.
"Will this get me back in the window [for a club job]? I don't know," added Keane.
"It's been everything I hoped it would be and I've been learning a lot from Martin.
"I'm not really one for networking or applying for jobs, but I'm enjoying my role here."
Keane believes the Republic can perform much better than the performance of Giovanni Trapattoni's squad at Euro 2012 when the Irish exited after losing all three of their group games.
"I'm not sure how many people would have expected us to get out of this group," added the Republic assistant.
"So if we get a tough one - which we will - in the summer, we'll have to hopefully try to surprise one or two people.
"We won't be short on hunger and desire and determination, and with the players and the manager we have, hopefully we'll give every team we play a good game."
