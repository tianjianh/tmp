Reading manager Jaap Stam has vowed to keep faith with his side's playing style as a difficult period approaches.

The Royals are fourth in the Championship, but face four of the top six sides in their next six fixtures.
Stam's side lost 1-0 to promotion rivals Huddersfield on Tuesday, ending a six-match unbeaten run, but the Dutchman remains confident.
"The players believe in the system that brought us to the point where we are now today," the 44-year-old said.
The defeat by third-placed Huddersfield left Reading eight points adrift of the automatic promotion places with 13 matches remaining.
The Royals play Brighton on Saturday, with fixtures against Newcastle, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds also scheduled over the next six weeks.
Although Reading have conceded 42 goals in the league this season - seven more than any other top-six side - Stam believes his players are fully onboard with his tactics.
He told BBC Radio Berkshire: "If we keep on doing it we can dominate the game, play well, go forward and create chances. The belief is there and there's no changing that.
"We'll keep on doing what we've been doing until the end of the season, it's given us success and points.
"At this stage you want to measure yourself against the best teams in the Championship. It would be nice, when you play them, to win those games and stay in the top six."
