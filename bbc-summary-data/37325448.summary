[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster moved into second place in League Two with a comfortable win over Newport County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers' first half dominance was rewarded by James Coppinger's superb free-kick, but Andy Williams and Tommy Rowe both missed good chances.
The pair made amends soon after the restart when they combined well for Williams to double the lead.
The introduction of Ryan Jackson and Rhys Healey added impetus to County, but the home team always had the edge.
