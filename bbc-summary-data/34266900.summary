Stephen Tillyer, 49, took the 16th Century instrument and two 19th Century bows, valued at £35,000 each, from a rail carriage on 26 January.
He also stole a teenage boy's rucksack before he got off the London to Dover train service at Folkestone West.
Tillyer received a six month and a three month jail sentence, both suspended for 12 months.
He was convicted of two counts of theft following a trial at Canterbury Crown Court in August. Both suspended sentences are to run concurrently.
British Transport Police said Tillyer, of Gloster Close, Folkestone, Kent, took the case containing the valuable viola and bows and the rucksack off the train "despite opportunities to hand both pieces of luggage into train staff".
CCTV footage released by the force shows the 49-year-old lifting the antique instrument out of the luggage rack and quickly walking off when train guard approaches him.
Tillyer was arrested two days later at Folkestone West station.
"This case should serve as a stark warning to anyone who even considers removing lost property from a train with the intention of keeping it for themselves," said Det Con Bob Gee.
"Items left behind on a train should always be handed in to train staff or a lost property office. If in doubt, leave the item for a member of staff to recover."
Tillyer was also ordered to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £3,500 in costs.
