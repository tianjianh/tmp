Prof Hugh Montgomery from University College London told BBC Radio 4's Eddie Mair that people should not be worried about Google having access to patient information.
It comes after New Scientist revealed that Google had been given access to an estimated 1.6 million NHS patient records.
Google said it had been approached by the NHS and was using the data to develop an early warning system for patients at risk of developing acute kidney injuries.
But critics have questioned why it needs the data of all patients to create such a specific app.
