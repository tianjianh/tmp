[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother who died after an emergency Caesarean section lost more than four pints of blood, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frances Cappuccini suffered a "gush of blood" several hours after giving birth to second son Giacomo at Tunbridge Wells Hospital in October 2012.
Senior registrar Dr Gabriella Gray said she twice managed to stop the bleeding but there were further complications.
Last year the hospital trust and a consultant were cleared of manslaughter.
Dr Gray told the inquest she had responded alongside two other doctors to an emergency buzzer sounded for Mrs Cappuccini.
She was informed there had been a postpartum haemorrhage, she said, which led her to observe and assess the mother of two.
After a second buzzer was sounded around 90 minutes later, Dr Gray said the decision was made to take Mrs Cappuccini back to theatre because there was "ongoing" bleeding.
She discovered blood clots and removed a 4-5cm piece of placenta still in Mrs Cappuccini's womb, the inquest heard.
The 30-year-old schoolteacher also had problems breathing, "alarming high" blood-acid levels, and high CO2 retention levels, she added.
On Tuesday Mrs Cappuccini's husband Tom told the inquest she endured a 12-hour labour after hospital staff refused an elective Caesarean section.
A locum consultant anaesthetist Errol Cornish was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust was cleared of corporate manslaughter two weeks into a trial last January.
The inquest, at Gravesend Old Town Hall, continues.
