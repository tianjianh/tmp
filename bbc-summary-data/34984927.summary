Great British Bake Off gets professional spin-off show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Great British Bake Off is getting a spin-off show where professional pastry chefs compete to prepare the best desserts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bake Off: Creme de la Creme will be presented by Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge.
Fifteen teams of professional chefs will compete to produce the most impressive miniatures and showpiece desserts.
The eight-part series will be shown on BBC Two next year.
The chefs will work in teams of three and will come from famous hotels, top restaurants and patisseries, as well as the development kitchen of a leading supermarket, the armed forces and private clubs.
Their efforts will be judged by three of the industry's most influential pastry chefs - Benoit Blin from Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons, Cherish Finden from The Langham Hotel in London and Claire Clark who has twice been named Britain's best pastry chef.
The new show is being made by the same team who produce The Great British Bake Off.
Love Productions promised tension and drama as the chefs work together to show off their skills and creativity. The winner will be the team who displays "the precision of surgeons, the knowledge of chemists and the creativity of artists".
