[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police found 60kg of cannabis, 1kg of MDMA, 61kg of amphetamine and 134kg of cannabis resin in Torfaen.
Vincent David Lowrie, of Monmouth, and Darren Lewis, of Pentwyn, Cardiff, admitted drug offences while Darren James Cohen, of Pentwyn, was convicted.
Lowrie was jailed for nine years at Cardiff Crown Court; Cohen and Lewis got two years and six months each.
Police uncovered the drugs after stopping a van loaded with cannabis in Pontypool in November 2013 which led them to a storage unit in Cwmbran.
Lowrie pleaded to guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs; Lewis admitted possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and Cohen was found guilty of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs.
Det Ch Insp Gary Phillips said: "Whilst sentencing is now complete our work continues as we look to take any assets they have gained for this criminality away from them."
