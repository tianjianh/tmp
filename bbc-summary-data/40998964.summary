The seven Premier League sides playing in Europe this season, including EFL Cup holders Manchester United, will be among the 32 clubs in the draw.
Previous draws for the competition have been beset by problems - including teams being drawn out twice and confusion around home and away ties.
The 16 fixtures will be played in the week commencing 18 September.
The English Football League apologised for an issue with the graphics that accompanied their live stream of the first-round draw - which took place in Thailand - when Charlton accidently appeared in two ties and Forest Green Rovers were listed as playing Wolves when they had been drawn against MK Dons.
Following the second-round draw, the EFL was forced to clarify which teams were playing at home in four of the ties, after mistakes during the live announcement.
An EFL spokesman said: "We understand that not everyone will agree on the timing of this week's round three draw, but in staging in this way it will give the competition both the maximum exposure in the UK, Chinese and South East Asian markets.
"This is not only an important factor for the EFL but also our new sponsors Carabao, who, like ourselves, plan to use the growing global appeal of the competition to reach new audiences."
There will be no live coverage anywhere of the draw - on television or online - but details will be released on social media.
"Once the logistics have been completed in Beijing, the UK will be waking up and the breakfast media will be able to report and get reaction on the 16 ties that will take place next month, which we feel is an interesting move away from the usual post-game evening draws," the EFL statement added.
"Our decision to go to China is part of a strategic plan to grow the EFL internationally and specifically boost profile and exposure in ASEAN markets.  A number of potentially significant meetings are being held around the draw that we envisage will deliver a benefit to all 72 clubs of the EFL."
This is the first season of a three-year naming rights deal for the EFL Cup - formerly the League Cup - with Carabao, a Thai energy drink.
