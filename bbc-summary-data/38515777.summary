Johanna Konta wins to reach last four at Shenzen Open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number one Johanna Konta continued her good start to 2017 by reaching the semi-finals of the Shenzhen Open in China.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Konta beat world number 60 Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-4 6-7 (11-13) 6-3.
Her next opponent will be another Czech, Katerina Siniakova, who beat Serbian Nina Stojanovic 6-3 6-4.
Siniakova caused a surprise in the second round by defeating second seed Simona Halep.
Konta looked in control early on against her opponent - the twin sister of world number six Karolina Pliskova - as she took the first set with a single break of serve.
Neither player could force a break point in the second set and in the resulting tie-break Konta wasted two match points before the big-serving Pliskova levelled the match on her fifth set point.
But Konta stayed firm in the final set, claiming the break and reaching the semi-final on her fifth match point.
"I am very happy to have extended my stay here," she said.
"She is one of the best servers on tour so I knew I was going to have a hard time on her service games. I was very happy I was able to get that break in the third and see it out in the end."
