[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deal signed between the Tories and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes an extra £1bn in public spending for Northern Ireland.

The "confidence and supply" agreement was signed in Downing St by DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson.
The Prime Minister sought the support of the DUP's 10 MPs after losing her majority in the general election.
The government has published full details of the agreement online.
Talks between the Conservatives and the DUP began shortly after the poll on 8 June but it took longer than expected to finalise a deal.
As well as the financial commitments, the two parties have agreed there will be no change to the pensions triple-lock or the universal winter fuel payment, that they will meet a NATO commitment of spending 2% of GDP on the armed forces, and that they will implement the Armed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Féin, the second largest party in Northern Ireland, has previously refused to support implementing the military covenant in Northern Ireland.
The Prime Minister described the deal as a "very, very good one".
In a letter outlining the terms of the deal to Conservative MPs, Mrs May said: "Northern Ireland's unique circumstances, not least the legacy of the Troubles, means that it faces specific challenges."
Her letter added that both the DUP and the Tories "agree the need for additional financial support for Northern Ireland and jointly desire that this will play a positive role in the efforts to re-establish devolved government".
Speaking outside Downing Street, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the details of the agreement would "benefit all our (Northern Ireland) people".
"They will boost the economy and invest in new infrastructure as well as investing in the future of our health and education sectors and a range of other measures," she said.

Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said it was critical that the money is "targeted at areas of need, not the parochial priorities of one political party".
He said the deal should prioritise "building the A5 and A6, using city deals to further the expansion of Magee University at Magee and bespoke investment across the north and an immediate end to regional investment disparities".
Alliance MLA Stephen Farry described the agreement as "significant" and said his party would welcomed additional resources for Northern Ireland, provided any new money was spent "wisely and strategically".
However he added: "The process around which the money and allocations have been determined has not been and open and transparent one."
The agreement has also been criticised by politicians in England, Scotland and Wales, who argue spending in Northern Ireland should be matched in other parts of the UK.
Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the Tory-DUP deal is "clearly not in the national interest" but was designed to help the prime minister "cling to power."
"The government must immediately answer two questions," Mr Corbyn said.
"Where is the money for the Tory-DUP deal coming from? And, will all parts of the UK receive the much needed additional funding that Northern Ireland will get as part of the deal?"
Money distributed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is controlled by the Barnett Formula, which dictates the allocation of funding from Westminster according to population size and what powers are devolved to each nation.
Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the Conservative-DUP deal "all but kills the idea of fair funding for all nations and regions".
"It is outrageous that the prime minister believes she can secure her own political future by throwing money at Northern Ireland whilst completely ignoring the rest of the UK," he said.
Ian Blackford, the Scottish National Party's leader at Westminster, said it was a "grubby deal" that "summed up how little the Tories care about Scotland".
The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney said the deal between the Conservative Party and the DUP was "primarily a matter for those two parties".
However, he noted that the agreement "provides for DUP support for British government legislation on Brexit" and suggested that could help Stormont negotiate a better deal when the UK leaves the EU.
"An enhanced Northern Ireland voice, articulating an agreed devolved government position, could see more effective and inclusive representation of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at Westminster," Mr Coveney said.
Northern Ireland's health service is a big winner from the DUP-Conservatives deal - it will receive about £300m that will allow the service some breathing space.
Many will argue that it is just a sticking plaster that will not go far enough to see the transformation that is required.
The UK government is to allocate £50m per year for two years to enable the executive to address immediate pressures in health and education.
While £50m may sound a lot, in practice that amount of money could be spent very quickly trying to tackle the thousands of people on hospital waiting lists
On top of that, £100m per year will be allocated for two years towards transforming the local health service - this will go someway in helping to deliver the recommendations set out in the Bengoa health review and the Department of Health's subsequent 10-year plan.
The big surprise is the money allocated to tackling mental health: £10m per year for five years.
Health professionals will welcome this additional funding in an area with a spiralling problem of its own in terms of waiting lists.
The deal will also have a major impact on ongoing talks in Northern Ireland, where parties have until 29 June to find agreement over restoring the devolved government.
Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing executive since March and without a first and deputy first minister since January.
The institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin about a botched green energy scheme.
The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, stood down in protest over the DUP's handling of an investigation into the energy scandal, in a move that triggered a snap election.
Stormont parties have been warned that if they cannot reach agreement on restoring the Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, direct rule from Westminster could follow.
Parties had raised concerns that the DUP-Tory deal could undermine devolution negotiations, arguing a government dependent on the support of the DUP could not be impartial its Northern Ireland policies.
However, Conservative MP and First Secretary of State, Damian Green, denied that the deal could put Stormont's future at risk.
He repeated a previous comment made by Mrs May that "the Conservative Party's full title has traditionally been the Conservative and Unionist Party".
"We are always unionist, we remain as unionist as we ever have been, and have been throughout the time when we've been able to deal with devolved institutions," Mr Green said.
"But what we say is that absolutely we continue to be committed to the notion of consent in Northern Ireland; it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide on their own governance structure."
In her letter to Tory MPs, Mrs May said "the Conservative Party will never be neutral in expressing its support for the union".
"As the UK government, we believe that Northern Ireland's future is best served within a stronger United Kingdom. We will always uphold the consent principle and the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland."
