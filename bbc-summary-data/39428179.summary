South Africa sealed a 1-0 series win in New Zealand after rain washed out the final day of the third Test.

The tourists - on 80-5 at the start of the day and 95 runs short of making New Zealand bat again - had faced defeat.
But New Zealand were denied the chance to seal a series-levelling victory as play was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Hamilton.
"It's a real fair assessment to say we got saved by the rain," said South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.
"New Zealand can count themselves very unlucky," he added.
South Africa won the series thanks to an eight-wicket victory in the second Test in Wellington.
