A geological study of a landslip which caused an Isle of Wight road to collapse three years ago has been given the go ahead.

The A3055 Undercliff Drive suffered landslips in February 2014 after heavy rain, creating a three-mile detour.
Isle of Wight Council leader Dave Stewart said: "The island needs to have this road open."
Works include drilling the ground to see if it would allow water build up to escape.
Mr Stewart, who has approved the feasibility study, said: "The situation cannot continue - the road needs to be back in operation.
"We have over 7,000 houses and business spread along the length of the undercliff from Ventnor to Niton but the economic damage of the closure has spread well beyond these areas with businesses as far away as the West Wight also noticing a drop in trade and tourism following the closure."
It is understood the authority will be working with Bournemouth University and an environmental consultant on the exploration works.
The landslide between Niton and St Lawrence, which happened during work to repair the road, caused eight homes to be evacuated.
In 2016 a temporary route to provide full access for local residents was put in.
