About 600,000 transactions were delayed as a result of the processing problem at the RBS group on Wednesday.
The bank said it was "extremely sorry for the inconvenience and distress that this has caused our customers".
Payments of wages, tax credits and disability living allowance were among those that went uncredited.
The problems affected customers across the RBS Group, including RBS, NatWest, Ulster Bank and private bank Coutts.
They were caused as a result of information failing to be inputted by the computer system during its overnight process on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning - a situation that RBS itself described as "unacceptable".
"If any customers are still experiencing issues, please contact our call centres or come into a branch where our staff are ready to help," the bank said in a statement.
"We will continue our work to make sure that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of this issue."
It has also promised that no customers' credit files would be affected by any missed payments that were the result of the failure.
