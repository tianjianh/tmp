Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19, from South Shields, were among 22 victims killed in the suicide bomb attack on 22 May.
In a joint statement, their families said they were "looking forward to bringing their babies home".
They added that their "hearts ached" for those who have now suffered loss.
The statement, issued through Greater Manchester Police, read: "We want to give special thanks to Greater Manchester Police, our Northumbrian Police family liaison officers and The Hilton Hotel who have shown nothing but kindness and resolve.
"To the nurses and British Red Cross we also extend our gratitude for supporting us during our darkest hours.
"The past two weeks have been a parent's worst nightmare as our children were taken from us much too soon.
"Finally after much heartache and sadness we are in a position at last to bring our babies home where they belong.
"We would at this point also like to reach out to those affected by the London terror attack, sending our love and condolences to those who have lost loved ones, our hearts are aching for your loss, may those injured have a speedy recovery."
