Mr Izzard was walking with thousands of March for Europe demonstrators along Whitehall on Saturday when his hat was taken.
The comedian gave chase in high heels and retrieved his headwear with the help of police.
David Czerwonko, 26, of Clitherow Road, Brentford, has been charged with theft.
He was bailed until 19 September when he will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court, police said.
The beret has since been taken away by police as evidence.
The comedian had addressed crowds in Parliament Square during the event.
Protests were also held in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol, calling for the UK to strengthen its ties to the continent following the Brexit vote.
