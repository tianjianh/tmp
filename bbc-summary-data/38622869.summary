Givan 'must list recipients' of £1.9m community halls fund, says SDLP leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Communities minister Paul Givan should clarify exactly who is to benefit from a £1.9m community hall grant scheme, the SDLP leader has said.

Colum Eastwood said a breakdown of recipients was "imperative", given that the scheme risked excluding sporting organisations including the GAA.
Last October, the programme was launched in an Orange Hall by Paul Givan and Arlene Foster.
The funding was £500,000, but that figure has nearly quadrupled to £1.9m.
On Friday, Mr Givan said the programme was " hugely oversubscribed" with more than 850 applications received by his department.
He confirmed that 90 organisations would be funded but there would be "many disappointed applicants".
The deputy district master of Sixmilewater Orange Lodge, William Strange, was quoted in the government press release, saying the funding was "a great boost for our hall and the local community".
On Saturday, Mr Strange told the BBC that his Orange Hall - Tildarg, near Ballyclare - would receive £24,700 under the scheme.
He said the money would be used to install new disabled access toilets, a new kitchen, a new heating system and insulation at the site which dates back to 1873.
However, the SDLP leader said his party had concerns from the time that this fund was opened.
"It seemed, at that stage, that the criteria meant that GAA clubs could not apply," he said. "We were worried that the minister was trying to look after one community rather than the whole community."
Mr Eastwood called on the communities minister to make things clear.
"He needs to publish a list of recipients of this scheme and give us an explanation as to why this scheme was allowed to go over budget in such as way.  They are actually talking about spending quadruple the amount that they wanted to spend at the beginning, so I think that is a very serious issue for the minister to address."
When it was originally launched, Mrs Foster said the money would be used to improve halls that were in disrepair or had been damaged - with priority given to those targeted in attacks or by anti-social behaviour.
The Irish News reported on Saturday that a full list of the fund's successful applicants had not been released, despite repeated requests from the newspaper.
At Christmas, Mr Givan cut funds to a scheme offering Irish language scholarships to young people.  Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said the £50,000 cut was part of the reason for his resignation as deputy first minister.
Last week, Mr Givan said he had identified the "identified the necessary funding to advance" the Líofa Gaeltacht Bursary Scheme. He also claimed his original decision was not "political".
However, the SDLP leader said on Saturday: "He appears to be a minister for half of the community, he has not done much to illustrate that he is a minister for everyone."
