Duckett, 21, is in England's winter tour squad to Bangladesh after scoring 1,338 Championship runs this summer.
Chris Woakes was named England Test Player of the Summer and Tammy Beaumont was voted Women's Player of the Summer.
Duckett said the awards are "probably the highlight of my summer".
He added: "I got my England call-ups and so many other things have happened. If someone had said at the start of the season that all this would happen I wouldn't have believed it.
"What makes the PCA awards so special is that you are voted for by your peers. People who you play against vote for you and that means a lot to me. I can't keep the smile off my face. I wasn't expecting this."
Beaumont scored centuries in her three England one-day internationals against Pakistan and helped Kent complete a Championship and T20 double.
She beat Natalie Sciver and Lauren Winfield to the award, voted for by her fellow England players.
"It's been a bit of a breakthrough summer for me. I hadn't really cemented my place before so to have a season like that was unbelievable," Beaumont said.
