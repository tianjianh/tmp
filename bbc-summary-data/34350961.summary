[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Programme-makers are working hard to ensure north Wales is "centre stage" in BBC Wales' output, according to its head, Rhodri Talfan Davies.

The BBC Wales director said a TV series in June, called Real North Wales, attracted 1.3m viewers and has become one of the broadcaster's most popular seasons of programmes in recent years.
He is giving a speech to members of North Wales Business Club in Llandudno.
This year marks 80 years since BBC Wales began broadcasting in the region.
He will tell the audience at St George's Hotel: "The goal we have set ourselves is simply stated: to reflect Wales as it really is. Unvarnished and diverse. Not the Wales of our imagination or a rose-tinted past - but the Wales of today.
"I'm only too aware that many people in north Wales think that BBC Wales can be too focused on the south.
"So let me reassure you that we have more than 100 talented journalists and programme-makers right across north Wales working hard to ensure the lives and passions of the region are centre stage.
"And I hope the ambition and the success of the Real North Wales season is seen as a clear statement of intent."
In his speech, Mr Davies will also warn that too much of the current debate about the future of the BBC - part of the UK government's review of the corporation's Royal Charter - ignores the voice of the public.
"Far too much of the newspaper coverage I read is based on the assumption that support for the BBC, the licence fee and for other forms of public service broadcasting, is in decline," he said.
"It isn't. Public support is strong and getting stronger. The public don't think we're perfect - and they're right - but they know we're on their side.
"More than that. The assumption that, as choice expanded, the argument for public broadcasting in Wales and Britain would progressively diminish, has turned out to be false."
