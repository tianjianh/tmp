Rover was eight weeks old when he was washed into a garden in Portreath, Cornwall, in February,
The garden is several hundred feet from the nearest beach and the pup was found disorientated on the lawn.
Rover, who had cuts and bruises to his lips, chin and flippers, will be released at the beginning of June.
The pup was taken to The Cornish Seal Sanctuary, which is based in Gweek.
It said it did not know how Rover ended up in the garden but presumed he was trying to get away from the high tides and big waves.
"He was a good healthy weight, but had taken a bit of battering from being tossed around by the heavy seas," said Tamara Cooper, from the sanctuary.
"Staff learned to be extra careful when cleaning up near Rover, as he was completely fearless and apt to try and take a bite out of anyone getting too close."
Rover spent 10 days in the sanctuary's indoor hospital. He now weighs 66lb (30kg) and is healthy enough to return to the wild.
