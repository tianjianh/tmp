Pauline Cafferkey, 40, was admitted to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after being taken from her home in South Lanarkshire at 09:30.
She is undergoing routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Team and remains in a stable condition.
Ms Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working as part of a UK team in Sierra Leone in 2014.
A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: "Ms Cafferkey was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital under routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Team.
"She is undergoing further investigations and her condition remains stable."
Paramedics arrived at the nurse's flat in Halfway, Cambuslang, on Thursday morning.
Residents told the BBC that an ambulance, escorted by police cars left the flats on Lightburn Road, at about 09:30.
Police confirmed that officers had "assisted in the transfer of a patient" on Thursday morning.
Following news that Ms Cafferkey had been admitted to hospital, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "Sending my very best wishes to Pauline Cafferkey. She has already suffered way too much - & all for trying to help others. Thoughts with her."
Ms Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working as part of a UK team at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.
She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free hospital in London at the beginning of 2015 after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.
Ms Cafferkey was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, and in March 2015 returned to work as a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.
But it was later discovered that the virus was still present in her body, and she was readmitted to the same London hospital in October 2015.
She again recovered, before being treated at the Royal Free for a third time in February of this year due to a further complication related to her initial Ebola infection.
More recently, the nurse faced a number of misconduct charges by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).
These were for allegedly allowing a wrong temperature to be recorded during the screening process at Heathrow on her arrival back in the UK from Sierra Leone in 2014.
The NMC's conduct and competence panel dismissed all charges at a hearing in Edinburgh last month after being told that Ms Cafferkey's judgement had been impaired by illness.
