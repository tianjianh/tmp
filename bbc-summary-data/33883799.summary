[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Mankelow was found with severe head injuries under a railway arch in Swinegate on 25 April. He was taken to hospital but died the following day.
The 20-year-old, from Tonbridge in Kent, was studying at the University of Leeds.
Richard  Danter, 31, of Queen's Road in Leeds, admitted murder at Leeds Crown Court and will be sentenced on 21 August.
Prosecutors said the pair met at the city's Viaduct Club and were seen dancing and socialising.
They left the club together at 02:55 and headed towards the Dark Arches area of the city, where Danter attacked Mr Mankelow and then tried to conceal his body.
The victim was found unconscious a short time later by a member of the public.
Robin Allen, from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: "Like many people up and down the country, Billy Mankelow had finished work and had gone out on a Friday night to socialise with some friends.
"However, he had the misfortune of meeting Richard Danter, who had a history of violence [and] carried out a violent and unprovoked attack on the victim."
