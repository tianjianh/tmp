A Tube driver saw a woman being dragged along the platform by a train and fall down the gap, it has emerged.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is reviewing London Underground safety procedures after the woman fell under a train leaving Clapham South station.
She snagged her coat in the train doors and was dragged a short distance along the platform at rush hour on 12 March.
She became detached from the coat and fell into a gap between the train and the platform, hurting her head and arm.
The investigation will specifically review London Underground's (LU) safety arrangements for the safe dispatch of trains from its stations and the risk posed by items potentially becoming trapped in train doors.
At about 08:00 GMT a member of staff on the platform signalled for the train driver to begin closing the doors, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said.
Because of an obstruction, one set of doors was unable to close properly and all the doors reopened.
The RAIB said the woman stepped out of the crowded carriage, intending to catch the next train, but as the doors shut again her coat became trapped, unbeknown to the driver who began to drive the train into the tunnel.
Checking the live platform-view camera in his cab, the driver saw "passengers stepping aside and a person moving with the train", it said.
He quickly applied the brakes but the train travelled about 60m (196ft) in total before it came to a halt.
"Before the train came to a stop, the passenger fell to the ground, off the platform edge and into the gap between the fourth and fifth carriages, having become separated from her coat," the RAIB said.
