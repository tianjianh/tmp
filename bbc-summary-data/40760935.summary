[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conor McAleny introduced himself to Fleetwood in style with both goals in a 2-0 League One win over Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker, who joined from Everton over the summer, scored in each half to leave the Millers in no doubt how tough their life will be following relegation from the Championship.
Fleetwood gained control in the 16th minute as McAleny opened his account when he nipped in front of his marker and turned home Bobby Grant's cross.
There should have been a comfortable cushion at the half-time break but Jordy Hiwula hit the post when racing clean through on goal and then Grant blazed over from a good position.
Rotherham started the second half brightly as they tried to force a way back into the game, but McAleny's second goal killed them off.
With their first threat of the half, McAleny cut in from the left and fired a low shot that beat Millers goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell at his near post.
