Northern Irishman Stephen Lynd, 36, and West Yorkshire rider Gavin Lupton, 37, are in a critical condition.
Lynd crashed in Wednesday's Dundrod 150 practice and Lupton was injured during the challenge race on Thursday.
Hodson, 35, died after a crash in the Dundrod 150, which is part of the Ulster Grand Prix bikes week.
Thursday's second serious crash involving Lupton led to the remaining scheduled Dundrod 150 races being abandoned as the roads were closed to allow to allow for a police investigation.
Hodson died after the incident at the Joey's Windmill section of the Northern Ireland circuit.
Brother Rob was involved in the crash but was not seriously hurt.
The national race was immediately red-flagged and the Hodson brothers were taken to hospital after being treated at the scene.
Jamie Hodson's death was announced shortly after 22:00 BST.
An experienced rider, he was the reigning Manx GP Supertwins champion, and this year achieved a top-10 finish in the Isle of Man TT Lightweight race.
The Dundrod and District Motorcycle Club, the organisers of the meeting, offered their sincere condolences to the Hodson family and friends and asked for their privacy to be respected.
Thursday's Dundrod 150 meeting was part of the Ulster Grand Prix meeting which concludes with Saturday's main day of racing at the circuit.
