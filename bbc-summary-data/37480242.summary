[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 0-4 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers went to the top of the National League with a thumping win at Aldershot, who played most of the match with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shots had been unbeaten in eight matches to climb into the top six but were blown away in the first half by Mark Cooper's side, who move above Dagenham & Redbridge after their defeat at Torquay.
Frenchman Fabien Robert put the visitors ahead after just five minutes with his first goal since joining Rovers from Swindon
And only three minutes later forward Kieffer Moore doubled the advantage following a swift counter-attack.
Aldershot saw defender Will Evans dismissed on 17 minutes following an off-the-ball clash with Rhys Murphy and Robert struck again with a fine individual effort on 27 minutes.
Moore made it 4-0 in first-half stoppage time and that was the end of the scoring against a side who showed commendable spirit after the interval.
