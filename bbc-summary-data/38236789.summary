Bonnyrigg Rose: Four things you might not know about the Rosey Posey

They did it; they actually did it.

East Super League junior outfit Bonnyrigg Rose were the thorn in Dumbarton's side on Tuesday, winning 1-0 in a Scottish Cup third round replay.
It's only gone and set up a fourth-round tie against cup holders and local rivals Hibernian.
The Rosey Posey hope the tie can be moved to Tynecastle, but in the meantime here are four things you might not know about the Midlothian club.
Bonnyrigg Rose list former James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery as one of their former players.
The Edinburgh-born actor, now 86, spent a couple of seasons with the Midlothian club in the early 1950s when he was in his twenties.
Turning to a life on screen seemed to be a sensible choice, though, because Connery is not remembered for lighting up junior football stadiums across the central belt of Scotland.
But there was one reference in the Dalkeith Advertiser from 1951 that described him scoring "with a 30-yard shot in a 3-1 defeat by Broxburn Athletic".
Other notable former players include Pat Stanton (Hibs) and John White (Tottenham).
Hearts through and through, you can understand why Rosey Posey boss Robbie Horn is desperate to get their fourth round tie against Hibs staged at Tynecastle.
Horn is 39 now but was on Hearts' books as a young footballer. A centre-half, he struggled to break through with the Jam Tarts but did manage six Scotland Under-21 caps and a run-out at Craig Levein's testimonial.
Horn went on to play for Forfar Athletic and Berwick Rangers, where he was later assistant manager.
The Rose's New Dundas Park plays a vital role in the community and amongst other things, gives a base to Bonnyrigg Homing Society.
Pigeons come and pigeons go, especially on Saturday mornings before a match later in the afternoon.
But Rosey Posey club secretary Robert Dickson talks fondly of their feathered friends, insisting the players and fans are happy to share the stadium with a few extra "wingers".
As always with junior or part-time teams, there are a wide range of day jobs among the Bonnyrigg Rose squad.
Their goal hero against Dumbarton, Adam Nelson, is a custody officer.
Star striker Keiran McGachie is a leisure centre manager.
Right-back Alan Horne is a laboratory technician.
Centre-back Dean Hoskins is a steel fabricator.
And goalkeeper Michael Andrews is a media sales executive.
