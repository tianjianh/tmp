A teenager has been charged with a hacking attack on Mumsnet, which caused the parenting site to reset its 7.7 million members' passwords.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Buchanan, 18, of Haslemere, Surrey, faces two counts of hacking and one of impairing the operation of or hindering access to a computer.
The charges relate to "computer intrusion and damage to network profiles" in July and August 2015.
Mr Buchanan is expected to appear at Guildford Magistrates' Court on 7 June.
The Mumsnet homepage was redirected to a now suspended Twitter profile page and had some posts edited during a cyber attack in August.
It was also subjected to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where an attempt is made to force a site offline by swamping it with internet traffic.
The Metropolitan Police said two 17-year-old boys who were were interviewed under caution in relation to the incidents had been eliminated from the inquiry.
Mumsnet users were made to reset their passwords as a "precautionary measure" following the attacks.
