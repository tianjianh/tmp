Gloucester's 'ugly' buildings cover-up plan revised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to cover up Gloucester's "ugly" buildings under canvas or cladding have been revised by the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Â£150,000 scheme to hide the city's "visually uninteresting" buildings ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, was approved by councillors in June.
But council leader Paul James said some of the proposed designs had to be dropped as "they couldn't be achieved within the budget".
A final decision on the designs is expected in the coming weeks.
The council is looking at two main sites - Kings Walk shopping centre and the link bridge over Eastgate Street.
With funding from the city centre investment fund, Kings Walk will be concealed behind timber effect cladding and the link bridge behind mirrored stainless steel.
"The designs we'd put forward before some of them have stayed in, others have come out because they couldn't be achieved within the budget," said Mr James.
"But we hope the new designs will be a nice touch for our visitors and be appreciated by Gloucester residents."
Four world cup matches will be played at Gloucester's Kingsholm stadium.
The council hopes re-cladding work will begin next spring, subject to planning permission.
