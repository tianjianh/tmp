Hibernian: Stokes has not produced the goods for Hibs - McManus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anthony Stokes has failed to produce the goods during his loan spell at Hibernian, according to former Easter Road striker Tam McManus.

Stokes arrived on loan from Celtic in January and has scored two goals in 11 appearances, with his partnership with Jason Cummings failing to fire.
"You've got Anthony Stokes and all the hoo-ha with bringing him in and he's just not produced," McManus said.
"I don't think Stokes' attitude at times has been great."
Allied to the Irishman's struggles in front of goal - he has failed to find the net in his past seven matches - strike partner Cummings is also in the midst of a dip in form.
He has contributed 20 goals in all competitions for Hibs this season, but just one of those has come in his last six matches, and McManus believes manager Alan Stubbs will dispense with the striking partnership.
"The Stokes - Cummings partnership for me, it just doesn't work," McManus told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"You've got two guys who want to sit in the box and play. It's like a Kris Boyd and an Ally McCoist kind of partnership. Both of them want to sit in the box, get the glory and score goals. You've got to have a mix and a blend and Hibs have not got that at the minute.
"I think you'll see the end of that partnership. I don't think that's worked at all."
McManus thinks Stubbs may try to bring Stokes back into form by pairing him with a new strike partner.
"You've got Chris Dagnall there who could come in and play. You've got James Keatings who could come in and play.
"Maybe if you play him beside somebody else who is going to run wide and do all his running for him, you get Anthony Stokes in the box more and create more chances.
"I would maybe go and play Stokes and Keatings or Stokes and Dagnall and give Cummings a little rest. Sit him on the bench and bring him back in in a couple of games time."
