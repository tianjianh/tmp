Mexico and Canada seek $3bn in US sanctions over meat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mexico and Canada have called a meeting with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to request the right to impose sanctions on the US, worth $3bn (Â£2bn).

The move is in retaliation to US meat-labelling rules, which the two countries say discriminate against them.
The WTO has already upheld a ruling in favour of Canada and Mexico, saying the rules treated them less favourably.
The US said it would object to the measures being imposed.
"The amended COOL [country of origin labelling] measure, which causes Canadian and Mexican livestock and meat to be segregated from those of US origin, is damaging to North America's supply chain and is harmful to producers and processors in all three countries," a joint statement from Canada and Mexico said.
It described the measure as "blatantly protectionist" and said Canada would be requesting authorisation to impose $2.4bn worth in retaliatory measures against the US while Mexico was looking to impose $653m.
"The governments of Mexico and Canada will keep working closely to resolve this important commercial dispute with the United States, with an aim to defend our farmers and breeders and maintain jobs and economic prosperity in all of North America," the statement concluded.
In response, a spokesperson for the US Trade Representative said: "It is notable that neither Canada nor Mexico provided any justification for the numbers they asserted."
However, sources suggest that US lawmakers may yet repeal the COOL law.
The WTO meeting is scheduled to take place on 17 June.
The dispute dates back to December 2008 when Canada and Mexico first objected to requirements that retailers in the US provide details on where the meat was born, raised and slaughtered. They say it unfairly makes their products more expensive.
