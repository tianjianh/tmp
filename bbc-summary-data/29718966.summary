The man, identified as Robert Kelvin Ellis, 60, was found with his hands tied in a ditch near a paddy field between the towns of Ubud and Kuta.
Indonesian police told the BBC Mr Ellis's wife had confessed to having "ordered the killing".
The BBC understands that Mr Ellis had been living in Bali for some time.
Officers said he had been living in the Sanur area, on the island's south coast. His wife had recently reported him missing.
A BBC correspondent in Indonesia, Alice Budisatrijo, said police had told her that Mr Ellis's wife had confessed during later questioning.
A man suspected to have carried out the murder has been arrested and police are understood to be looking for four others.
Detective Wisnu Wardana said Mr Ellis's body had been wrapped in a plastic sheet and a blanket. It was found by villagers.
Ida Bagus Putu Alit, head of forensics at Bali's Sanglah Hospital, told the AFP news agency the man suffered "three gashes on the neck" caused by a "sharp weapon".
A spokesman at the British embassy in Jakarta said: "We were notified of the death of a British national in Bali.
"We stand ready to provide consular assistance."
