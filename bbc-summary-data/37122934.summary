Jason Davidson: Huddersfield Town defender joins FC Groningen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town defender Jason Davidson has joined Dutch side FC Groningen on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Australia international Davidson joined the Terriers on a three-year contract in June 2015 following his release by West Bromwich Albion.
The 25-year-old made 30 appearances last season, but has not featured for David Wagner's side so far this term.
"He is obviously keen to play regular football and that is not something we can offer," head coach Wagner said.
