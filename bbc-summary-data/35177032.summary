Amir, 23, was jailed for his part in a spot-fixing scam during the 2010 Test series in England and banned from cricket for five years, but returned to domestic action in September.
"Hafeez and I can't accept Amir's presence in the camp," Azhar said.
Pakistan play three ODIs and three T20s in New Zealand in January.
Hafeez, a former captain in the T20 format, has previously said he "can't share the dressing room with someone who hurt my country's integrity".
He is understood to have told head coach Waqar Younis he will not attend any part of the camp at which Amir is present.
The Pakistan Cricket Board said it was attempting to convince Azhar and Hafeez to reconsider their stance.
Amir, then 18, pleaded guilty to bowling no-balls at pre-arranged times during Pakistan's fourth Test against England at Lord's in 2010.
He served half of a six-month jail term, while team-mates Mohammad Asif and captain Salman Butt served six and seven months respectively.
Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott said Amir, Asif and Butt should be "given a second chance".
Speaking to pakpassion.net, the 75-year-old said: "Give them a proper chance, get fit, play well and if they are still good enough then give them a chance in the Pakistan team.
"Nobody should hold anything against, or favour, any of the three in any way."
