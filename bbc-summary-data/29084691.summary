"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales," he said.
Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked "remarkably well".
He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together.
More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK.
Mr Crabb said: "We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that.
"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales.  I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that.
"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment.
"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan."
The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor.
US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its "extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality."
Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event.
First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and "tolerance of some inevitable disruption".
"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales," he said.
"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality of our country and saying he would encourage people from the United States to visit here.
"The next step is to ensure we keep this momentum going."
Cardiff council promised that security barriers in the centre of the city would be taken down by Sunday afternoon.
As part of the promotional push at the summit, world leaders were presented with willow baskets filled with gifts from Wales.
A note from Prime Minister David Cameron said: "I hope you will enjoy each of these gifts and be inspired by them to find out about all that Wales has to offer."
The basket included:
