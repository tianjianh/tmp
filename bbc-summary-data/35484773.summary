Nigh Tube: RMT union to recommend pay deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Rail, Maritime and Transport union will recommend its members accept a pay and conditions deal for the Night Tube service, its executive has decided.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The acceptance of the deal by unions will clear a big hurdle for the service which was due to begin last September.
The RMT's 10,000 members will start voting on 11 February.
The Night Tube service will take place on five lines - Jubilee, Victoria, Central, Northern and Piccadilly lines - on Fridays and Saturdays.

The proposed agreement includes a 2% pay rise in year one, RPI inflation or 1% (whichever is greater) in years two and three, and RPI plus 0.25% or 1% (whichever is greater) in year four, plus a Â£500 bonus for staff on lines where the night Tube will run.
But three other unions are still to decide on whether they accept the offer.
BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards said the RMT executive's move was a "big step forward".
The train drivers' union Aslef and TSSA, which represents station staff, are yet to decide, although Aslef is said to be "looking like they will also accept".
But Unite, which represents engineering staff, has turned down the offer and wants further talks, Tom Edwards said.
The RMT union is still in talks with London Underground over a planned strike this weekend over the issue of job losses.
