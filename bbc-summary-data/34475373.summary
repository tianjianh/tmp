Jamie Reynolds: Sex fantasy led to Georgia Williams murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Georgia Williams was not Jamie Reynolds' first intended victim but she was the one to pay the ultimate price when he turned his morbid sexual fantasies into a reality.

He murdered the trusting Telford 17-year-old to fulfil his long-standing desire to hang a girl and sexually assault her body, the judge jailing him for a whole-life term said.
It was that same desire he focused on Jadine Dunning, who says she feels lucky to be alive after Reynolds doctored school photographs of her to look like she had been hanged.
"I won't get those images out of my head now," said Jadine, who is best friends with Georgia's elder sister Scarlett.
"He had put a red noose around the neck, bulging eyes, bright lipstick on the lips.
"I was stunned. I could not believe it. I was disgusted. I didn't know how I felt. I froze really.
"I just keep thinking what if it was me, what if he had killed me."
She said: "I knew him for five years. He was in my class. He was always a little bit odd but you would never have imagined anything like this.
"He was quite quiet, quite reserved. He kept himself to himself.
"I think what he's done stemmed from a very early age. I know he was torturing neighbours' pets."
Reynolds, 23, from Wellington in Telford, Shropshire, harboured a fascination for hanging, strangulation and necrophilia from at least the age of 15, a court heard.
By the time he was 22, having amassed 16,800 images and 72 videos of sexual violence, he had progressed to murder.
He had written 40 stories about fatal attacks on girls he knew and he had drawn nooses onto copies of their Facebook photos.
Consultant psychiatrist Dr Katina Anagnostakis, who assessed Reynolds after his murder arrest, described him as experiencing recurrent intense sexual fantasies involving violent sadism.
She said he had a propensity to access such material through the internet, by writing stories and by seeking to enact them.
Reynolds had previously told therapists he found images of strangulation arousing and had experimented with asphyxiation using a plastic bag, a report said.
Had Georgia's parents had any inkling of Reynolds' dangerous desires they would never have let their daughter go to his house. But they were completely in the dark.
Her mother Lynnette Williams, said: "It didn't worry me it was Jamie Reynolds because Jamie had been down here before.
"We knew him, we had known him for quite a few years.
"He was in a social circle of friends so it wasn't anything we were alarmed about.
"We knew he lived just up the road in a house similar to ours, so it was all okay as far as we were awareâ€¦. She left here at 19:55 BST. We know at 20:20 BST she was dead."
Reynolds had tricked Georgia into going to his house for an artistic photoshoot involving a simulation hanging, by writing to her on social media, the court heard.
He said: "You would be standing on a box. I would edit that out on the computer so it would look like you were floating."
But he had written a story entitled: "Georgia Williams in Surprise" which detailed exactly what he intended to do.
Photographs found on Reynolds' hard drive show the last pictures of Georgia alive, smiling and posing with a red rope around her neck.
The next series of photographs show her dead.
Reynolds became one of the youngest in British criminal history to be sentenced to a whole life term in prison.
But Georgia's family say they have been given a life sentence of heartbreak, pain and torment without her.
