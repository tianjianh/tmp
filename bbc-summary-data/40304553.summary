Evans, 27, retired against Germany's Dustin Brown in the recent Surbiton Trophy with a calf injury, missing this week's Nottingham Open as a result.
Argentina's Del Potro, 28, is still struggling with the groin problem that hampered him at the French Open.
It is not known if they will be fit for Wimbledon, which starts on 3 July.
World number one Andy Murray heads the field at Queen's, aiming for a record sixth title.
Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka and 2016 Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic are also playing in the west London event.
However, French Open winner Rafa Nadal has also pulled out of the tournament after being advised to rest by his doctor.
Following the withdrawals of Evans and Del Potro, Britain's James Ward has been given a wild card as he continues his comeback from a knee injury.
The 30-year-old, who was a semi-finalist at Queen's in 2011, has only played once on the ATP tour this year - losing to Evans at Surbiton - and is currently ranked outside the top 1,000.
BBC Sport will provide the usual comprehensive live coverage on BBC One, BBC Two, Red Button, Connected TV and online daily throughout the competition.
