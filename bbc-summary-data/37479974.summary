[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 4-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second-half hat-trick from the in-form Akwasi Asante gave Solihull Moors back-to-back wins for the first time this season as they brushed aside Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a dominant first half, Asante gave Solihull the lead five minutes after the break, scrambling home after a long throw by Connor Franklin.
It was 2-0 on 70 minutes, when Omari Sterling-James' tame shot from the right-hand side somehow found its way past Magnus Norman after the winger linked up with Jamey Osbourne.
Asante, who also scored a hat-trick against Maidstone on Saturday, wrapped up the points with two goals in the last 20 minutes.
First he latched onto Ryan Beswick's pass to finish well before completing the rout eight minutes from time after peeling away from the Southport backline.
