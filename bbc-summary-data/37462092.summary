Twaddell Agreement: Reaction from across Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leading figures from Northern Ireland have been reacting to news that an agreement has been reached to end a long-running dispute at Twaddell Avenue in north Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"I said at the start of the summer that we all have a responsibility to show leadership and to continue to seek resolutions to contentious issues through discussion and to ensure any difficulties are identified and resolved peacefully.  By doing so, we become stronger as a community and a country.
"I thank all those involved. We want to build a future that is respectful, inclusive and vibrant.  Northern Ireland can have a very bright future built on respect and celebration of diversity."
"I commend the representatives of the Orange Order and Cara for their efforts in negotiating a solution.
"This is a clear demonstration that local dialogue can work, and offers up the best chance of resolving disputes like this."
"I want to pay tribute to the facilitators and all those involved for their tireless efforts to achieve this important agreement to resolve the Twaddell parades dispute and thank them for all their work on making this agreement possible. I look forward to seeing this new agreement implemented and an end to the protest.
"I also wish to take this opportunity to thank the chief constable and his officers who were at the frontline, policing this situation over the course of the last three years, for their impartial and impeccable support to protect the entire community at the Twaddell interface."
"From what I am hearing, it looks as if it is a fair and balanced agreement. It is very close to what was nearly agreed in 2012.
"I think it is the sort of thing that could stick and could see it through."
"Expressions of place and identity can be very emotive and challenging.
"I wish to pay tribute to those in the Orange Order and among local residents for their leadership and courage in achieving this agreement. I look forward to its full implementation in good faith and good neighbourliness."
"I want to commend the work of the mediators, Rev Harold Good and Jim Roddy, and the leadership of those local lodges and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association who have made this agreement possible.
I also want to thank everyone else who was involved in this process and in particular local Sinn FÃ©in elected representatives who provided support for the residents and leadership in the community.
This progress is evidence that through dialogue and co-operation, and a willingness to resolve difficult disputes, that it is possible to reach agreement."
"It is important to recognise that the completely voluntary nature of this deal between Cara and the Orange Order is a source of genuine anxiety and real concern for the people of Ardoyne, given all of the previous actions of the Orange Order and the behaviour of local lodges, bands and supporters, particularly over the last three years.
"These concerns were strongly expressed by the residents who attended the public meeting where this deal was revealed.
"While this deal can be welcomed now, previous experience over many years warrants an air of caution. The success of this deal can only be judged in the long term."
"I congratulate the representatives of the two sides on reaching an agreement and thank the mediators for their good work, despite the disappointments of the past summer.
"I look forward to seeing the full details of the deal being published and most importantly, put into action."
"While the camp at Twaddell may have offered a focal point for justified frustration and anger in the early days of the impasse, it had become an expensive and ineffective initiative.
"I hope the parade will now be allowed to pass peacefully and respectfully."
"The Police Service welcomes the news of a local agreement in relation to the challenges surrounding parades and protests at Twaddell/Crumlin Road in north Belfast.
"I and my officers look forward to stepping back from the significant policing operation that has been ongoing for some time.
"We will continue to work with all communities to secure a long-term resolution of the issues surrounding parades and protests in Belfast."
"I welcome the agreement that has been reached between the lodges and residents of Twaddell Avenue after three years of dispute, and pray that it might now find peaceful resolution as we look forward to the future.
"For all concerned this has been a long-running and seemingly intractable situation. For this reason I give thanks for the dedication, patience and persistence of all involved in bringing these negotiations to a resolution.
"What will now be important, as we move forward, is for equal energy and persistence to be given to strengthening community relationships across the whole community."
"I welcome this announcement that brings to an end the protracted impasse at Ardoyne and which, hopefully, sees to an end the inter-community strife.
"I note that one of the practical out workings of this agreement will be the ability of the Ligoniel Orange Lodges to complete their July 2013 return parade on October 1st."
"We welcome news that both sides involved in this long-running dispute have reached agreement.
"We would like to pay tribute to all those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to bring this situation to a peaceful conclusion, allowing this area of north Belfast to continue on its journey of reconciliation.
"We continue to pray for all those who strive towards peace and a shared future in the area."
"This will immediately release the officers deployed in connection with that protest to be utilised in front-line duties in the communities they were extracted from.
"It will also help to take some of the pressure off those frontline officers who, on a daily basis, are struggling to meet demand. We obviously commend all those who played a part in making this resolution possible."
"The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, meeting in County Leitrim on Saturday, welcomed the news that an agreement has been reached by the Ligoniel lodges and bands in respect of completing their 2013 Twelfth of July parade.
"The Grand Lodge supports local solutions for local situations.
"However, we are mindful that there are other parts of Northern Ireland where no resolutions have as yet been found regarding parades and brethren continue to protest. They too have our full support."
