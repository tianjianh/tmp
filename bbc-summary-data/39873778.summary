[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The University of Manchester's decision to cut 171 posts is due to "new government legislation and Brexit", a union has claimed.

The university says the job losses have to happen for it to be a world-leading institution and will offer voluntary severance wherever possible.
But the University and College Union (UCU) said the university was in "a strong financial position".
Academics and support staff are both under threat.
A university spokesman said cuts would be made to staff in the biology, medicine, health, business and humanities departments.
He said it was hoped compulsory redundancies would be avoided, and the organisation wanted to "improve the quality of our research and student experience in some areas and ensure financial sustainability".
"We have detailed plans for significant growth in funds from a range of activities, but we will also need to make cost savings," he added.
UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said the university had blamed the cuts on financial instability caused by "recent government policy changes and Brexit as an excuse to make short-term cuts that will cause long-term damage".
The UCU said the university's financial statement for the year ending July 2016 revealed it had reserves totalling Â£1.5bn.
More than 12,000 people work at the university, including almost 7,000 academic and research staff.
Union members are to meet on Friday to hold talks about the proposed cuts.
