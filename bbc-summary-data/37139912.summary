[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley responded to the departure of manager Mark Bower with another drab showing as they lost heavily at home to Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a goalless first half, the floodgates opened as Blair Turgott foraged forward for the Ravens and smashed an unstoppable shot past Daniel Atkinson in the 51st minute.
Three minutes later, Louis Dennis doubled the lead from the penalty spot after a foul by the goalkeeper.
Max Porter struck in left footed to put affairs beyond a forlorn Guiseley in the 71st minute, although Adam Smith did restore some cheer for the Lions with a late, deflected volley.
Substitute Bradley Goldberg, however, completed the rout for the away side, curling in after a fine solo run.
