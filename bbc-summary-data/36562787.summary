More than 13m people used the Speaking Clock in its first year from 24 July 1936 and even now it enjoys about 12m calls a year.
Speaking Clock No 1 and No 2 can be seen at the British Horological Institute in Upton Hall in Nottinghamshire.
Sara Mendes da Costa, the fourth voice of the clock, will also be at the show.
Dudley Giles, chief executive of the BHI, said: "The Speaking Clock is a Great British institution. [The first clock] was in service on 24 July, 1936 and it remained in service for 27 years.
"It was then replaced with the next generation which used quartz technology and the voice of Pat Simmons."

Ethel Cain was selected as the first voice, from a pool of 15,000 telephone operators who worked for the GPO.
It was only after she had recorded the script - "At the third stroke, it will be... precisely" - that they noticed a slight speech impediment.
The microphone had picked up a slight whistle at the end of each her words and it took a year to remove from sections of the glass discs used in the machine.
Ms Mendes da Costa won a Children in Need competition in 2006, succeeding Brian Cobby to become only the fourth long-term voice of the clock.
Several celebrities have recorded the time for the clock for charity.
The exhibition is held at Upton Hall, near Newark, throughout the weekend.
