The England football coach was speaking to Newsround ahead of the 2013 Women's Euros competition in Sweden.
Asked whether the women's team could beat the men, she answered: "Absolutely, why not?
"I think physically the guys are obviously a lot stronger than the women, but if we took it on technical ability we're as good as the men."
She continued: "We'd give it a good go."
The former international player added: "Women's football is sometimes considered secondary.
"But the growth of the game means more people are interested in the game, and it's flourishing."
