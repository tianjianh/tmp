Elsewhere, Johanna Konta became the first British woman to reach the quarter-finals since 1984 with a hard-fought win over France's Caroline Garcia.
Konta will play Simona Halep after the Romanian second seed's 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 victory over Victoria Azarenka.
The 27-year-old Belarusian, playing only her second tournament after giving birth to son Leo in December, saved three match points before Halep triumphed.
If Halep beats Konta in the last eight, she will become world number one.
