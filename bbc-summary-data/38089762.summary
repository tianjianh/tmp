The clip of people seen getting into a hangar was posted on YouTube at the weekend but has since been removed.
South Yorkshire Police said it was investigating an "incident of trespassing at Doncaster Robin Hood Airport".
The airport confirmed an "incident" took place at its hangar on Saturday.
In a statement, a spokesperson said: "We can confirm that an alleged incident took place on Saturday evening in a hangar on the airport site and did not occur in a passenger area.
"It was immediately reported to the relevant authorities, with whom we are now working alongside in full support of their investigations.
"The ongoing safety and security of our passengers remains our number one priority."
