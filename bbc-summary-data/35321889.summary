Lenders are expecting more jostling for buy-to-let mortgages in the coming weeks after a leap in demand in late 2015.

A survey by the Bank of England said 30% more lenders expected demand to grow over the first three months of the year than those predicting a fall.
Various figures have shown an increase in buy-to-let mortgage lending in recent months.
Buy-to-let investors face a 3% surcharge on stamp duty from April.
Housing experts predict that prospective landlords will move as quickly as possible to complete purchases before the extra stamp duty on second home purchases kicks in.
Demand for buy-to-let lending increased significantly in the three months to Christmas, the Bank said.
Some 22% more lenders reported increases rather than decreases in the demand for loans.
On Thursday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said the number of buy-to-let home loans advanced in November leapt by 35% compared to the same month a year earlier.
A number of reports have also suggested an increased reliance on credit among consumers towards the end of last year.
The Bank's survey revealed that demand for personal loans and overdrafts picked up in the last three months of 2015. A significant chunk of this was finance for buying cars.
This demand is expected to remain strong in the first quarter of this year, the Bank said.
