Matthew Jillard, of Bordesley Green, said he had been visited by police more than 40 times in the past 18 months, often in the middle of the night.
He said police confused his house in Repton Road with a nearby address in Repton Grove.
West Midlands Police said it had taken measures to stop it happening again, but Mr Jillard said they had failed.
The 38-year-old labourer said in Christmas week police had mistakenly called at his house five times, disturbing the friends and family he had staying with him, including one call at 0300 GMT and one at 0500 GMT.
"I just don't know what to do. Nine out of 10 times they are really apologetic.
"When my girlfriend rang Police HQ at Lloyd House the gaffer there said he knew all about it because they had seminars about not getting it wrong.
"We used to get post for the address in Repton Grove but that has stopped after we contacted them.
"We've put up signs, we've tried to get them to change their records. Some officers have said it is their sat-nav because they're not always that accurate.
"I really don't know what more we can do."
A police spokeswoman said: "West Midlands Police can confirm that officers have attended an incorrect address in Repton Road on several occasions.
"Officers have been in regular contact with the occupier to apologise for the mistakes. A number of measures have been put in place to stop this from happening again."
