'Give our family justice,' says aunt of teen killed in Greece

The family of Tyrell Matthews-Burton, who was killed in Malia, has accused the UK government of not doing enough to help them.

On 13 July 2013, around 30 British tourists got into a fight outside a bar. Tyrell was stabbed and died.
His aunt Rose Matthews said the family still do not know much more than that.
"We're not sure of all the details but my nephew and his friends were in the wrong place at the wrong time," she said.
The family claim there were problems with the Greek police investigation into the death of Tyrell, who was in the country celebrating his 19th birthday.
"There were some flaws earlier, for instance, some of the evidence was sent back to my sister - the clothes he was wearing."
Ms Matthews told BBC Radio 5Live that they wanted to be treated the same as families in similar positions.
"We asked if they could send somebody with us or send somebody else on our behalf to investigate. That was not successful," she said.
British police went to Thailand after the murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge earlier this year.
The government says it will keep on supporting Tyrell's family but it is up to Greek authorities to further investigate what took place on the night he died.
"A young man's life has been snatched away from his family and friends, we want them to look at the case, look at the evidence and give our family justice," said Ms Matthews.
"Tyrell was a lovely man, a wonderful young man, he was friendly, funny."
On Monday, Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, who is also British, was cleared of the killing, after spending 16 months in a Greek jail.
He was found guilty of affray but is appealing that charge and denies playing any part in the killing of the teenager.
His dad, Chris, told Newsbeat: "It was a very long 16 months. Very hard.
"Having to be in the UK, not able to see my son, going to work every day to make sure we had funds to pay for the legal fees. But whatever I felt, it's nothing compared to what he went through."
It is still unclear who killed Tyrell.
There are outstanding charges against at least one other person.
Tyrell's mother Sharon has previously said that her son's death was "senseless, brutal and unnecessary".
