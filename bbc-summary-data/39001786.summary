Rebecca Williams said she was "so proud" to have been the girlfriend of Cameron Logan, who died in the blaze at the family home in Milngavie.
Hundreds of people attended a funeral service for Mr Logan, who was 23, at Clydebank Crematorium.
His brother Blair Logan, 26, has been charged with his murder, along with other offences.
A guard of honour was formed by Mr Logan's friends as the cortege arrived at the crematorium almost seven weeks after he died in the blaze.
A Scottish flag was draped over the coffin and a piper played Highland Cathedral as the "proud Scot" was carried inside.
His family issued a statement thanking "everyone who has helped at this difficult time", praising the actions of emergency services, neighbours and friends.
Ms Williams, who is a broadcast journalist at Global Radio, was seriously injured in the fire and spent weeks in hospital.
In an interview published by her employer, she paid tribute to Mr Logan.
She said: "Cameron was a teddy bear.
"He had such a big personality, but with a sensitive soul. And he was so funny and kind.
"He had an amazing ability to make people smile and feel good about themselves.
"He was always trying to improve himself and expand his horizons, something I really admired in him."
Ms Williams said Cameron had completed university and had wanted to join the police to become a detective.
She added: "I am so proud to have been his girlfriend. He was the love of my life."
In addition to being charged with murder, Blair Logan faces two other charges - one of attempted murder, and one of assault to injury, danger to life and attempted murder.
