Bomb disposal experts were called to Sackers in Great Blakenham after staff found three devices at about 12:00 GMT.
Suffolk Police said the bombs, believed to be used for training exercises, did not contain explosives.
David Dodds, Sackers managing director, said he was "gobsmacked" as to why someone would take the bombs to a scrap metal site.
"It's thanks to the vigilance of the staff that they were spotted," he said. "As soon as they saw one everything was quarantined and the police were called.
"It was a bit daunting."
More bombs were discovered at about 15:00.
Police said the bombs posed no threat to members of the public.
Mr Dodds said: "We think they were tracer bombs which were used during World War Two for training purposes.
"They held a very small explosive, so on impact the bomb would let off a puff of smoke so the pilot could see where it landed."
