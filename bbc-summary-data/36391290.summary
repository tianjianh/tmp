The RAF Scampton Airshow is to be held over a weekend in September 2017, organisers said.
An annual show at RAF Waddington was axed in 2015 by the Ministry of Defence.
Andy Armstrong, chief executive of the new organising company, said it would take place on the weekend of September 9-10.
In February, the RAF Charitable Trust reached an agreement in principle with the force to organise a show at Scampton.
"We now have to go out to all those people and companies we'll be relying on to ensure we have everything in place to stage an exciting and safe airshow", Mr Armstrong said.
It is hoped to have tickets on sale by the end of the year.
RAF Scampton is five miles (8km) north of Lincoln and is home to the Red Arrows aerobatic team.
During World War Two, Lancaster bombers flew from the base on the 1943 Dambusters raid to destroy the German dams in the Ruhr valley with "bouncing bombs". Out of 133 crew, only 77 returned.
