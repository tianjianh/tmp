[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood and Bromley are still waiting to get back to winning ways after playing out a goalless draw at Meadow Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Martin twice went close as the visitors started strongly, first seeing a shot blocked after eight minutes and then firing just wide on the half-hour mark, but that was as close as they came before the break.
Bromley continued to edge the battle, with Brandon Hanlan and Lee Minshull both forcing great saves out of Grant Smith early in the second half.
Boreham Wood have now not won in seven league games, while Bromley are without a win in six.
