Pace bowler Stuart Broad says England's current one-day batting line-up is the most powerful he has played with.

England amassed 391-6 in their win over a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra, which followed a score of 364-6 against an ACT XI.
"Nearly 800 runs in our last 100 overs batting. Without doubt the most powerful batting line-up I've ever played with," Broad tweeted.
England open a tri-series with Australia and India on Friday.
That acts as a warm-up for the World Cup, which England begin against co-hosts Australia in Melbourne on 14 February.
Broad's comments come following the removal of Alastair Cook as one-day captain and almost a year after Kevin Pietersen's England career was ended.
Pietersen is England's fourth-highest ODI runscorer of all-time, with 4,422 runs in 134 matches.
Ian Bell, who replaced Cook as opener, made 187 from 145 balls on Wednesday, to cement his place alongside Moeen Ali at the top of the order.
The rest of England's top seven looks set to include James Taylor, Joe Root, new skipper Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Jos Buttler.
Broad has played 108 one-day internationals since making his debut in 2006 and is set to play in a third World Cup.
