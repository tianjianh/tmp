Young voters have been quizzing Scotland's party leaders during a five-stop lift journey.

First on the move was Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens. He spoke frankly about being arrested by the police and why he would love to give a home to a refugee - but can't.
Asking the questions were Sarah (18); Jamie-Lee (16); Louis (16); Erin (18) and Megan (18).
They are all members of the BBC's Generation 2016 election panel.
Mr Harvie, an elected politician for more than 15 years, was asked if he had ever been arrested by the police.
He recalled that during a demonstration at the Faslane nuclear base, he was "hauled off" - alongside his mother - by officers.
Mr Harvie added:  "I think changing the world, sometimes, needs a wide range of different techniques and getting arrested sometimes happens."
When asked whether he would let a refugee live with him, the politician said he "might", but he didn't have the space "at the moment".
Other questions put to Mr Harvie included - would you ever fight in a war, is it fair that the minimum wage is lower for young people and who would you like to get stuck in a lift with?
The Scottish Lib Dems' Willie Rennie; Scottish Tory Ruth Davidson; Scottish Labour's Kezia Dugdale and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon have also been part of the BBC's Leaders in a Lift series.
