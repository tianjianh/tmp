[SN]TITLE[SN]
Warren Free murder: Metal pole used in 'vicious assault'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was murdered by six youths in a park after he confronted them about damage to his fence, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warren Free, of Coronation Close, Spalding, died in hospital in August after being found with head injuries at his home.
Two girls aged 15, two boys aged 15, a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man have denied murder.
Two of the boys also deny a charge of perverting the course of justice, relating to a pole used in the attack.
Lincoln Crown Court heard Mr Free was attacked following an argument outside his home during which his fence was knocked down and items were thrown.
The 42-year-old had then confronted the youths in a nearby park.
The prosecution claim he was knocked to the ground and subjected to a "vicious assault", during which one of the girls hit him with a metal pole.
It argued that all six defendants were involved in the attack and are jointly responsible for Mr Free's death.
After the attack he returned home, but died later from his injuries.
The trial continues.
