Poults took time out to answer your Twitter questions sent to BBC Sport and gives his advice to aspiring golfers and to Arsenal's board.
When did you start playing golf? And who got you into playing it? Dominic Clemons
"I started playing when I was about five. My dad cut an old three wood down - took off the sole plate, pulled out the lead weight that was in the bottom in those days and taped up where the grip should be with pipe tape and that was my starting club."
What's your favourite major and why? Also what do you believe is the best part of your game? Jacob Cutts
"My favourite major would be the Open Championship. Every Englishman is obviously going to want to put their hands on that Claret Jug. In respect to the best part of my game, I would think mentally I am pretty strong. That's always been a very strong part of my game. I've always felt in certain situations I have been able to pull on my mental strength."
Quite an obvious question, but what is your favourite Ryder Cup moment that you played in? Joe Pye
"Saturday afternoon at Medinah is probably going to be no surprise to nobody. To play in the last match of the afternoon - when the matches were 10-4 down and Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald winning their point to get it to 10-5 - Rory and I closed out our match on the last hole. That was a pretty special moment."
When was the closest you felt you came to landing a major? Robert Gray
"I would say when I finished runner-up at the Open in 2008 at Royal Birkdale. To post the clubhouse lead, at that point, I felt I had a chance to win.
"There's no pain in that at all. I loved every minute of it. There's too many ifs and buts and you can go through your whole life saying 'if, if, if'. It was a great week and finishing second was pretty special."
What is or was your favourite course you've played on? Michael Briggs
"I would say St Andrews in Scotland. The reason is that's where I played my first Open Championship and it was my first experience on a proper links course. To be able to play my first Open at the home of golf holds fond memories."
Would you trade your Ryder Cup performances for a major win? Jacob Bewicke
"No. I would not trade anything for anything. I'm happy with my career to date. Obviously, I would like there to be a major in there. That's not a great question to ask me because I never feel you should give something up for something else. It has been my journey to date and I'm happy with my journey."
What words of advice would you give to aspiring golfers out there? Andrew John Collins
"Work hard, focus, follow your dreams and never say never. No Limits is the name of the autobiography and there is a reason because I never set limits and I wanted to achieve big things. A lot of people make the mistake of just setting a goal and when they achieve that they don't want to get to the next level. Think big and work hard."
Is Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's time up? If so, who should the board be flirting with as a possible replacement? David Vincent
"I don't think Arsene's time is up. I think the board need to hand over a couple of cheques for him to sign a couple of new players. They play great football but sometimes great football does not get the job done as we saw the other night - dominating the game against Manchester United simply didn't win that game. We need to be stronger as a team so, therefore, the team needs to have a few extra players.
"Every Arsenal fan expects more from the club. After those years where they achieved great things, not a lot has happened in the eight years since. Of course, fans are going to be upset but I think the team just needs strengthening.
"They need a centre-half, a holding midfielder but big guys and not little guys. The team is not the biggest of teams and they get pushed around too easily. They get overpowered in certain situations. They need another striker as well."
Ian Poulter discusses his life story in his new autobiography, No Limits, and was speaking to Mandeep Sanghera.
