County Championship: Robinson hits debut ton in Sussex rescue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex tail-ender Ollie Robinson showed up the top order by becoming the first debutant to hit a Championship century for the county in 95 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a new county record last-wicket stand of 164 with Matt Hobden (65 not out), they almost doubled the Sussex score as the early Division One leaders were finally bowled out for 335.
Runs continued to flow when Durham's openers put on 88 inside 16 overs.
But Robinson dismissed both to cap a remarkable day as they closed on 103-2.
All-rounder Robinson, 21, was given his chance because Tymal Mills has joined Lewis Hatchett and James Anyon on the treatment table.
With the ball nipping around after Sussex were inserted on a sunny morning, several of the top order self-destructed as wickets fell regularly in the two hours either side of lunch.

The visitors had looked comfortable during a second-wicket stand of 88 in 18 overs between Ed Joyce (43) and Matt Machan (41).
But eight wickets had fallen for 83 runs when Robinson was joined by 22-year-old Hobden and Sussex's last pair suddenly made batting look ridiculously easy,
It was Usman Arshad, who had replaced the injured Paul Coughlin, who finally broke the stand to finish with the best figures of 3-41.
When the two last-wicket heroes then reappeared as Sussex's first and second change bowlers, they conceded 50 between them in their first five overs - but Robinson found some extra bounce to remove Keaton Jennings for 35 and then Mark Stoneman for 57.
Sussex's Ollie Robinson:
"I can't believe what's happened. I'm sure I'm not going to have too many days like this.
"I just tried to play nice and straight and keep it simple, but I couldn't have done it without Matt.
"At first we just wanted to get to 200, then 250 - we had no idea about any record stands. We kept each other going."
Durham coach Jon Lewis:
"Perhaps there was a bit of expectation on our part, thinking we had got the job done and the last wicket would come easily.
"But once they got in it became tricky for us. They played very well.
"The game hasn't got away from us. It's a good pitch and we just need some big partnerships."
