[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Human remains were found at a house in Ellesmere Port after police received information about Mr Borgye, 35, who disappeared four years ago.
Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the discovery in Hylton Court.
Officers are examining dental records to identify the body.
Det Ch Insp Simon Price said: "Formal identification is going to take some time but based on the information we have at this time, we believe the victim is Christophe."
The post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death as "blunt force trauma", said police who discovered the remains in a brick outbuilding.
Mr Borgye was living in the Ellesmere Port area at the time of his disappearance in May 2009 and is thought to have been an air steward for Ryanair at Liverpool John Lennon Airport, a police spokeswoman said.
She said following inquiries in 2009, police had been led to believe he was travelling abroad.
His family in France have been contacted and made aware of the investigation and discovery.
A 25-year-old man was arrested in Scotland earlier in addition to a man, aged 34, who is currently being questioned by Cheshire Police and a 35-year-old man who has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
