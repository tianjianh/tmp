Euro 2016: Jamie Ward believes NI's high-energy approach can trouble Germany

Northern Ireland's high-energy approach could help them spring a major upset if complacency creeps into Germany's team, says attacking midfielder Jamie Ward.

Michael O'Neill's men take on the world champions in Paris on Tuesday, unsure of what they require to secure a place in Euro 2016's knockout stages.
Ward, who plays for Nottingham Forest, says Germany will expect a routine win.
"They are the best team in the world and probably will not worry about us too much," said the 30-year-old.
"I am sure they will have watched our games and see we have a lot of energy. We are going to run around a lot.
"We just have to try to cause them problems, but they have quality players whoever they pick for their team."

Ward was recalled to the Northern Ireland team in one of five changes made by manager Michael O'Neill for Thursday's crucial 2-0 win over Ukraine.
The three points from that game could be enough for a place in the last 16.
However, defeat by Germany at the Parc des Princes would leave O'Neill's men depending on results in other groups going in their favour.
"Hopefully things go our way, but we have to concentrate on playing Germany," added Ward, who hopes to win his 25th cap.
"We will focus on our own game as we usually do. We cannot afford to let the occasion get to us."
Ward accepts Germany will go into Tuesday's game as strong favourites but insists O'Neill's side do not fear the world champions.
"We know what Germany are all about, and they have some of the best players in the world," he said.
"We respect them, but do not fear them.
"Our game is all about working hard and not giving people time on the ball. That might be different to what Germany have experienced before.
"We know we will not dominate possession - our strength is pressing and making life difficult for our opponents."
