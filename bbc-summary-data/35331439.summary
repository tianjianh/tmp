"It's nice to that one to bed; good victory, good for our goal difference, you never know if that could come in handy, all without playing particularly brilliant.
"In some ways I see that as a positive to still win 5-0 and not be totally happy.
"I thought we showed a lot of good intent on the ball, wanting to get on it, quicken our play.
"It was almost like there was an element of it being a little bit easy. I felt that they had some attacking players that could cause problems for us but we got the second goal and it was comfortable, don't get me wrong, but I just want us to be a little bit better on the ball and take care of it."
