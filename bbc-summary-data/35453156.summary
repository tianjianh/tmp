The tie looked done at the break with ruthless first-half finishes from Arnaud Djoum and Sam Nicholson.
Hibs displayed their character and their class thereafter, dominating much of the second half at Tynecastle.
Jason Cummings headed in 12 minutes from time to set up a frenetic finish, before Paul Hanlon slid home the equaliser in injury time.

Even at that painfully late stage, there could have been a winner.
Hearts responded and, under pressure, Niklas Gunnarsson almost turned the ball into his own net. Instead, it came back off his crossbar.
Tynecastle gasped in that moment. Breathless stuff and the right result. They go again at Easter Road a week on Tuesday, 16 February, and thank heavens for that.
This was hard and fast and ultra physical. There were lusty tackles by the barrowload, bookings galore, men going off injured and a second-half fracas.
Though they were two goals down at the break, it was Hibs who created the early chances, a neat turn and curling shot by John McGinn forcing Neil Alexander into a save and then Anthony Stokes heading just over from a corner.
Hibs lost Dylan McGeouch through injury after half an hour - Kevin Thomson replaced him for yet another Hibs 'debut'. The visitors missed McGeouch's industry and energy and within a minute of his exit his team were behind.
It came from nothing. Hearts - with new signing Abiola Dauda selected ahead of the departing Osman Sow - had posed no threat until Lewis Stevenson headed a weak clearance to Djoum, standing free outside the penalty area.
Djoum unleased a missile that flew past Mark Oxley. It was the purest strike you could hope to see and it sent Tynecastle into raptures.
Their delirium had barely died down when they were on their feet again celebrating the second. Callum Paterson hit a diagonal ball to the left side of the Hibs' box, where Nicholson took it on his chest and planted his shot beyond Oxley.
The question now was what could Hibs find after the break. This is a team that has already beaten three Premiership teams this season -  Aberdeen, Dundee United and St Johnstone all swept aside on their road to the League Cup final.
They rallied and pegged Hearts back and gave them a real fright. Gunnarsson came on as a replacement for David Gray and helped turn the tide, getting on the ball, finding space, making things happen. Marvin Bartley was like a rock in the middle of the park.
After a bout of pushing and shoving, a player pile-up and three bookings, Hibs started to create. Gunnarsson had a header saved by Alexander, then Stokes smashed one into the side-netting.
Hibs were dominating now, Hearts hanging on. All the energy belonged to Hibs - and all the chances. In the 78th minute, just when you started to doubt their capacity to turn possession into goals, Liam Henderson dinked in a cross and Cummings' terrific header looped in over Alexander's head.
The equaliser was late but deserving. Alexander thought he had repelled Hibs when he beat away Darren McGregor's header, but Hanlon followed up to complete the comeback.
There was time for a Hearts response. There was that Gunnarsson moment and then Thomson had to kick a Blazej Augustyn effort off the line.
Tumultuous stuff in the capital. Round two is a prospect to quicken the pulse.
