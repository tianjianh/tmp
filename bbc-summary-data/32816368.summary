Hospitality Ulster, formerly known as Pubs of Ulster, said growth could take job numbers to 50,000 in the sector.
The organisation represents pubs, restaurants and hotels.
It is setting up an advisory panel "to work with government" to develop the industry in Northern Ireland.
"Despite the loss of jobs during the downturn and sluggish growth recently, we have the opportunity to improve upon a sector which has promise," its chief executive Colin Neill said.
Research conducted by Oxford Economics in May said the hospitality sector makes a Â£1.2bn annual contribution to the Northern Ireland economy.
