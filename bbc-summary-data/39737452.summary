Celtic: Moussa Dembele may make cup final, says Rodgers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brendan Rodgers is not ruling Celtic's Moussa Dembele out for the season, hinting the striker could recover in time for the Scottish Cup final.

Dembele, 20, injured his hamstring in Sunday's semi-final defeat of Rangers and was expected to miss the 27 May meeting with Aberdeen.
Rodgers' Celtic have already won the Premiership and League Cup and are bidding for the domestic treble.
"He was on a bike today and moving the hamstring so we'll see," said Rodgers.
"He will be out for the foreseeable future. He had his scan on his hamstring. We'll just monitor that over the course of time and see how it is.
"It wouldn't be fair to say that [he's out for the season], no. We just have to assess it over time, see how he reacts.
"There is a period of time with individuals in terms of hamstrings but it's never to say that you can't be back within that.
"It is a hamstring tear, not overly serious, but we will assess it over the next two-to-three weeks."
Leigh Griffiths replaced Dembele at Hampden in the 2-0 win over Rangers and trained indoors on Thursday but Rodgers said of the 26-year-old: "He should be fine for the squad."
