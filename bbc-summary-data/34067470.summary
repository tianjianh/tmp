Dee estuary cockle beds 'to reopen for eight weeks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cockle beds in the Dee estuary in Flintshire can open for eight weeks this autumn, environment officials have announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) previously said the beds would not open as usual on 1 July after a sharp drop in the number of cockles.
But cocklers reported a "very late and unusual" appearance of young cockles.
NRW said another survey in August showed that there were about 600 tonnes which could be harvested.
Tim Jones, NRW's executive director for north and mid Wales, said: "This really is good news for all concerned and demonstrates how managing these beds in a way that helps the environment and the economy can work."
The beds will be open for the limited time from 21 September.
