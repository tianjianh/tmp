Newport Gwent Dragons coach Kingsley Jones says the team must change its "away mentality" after being knocked out of the European Challenge Cup.

The Dragons lost 36-19 to pool three winners Brive in France, and have not won away from home this season.
"There's a theme, we have to look at our away mentality," said Jones.
"We're starting to believe we can win at home, but we need to review our away form. There were 15 penalties against us [and] a few errors."
They Welsh region paid the penalty for a struggling scrum in the second half.
Without first-choice tight-head Brok Harris for personal reasons, Dragons conceded a series of infringements at the breakdown.
"A couple [of decisions] will go against you away from home, but we've got to be better than that, if there's a massive difference with the statistics away from home."
The Dragons reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup in 2014-15 and 2015-16, but are now left to focus on improving their ninth place in the PRO12.
"We're not that far away (eight points) from Cardiff Blues (in seventh), if we can continue our home form we'll move up the league a little but we need to get some away wins as well.
"Connacht and Edinburgh are good sides but we'll be looking to move above Connacht and catch up with the Blues."
