The singer from north London who is releasing a new album with his band Public Image Ltd, will turn 60 soon.
He tells BBC London's Brenda Emmanus joining the Sex Pistols was "the one chance I ever had to be loud and proud".
In the week the Queen becomes the longest reigning monarch he admits now has "no problem" with the monarchy "as people".
