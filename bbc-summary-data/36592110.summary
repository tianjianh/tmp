The hosts declared on their overnight score of 244-5, setting Notts a victory target of 386 in 96 overs at The Oval.
Notts were 102-2 at lunch but collapsed spectacularly during the afternoon session, losing their final eight wickets in 53 minutes for just 38 runs.
Surrey spinner Zafar Ansari, who removed Jake Libby and Riki Wessels with successive balls, ended with 6-36.
Ansari's devastating spell meant Brendan Taylor's 68 from 79 deliveries was in vain for Notts, who are now level on points with Surrey in Division One.
The win also lifted Surrey off the bottom of the table above Hampshire.
Notts had looked in a good position while Taylor and opener Jake Libby, who made a patient 33 from 115 balls, were at the crease sharing a third-wicket stand of 90.
But the swift departures of Libby and Wessels started the procession of Notts wickets, with only Dan Christian (11) reaching double figures among their final seven batsmen.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: "We've missed key moments in games at times, and we didn't miss them in this game.
"Everybody contributed and it ended up being a very good win against a very good Notts team.
"Traditionally, we're a better team in the second half of the season than in the first half. Hopefully we go back to type, play good cricket for the rest of the season and get a few more wins under the belt."
