The 38-year-old woman was found dead with a serious head injury at Gainslea Court in Derby Road on Friday evening.
Police have named the woman as Hayley Dean but formal identification is yet to take place.
James D'Arcy, 50, from Bournemouth, has been charged with murder and is due before the town's magistrates on Monday.
A post-mortem examination on Saturday found that Ms Dean died as a result of "blunt force trauma" to her head.
A cordon remains in place at the flat while crime scene investigators continue to examine the scene.
Det Insp Neil Phillips, of Dorset Police's major crime investigation team, said: "Family liaison officers have updated Hayley's family with this development and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.
He added: "I would like to hear from anyone who heard anything suspicious in or around Gainslea Court between 14:00 on Thursday 15 September and 18:30 BST on Friday 16 September.
"I am particularly keen to speak with any members of the public who saw or spoke with Hayley Dean or James D'Arcy between these times."
