[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England women hammered Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, running in 11 tries in a 63-0 victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors scored most of their tries through the back three with wing Lydia Thompson running in a hat-trick.
Fellow wing Amy Wilson Hardy and full-back Danielle Waterman crossed twice apiece in a dominant display.
Amy Cokayne, Natasha Hunt, Kate McLean and Sarah Hunter all touched down with Emily Scarratt converting four tries, with Wales unable to find a reply.
England's confident all-round display will make them Six Nations favourites and World Cup contenders.
The Red Roses, who unlike the hosts are professional, got the scoreboard moving inside three minutes when wing Wilson Hardy was worked clear with an overlap, and they continued to get outside the Welsh defence regularly.
The bonus point took just 22 minutes to arrive, and Wales scarcely had their hands on the ball in the first-half with Scarratt's goal-kicking extending the lead to 38-0 by the interval.
Waterman, Thompson and Wilson Hardy continued to run riot in their third quarter.
Wales managed more possession and territory as the game broke up in the final quarter with all the replacements coming on, but Thompson's third in the 67th minute was the last score as Wales were unable to breach a sturdy English defence.
England fly-half McLean, who finished the game at full-back, was player of the match for her controlling performance.
England next host Italy at the Stoop Memorial Ground on Saturday 25 February, while Wales face Scotland in Cumbernauld the previous night.
England beat France 26-13 in their opening contest after trailing 13-0.
Wales beat Italy 20-8 in their opening game of the tournament in Jesi on 4 February.
