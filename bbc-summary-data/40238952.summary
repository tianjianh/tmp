The 21-year-old made his Gunners breakthrough in 2012 but after struggling to command a regular berth and having a loan spell with West Brom, joined Werder Bremen last summer.
An impressive season including 11 goals from 27 games brought him to the attention of the Bundesliga champions.
"It is a great honour to be part of FC Bayern," he said.
"Before me lies an exciting time, which I am very much looking forward to."
Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added on his club's website: "We are delighted to see another young German national player in FC Bayern in Serge Gnabry. Serge has developed very well in Bremen."
