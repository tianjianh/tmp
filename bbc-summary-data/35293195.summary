An injured backpacker who inspired hundreds of people to give blood at a Thailand hospital needs more donations ahead of further surgery, her family have said.

Lucy Hill, 21, from Bury, broke her pelvis when her moped was in collision with a car on Saturday in Chiang Mai.
She has now had several blood transfusions after people responded to a social media appeal.
However, her aunt said "nowhere near enough blood" had been donated.
Sue Raleigh said more supplies of the relatively rare A negative blood were needed for further surgery, which was likely to be carried out on Thursday.
She said the Leeds Beckett University graduate remained in a critical but stable condition following surgery on her pelvis and a procedure to treat a bleed on her brain.
She added that her niece had briefly woken in hospital but became "quite distressed" and was placed back under sedation.
"She's having blood transfusions every day but she's going to need more," Ms Raleigh said.
"I think she's had two transfusions so far, but we've had word from Thailand to keep it coming."
She added that Ms Hill's mother Alison was at her bedside.
Family and friends of Ms Hill posted a plea on travel review site Trip Advisor after the hospital ran out of supplies of the blood. Fewer than 1% of Thai people have negative blood types.
The appeal was shared 40,000 times within six hours, with hundreds of messages and postings from people trying to help.
