Israel early election date set as Knesset votes on dissolution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Israeli political parties have agreed to hold a general election on 17 March, two years ahead of schedule.

The move was announced a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sacked two senior coalition partners in his cabinet, centrist leaders Yair Lapid and Tzipi Livni.
Mr Netanyahu accused the ministers of plotting against him.
On Wednesday, members of the national parliament, the Knesset, voted 84-0 in a preliminary reading to dissolve it.
The right-of-centre coalition, which was formed after the last general election in January 2013, is made up of Mr Netanyahu's Likud and four other parties.
Mr Lapid was serving as finance minister and is leader of the Yesh Atid party. Ms Livni was minister of justice and is leader of Hatnuah.
In a televised address on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said it was "impossible" for him to lead the current coalition, describing Ms Livni and Mr Lapid's activities as a "putsch".
"I will not tolerate an opposition within the government any more," he said.
The coalition has been fraught with tension in recent months, with both ministers publically criticising Mr Netanyahu on a number of issues, notably on Iran, the Palestinians, and most recently a bill designed to strengthen the Jewish nature of the Israeli state.
Both ministers criticised Mr Netanyahu's decision to dismiss them and call for early elections.
Mr Lapid said the move would "waste billions". Israeli media report that the poll is expected to cost some 2bn shekels (Â£322m; $505m).
Ms Livni warned that without the centrist parties the government would consist of "extremist" parties that she said would destroy the country, Haaretz reported.
