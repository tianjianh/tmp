A 20-year-old man was left with facial injuries after the incident on a footpath behind the Fubar nightclub.
Officer said the "unprovoked" attack took place at about 01:30 on Sunday morning.
The two men, believed to be aged between 20 and 40 years old, hit their victim on the head before running off.
The 20-year-old had left the club and was heading towards Goosecroft Road  to look for a taxi when he was assaulted. He was taken to Forth Valley Royal Hospital for treatment, but has since been discharged.
Sgt Murray McKenzie said: "From the information we have gathered at this stage of out inquiry, this appears to be a completely unprovoked attacked.
"The suspects are unknown to the man and it is not clear why they chose to carry out such a vicious assault.
"We are currently carrying out various lines of inquiry including reviewing the local CCTV network but today I'm asking anyone who saw this incident or has any information that can assist with our ongoing investigation to come forward immediately."
