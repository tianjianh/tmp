Operation Equinox is investigating claims of sexual, physical and emotional abuse between the 1940s and 1990s.
In a letter to victims Nottinghamshire Police confirmed 530 of 636 reported crimes were on council property.
Officers also said 485 alleged offences were committed by council staff and of 432 suspects, 283 had been identified.

So far, police have had 290 people report crimes.
Operation Equinox combined two police inquiries.
Operation Daybreak, sent up in 2011, was focussed on the Beechwood children's home in Nottingham, while Operation Xeres has been looking at residential homes in the county.
The letter emphasises the progress already made, with former social worker Andris Logins jailed for 20 years.
Two other men have been jailed for historical attacks not connected to children's homes and three more trials are due to begin in early 2017.
Nottinghamshire Police has not commented directly as the information is part of an ongoing enquiry.
