A court heard Roy Green fed his own habit by selling the drug to a steady stream of visitors to his close.
Green, 58, told police he was able to make £350 a week for a year without leaving his home.
He admitted at Perth Sheriff Court to being concerned in the supply of heroin.
Depute fiscal Gavin Letford told Perth Sheriff Court: "He was resident at Watergate with his partner.
"Police received intelligence that the accused was involved in the supply of controlled drugs.
"He was dealing drugs through the letterbox and there were a number of customers at the door daily to buy heroin.
"A number of people were arrested nearby."
One of the addicts said he had been visiting Green's home every day for two months to purchase heroin.
Green told police officers he had been dealing drugs for months and would make around £100 every two days.
Solicitor Cliff Culley, defending, said: "He was supplying to pay for his own habit.
"He wasn't living a life of luxury. He has a number of physical ailments."
Green, now of Feus Road, Perth was jailed for 33 months by Sheriff Fiona Tait.
Sheriff Tait said: "I acknowledge the physical disabilities which you have.
"However, you have pled guilty to the supply of heroin over a period of one year."
