The UK's national windsurfing championships have been put on hold after 40mph gusts were deemed "too strong" for it to go ahead.

The UK Windsurfing Association's annual championships were due to start at 11:00 BST on Bridlington's North Beach.
But the blustery conditions forced races to be postponed until Sunday, Chairman Bob Ingram said.
The Met Office said wind speeds were averaging 36mph from 09:00, which was "relatively unusual" for June.
A spokesperson said a gust speed of 40mph was recorded in Bridlington at 15:00.
