The father of a Londonderry man who died following a sectarian attack in 2006 has said he believes the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) was involved in the attack.

Paul McCauley, 38, died on Saturday in a care unit in Derry.
The civil servant was 30 when he was attacked by a mob at a barbecue in the Waterside in 2006.
His father said the hate perpetrated on Paul by a gang is a "massive stain on some people in the loyalist community".
Only one person has been convicted over the attack, although up to 15 people are believed to have been involved.
The investigation into the attack has now become a murder investigation.
Mr McCauley told BBC Radio Foyle that his son was left in a "horrific condition".
"Paul was imprisoned within his own body. He needed 24/7 care and was fed through a tube," he said.
"Paul was often in pain. This has been one of the most cruel crimes in Northern Ireland.
"There is a sense of peace now that we know Paul is in a better place."
"We believe the UDA were behind it and they have caused us so much grief.
"To have to wait in a dying process, where you know there is no recovery, is an appalling way to leave anyone."
"The hate that was perpetrated on Paul by a gang is a massive stain, not only on who did it, but on part of the loyalist community who know what happened. "
Mr McCauley said his son had been deteriorating since Easter.
"The end came quicker than expected," he said.
"We all sat with Paul on Friday night and we are happy that we were so close to him.
"Kathy, my wife, was holding his hand when he passed away.
"There is no bitterness, but we have a real drive for justice."
He urged anyone with information to come forward.
"I don't think part of the loyalist community here have done enough. I would prefer a louder voice," he said.
"These attackers are people who thought that they could disappear into the night. I'm certain that the commitment of the current investigation team will get answers.
"Community leaders must have the courage to assist the police."
Mr McCauley suffered multiple injuries, including a brain haemorrhage and a fractured skull, when he and two friends were beaten by a gang of youths.
Politicians have been calling for justice for the family.
The DUP's William Hay said: "I can't imagine what this family has gone through.
"I do believe there are people out there shielding the murderers of this young man.
"I would appeal to the police and the public to double their efforts in order to get justice for this family."
Foyle MP Mark Durkan said he hoped people with information about the attack would come forward.
"You have to hope at this stage that something would move people," he said.
