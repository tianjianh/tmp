The QPR striker, 23, charged his way through and turned to shoot low past keeper Jan Oblak in the 42nd minute.
Northern Ireland have now gone 10 games unbeaten for the first time.
Slovenia had a chance to equalise in the second half but veteran keeper Roy Carroll superbly saved Milivoje Novakovic's penalty.
The 66th-minute spot-kick was awarded when West Brom defender Jonny Evans pulled back Miral Samardzic as a corner came into the area.
Notts County keeper Carroll made another fine stop in the 89th minute to keep out a low shot by Valter Birsa.
Washington, the former postman who was playing non-league football just over four years ago, earned his second cap after making his debut in Thursday's 1-1 draw in Wales.
Boss Michael O'Neill has said the bulk of his squad will be made up by the players who got Northern Ireland to their first major finals for 30 years, so there are only a few places up for grabs by those on the periphery.
But Washington has certainly put his hand up for inclusion.
Those fans wondering why the match-shy Kyle Lafferty, their top scorer in qualifying, did not start forgot all about that when the hard-working Washington bulldozed his way through to finish well for the only goal of the night.
Northern Ireland going 10 matches unbeaten is a nice record for O'Neill to reflect on but, from his perspective, the result mattered more because it keeps momentum going as the Euro 2016 finals edge closer.
In their first tournament appearance in 30 years, Northern Ireland will face world champions Germany, Poland and Ukraine in the group stage.
Thursday's draw in Cardiff and this slender victory maintain the feel-good factor ahead of the finals.
It all breeds confidence and, if they can come through their final two warm-up games without losing, Northern Ireland can head to France in fine spirits.
For spells, the match may have had the definite feel of a friendly, but it was a good workout for Northern Ireland.
Striker Lafferty, now with Birmingham City on loan, came on in the second half to get some more game time.
Peterborough United defender Michael Smith made his international debut at the age of 27 and did not look out of place with a composed performance.
Competition for places is keen - there are going to be some disappointed men when O'Neill decides on his squad of 23.
Northern Ireland have two friendlies left before the serious business of facing Poland in their opening Euro 2016 match on 12 June.
O'Neill's men are back at Windsor Park to play Belarus on Friday, 27 May.
They then travel to play Slovakia in Trnava's New City Stadium on Saturday, 4 June before heading for their tournament base near Lyon.
Boss O'Neill has chosen to play Slovakia, believing they play in a similar style to the Poles and second Group C opponents Ukraine.
