Police set off in hot pursuit on jetskis for the man, who later claimed he ran to help a friend give birth on the beach, according to local media.
His bill was over A$600 (Â£360, $450).
Terry Peck, who has been charged with theft and assault, later said the lobsters were overcooked.
The 33-year-old appeared in court on Monday morning after the incident at Omeros Bros restaurant in Surfers Paradise on the east coast.
He allegedly consumed two lobsters, a baby octopus, 21 vodka oyster shots and "a number of Coronas".
"Oh God! By himself?" said magistrate Joan White when she granted bail, according to ABC News.
A restaurant representative, Mark Hunnybun, rejected the criticism of the standard of cooking, telling the network: "We pride ourselves on cooking our lobsters perfectly."
Australian media have uncovered some of Mr Peck's self-produced music, including one track entitled Ozi Ozi Ozi Oy Oy Oy.
Australia is far from the only country where restaurants face the risk of non-payers.
Last month, Spanish police arrested the alleged ringleader of gang that carried out a series of eat-and-run raids in the country's north.
The group, which comprised over 100 people, consumed about 2,000 euros of food and drink at Bembibre's El Carmen restaurant in March, claiming they were celebrating a baptism.
They fled before dessert was served.
A similar incident happened a week later at nearby El Rincon de Pepin, during a supposed wedding reception.
The group paid 1,000 euros as a deposit, but consumed 10,000 euros of food and drink before running out, owner Laura Arias told the BBC.
