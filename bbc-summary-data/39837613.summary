The 55-year-old Wiltshire-based rider was lucky not to have been paralysed after a fall in 2015 and required eight hours of surgery on his neck.
He held his nerve in the show-jumping phase on Nereo to edge out Germany's defending champion Michael Jung.
Overnight leader Ingrid Klimke of Germany dropped from first to ninth.
Tim Price of New Zealand was third while Rosalind Canter was the highest placed Briton in fifth place, with Gemma Tattersall seventh and Kristina Cook 10th.
British rider Emily Gilruth is in intensive care after she was seriously injured in a fall on Saturday.
