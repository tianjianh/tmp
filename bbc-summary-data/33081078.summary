Birmingham children's services: Timeline of the problems

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A series of child deaths in Birmingham saw the city council's children's service branded a "national disgrace" and consistently rated "inadequate" by Ofsted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government appointed external commissioners to oversee the department but improvements have "not gone far enough, fast enough", the Department for Education has said.
The council subsequently announced a plan for children's services to be run by a trust.
