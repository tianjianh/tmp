[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report into how a ferry crashed into a pier has pointed to a mechanical fault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uriah Heep ran into Hythe Pier while it was berthing with 15 passengers and three crew onboard in May 2016.
The trimaran became wedged under the pier, collapsing the wheelhouse and trapping the skipper, who was pulled free by a colleague.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found the crash resulted from a loss of propulsion control.
Investigators found the skipper lost control of the water jet propelled vessel on 13 May as it arrived at the pier at 21:10 BST.
According to the report, the loss of control was caused "almost certainly from a mechanical failure within the hydraulic circuit that powered the thrust deflector".
It also found "the ferry's berth at Hythe afforded little space within which to abort an an approach in the event of a mechanical malfunction".
The investigation found the ferry had been involved in three previous incidents:
Following the crash passengers and crew were rescued from the ferry and taken on to another vessel.
Some passengers received minor neck and back injuries, the skipper suffered minor cuts and abrasions.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency withdrew Uriah Heep's passenger safety certificate following the accident.
Uriah Heep was later sold by its operator, White Horse Ferries Ltd.
Hythe Ferry now runs a shuttle service using one vessel, Great Expectations, between Hythe and Southampton.
