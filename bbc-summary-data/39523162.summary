[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury picked up a point in their battle to avoid relegation from League One after fighting back to draw with Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieron Morris gave the Saddlers a half-time lead before Stefan Payne headed Shrewsbury level 20 minutes from time.
Shrewsbury, who are two points clear of the relegation places, started brightly and Payne fired wide in the opening seconds before then setting up a chance for Shaun Whalley, but the winger's shot was comfortably gathered by goalkeeper Craig MacGillivray.
Amadou Bakayoko twice went close for mid-table Walsall before the visitors took the lead in the 35th minute. Joe Edwards delivered a fine cross from the left and midfielder Morris burst into the box to head home from close range.
Walsall almost doubled their advantage two minutes later but Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler made an excellent double save, blocking an effort from Bakayoko and then reacting impressively to tip a drive from Morris over the bar.
Leutwiler made another important save early in the second half from an Edwards free-kick and Morris then drove narrowly wide.
But Shrewsbury rallied and equalised in the 70th minute when Whalley's cross from the right was headed in by on-loan Barnsley striker Payne, his second goal in as many games for Paul Hurst's side.
