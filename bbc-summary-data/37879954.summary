Two unions have rejected a pay and conditions offer by oil industry contractors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite and GMB unions said members had "overwhelmingly" rejected proposals by the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) following a consultative ballot.
They added they were seeking a meeting with OCA to try to reach a negotiated settlement.
OCA said it remained "committed to doing everything we can to reach an agreement".
In a statement, the unions said: "Unite and GMB members have overwhelmingly rejected the OCA employers' pay and conditions proposals.
"In light of a significant mandate from trade union-organised offshore workers to oppose any further cuts in pay, or changes to other terms and conditions, we now are seeking a meeting with the OCA to try and secure a negotiated settlement to unions' pay and conditions claim."
Responding to the news, OCA chief executive Paul Atkinson said: "We are seeking to reach an agreement that continues to protect employees' earnings by guaranteeing pay and standards while at the same time ensuring that investors have the confidence they need to do business in the UK Continental shelf.
"Throughout the current negotiations, the OCA has been in constant dialogue with the relevant trade unions in an attempt to reach a mutually acceptable position.
"These negotiations are ongoing and we are committed to doing everything we can to reach an agreement."
In July, hundreds of North Sea workers went on strike over plans to cut their pay and allowances.
The action was taken by members of the RMT and Unite unions employed by the Wood Group on Shell platforms.
It was the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore oil and gas industry in almost 30 years.
