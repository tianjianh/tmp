Northumbria PC sacked over indecent child images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Northumbria Police officer has been sacked after downloading indecent images of children, the force said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Paul Sharp, from North Tyneside, was dismissed after receiving a suspended jail term by magistrates last month.
The 34-year-old admitted two counts of making indecent images of children and one of possessing extreme pornography.
In a statement, the force said it "completely condemned" PC Sharp's actions, which had been dealt with by its Professional Standards Department.
The statement added: "Both we and the public quite rightly expect the highest standards from our police officers and staff.
"When the behaviour of one of our officers falls below our high standards we investigate thoroughly and take appropriate action, which in this case led to Paul Sharp being dismissed from Northumbria Police."
