West Yorkshire men admit Makayabella cocaine plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men charged in connection with a £160m drugs haul off the coast of Ireland have admitted conspiracy to import cocaine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The luxury yacht Makayabella was intercepted in September last year after crossing the Atlantic.
David Webster, 44, of Rillmead, Otley, and Philip McElhone, 29, of Freemantle Place, Leeds, both appeared via video at Leeds Crown Court.
Both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import Class A drugs.
The two men were remanded in custody by Judge Guy Kearl QC until sentencing in September.
It is believed the drugs, which came from Venezuela, would have had a street value in excess of £160m.
The Makayabella was intercepted in poor condition by Irish authorities in the Atlantic Ocean, 200 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland, while investigators also seized a 25ft (8m) motor boat called Sea Breeze, moored in Pwllheli, north Wales.
