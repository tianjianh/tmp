Campaigners hoping to overturn Alistair Carmichael election to lodge papers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners hoping to overturn the election of Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael are heading to the Court of Session in Edinburgh to lodge legal papers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Carmichael has faced calls to resign over the leak of a memo which wrongly suggested Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.
More than Â£40,000 has been raised online to fund legal representation.
The MP won the support of his local party earlier this week.
Two islanders in Orkney, one of whom is an SNP member, have raised more than Â£40,000 through an online crowd-funding website to pay for legal representation.
Mr Carmichael has admitted an error of judgement, but opponents believe the truth about his involvement in the leaking of the memo could have altered the result in his constituency, where he finished just over 800 votes ahead of the SNP.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats have said that Mr Carmichael will not face any party disciplinary action over the matter.
The SNP have been calling on Mr Carmichael - the only remaining Lib Dem MP in Scotland - to consider his position.
An official Cabinet Office inquiry found he approved the leak of an official memo by his special adviser to a newspaper during the campaign.
The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed Scotland's first minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband - comments Ms Sturgeon has always insisted she never made.
Mr Carmichael later said the first he had heard of the memo was when he was contacted by a journalist.
He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.
Protests have been held in Kirkwall and Lerwick calling for Mr Carmichael to quit, but he insists he has apologised, forfeited his ministerial pay-off and will continue as an MP.
The parliamentary standards commissioner is considering whether to accept a complaint about Mr Carmichael's conduct, and Police Scotland has also received a complaint.
