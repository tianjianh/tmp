The Yogi Berra Museum announced that the Hall of Fame catcher had died on Tuesday evening.
Berra spent almost all of his 19-year career with the New York Yankees. He was a three-time Most Valuable Player and 13-time World Series champion.
His famous "Yogi-ism" quotes included "it ain't over till it's over".
Berra is also said to have inspired the cartoon character Yogi Bear.
Yogi Berra's greatest quotes
The Berra family said in a statement: "While we mourn the loss of our father, grandfather and great-grandfather, we know he is at peace with Mom.
"We celebrate his remarkable life, and are thankful he meant so much to so many. He will truly be missed."
Tributes have already begun to pour in from the world of baseball.
The New York Yankees tweeted simply: "We have lost an icon."
Major League Baseball tweeted: "We mourn the passing of Yankees icon and Hall of Famer Yogi Berra."
LA Angels slugger Shane Victorino tweeted: "My thoughts and prayers to the Berra Family!!! Yogi you were an icon and legend to us all who play this amazing game of baseball."
Berra launched a defamation lawsuit over the Hanna-Barbera cartoon Yogi Bear, although he later withdrew it.
The management said the name was a coincidence, but it was widely believed he was the inspiration.
Berra was born Lawrence Peter to Italian immigrants in St Louis in 1925.
He was said to have been given the nickname Yogi by a friend who saw him sitting cross-legged and looking like a meditating yogi.
He greeted Pope John XXIII at the Vatican by saying "hello, Pope", receiving the reply "hello, Yogi".
Among his career highlights were 15 straight MLB All-Star Game appearances.
He played for the Yankees from 1946-63, winning 10 World Series alongside the likes of fellow Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle.
After finishing playing he coached or managed the Yankees and New York Mets to three more titles.
