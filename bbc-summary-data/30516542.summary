[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock, from Glen Parva, who had Down's syndrome, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary on 18 February 2011 suffering vomiting.
He later suffered a heart attack and efforts to revive him failed.
Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, Theresa Taylor and Isabel Amaro are due before Leicester magistrates on 23 January.
An inquest into Jack's death was adjourned in 2013.
Fiona Morrison, specialist prosecutor with the CPS Special Crime Division, said: "Having completed our review, we have concluded there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Dr Bawa-Garba, Sister Taylor and Staff Nurse Amaro to each face charges of gross negligence manslaughter."
A spokesperson for University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, said: "We have been informed that three members of staff have been charged and will appear before magistrates in January.
"The staff concerned are not on clinical duties. The CPS have advised all concerned that further comment on this case will be prejudicial to a fair trial and hence there is nothing more we can say whilst these proceedings are in train."
