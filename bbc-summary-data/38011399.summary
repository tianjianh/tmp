Penman Engineering employed about 140 people at its Heathhall site on the outskirts of Dumfries.
Commercial vehicle builder Martin Williams (Hull) agreed a deal to buy the company this week to allow it to move into "new sectors".
Director Nick Williams said the aim was to bring the company back into operation as soon as possible.
"We are looking to re-employ as many of the previous workforce as possible," he said.
"We anticipate that the return to full staffing will be a gradual process, however we are hopeful to have a considerable number back in employment by Christmas.
"We are very keen to engage with all former employees and the local supply chain as quickly as possible to offer employment and subcontract opportunities moving forward."
A company spokesman said it intended to remain on the Heathhall site "for the foreseeable future".
Mark Ranson, of administrators Armstrong Watson, said: "We are delighted that we have been able to secure a successful sale for Penman and wish Mr Williams every success in the future.
"We must thank all of the Penman staff for their help and cooperation during the period of administration trading, which we appreciate will have been difficult for them."
