Rowe, 27, joined Rovers on loan for the end of the 2015-16 season after finding opportunities limited at Molineux and scored three times in 10 appearances.
Rover boss Darren Ferguson previously took Rowe to Peterborough from Stockport when the player was aged 19.
"I've played under Darren for quite a long time, we work very well together on and off the field," Rowe said.
Speaking to the club's website, Rowe continued, "When I first signed on loan my aim was to come here and do well, impress the fans and learn again as a player.
"I really enjoyed my time and I've signed permanently because of the ambition this club has."
