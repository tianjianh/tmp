Peregrine falcon chick in rehab after Ipswich fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A peregrine falcon chick could be in rehab for "up to a year" after it crash-landed having fledged from its nest at the top of the 23-storey block of flats.

The chick was one of five fitted with identification rings in May, having hatched in a man-made nestbox built into The Mill on Ipswich's waterfront.
The bird was found "almost emaciated" with an injured chest in a churchyard.
The other chicks and their parents are flying and feeding around the docks.
The chicks all fledged about two weeks ago from The Mill, which is 233ft (71m) high and has a nesting box fitted into the parapet on the flat roof.
The injured chick was found in the neighbouring St Peter's churchyard on 17 June.
Steve Piotrowski, from the Suffolk Ornithologists Group, said: "The bird had a bruised sternum and was very weak and almost emaciated from a lack of food - it's not strong enough to be returned to its family, who might even kill it.
"It can feed itself, but the question of whether it can successfully be taught to hunt could take up to a year to be answered - it can be a very long rehabilitation."
Mr Piotrowski said a pair of peregrines had bred three chicks at a nest on the Orwell Bridge in Ipswich, but all three had been killed after flying into traffic.
A pair of adult birds were at the derelict sugar beet factory in Ipswich, while another pair laid eggs at Felixstowe docks, but these did not hatch.
A pair of juveniles have since arrived at Felixstowe, but Mr Piotrowski said it was a mystery where they had come from.
