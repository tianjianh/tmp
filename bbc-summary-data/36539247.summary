The Norway international, 23, is their fourth foreign signing in three months.
"Signing Andrine is another wonderful addition to the club and the FAWSL," said Blues Ladies manager David Parker.
"Her stature in the game is already up there with the most promising players in Europe. We want to help her achieve the status she is capable of reaching, as one of the best players in Europe."
The signing of Hegerberg follows the arrival of three Germans, striker Isabelle Linden from Champions League holders FFC Frankfurt, full-back Corina Schroder from Liverpool and defender Marisa Ewers from Bayer Leverkusen.
They have all been signed for the second half of the Womens Super League season, which will resume for Blues on 29 June at home to Arsenal.
"I've had three good years in Gothenburg," said twice-capped Hegerberg, who has signed subject to international clearance.
"But I felt the time was ready to take on a new challenge and I can't wait to get stuck in with Birmingham."
Blues went into the mid-season break after two wins in three matches to climb to third in WSL 1, seven points behind leaders Manchester City.
