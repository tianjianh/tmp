But fellow Englishman and second seed Nick Matthew was surprisingly beaten by Egypt's Tarek Momen.
Willstrop's 11-5 11-7 11-4 victory over Colombian Rodriguez came a day after he beat world number one Mohamed Elshorbagy in Bellevue, Washington.
He will face French third seed Gregory Gaultier in his semi-final on Saturday.
It is the first time Willstrop, 32, who has slipped to world number 24 after a career-threatening hip injury, has reached the semi-finals since 2012.
"I've worked hard and for it to come together in such an important week is tremendously satisfying," said the former world number one.
"Above everything else, I'm thoroughly enjoying it and I'll try as best as I can to keep it going."
England number one Matthew, 35, went down 5-11 11-7 9-11 11-8 11-7 to eighth seed Momen in a gruelling 84-minute encounter.
The Egyptian trailed 2-1 but recovered to claim victory.
"I tried my best and left it all on there," said triple Commonwealth Games gold medallist Matthew.
"Obviously I wanted to win a fourth title but, putting it into perspective, I have a lovely wife and daughter at home and they're the most important thing."
