A young girl and her parents were found dead after the man suspected of their murders sent a friend a "concerning" text message, an inquest has heard.

Janet Jordon, 48, her daughter Derrin Jordon, six, and partner Phillip Howard, 44, were found at their home in Vicarage Road, Didcot, on 23 May.
The body of Ms Jordon's son, Jed Allen, was discovered in woodland in Oxford on 25 May following a 30-hour manhunt.
Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard it was likely he died days earlier.
The identities of the four were officially confirmed during the opening of the inquests at County Hall in Oxford.
Coroner Darren Salter described the deaths as "a sad and shocking case".
Det Sgt Ali Driver, of Thames Valley Police, told the hearing the bodies were discovered at Vicarage Road after a friend of Mr Allen called police at 20:22 BST on the Saturday night.
"He had received a concerning text message from Jed and had gone to Jed's house to try and find him," he said.
"Instead of finding Jed, he found the body of Phillip Howard and called the police.
"Phillip Howard was found downstairs. He had suffered multiple stab wounds.
"Janet Jordon and Derrin Jordon were both found upstairs and had also suffered multiple stab wounds."
Two dog walkers found the hanged body of Mr Allen, 21, in woodland close to Marston Ferry Road, Oxford at 16:40 on 25 May.
"It is still under some investigation," Det Sgt Driver added.
"However, it would seem quite likely that it occurred on 23 May as well."
Police are now studying the movements of all the victims before they died and the reasons for their deaths.
The investigation is likely to take another two months.
The inquests were adjourned and are expected to resume in the autumn, at a date yet to be fixed.
