The visitors took  a shock lead when Wales Under-21 striker Jake Cassidy headed home from a corner against the run of play, but the hosts hit back.
Wrexham equalised 20 minutes later in some style, when striker Ntumba Massanka scored a superb bicycle kick.
Substutute Rooney then scored the winner with virtually his first touch on his 200th career appearance, and added a third in injury time.
Guiseley are 22nd and Wrexham rise to 11th.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"I think we deserved three points, but it was not a great performance.
"We were not as free flowing as we wanted to be, but the character we showed was pleasing.
"The first goal comes from a great bit of skill and I thought this was the right game for him.
"We are pleased with the result."
