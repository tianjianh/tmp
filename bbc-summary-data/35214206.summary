Wales international Dave Edwards needs surgery on a foot injury which may keep the Wolves midfielder out for 12 weeks.

The injury will leave Edwards, 29, with little time to prove his fitness for this summer's European Championship.
Wolves suffered a further blow after learning that Poland's Michal Zyro, 23, faces up to eight weeks out with the calf injury sustained last week.
Meanwhile, winger Jordan Graham, 20, will undergo surgery on Wednesday on his torn anterior cruciate ligament.
He is expected to be sidelined for between nine to 12 months, whereas Zyro could be back by mid-March and Edwards will hope to be back in contention by the end of the season.
"Dave fractured his fifth metatarsal in a tackle on Saturday," said Wolves head of medical Phil Hayward. "He will need surgery early this week. The normal rehabilitation time is around 12 weeks so we expect him to be out of action until around the middle to the end of April.
"Michal has sustained an injury to his calf which is complicated. It is not just the muscle affected but the tendon structure between the muscles. We expect the rehabilitation process to be between six and eight weeks, but will be re-scanning the injury on a regular basis."
Wolves also have an ongoing concern about Bjorn Sigurdarson, who returned on New Year's Day but has only played once since and pulled out of Saturday's game at QPR after a twinge in his back.
Before losing Benik Afobe to Bournemouth for Â£10m in this January transfer window, Wolves also saw loan man Sheyi Ojo return to Liverpool.
The signings of Swindon Town winger Will Randall and Wales Under-19 international striker Aaron Collins, from League Two side Newport County, were both for the Under-21 squad.
But their main signing Zyro has scored three times since arriving from Legia Warsaw, but the injuries to him and Edwards may force Wolves to buy again.
"It's not something we've been ignoring," head coach Kenny Jackett told BBC WM, after Saturday's game. "It's something we've been focusing on heavily. It does not look like there's anyone imminent but it's tough to sell a player two weeks in, then have to do something straight after.
"It's very easy to bring in players. It's not so easy to bring in the right players. Sometimes you're better off doing nothing."
Wolves are keeping an eye on Newcastle United defender Mike Williamson, who they had on loan before being recalled by the Magpies, but he is injured.
However, they are definitely interested in discarded Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor.
