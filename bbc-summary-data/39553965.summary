Port Vale caretaker manager Michael Brown says he can understand why some supporters showed their frustration at the end of Saturday's 1-0 League One defeat at Chesterfield.

More than 700 travelling fans watched Vale suffer their fifth straight away loss to slip back into the bottom four.
But Brown believes many fans are aware of the circumstances that he is working under, with his squad hit by injuries.
"We can see they're frustrated, 100%," Brown told BBC Radio Stoke.
"The ones who look into the true problems we have are very understanding of the situation," added the 40-year-old, who is still acting on a caretaker manager basis and awaiting a decision on his own future.
The loss of defender Andre Bikey late on in Vale's defeat on Saturday, to become the club's ninth current injury casualty, was the sparking point to the fans' anger.
But Brown is now ready to risk turning as his replacement to Remie Streete, who has been sidelined for three matches with a hamstring injury, when they host promoted Sheffield United on Good Friday.
"We hope to have Remie for Friday," Brown added. "We certainly need him."
Vale have only won three times in 2017 - but all three have been in the past month, in a run of good home form that has brought them 10 points out of a possible 12 at Vale Park.
Their biggest home test to date comes on Friday against the Blades, one of Brown's old clubs and the likely League One champions.
"Other teams are beating teams who are higher in the table," he said. "That's what we're going to have to do in the coming weeks.
"We knew it was going to go all the way, but there are games we can still win. We need to be as positive as we can."
Vale, in 21st, are one point behind three clubs - Bury, Shrewsbury Town and Gillingham.
Brown's men have a game in hand, away at Walsall on 25 April, but Vale have the second worst away record in the division, having picked up just nine points in 20 games.
They have lost last their past five away matches, having not won on their travels since beating MK Dons 1-0 on 9 October.
