The flock of sculptures are being displayed at Cribbs Causeway shopping mall before they are sold to raise funds for  children's charities.
Aardman designer Gavin Strange, who created designs for three of the sculptures, said the project had been "super exciting and super daunting".
The sold-out event will run until 20 September.
Some 70 sheep made up the trail in Bristol with the remaining used to create another in London over the summer.
An auction of the sheep will take place on 8 October.
Sculptures featured in the London trail will raise money for Wallace and Gromit Children's Charity.
Meanwhile, the Bristol sculptures will raise money for Bristol Children's Hospital charity, The Grand Appeal.
