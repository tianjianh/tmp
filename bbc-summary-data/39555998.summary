Strip 'violent wine' monks of charity status, say secularists

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monks who make Buckfast tonic wine linked to violent crime in Scotland should be stripped of charitable status, say campaigners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National Secular Society says the beverage made at Buckfast Abbey in Devon is harmful.
Buckfast Abbey Trust does not pay tax on the income because it is a charity, which the society claims is an "abuse of the charitable system".
The trust said it was surprised at the complaint.

The trust made a record £8.8m last year from sales of the caffeine-fuelled Buckfast wine.
The society has called on the Charity Commission to remove the abbey trust's charitable status "unless they change their activities".
43.4%
of young offenders drank Buckfast before committing their offence
42% drank any kind of spirits
31% drank any kind of beer
21% drank any kind of cider
9% drank any other drinks
Its vice president Alistair McBay said: "The monks should be setting an example as a religious organisation but the opposite is happening."
"The question needs to be asked 'Are they serving God or Mamon?"
Last year the abbey said it supported alcohol education charities like Drinkaware, a fact disputed by the charity.
It has made about £88m since 2004 from royalties made on each bottle of Buckfast sold, according to the Charity Commission.
The trust justifies its existence as a charity in its annual report, stating its aim is the "advancement of the Roman Catholic religion".
In a statement, it said it would contact the Charity Commission.
A Scottish sheriff said last year there was a "very definite association between Buckfast and violence".
In 2007, the Scottish Prison Service found 43.4% of inmates had consumed Buckfast before their last offence, despite it accounting for less than 1% of total alcohol sales nationally.
The Charity Commission said it took "all complaints about registered charities seriously" and would "assess the information about the Buckfast Abbey Trust to determine if there is a regulatory role for the Commission".
