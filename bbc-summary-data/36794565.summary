Fifa issues warning to Benin over arrest warrants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifa has warned Benin over the arrest warrants issued in the country for several key officials, including Fifa Council member Constant Omari.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The warrants are for the Benin Football Federation (FBF) executive committee and a Caf observer who attended federation elections on 10 June.
All ignored a court injunction ordering the suspension of FBF elections, which went ahead in June despite the directive.
Football's world governing body says if the "decisions in question are not withdrawn by 18 July, the case will be referred to the Bureau of the Fifa Council, for it to take the appropriate decision."
Fifa disapproves of external interference in the running of a football association, having banned various countries in the past for such an offence.
The elections were held in the presence of Omari, with the DR Congo FA president acting as a Fifa observer, and his Ivorian counterpart Sidi Diallo, who represented the Confederation of African Football.
Holding the elections meant a ban from global football imposed by Fifa in May was lifted and allowed Benin to play a postponed Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Equatorial Guinea.
Benin won that match 2-1 to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for January's finals in Gabon from Group C.
The Fifa ban had been imposed after an earlier court ruling but stipulated the sanction could be lifted when elections had been held.
Anjorin Moucharafou was voted in as president once again by the 40 of the 42 delegates present.
His election went ahead despite a court having ruled it should be delayed indefinitely after it upheld a complaint by 20 of the country's football clubs.
The clubs argued that the current normalisation committee running the sport in the country had violated the statutes of FBF.
