Six Nations 2017: Roof closure decisions out of Wales' hands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales must wait for England and Ireland to decide if the Principality Stadium roof will be closed during their Six Nations games in Cardiff.

Wales asked organisers for permission to play all their home games under the tournament's only retractable roof but were turned down.
"It's now a discussion between the teams the week of the game like has always happened," said Howley.
England are Wales' first visitors on Saturday, 11 February.
Eddie Jones, England's Australian coach, said he cannot understand why the use of the roof - open or closed - is an issue.

"I don't care. It makes no difference because both teams have to play under it," said Jones.
However, Howley and his team will not know until close to the game what will happen.
"It's something that we wanted to have because of the experience one, of the atmosphere, but also controlling the conditions," said Howley.
"We understand and we respect that decision."
The Wales coach - deputising for 2017 British and Irish Lions boss Warren Gatland - also recalled England's 2013 visit to Cardiff when Stuart Lancaster was in charge of England.

The former Wales and Lions scrum-half was also in charge of Wales that season, as Gatland prepared to take charge of the Lions in Australia.
Howley said: "Stuart Lancaster rang me on the Monday and wanted the roof closed.
"If that's the case when England come to the Principality and Eddie Jones wants the roof closed that's fine.
"So it's down to the opposition coach who will dictate if the roof is open or closed."
Wales start the tournament on Sunday, 5 February and also travel to Scotland and France.
They host Ireland on Friday, 10 March.
Wales have two home matches in the 2017 Six Nations - firstly against England and then Ireland on 10 March.
