The huge white Art Deco building on Edge Lane could be transformed into a 4.5 hectare hub incorporating film and television studios, a report said.
The Littlewoods Studios Liverpool campus would include nearby Liverpool Innovation Park and the Liverpool Theatre School.
If plans are approved by the council on Friday, work could start "immediately".
It is estimated the project could create up to 900 full-time jobs.
The property was built in the 1930s for Sir John Moores and his brother Cecil to house their football pools business.
It was designed by Scottish Architect Gerald de Courcey Fraser, who also designed a number of department stores for Lewis's.
Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said the building is in "a great location to attract productions to the city".
"With this development we can support the film sector, attract inward investment and give a boost to the local economy," he added.
A report by the Film Office revealed that, in 2014-2015, the city missed out on a potential £20m filming revenue due to capacity issues in the city.
Projects filmed in the city recently include feature film Florence Foster Jenkins starring Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant, Stephen Poliakoff drama Close to the Enemy, supernatural crime drama Houdini and Doyle and Sky's new drama The Five.
The former Littlewoods Pools Building has been empty since 2003, although developer Capital and Centric has recently completed a £4m conversion of the Bunker Building to create office space for digital and creative companies.
The company will continue to work on the buildings and take direct ownership of the site.
The developer has previously submitted plans to turn the art deco building into a hotel.
