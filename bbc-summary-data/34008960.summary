National Museum of Scotland faces seven day strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Museum of Scotland is facing seven days of continuous strike action during the Edinburgh Festival.

The Public and Commercial Services union said 120 members were due to take part in the strike over the removal of a weekend allowance from staff.
They have served notice that the strike will begin on Monday.
The action is part of a union campaign, now in its 18 month, to get the allowance reinstated for all staff working on a Saturday and Sunday.
National Museums Scotland (NMS) withdrew the allowance for new staff.
Union officials said it resulted in two rates of pay for staff working weekends, those who get the allowance because they were employed before 2011, and those who do not.
Officials said withdrawal of the allowance could reduce an individual's pay by Â£2,000 to Â£3,000.
Previous strike action has closed the museum to the public.
Further talks between museum management and union officials have been scheduled for Friday.
Lynn Henderson, Scottish secretary of the PCS, said: "Our members are determined to win this dispute. It is heartening to note that the support is as strong with members who get the allowance as with those who don't. We call on NMS management and the Cabinet Secretary Fiona Hyslop to right this wrong.
"It is one thing to say that you oppose austerity measures and low pay but when it's in your gift to do something about it, for relatively little money, the Scottish government choose to do nothing about it.
"Our members are prepared to escalate action taken to date, but even at this late stage action can be avoided if we receive an acceptable, improved offer. Whether the strike goes ahead or not is in the gift of those who removed the allowance."
National Museums Scotland has previously said it has had to make a "wide range of changes in order to manage the reduced budgets which have been a result of the financial crisis."
It said it had differentially increased pay levels for its lowest paid staff in recent years, and that weekend payments are no longer common in the culture and tourism sector across the UK.
It has also said that no members of staff received a pay cut following the introduction of the new contracts, and that the terms of the new contracts had been communicated during the recruitment process and on appointment.
Responding to the potential of strike action next week, an NMS spokesman said it was likely to cause disruption to both the National Museum of Scotland and the National War Museum.
He added: "Talks involving National Museums Scotland, the PCS union and conciliation service ACAS are scheduled this week. We remain fully committed to a process of dialogue and we hope progress can be made towards a positive outcome.
"These talks were scheduled and agreed to on both sides before this action was announced, so we are surprised and disappointed at PCS's decision to call for strike action".
