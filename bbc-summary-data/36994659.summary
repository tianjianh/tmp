Guiseley 0-2 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham bounced back from their midweek thrashing at the hands of Chester with a comfortable 2-0 win over Guiseley at Nethermoor Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Daggers were beaten 3-0 on Tuesday, but took advantage of some early pressure when Christian Assombalonga finished a fine team move by heading his first goal for the club after five minutes.
Ten minutes later Assombalonga almost added a second but the former Waltham Abbey forward's lob cleared the crossbar as well as the goalkeeper.
Oliver Hawkins sealed the points 15 minutes from time by heading home from a corner to leave Guiseley still searching for their first point of the season.
