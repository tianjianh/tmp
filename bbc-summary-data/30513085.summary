As part of the Forever Faster campaign, she will be featured with the likes of Usain Bolt and Sergio Aguero.
Bjorn Gulden, Puma CEO said: "With a strong portfolio in football, running and motorsport, finding an inspiring partner for women's training was very important. Rihanna was a natural choice for us.
"We're delighted to have her as a partner, and we're looking forward to what's to come."
Rihanna's not the first non-sports star to hook up with a trainer company.
