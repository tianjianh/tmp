Rotherham CSE trial: Sex abuse 'caused victim to flee UK'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alleged victim of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham fled the country with her family to escape those abusing her, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl, now 27, went to police in 2003 claiming she had been repeatedly raped when she was 13 years old, Sheffield Crown Court was told.
Eight men are on trial charged in connection with the sexual exploitation of three girls between 1999 and 2003.
The men, accused of rape and other offences, deny the charges.
Opening the case, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the jury how the girl and her family withdrew the allegations due to threats.
The family ended up moving to Spain to get away from the men exploiting her, the prosecutor said.
She said the girl's clothes were lost by police and were not subjected to scientific analysis.
The prosecutor explained how, in April 2003, the girl had gone to police after one of the accused, Sageer Hussain, attacked her and she was examined by a doctor.
Ms Colborne said: "The family believed they were in real danger and withdrew the allegations at the time."
The prosecution said the family took two years to extricate her from the group of men and "wrote to their member of parliament and the home secretary."
Ms Colborne said the case was about "a number of women who were sexualised and, in some instances, subjected to acts of a degrading and violent nature at the hands of these men".
She said Mr Hussain "was instrumental in befriending young girls who were flattered that he and his friends spent time with them".
In relation to one girl, she said: "He used her for his own gratification and passed her on to his friends, older brothers and associates."
The case was adjourned until Wednesday.
