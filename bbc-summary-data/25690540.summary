The US state department said it deeply regretted the move and hoped that it would bring closure to the case.
The row erupted after Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York on charges of visa fraud and underpaying her housekeeper.
She was asked to leave and arrived back in Delhi on Friday evening.
The state department said it now hoped India would return to constructive ties with the US.

In requiring the US to remove one of its diplomats from Delhi the Indian government is effectively treating the departure of its own diplomat from the US as an expulsion.
The question now is whether this draws a line under the messy diplomatic spat between the two countries.
Of greater importance is the longer-term impact this may have on bilateral ties. India, a democracy and rising power in Asia, is seen in many quarters in Washington as a natural fit to become a special partner of the United States. The US has sought a closer strategic and military partnership with Delhi but to a large extent has been rebuffed.
India is cautious about advancing ties too quickly. It doesn't want to antagonise Beijing and many Indians still see the US as having been far too close to Pakistan.
Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: "We deeply regret that the Indian government felt it was necessary to expel one of our diplomatic personnel.
"This has clearly been a challenging time in the US-India relationship. We expect and hope that this will now come to closure and the Indians will take significant steps with us to improve our relationship and return it to a more constructive place," she said.
The expelled diplomat has not been named.
Sources told Agence France-Presse that the individual was of similar rank and had been involved in the Khobragade case.
India had demanded an apology after Ms Khobragade, 39, was handcuffed and strip-searched following her arrest last month. It refused to waive her immunity.
Ms Khobragade has always denied any wrongdoing.
On Thursday she was indicted by a US federal grand jury in Manhattan, but was also granted immunity by US officials, paving the way for her to return to India.
She arrived back in the Indian capital at about 22:30 (17:00 GMT) on Friday.
Her father, Uttam Khobragade, said: "We are very relaxed and happy that she is back home. We are filled with joy."
He added: "We are overwhelmed by the country's support."
Ms Khobragade was arrested after a complaint from her maid, Sangeeta Richard.
She in turn accused Ms Richard of theft and attempted blackmail.
Delhi said it was "shocked and appalled" at the manner of her arrest, and ordered a series of diplomatic reprisals against the US.
Security barricades around the US embassy in the capital were removed and a visiting US delegation was snubbed by senior Indian politicians and officials.
On Wednesday, the embassy was ordered to stop "commercial activities on its premises". India also said that embassy cars could be penalised for traffic offences.
The embassy has been told to shut down a club within its premises which includes a pool, restaurant and tennis court, NDTV news channel said.
