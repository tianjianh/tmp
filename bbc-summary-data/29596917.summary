The prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross was discovered hanged in dense woodland, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was discovered in Boston Park, west London, on 4 October, four days after the teenager's body was found.
The coroner said a post-mortem examination found the cause of death was "consistent with hanging".
The inquest at West London Coroner's Court was opened and adjourned until December.
Convicted killer Zalkalns' decomposed body was identified by his dental records, the court heard.
Coroner's officer Lana Atkinson told the court: "Mr Zalkalns was found on 4 October and his body was found suspended by his neck in dense woodland in Boston Manor Park adjacent to the canal.
"A post-mortem conducted on October 6 found a conditional cause of death is consistent with hanging. There is no evidence of third party involvement."
The coroner's officer added police were still investigating the case.
Zalkalns had served seven years in prison in his native country for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death before moving to the UK in 2007.
CCTV captured Zalkalns cycling behind Alice on a tow path on the day she disappeared.
Alice, from Hanwell, in west London, disappeared on 28 August.
Her body was found wrapped and weighted down in a shallow stretch of the River Brent on 30 September.
Alice's inquest was opened and adjourned on 10 October.
