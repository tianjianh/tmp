Kilmarnock FC face legal battle over the 'Killie Pie'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock FC are facing a legal battle with a local bakers over the naming rights for the famous "Killie Pie".

Brownings Bakery, who make the delicacy and provide match-day catering, have applied to trademark the name.
The club has owned the "Killie" trademark, which includes pies and snacks, since 1998 and will end its partnership with Brownings from 31 May.
Brownings managing director John Gall said the Kilmarnock bakery owned the pie name.
He said the club would be asked to stop using it.
The Killie Pie, which has a steak and gravy filling and a puff pastry lid, was voted the best pie in the SPFL last year.
Kilmarnock FC's company secretary, Michael Johnston, said the fans' favourite was created by another local baker and, in 2003, the club's then chief executive agreed to let Brownings use the name.
Mr Johnston said the trademark held by the club included confectionery, pies and snack foods and that the bakery was never charged for using the brand name.
The club claim that Brownings had increased their sales significantly with the Killie Pie but Brownings said the pie sales accounted for about 3% of its turnover.
Mr Gall has openly criticised Mr Johnston's running of the club in the past and backed a consortium of local business owners to take it over.
He told BBC Scotland: "Michael has a grudge against me but I've put a lot of money into Kilmarnock FC because I'm a fan."
The bakery plans to rebrand its pies as "Brownings" until the matter can be resolved.
Mr Gall said the recipe for his Brownings Pie would remain the same.
