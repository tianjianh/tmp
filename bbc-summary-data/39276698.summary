Changes to teacher training in Wales will help attract the "very best" talent to Welsh schools, the education secretary has said.

Kirsty Williams said new rules would strengthen links between universities and schools in a bid to drive up standards.
The quality of teaching in Wales had been criticised as weak by education watchdog Estyn.
Ms Williams said the move would make teaching a "first choice profession".
The Welsh Government said changes to the initial teacher training (ITE) would build partnerships between schools and universities and increase the role of research.
Gareth Evans, executive director of education at The University of Wales Trinity St David, said the move would make teachers "active researchers" rather than learning the theory in lecture halls and practising in classrooms in isolation.
He told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme the changes were "not necessarily a knee-jerk response" to Estyn's criticisms, but to get ready for the new curriculum.
It is intended for the new curriculum, proposed by Graham Donaldson, to be fully up and running by 2021.
"It is a recognition of the fact that we need new teachers who are research engaged, who are adapt at driving our brand new curriculum," he said.
Mr Evans said the changes would make schools directly accountable for their trainees, and schools could employ full-time trainers in the future.
He added: "You will have teachers who are constantly reflecting on their own practice, who want to get better, who are open to new ideas and innovations, and are research engaged.
"It's a very radical move, but one for the better."
72% of primary schools have good or excellent standards
39% of secondary schools have good or excellent standards
48% of secondaries have adequate standards
78% of primaries have good or excellent learning experiences, teaching and care support
67% of secondaries have good or excellent learning experiences, teaching and care support
39% of teaching is "good or better" in 33 secondary schools inspected
Announcing the new rules on Wednesday, the Liberal Democrat AM said in order to attract the very best talent Wales' had to get its ITE offer right.
"The teaching profession can only make its proper contribution to raising standards of education in our schools if our initial teacher training offers our future teachers the skills, knowledge and appetite to lead the change required," she said.
"This is about our schools and universities working together, using the best research available, so our teachers have the right skills to deliver our new curriculum for the benefit of all our pupils."
A special board of the Education Workforce Council (EWC) will accredit individual programmes.
Last year, Ms Williams's predecessor Huw Lewis announced reforms to teacher training in Wales, including a new two-year postgraduate course and greater subject specialism for primary school teachers.
