They were both from Buncrana.
Three other men who were in the same car were treated in hospital following the crash which happened at about 03:35 BST on Saturday.
The five friends were driving home from a night out when their car went off the road between Quigley's Point and Whitecastle.
It crashed through trees and down into an embankment.
One of the teenagers died at the scene and the other was taken to Altnagelvin hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.
Buncrana priest Fr Francis Bradley spoke to the families of the teenagers who died.
"Both Nathans were part of a wide circle of friends who often socialised together," he said.
"The families were telling me last night of how they had booked to go away for a short break together.
"Unfortunately this, amongst many other things, is now dashed by the tragic events of yesterday morning."
GardaÃ­ have appealed for witnesses to the crash.
