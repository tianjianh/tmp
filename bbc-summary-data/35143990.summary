Whitlock, seeded 10, missed two darts at a double to win 3-0 and Evans hit back to level before winning the deciding set with a 130 checkout.
Earlier, England's number nine seed Ian White was beaten 3-1 by Belgian outsider Dimitri Van den Bergh.
Phil Taylor lost only one leg as he beat qualifier Keita Ono 3-0.
The 55-year-old, winner of 16 world titles, maintained his record of never losing in the first round of the event, producing a finish of 167 and then wrapping up the match with a 121.
Taylor, who last won the world title in 2013, said: "Listen, I want to improve. I am sick of Michael van Gerwen. I am sick of getting beaten. This is my job. I could retire tomorrow - of course I could - but I want to improve."
