Relive Everton's loss at home to West Brom
All the reaction to Saturday's games
Having won their past two in the Premier League before this game, there was optimism around Goodison Park that Everton may be in with a shout for a Europa League spot, especially after seeing fifth-placed Manchester United lose.
But the Toffees were wasteful against West Brom, chalking up 34 shots in the match without managing to find the net. Only six of those were on target and they have now lost six games at home in the league.
Having had 76% possession, they could count themselves unlucky when striking the woodwork twice, but top scorer Romelu Lukaku failed to add to his 16 goals in the top flight, being well shackled by the visitor's defence.
Barkley tried to exert his influence but with the opposition back line sitting deep, the England international was made to shoot from long range.
There were a smattering of boos from the home supporters at the final whistle, frustrated that their side failed to build on their recent good form and dropping to 10th in the table.
Tony Pulis's side went into the game on the back of a poor run which had seen them looking over their shoulder at the relegation zone, but they did manage to scrape past Peterborough on penalties in the fourth round of the FA Cup in their last game.
A disciplined display against wave after wave of Everton attacks saw them pick up three points and climb up to 13th in the league, eight points above the drop zone.
Centre-back Jonas Olsson was the bedrock on which their clean sheet was based, thwarting the Merseysiders throughout the game. The Swede made a match-high 17 clearances and six blocks.
Having gone three of their past four games without a shot on target, they needed just one in this match, as Rondon's opportunistic effort from the goalline in the 14th minute gave them victory.
Everton boss Roberto Martinez: "We didn't do anything wrong. Their one shot on target ends up in the back of the net.
"The effort and the way that we play the game I couldn't fault. It is one of those moments in football sometimes that are difficult to explain."
"We have been very strong away from home and the points we have achieved is outstanding but we should base our success on making Goodison Park a fortress."

West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "Everton are a top four or five team. The depth of quality within the club is fantastic, they had a great performance to beat Stoke last week and to come here and put in that performance is fantastic.
"We played Everton at the beginning of the season and we were 2-0 up and they scored three late goals. We were distraught, so it is nice to come here and get one back on them."
Both sides are in FA Cup fifth-round action next Saturday. Everton travel to face Bournemouth (kick-off 17:15 GMT), while West Brom are at Championship side Reading (15:00).
