[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Services through the Channel Tunnel have been hit by delays due to power problems and extra passport checks.

Passengers are waiting about an hour to clear border security at Calais and a further four hours at the terminal, Eurotunnel said.
An earlier broken-down train, which had added to delays, has now been fixed. Eurotunnel is now working on clearing the backlog of trains.
It also warned of queues at Calais due to "reinforced border checks".
Earlier, Eurostar was forced to reschedule trains from Paris and Brussels heading to London St Pancras because only one line remained open in the tunnel.
