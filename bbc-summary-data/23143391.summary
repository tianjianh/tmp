Plans for a 20-turbine wind farm in the Glenkens area of Dumfries and Galloway have been officially submitted to the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burcote Wind said the Longburn project could meet the energy needs of more than 40,000 homes.
The company held consultation events earlier this year when the proposals were for up to 36 turbines.
It said it believed the development could deliver "a long-term legacy of economic benefits" to the area.
