Russia 0-3 Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales swept past Russia with a breathtaking display in their final group game at Euro 2016 to reach the knockout stages of a major tournament for only the second time in their history.

Aaron Ramsey's beautiful clipped finish put Wales ahead before Neil Taylor scored his first international goal as Chris Coleman's side seized control with an inspired first-half performance.
There was no let-up in the second half as the irrepressible Gareth Bale struck to become the tournament's leading scorer with three goals.
England's goalless draw against Slovakia in Saint-Etienne means Wales progress as Group B winners and will face the third-placed team from Group A, C or D.
News of the England result filtered through to the Toulouse crowd a couple of minutes after the final whistle, adding to the sense of disbelieving euphoria among Wales' raucous supporters.
Playing in their first European Championship, Wales take their place in the knockout stages of an international competition for the first time since a goal by Pele saw them beaten by Brazil in the 1958 World Cup quarter-finals.
There was security in the knowledge a draw was probably enough, while even a defeat coupled with an English win against Slovakia could have seen them progress as one of the best third-placed teams.
Yet Coleman and his players did not want to rely on anyone else. With their destiny in their own hands, Wales wanted to take care of business in Toulouse.
They did so in spectacular fashion, overwhelming a ponderous Russia side with one of the most impressive performances in Welsh football history.
Coleman raised a few eyebrows by selecting striker Sam Vokes ahead of Hal Robson-Kanu. The decision, though, paid off handsomely as the Burnley forward provided the central pivot for a rampant attacking display from Wales.
His inclusion allowed Bale to torment Russia's defence in his roaming role, wreaking havoc as he ran relentlessly at Sergei Ignashevich and Vasili Berezutski, a centre-back pairing with a combined age of 70.
Ramsey revelled in an advanced position similar to Bale's, with Russia's high-octane but high-risk pressing game allowing Wales too much space.
Joe Allen exposed those gaps with a brilliant assist for Wales' opening goal, controlling the ball with a backheel before carving open the Russia defence with a pass for Ramsey, who delicately lifted his finish over the onrushing Igor Akinfeev.
The second goal came from an unexpected source as Taylor, whose last strike was for Wrexham against Grays Athletic in the Conference in 2010, found himself unmarked at the back post.
His uncertain first effort was blocked by Akinfeev but he converted the rebound.
Leonid Slutsky's side could not recover, and their elimination was sealed when Bale flicked the ball with the outside of his left boot and into the net despite a touch from Akinfeev.
Wales boss Chris Coleman: "The three points are massive for us but the performance was even sweeter than the points.
"My players were brave. I don't mean without the ball; I mean brave in possession. We were brilliant without the ball against England, but with it, we didn't play like we know we could.

"I'm absolutely made up for the players. This group are on their way to more success and this is just part of the journey they are on.
"We have to see who we get next but we play with no fear. When we play like that, why should we have any fear?"

With their country having been absent from major tournaments for 58 years, several of the estimated 20,000 Wales fans would have been forgiven for being content with qualifying for Euro 2016.
However, it has been a constant refrain from Coleman, Bale and others that Wales were not travelling to France to make up the numbers as happy tourists.
Wales are here to defy expectations and they will view their last-16 fixture, whoever it may be against, as an opportunity to provide their hitherto success-starved fans with yet more memorable moments.
