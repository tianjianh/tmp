Moves to approve a major revamp of an Oxfordshire shopping centre have been described as "terrible" by campaigners.

Multi-million pound plans to redevelop the West Way shopping centre in Botley have been granted planning permission following years of negotiations.
The proposals include 149 homes, a 122-bedroom hotel, 262 student flats, a new community building and a new church.
Almost 350 residents have raised objections to the plans.
After the decision, Diane Harris said on Facebook it was "a very sad day" and "a terrible decision", while Jim Mower added that it was "the beginning of the overdevelopment of Botley".
Campaign group West Way Community Concern said the plans would cause "demonstrable harm to the local area, by nature of its excessive height and massing".
But developer Mace, which hopes to complete the scheme in 2019, said it was an "innovative sustainable development proposal that's capable of taking Botley Centre into the future".
