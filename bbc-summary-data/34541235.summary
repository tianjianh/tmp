Between 2011 and 2014, the five health trusts settled a total of 570 cases.
In many cases, the total amount paid to lawyers and other experts such as architects and accountants dwarfed the settlements to patients.
The fees have been defended by the directorate of legal services who are solicitors for the Health Service.
BBC News NI Health Correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly reports.
