The 30-year-old scored three goals in 32 appearances last term as the Lilywhites reached the semi-finals of the League One play-offs.
Beavon has made 69 appearances in total for the League One side since joining from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012.
"This club has what it takes to get promoted," said Beavon, who began his career with non-league Didcot.
"Having been involved at Preston in the play-offs last season, I didn't really want to leave League One, but having seen what this club can do I'm really looking forward to joining up with the lads and getting started."
Meanwhile, midfielder Joe Doyle and winger Marcus Harness, both 18, have signed their first professional contracts with the Brewers.
Doyle has agreed a one-year deal, while Harness has signed for two years.
