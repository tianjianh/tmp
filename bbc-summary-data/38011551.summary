Brazil international Coutinho, 24, has been influential in helping the Reds go top of the Premier League table, scoring five league goals and making five assists.
His form has led to links with Spanish sides Barcelona and Real Madrid.
"My opinion is that he fits really well here," said Klopp.
"We all hope and think his future is here at Liverpool.  What everybody forgets about Phil is that he is still very young. At 24, he has a long way to go and lot of space for improvement.
"He is now at the age where skills and mixture with experience give him more consistency. With the team-mates around, he is getting better and better. I'm sure he has only started so that's all good."
Liverpool have made their best start to a Premier League season since 2008-09, with 26 points and 30 goals after 11 games. They travel to Southampton on Saturday in their next Premier League outing.
Klopp is not concerned about the spending power of Europe's biggest clubs tempting his players away from Anfield.
"At the end, it will not be money. If there is a club who can play double what we pay then I bring the player there," said the German manager.
"Who am I to say 'no, don't think about your family, kids, grandkids and all that stuff'. But I don't know a lot of clubs in the world who can do this.
"We have to create an atmosphere in and around the club where no-one wants to leave.
"At this moment, I am not worried about anything. The players like to be here. It is a job and our job that it stays like this."
