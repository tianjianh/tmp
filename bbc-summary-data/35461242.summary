Four prison officers have been injured during "an incident involving a prisoner" at Maghaberry jail on Sunday, the Department of Justice has said.

The department's spokesman would not give any details of what happened but confirmed one of the officers received medical treatment for her injuries.
Democratic Unionist Party MLA Edwin Poots has claimed one of the officers was scalded when a kettle of hot water fell during a struggle with an inmate.
He said the jail was under-staffed.
Mr Poots is a former Stormont minster for health and public safety and a current member of Stormont's justice committee.
On his Twitter account on Sunday, he wrote: "A prison officer scalded with hot water and five colleagues injured. How long is the SMT [senior management team] and Minister going to drag their feet."
He told the BBC that under-staffing in the high-security County Antrim jail was creating dangers for both staff and inmates.
In a statement on the latest incident on Sunday afternoon, the Department of Justice said: "In line with Prison Service policy, a full investigation will now be carried out."
A prison inspection report last year said Maghaberry prison was "unsafe and unstable" for prisoners and staff.
Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show revealed that prisoners were attacked by other inmates more than 800 times in Northern Ireland jails over the last three years, almost half of them in Maghaberry.
