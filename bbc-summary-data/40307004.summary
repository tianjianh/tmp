Drunk driver 'hit 100mph in fog' on A6 near Bedford

A judge has told a woman who crashed a stolen car after driving at 100mph (160kmh) in fog without lights it was a "miracle" nobody was killed.

Natalie Walsh, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 14 months after admitting aggravated vehicle taking.
Hairdresser Walsh took the keys to her uncle's Ford Mondeo as he and his wife slept, Luton Crown Court heard.
The court was told Walsh, who was also banned from driving for three years, was trying to "change her lifestyle".
Rachel Law, prosecuting, told the hearing how the defendant had been offered a place to stay by her aunt and uncle before the incident.
But on 30 October 2016, after drinking wine, lager and whisky, she took her uncle's car keys and drove onto the A6 near Luton and headed northwards towards Barton.
Police tried to stop her but she continued to drive northwards on the A6, overtaking dangerously and increasing her speed, the court was told.
By the time she reached Elstow she had two flat tyres and black smoke was pouring out of the vehicle, the court was told.
"She misjudged a roundabout and crashed. She was unconscious and the air bags had been deployed," said Miss Law.
A blood test later showed she was twice the legal alcohol limit.
Jane Anderson, defending, said Walsh had been leading a productive life as a mother and hairdresser, but got involved with someone who introduced her to drugs.
"She is working very hard to change her lifestyle," said Ms Anderson.
Judge Philip Bartle QC told her: "For completely incomprehensible reasons you decided to take your uncle's car and drive in a way which was so appalling that it is nothing short of a miracle that you did not kill yourself or anyone else on the road."
