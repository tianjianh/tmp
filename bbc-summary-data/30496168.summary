[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police believe one man is responsible for two separate cash robberies on women at ATM machines in Renfrewshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 73-year-old woman was robbed at an ATM near the Cenotaph, in Paisley town centre, at about 16:00 on Saturday.
The next day, a 56-year-old woman was robbed outside the Tesco store in Newmains Road, Renfrew.
In both cases the man came up behind the women and stole the cash from the ATM. He is described as white, 6ft tall, of medium build with dark hair.
He was wearing a dark jacket and trousers, with black trainers that had a white sole.
Det Con James Craig said: "The two locations where the thefts took place are extremely busy and I am sure that there are people that saw this man approaching both victims.
"Also, if anyone was in these areas around the times of the incidents and witnessed anything suspicious, then please come forward.
"I would also ask people to be extra vigilant when using cash machines and to be aware of who is standing behind you."
