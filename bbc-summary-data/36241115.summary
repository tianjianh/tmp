Torbay mayor and cabinet system scrapped in referendum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elected mayor and cabinet system will be scrapped after a Devon referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Torbay Council has had a mayor and cabinet since 2005, but will now adopt a leader and cabinet from 2019.
The referendum was held after post holders were accused of making wrong decisions and having too much power.
But supporters of the role said it was good to have a single visible figure who was above political infighting.
The turnout for the referendum was 25%, with 15,846 votes placed in favour of a leader and cabinet and 9,511 in favour of the current mayor and cabinet system.
Conservative Gordon Oliver was re-elected as mayor for his second term, which will last four years, in 2015.
Jenny Kumah, BBC Radio Devon's political reporter, said: "The main differences between the two systems is that the mayor is directly elected by residents and has more power to get decisions through.
"Mayors cannot be removed before the end of their four-year term.
"A council leader is chosen by councillors of the winning party after an election, but councillors can vote to remove the leader at anytime."
