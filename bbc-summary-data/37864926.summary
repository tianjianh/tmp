South Africa's Coetzee hit a seven-under-par 64 to lead Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark by one stroke.
Spain's Jorge Campillo, China's Haotong Li, Italy's Matteo Manassero and Bernd Wiesberger of Austria are five under.
Willett, who needs to finish fifth to regain top spot in the Race to Dubai, said: "It's a lot better than it has been. My best is not far off."
The 29-year-old had led the rankings since claiming his first major title with the Masters in April, but was overtaken by Open champion Henrik Stenson last week.
Stenson was joint second at the World Golf Championships in Shanghai, where Willett finished 14 over par and 75th in the 78-man field.
"To be honest. after the last few weeks anything would have been good, but things are going in the right direction," Willett added.
"We're working hard, doing everything right and that's all you can do in this game. We have three weeks to try and do something special and I need to make some headway this week."
