Ricky Scott, 29, of New Basford, handed himself in after footage was released showing a man being knocked unconscious after helping two women, in March.
Michael Kane, 27, from Glasgow, who officers said was a "good Samaritan", suffered multiple skull fractures.
Scott was sentenced to two years and eight months after admitting the attack, at Nottingham Crown Court.
On 1 March, Scott had just left the Bambuu club, in the Lace Market area of Nottingham, where he had been drinking with friends.
CCTV footage shows him running up to Mr Kane, who had started to talk to two women he thought were upset, one of whom was Scott's girlfriend.
He then knocked Mr Kane to the ground with one punch.
The court heard Mr Kane, who was visiting the city for a poker tournament, had to be fed through a straw because his injuries were so severe.
Judge Steven Evans said Scott was fuelled by anger and made matters worse by claiming he was provoked by a racial slur, which was a lie.
"This was an assault born out of anger and being incensed by a man talking to his girlfriend.
"Michael Kane was no threat to you... [the attack] was unwarranted, unprovoked and vicious and you tried to blame the victim."
Scott admitted a charge of wounding without intent in June.
Det Con Sharon Lowth, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This case really highlights how devastating a single punch, a single act of violence lasting no more than a couple of seconds, can be."
