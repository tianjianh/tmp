A Cardiff-based businessman who became a computer hacker for the so-called Islamic State (IS) has been killed in a US-led coalition air strike in Syria.

The Pentagon said Siful Haque Sujan, originally from Bangladesh, was killed near the city of Raqqah on 10 December.
Sujan supported IS hacking efforts, anti-surveillance technology and weapons development for the jihadist group.
He was one of 10 IS leaders killed in air strikes.
Pentagon spokesman Army Colonel Steve Warren said: "Now that he's dead, ISIL has lost a key link between networks."
Members of the Cardiff Bangladeshi community said they were shocked and stunned and had no indication he had been radicalised.
It is understood Sujan left the UK in July 2014 and travelled to Syria.
South Wales Police Det Supt Lee Porter said: "We are unable to confirm or deny the accuracy of these reports at this time but are currently working with our partners to ascertain what has happened.
"While we understand Mr Sujan had lived and worked in south Wales, he had left the UK in 2014 thus was not a resident of Wales at the time of his reported death."
Sujan bought a house at Rhydyfelin near Pontypridd 10 years ago while he was a student and rented it out.
Former neighbours Donna and Nigel Davies were surprised at the news.
"He was a nice enough outgoing guy, always polite to us," Mrs Davies said.
"It was a hell of a shock - living next door to someone like that for four years and not knowing anything about it."
