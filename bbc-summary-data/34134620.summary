A group of five men and women were walking on Middle Meadow Walk from Forest Road at about 05:15 on Tuesday.
One of the group was approached from behind by an unknown man who assaulted him.
The suspect was described as white, 25 to 30, with a medium to stocky build and shaved head.
He was wearing a light tweed-style jacket with dark chino trousers.
The man was last seen making off towards Melville Drive.
