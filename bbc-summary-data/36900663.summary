[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gardaí (Irish police) investigating the murder of Denis Donaldson in County Donegal in 2006 have arrested two men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men, one of whom is in his 40s, the other in his 70s, were arrested in the county on Tuesday and are being questioned by police in Letterkenny.
Denis Donaldson was shot dead in April 2006  in a remote cottage in the hills of Donegal's north west coast.
Three years later, the dissident republican Real IRA claimed responsibility for the killing.
His death came months after he was exposed as an agent who had worked for police and MI5 for 20 years.
Mr Donaldson was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics.
Following the Good Friday Agreement and the eventual devolution of power to Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein appointed Mr Donaldson as their key administrator in the party's Stormont offices.
His family took legal action  against officials in the Republic of Ireland in April, after an inquest into his death was adjourned for the 19th time.
