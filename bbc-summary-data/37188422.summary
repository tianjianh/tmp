A shed replica of the Millennium Falcon cockpit from Star Wars has been vandalised during a raid on a charity-run farm.

All of the windows on the shed - a finalist in the national Shed of the Year competition - have been smashed.
A bird was also found dead in an aviary following the raid at Stonebridge City Farm in Nottingham. Staff believe it could have died of fright.
It is the second time the farm has been targeted over the past few days.
Marie Rogers, the farm's manager, said the Star Wars shed was in the play area and used by children who "loved" it.
She said: "Everybody's devastated, we work a lot with adults with disabilities and others who work hard to maintain the farm.
"It's mindless vandalism instead of watching the Great British Bake Off."
She said cameras are installed but thinks the vandals evaded them.
"People are offering to come and sleep here with their dogs," she added.
The farm was initially broken into on Sunday evening, when vegetables were smashed up and every shed was broken into.
Staff then left the farm at about 17:30 BST on Wednesday and returned at 08:30 the following morning to find further chaos.
As well as the shed being smashed up, the chicken houses had been overturned, while the birds were sleeping inside, and chickens and turkeys had been let out of their cages.
Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
