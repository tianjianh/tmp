The 25-year-old German scored 11 goals in 56 appearances for the R's after joining from Mainz in July 2015.
Polter had a successful loan spell with Union Berlin during the 2014-15 season.
"I am sorry to lose Seb. He is a great professional and has an attitude that I love," Rangers boss Ian Holloway told the club website.
Polter's departure comes a day after Brazilian midfielder Sandro was transferred to Turkish side Antalyaspor.
Dutch midfielder Tjaronn Chery is still in talks about a move to the Chinese Super League.
