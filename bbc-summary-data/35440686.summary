£4m Hay Castle plans submitted for approval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £4m restoration and renovation of a Powys castle have been submitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hay Castle Trust bought the site in 2011 and architects have spent the past year working on the project.
It will include creating a route which links the castle and Hay-on-Wye town.
If Brecon Beacons National Park Authority approves the plans when it meets in March, building work could start at the end of the year and be complete by early 2018.
