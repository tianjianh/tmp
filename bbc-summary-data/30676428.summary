FA Cup Rewind: Relive the 1988 Wimbledon-Liverpool final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Liverpool prepare for Monday night's FA Cup third-round trip to face League Two side AFC Wimbledon, let BBC Sport take you back to the 1988 final with FA Cup Rewind.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From 14:00 GMT on Monday we will rerun, in full and 'as live', the highs and lows of the classic final between the Crazy Gang and the Culture Club.
If you've never seen the match before you'll enjoy the traditions of Cup final day - from reporters at the team hotel to the huge marching band on the pitch - the 'physical' tackling of the late 1980s and the easy life of a defender before the backpass rule was enforced.
Thanks to the BBC's innovative live technology, you will be able to watch or relive the final as though it is unfolding for the first time, as the match is replayed in full, including 'live' video and full text commentary.
There will also be the chance to see the original BBC presentation from Des Lynam, and punditry from Jimmy Hill and Bob Wilson.
Keep your eyes peeled for special guests including the parents of Liverpool winger John Barnes and comedians Les Dennis and Russ Abbot.
The match will be available to watch across four screens - PC, tablet, mobile and connected TV - from bbc.co.uk/facup or through the BBC Sport apps for mobiles, tablets and connected TVs.
You will also be able to get involved with the action as it happens through social media - just like every matchday on the BBC Sport website.
Coverage starts at 14:00 GMT with the match kicking off at 15:00 GMT.
