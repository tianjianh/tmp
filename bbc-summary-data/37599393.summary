Huddersfield Town 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town missed the chance to go back to the top of the Championship after losing to Sheffield Wednesday in the Yorkshire derby.

Fernando Forestieri scored the only goal from the spot after Rajiv van La Parra handled Tom Lees' shot.
Huddersfield, who would have gone top with a win, went close to an equaliser when Elias Kachunga's effort was cleared off the line by Daniel Pudil.
Forestieri and David Jones had earlier both hit the woodwork for the Owls.
Huddersfield went into the game boasting a 100% record at the John Smith's Stadium this season after winning all five of their previous home league games by a single goal.
But their first home defeat of the season in front of a record league crowd at their ground of 22,368 sees them remain third in the table, a point behind leaders Norwich, while Sheffield Wednesday climb to seventh after their fifth win in seven matches.
The Owls began the brighter and saw Jones clip the top of the bar with a cross-shot in the opening minutes, although it was Huddersfield who had the better first-half openings as Keiren Westwood saved from Kachunga and Kasey Palmer.
Forestieri clipped an effort against the post when clean through straight after the break but made no mistake when he sent Terriers keeper Danny Ward the wrong way from the spot to score on his fourth successive visit to Huddersfield.
And although Kachunga went close to earning his side a point, Liam Palmer should have made it 2-0 in stoppage time only to shoot straight at Ward when unmarked inside the box.
Huddersfield manager David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"I have no complaints with the performance - it wasn't outstanding but it was good - but we're disappointed with the result
"If two strong sides play against each other then it's even and tight and one situation decides the game, and unfortunately it was a situation for Sheffield Wednesday.
"We did a lot of things right and I can accept this result because we tried everything. Sheffield Wednesday are one of the best sides in the division and we were competitive against them."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal told BBC Radio Sheffield:
"It was a fantastic win. Huddersfield are a very good team, they have a good dynamic and cause their opponents problems.
"But I think today they played against a team that was ready to play them and because we were ready they found it difficult to create chances.
"Huddersfield had more of the ball but we controlled the game and created the more clear chances. We deserved to win."
