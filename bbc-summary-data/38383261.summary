John Sheridan: Notts County boss gets five-game touchline ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County boss John Sheridan has been given a five-match touchline ban by the Football Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was sent to the stand in his side's 2-0 defeat by Wycombe on 10 December.
The ban starts immediately, meaning Sheridan will have to watch Tuesday's FA Cup second-round replay with Peterborough from the stands.
The former Chesterfield and Oldham boss admitted on Monday that his job was under threat after six successive League Two defeats.
Notts are 20th in the table, just one point above the relegation zone having lost 11 of their 21 league matches.
