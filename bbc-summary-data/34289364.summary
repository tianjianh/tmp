[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland has announced its intention to run for UK City of Culture in 2021.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A programme of performances and events is marking the launch of the bid, which is being driven by the MAC Trust, a music, art and culture charity.
Organisers hope venues such as the Glass Centre, the Museum and Winter Gardens, and the Empire Theatre will help it bag the title.
The status, awarded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, provides a substantial boost to the economy.
It was held by Derry-Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in 2013, and Hull is the next one in 2017.
