Jones, 22, joined Blues in 2015 but did not make a first-team appearance.
He moved to Port Vale in August but his loan deal expired this month.
"As soon as I knew a team the size of Bradford were interested in me, I was always drawn to them more than the other teams interested in me," Jones told the Bantams' club website.
"It was good to get out on loan and get some first team experience. I've taken my chance and managed to get a move to Bradford."
Bradford's fellow League One club Vale had wanted to sign Jones on a permanent deal, but chairman Norman Smurthwaite said on Twitter that they could not agree personal terms.
