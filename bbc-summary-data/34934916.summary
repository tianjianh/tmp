[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby abuse father jailed at Truro Crown Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who inflicted life-threatening injuries on his baby has been jailed for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The child was taken to hospital in September 2013 with injuries likened to those caused by "a high speed car accident", Truro Crown Court heard.
His father was found guilty in October after initially denying involvement.
The mother of the baby was found not guilty of all charges. Neither the man, woman, nor the baby can be named for legal reasons.
As well as bleeding to both sides of the brain, the baby's right leg swelled to double the size of his left leg and he had suffered multiple fractures, the jury was told.
The father told the court he "fell in love with his son as soon as he was born" and he "meant everything to him".
He told police the baby may have been injured by another child being rough with him or that they might have happened when he was taken out of his car seat.
However, Dr Eleanor McCartney, a child protection doctor at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, said the thigh break must have been non accidental and the  injury was the kind normally caused by a high speed car crash or fall from a significant height.
She said the injuries were "extreme" and not caused "by normal or even rough handling of a child".
The father was found guilty of one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent but was cleared of one count of grievous bodily harm with intent.
The mother was found not guilty of four counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, four counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm and one count of allowing or causing injury to a child.
The baby has since made a full recovery.
