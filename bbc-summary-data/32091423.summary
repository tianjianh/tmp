Debbie Jevans has resigned as chief executive of England's World Cup 2015 organising committee, citing personal reasons.

Jevans was director of sport at London Olympic organisers Locog before taking on the World Cup post in October 2012.
A Rugby World Cup organising committee statement said Jevans leaves "with plans in excellent shape" and more than "1.9m tickets sold".
Jevans said: "This is the right decision for me to make at this time."
Stephen Brown will become the new managing director and working alongside chairman Andy Cosslett.
Cosslett said Jevans' "legacy will be seen during and after the tournament is delivered".
Jevans added: "I am immensely proud of the team and all that we have achieved in the time that I have been chief executive.
"Everything is in place to ensure that this is the best Rugby World Cup ever, and I am confident my team will deliver an exceptional tournament."
The 48-match tournament begins on 18 September when England play Fiji at Twickenham.
