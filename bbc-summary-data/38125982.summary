The body of Trevor Hadlow, 70, was discovered at an address in Capstone Road, Gillingham, on Tuesday morning.
His family said: "Trevor was quite a character, who enjoyed the outdoor life. He was always willing to help out friends and neighbours."
The teenager, from Sheerness, has been remanded in custody and will appear before magistrates in Medway on Monday.
He has also been charged with attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving.
The additional charges related to an incident in High Street, Eastchurch, on 8 July in which a traffic warden was injured, Kent Police said.
