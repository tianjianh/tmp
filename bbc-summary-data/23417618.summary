A pensioner who has spent 13 days camped on a bench outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, waiting for the birth of the royal baby, said he was "relieved" the wait was finally over.

Royal Family fan Terry Hutt, 78, from Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, has become known as "The Union Jack Man".
"Being here has been like a holiday and totally overwhelming," he said.
Mr Hutt plans to stay until he sees the baby and said he hoped it might be named Prince Terence, after him.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby was born at 16:24 BST on Monday, weighing 8lb 6oz.
His name is yet to be revealed.
Mr Hutt, a fan of the Royal Family since the age of four, arrived outside St Mary's Hospital two weeks ago, and decked his bench and himself in Union Jack regalia.
He has left his post only once, when his wife told him to return home for a bath.
"It's been worth every minute," Mr Hutt said.
"You're sitting at home and watching or listening to the news, and I'm right here."
Mr Hutt hopes to hand a homemade congratulations card to the Royal Couple when they leave the hospital.
"The only other thing I would like of course, is to hold the baby. You never know," he said.
"I have suggested they call it Prince Terence Norman, after me. But it will probably be George."
Meanwhile, the mayor of Cambridge, Paul Saunders, said the city would celebrate its new prince in an unostentatious "practical way for a down-to-earth couple".
A donation will be made to East Anglia's Children's Hospices (Each) of which the duchess is patron.
Its chief executive, Graham Butland, said he was delighted, and added: "On 22 July, 15 years ago, Each was born as a charity so we're really delighted that her Royal Highness's first child will forever share its birthday with Each."
Children at the Milton, Quidenham and The Treehouse hospices are making congratulatory cards which are to be sent to the duke and duchess.
A Cambridge pub - visited by the couple on a recent visit to the city - has placed a baby chair in the bar, and said the spot would "forever be reserved for the prince".
A punt company is planning to name a vessel after the baby and said the prince could take the boat out "whenever he wished".
In the meantime, Mr Hutt he said he hoped the baby would leave the hospital sooner rather than later, so he could pack up his belongings, clear up his "royal bench" that has been home for 13 days, and "go home to see my own family".
