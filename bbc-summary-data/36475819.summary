[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Gary Miller and goalkeeper Paul Gallacher have rejected contract offers as midfielder David Wilson has signed a new deal with Partick Thistle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frederic Frans had announced on Monday that he was leaving and has returned to Belgium to re-sign for Lierse.
The 29-year-old Miller joined Thistle last summer after leaving St Johnstone and made 24 appearances.
Gallacher had only played once, but the 36-year-old was also goalkeeping coach with the Premiership club.
The former Scotland international, who joined Thistle after leaving Ross County in 2013, had fallen to third choice behind Tomas Cerny and Ryan Scully at Firhill.
Wilson, who came through the club's youth ranks, made only 12 appearances last season, but the 21-year-old started in the final two games of the season and has agreed a one-year contract extension.
