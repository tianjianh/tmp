On Tuesday afternoon a large part of the building collapsed ahead of a planned demolition.
The Revd Hannah Reynolds of St Peter's Church, Didcot, said: "It's weighing very heavily on the community. It's a feeling of agony of not knowing."
A search operation is still under way at the site as rescuers try to locate the missing workers.
The exact cause of the collapse which claimed the life of Michael Collings, 53, from East Cleveland,  area is still unknown.
Revd Hannah Reynolds, who also led prayers for the rescue workers at a service earlier, said: "It's been very shocking.
"We've had a number of things happen in Didcot in recent years and it's another tragedy that we're facing so there's almost an unbelief about it."
A book of condolence has also been opened at the town's Civic Hall.
The operation to recover the missing workers has involved sniffer dogs, listening devices and a thermal imaging drone.
