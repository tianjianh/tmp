Professional Darts Corporation chief executive Porter landed the same role with the O's under Barry Hearn in 2006.
The 37-year-old left the National League side in October 2014, following Francesco Becchetti's takeover.
"This is a time for us to look to the future and there's a great buzz around the place," he told the club website.
"Everyone knows how difficult things have been and that cloud has now been lifted."
