The 23-year-old has not played a single game for Town this season.
He joined the Championship side from Southampton in June 2011 and has made 67 appearances in total for them.
"It is important that we have the right balance in the team as I have felt that the balance has not been correct in the last couple of weeks," Chesterfield boss Paul Cook told the club website.
