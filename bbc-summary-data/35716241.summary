Nev Edwards has become the latest Sale Sharks player to sign a new two-year deal with the Premiership side.

The 28-year-old winger joined Sale at the start of the season on his first professional contract after impressing during a pre-season trial.
Edwards was playing in the third tier of English rugby at Rosslyn Park last year, but his eight tries make him the Sharks' top scorer this season.
"Nev's been a revelation, hasn't he?" said director of rugby Steve Diamond.
"He's a fantastic example of somebody who asks for an opportunity, gets an opportunity and takes it with both hands.
"I'm really delighted he's signed and he can settle up here now properly."
Edwards joins Johnny Leota, Peter Stringer, Sam James, David Seymour, Will Addison and Mark Jennings in signing new deals over the past month.
