[SN]TITLE[SN]
Emma Duffin took £89,416 from Bannvale Credit Union

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim woman has admitted frauds and taking almost £90,000 from the credit union where she worked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emma Duffin, 39, from Rasharkin, faced five charges of theft and 12 of fraud from Bannvale Credit Union.
She pleaded guilty to all the charges, apart from two her defence said referred to loans for her husband.
Duffin stole a total of £61,416.96 and submitted applications for loans to the credit union totalling £28,000 between November 2004 and April 2009.
Antrim Crown Court was told that the defendant, from Church Meadows in the village, worked as a clerk in Bannvale Credit Union and like all clerks looked after her family's business transactions which appeared to be unsupervised.
Duffin therefore submitted loan applications for members of her own family and then kept the money herself.
Her defence barrister said that her actions coincided with a time when she was suffering from post-natal depression and told the judge money had been spent on her children's clothes and holidays.
Her defence also said she had no savings and had significant debts from this period when "her spending was out of control".
The judge, who freed Duffin on continuing bail until her sentencing next month, told her: "You have pleaded guilty to very mean offences and I can see by your face that you are very ashamed of your actions.
"I strongly advise you to work with probation and tell them the reasons that drove you to this sort of behaviour".
He also told Duffin that she was "always going to be found out eventually."
