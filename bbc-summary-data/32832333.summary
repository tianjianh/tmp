[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unemployed man murdered his mother before fleeing to Spain, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Heiss, 30, from Surbiton, is accused of strangling 58-year-old Margaret Sheehy at her home in Springfield Road, Kingston, in 2012.
Ms Sheehy was found dead the day before Mr Heiss used her credit card to travel to Europe by Eurostar, the Old Bailey heard.
Mr Heiss denies murdering Ms Sheehy on 11 June 2012.
Prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC told the jury Mr Heiss went on to use his mother's bank cards in San Sebastian before being extradited from Spain to stand trial.
Ms Sheehy, a telemarketing executive, had been planning to sell her flat and live mortgage-free in Bournemouth or Spain, the court heard.
The jury was told she had considered paying off some of Mr Heiss' debts after he had had some financial difficulties and was living on benefits.
However, the mother-of-two told colleagues she had changed her mind and was going to stay in her flat and continue working, the jury heard.
Mr Heiss, who had resigned from a job at Waitrose, was Â£200 overdrawn in one bank account and had Â£2.82 in his current account, the court heard.
The trial continues.
