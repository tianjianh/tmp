Giant Lenin 'head' unearthed 24 years after burial in Berlin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The giant head of a statue of Russian revolutionary Lenin has been unearthed, 24 years after it was buried in a German forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Workers dug up the granite structure from woodland outside Berlin, following a campaign by historians.
The head was once part of a 19m (62ft) monument to the communist leader, which towered over the east of the city.
It was dismantled in 1991 after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the pieces were buried in a secluded forest.
The structure famously featured in the 2003 film comedy, Good Bye Lenin, about German reunification. In one scene it was airlifted through the city by a helicopter.
Lenin's 3.5 tonne head will now be transported from the forest to west Berlin's Spandau Citadelle museum to be included in an exhibition about German monuments.
It is the only part of the statue to be excavated.
