Tshibola made 10 appearances for Villa last season, with a further four during a loan stint with Nottingham Forest.
Dons boss Robbie Neilson told the club website: "Aaron will bring great experience, energy and power. He's a Championship-calibre player."
Tshibola added: "At this time in my career, playing games is the most important thing for me."
Villa signed Tshibola on a four-year contract for an undisclosed seven-figure fee in July 2016.
