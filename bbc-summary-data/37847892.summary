The 26-year-old pop star has amassed earnings of $170m (£137.8m) over the past year, mainly thanks to a world tour named after her recent 1989 album.
Adele is ranked second with estimated pre-tax income of $80.5m (£65.2m).
Madonna comes in third place with estimated earnings of $76.5m (£62m), with Rihanna following closely behind.
Beyonce is placed at five, with pre-tax income estimated at $54m (£43.8m), according to the magazine.
Swift's pole position was virtually guaranteed earlier this year when she topped Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities.
Katy Perry, ranked sixth this year, topped last year's rundown of female pop stars with estimated earnings of $135m (£109.4m).
Forbes bases its the estimates on industry information as well as interviews with managers and agents, along with data given by the artists themselves.
Here are the top 10 female pop stars on the Forbes list, which covers the period June 2015 to June 2016:
