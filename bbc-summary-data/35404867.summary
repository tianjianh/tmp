[SN]TITLE[SN]
Full inquest to be held for murdered teacher Ann Maguire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner is to hold a full inquest into the death of a Leeds school teacher murdered in her own classroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death by a student at Corpus Christi Catholic College in April 2014.
Will Cornick, who was 15 at the time, was ordered to be detained for a minimum of 20 years after admitting her murder.
West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff said a date for the inquest had not yet been fixed.
A full inquest is not usually held following a successful prosecution.
Mrs Maguire's husband, Don, has previously called for a full independent inquiry into the circumstances of his wife's death.
He said due to Cornick's guilty plea the evidence was never fully reviewed and he wanted to ensure nothing could have been done to prevent her death.
Mrs Maguire had taught Spanish at Corpus Christi Catholic College for more than 40 years at the time of her death.
A review of the case is already under way by the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board.
