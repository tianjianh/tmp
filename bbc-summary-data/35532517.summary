The French Football Federation announced on Monday that the Scots would provide their final opponents before they host Euro 2016.
Six days prior to the match in Metz, Strachan's men will meet Italy during a week-long training camp in Malta.
The Italy game will be at the Ta' Qali National Stadium on Sunday, 29 May.
That contest comes just over three months before the Scots take on the Maltese at the same venue in their opening qualifier for the 2018 finals in Russia.
France and Italy are currently 24th and 15th in the Fifa world rankings respectively, with the Scots 46th.
"It is imperative we are ready for the start of the World Cup qualifiers in September and while we would rather be playing France or Italy in the European Championship, we must prepare properly against two top-class teams who will be highly motivated ahead of the finals," said Strachan.
"Games like these will provide a focus for our players and the coaching staff. They also give us a chance to show that we are capable of competing in such company, as we did in the recent qualifiers against Germany and Poland.
"The camp in Malta has the additional benefit of allowing us to familiarise ourselves with the facilities before our opening match in September."
Scotland have already scheduled international challenge matches for March, with a trip to the Czech Republic followed by a visit from Denmark.
