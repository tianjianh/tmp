Connah's Quay high street homes set for demolition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A row of rundown terraced homes in Deeside are set to be demolished as part of plans to regenerate the area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The houses on Connah's Quay High Street are on a "key gateway" into the town.
Flintshire council has been buying houses between numbers 149-159 since its regeneration project began in 2010.
Plans for replacement housing have yet to be drawn up. An application to flatten the properties has been submitted to council planners.
The authority has been awarded more than Â£6m from the Welsh government to help to pay towards its regeneration of the wider Deeside area.
Councillor Helen Brown, cabinet member for housing, said replacement properties at Connah's Quay would eventually "stimulate further regeneration and uplift the area".
