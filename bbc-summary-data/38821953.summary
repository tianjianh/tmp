Ross McCormack & Zach Clough: Nottingham Forest sign Aston Villa & Bolton forwards

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Nottingham Forest have signed striker Ross McCormack on loan from Aston Villa and Bolton forward Zach Clough for about £2.5m on a four-and-a-half-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland international McCormack, 30, has recently been left out of Villa's side for disciplinary reasons.
The ex-Leeds and Fulham man, who signed for Villa for £12m in August, last scored on 26 December.
Clough, 21, has scored 21 league goals in 59 appearances for Bolton.
He was close to leaving the Macron Stadium 12 months earlier, but turned down an offer from Bristol City after a £2m bid was accepted by the club.
Meanwhile, Forest have confirmed the signing of Benfica midfielder Joao Teixeira, 22, who has joined on loan until the end of the season, while Reds have also signed 22-year-old Chesterfield winger Gboly Ariyibi for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.
