West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom's 100% winning start to the season came to an end as a terrible defensive mix-up between Ahmed Hegazi and Ben Foster gifted Stoke a draw at The Hawthorns.

The Baggies were on course to join Manchester United on nine points at the top of the Premier League after Jay Rodriguez headed home his first league goal for the club on his home debut.
But in attempting to clear a seemingly innocuous chipped cross from substitute Ramadan Sobhi, Hegazi and keeper Foster both missed the ball - allowing Peter Crouch to head into an unguarded net.
Prior to Rodriguez's goal there had been only one shot on target - a dipping, deflected Kurt Zouma shot that Foster was able to tip over the crossbar.
The game livened up in its final quarter, with Rodriguez looping a header on to the top of the bar and Hegazi having a close-range header tipped over.
But the Egyptian defender's costly aberration proved to be the encounter's defining moment and leaves Albion focused on the two points lost as opposed to the one gained.
The draw continues Stoke's positive response to their opening-game loss at Everton, which has seen them claim four points thanks to a home win over Arsenal and Sunday's game in the West Midlands.
The first 257 minutes of Hegazi's West Brom career suggested that Tony Pulis had pulled off a masterstroke in acquiring the Egypt international on loan from Italian side Fiorentina.
He scored on his debut against Bournemouth to get Albion's season off to a winning start and then contributed to the clean sheet that followed in another victory at Burnley.
He came close to adding to his burgeoning reputation with a header that would have made it 2-0 and sealed another hard-fought victory.
Instead, some of his good work has been undone by his first real error in a Baggies shirt.
However, Albion were always vulnerable to such a mistake as a result of their lack of a cutting edge in attack.
When fit, Rodriguez has scored goals on a regular basis and his predatory finish suggests he will do so again at his new club, but he is noticeably lacking in able support.
Central striker Salomon Rondon spent much of the game isolated, while James Morrison and Matt Phillips failed to provide an attacking threat from midfield.
It is no surprise that Pulis is reportedly to be weighing up a move for Watford forward Troy Deeney before the transfer window closes.
Fortuitous it may have been, but Stoke's leveller was reward for a display that saw them match their hosts for work-rate and resilience.
Their forward line of Jese, Xherdan Shaqiri and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting carried the greater threat through their movement and pace but too often they were guilty of over-playing in the final third.
Choupo-Moting was adamant he should have had a first-half penalty but was denied by a referee who spotted him hooking his trailing foot around the static leg of Chris Brunt.
In the end they were left to rely on West Brom's generosity and a well-placed Crouch, who ensured that the Potters avoided defeat after going behind - the first time they had done so in the Premier League since November 2016.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "I think we had the best chances. You look at the money that Stoke have invested and they are a good side. We wanted Kurt Zouma but couldn't afford that loan fee.
"That's eight or nine games I have managed against Stoke and I am unbeaten. The game here, we were the better team. It's been a great start to the season."

On deals before the transfer window "The chairman has just come in and we are hoping we can bring the players in we need. We have specific areas, and specific players."
Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "We have gone behind against the run of play and showed good character to come back. We were the team that was pushing to the end. It wasn't a high quality game - a poor game, I have to admit. But you have to stick with it. I was pleased we were able to show that mentality.
"The conditions took the edge off both sides. Warm day, long grass, no water on the pitch. At the end we will take the point. In my view we should have had a penalty for a handball but the referee disagrees."
Hughes also hinted at a few new faces before the transfer window closed adding: "The group could have maybe do with one or two to add to the quality we have. We will try."
