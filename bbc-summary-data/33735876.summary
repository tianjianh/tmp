Kleyo De Abreu, 23, from London, was killed on 21 July in Lanjaron, Granada, while jumping from the Tablate Bridge.
The Guardia Civil has charged the owner of an adventure company and a bungee jump supervisor with her death.
Its investigation found there was miscommunication between the supervisor and Miss De Abreu, who jumped before the equipment had been made safe.
One supervisor had been left to monitor 14 people taking part in the bungee jump, which was "not enough" to guarantee customer safety, police found.
It said the monitor's role was to secure the ropes and harness before authorising the person to jump.
But after attaching the harness to Ms De Abreu and moving away to tighten the ropes, there was believed to have been a "lack of communication or understanding" and Ms De Abreu jumped before being told to do so.
The police report stated: "This jump, performed before the ropes were properly tensioned...could be the cause of the accident".
Investigators believed the monitor "did not execute their function with due care and precautions", the report said.
There are two bridges at the site - a modern bridge from which bungee jumps are launched, with an ancient Roman bridge underneath.
It is believed Ms De Abreu hit the lower bridge, causing fatal injuries, when she jumped from above.
Her father Bernard Atwell described his daughter as "sweet, caring, bubbly and focused".
Ms De Abreu, an aspiring fashion student from Brixton, had been visiting her aunt in Spain, who was watching when she fell.
