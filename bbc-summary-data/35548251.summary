Top Gear presenters: Who are they?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The full line-up for the rebooted Top Gear has finally been revealed, with some names more recognisable than others. We take a look at the magnificent seven.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As a former racing driver, Eddie Jordan, 67, is well-qualified to co-host Top Gear.
Irish Jordan's career ran from 1974 to 1979, during which time he raced in a number of championships including Formula Ford, Atlantic, Three and Two, winning several races including the Irish Formula Atlantic Championship in 1978.
In 1979, Jordan retired from racing, having suffered a number of major accidents while competing. He went on to set up his own successful Jordan team in 1980. The team became Formula 3 champions with Johnny Herbert in 1987 and Formula 3000 in 1989 with Jean Alesi.
In 1990, Jordan set up the Jordan Grand Prix team and entered Formula 1.  Among its drivers were Michael Schumacher, who made his Formula 1 debut with Jordan, Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher. Jordan gained a reputation as a mentor to young talent, to whom a host of drivers owe their breaks.
He sold Jordan Grand Prix in January 2005 and has since developed a portfolio of business interests, as well as presenting the BBC's coverage of Formula 1.  Jordan has also been inducted into the Irish Motorsport Hall of Fame and in 2012 he was awarded an honorary OBE, in recognition of his services to charity and motor racing.
German racing driver Sabine Schmitz, 46, has honed her Top Gear credentials with her previous guest appearances on the show.
Driving was in her blood from an early age, as she grew up in her parents' hotel just 300m from the Nurburgring track, and has spent her life surrounded by cars and racing.
As a professional behind the wheel for BMW and Porsche, Schmitz became the first woman to win the prestigious 24 Hours Nurburgring in 1996, and repeated the feat a year later.  She also became known as the "world's fastest taxi driver" by driving passengers around the Nurburgring track in a BMW M5.
As a result of her popularity, Schmitz became an occasional motorsport guest commentator and since 2006,  she has co-hosted a motoring show on German television, D Motor, on the DMAX TV channel. She still races successfully today and runs her own race team.
Motoring journalist Chris Harris, 41, is probably best known for his popular YouTube channel, Chris Harris on Cars, which he launched in 2014 along with his friend Neil Carey, and which features self-produced and filmed reviews and content.
Harris began his journalism career at UK-based Autocar magazine, becoming their official road-test editor. He has also worked as a reviewer, writer and editor for many other magazines, including Evo and Jalopnik.
Harris's knowledge of cars - and his driving ability - comes largely from his own racing career. He's driven in a variety of race cars and types of races, achieving success in a Formula Palmer Audi in 2000. His driving experience has also included endurance races, including the 24 Hours Nurburgring, in which he last competed in 2015.
Rory Reid has been recruited to Top Gear from the show's 2015 public auditions, but he's no novice when it comes to cars or presenting.
On hearing he'd got the job, Reid said: "I've been a Top Gear fan for decades, but more than that, I live and breathe cars in a way that is perfectly compatible with the show."
Reid is an award-winning journalist, with 18 years experience specialising in cars. He is editor-in-chief of Recombu, specialising in producing car reviews. He has also written and presented for CNET UK, where he launched the company's popular Car Tech channel, receiving an Association of Online Publishers (AOP) award for Best Use of Video.
Reid has featured in a number of other car-focused television shows and had a starring role in the Gadget Geeks series on Sky 1, where he reviewed cars and consumer technology. He was also a presenter on the Fast, Furious & Funny YouTube channel.
Chris Evans
Evans is very much in the driving seat of the Top Gear team and has been heavily involved in all aspects of rebooting the show.
He has had a long love affair with cars, amassing a huge personal collection, from Ferraris to Ford Escorts. He also founded the CarFest events, held twice a year to celebrate motoring and raise money for Children in Need.
His TV broadcasting credits including Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, The Big Breakfast, TFI Friday and The One Show. He took over the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast show in 2010 and has continued to attract new listeners. He will be juggling his early morning starts with his Top Gear duties.
There was great excitement with the surprise announcement that US actor LeBlanc was joining Top Gear, although not all fans of the show were happy.
The star is best known for playing Joey in Friends for 10 seasons, winning fans around the world as the hapless lothario. He's currently starring as a fictionalised version of himself in BBC/Showtime comedy Episodes, which is set to start filming its fifth season in April. He's also signed up for a CBS comedy called I'm Not Your Friend.
The Stig's primary role, apart from being the butt of jokes, is to test the cars to their limits and instruct the celebrity guests how to handle the track in the popular "Star in the Reasonably Priced Car" segment of the show.
The real man in the white suit has changed over the years, but their identities remained a mystery until racing driver Ben Collins outed himself and was promptly stripped of his helmet.
Another driver took his place in 2010 and so far has maintained his silence.
