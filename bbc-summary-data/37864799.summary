The 26-year-old made 30 Super League appearances in 2016, scoring six tries.
The former Wakefield, Widnes Vikings, Hull FC and Leeds Rhinos player will now stay with the Tigers until the end of the 2019 season.
Chief executive Steve Gill told BBC Radio Leeds: "I've always liked him and I couldn't understand why Leeds let him go. He's been a revelation for us."
