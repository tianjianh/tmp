NHS Lothian admits mouth specialist shortage for cancer referrals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Lothian has admitted that there is a shortage of mouth doctors in Scotland for cancer referrals.

Patients have been waiting "longer than normal" for appointments with some since last year, it is understood.
NHS Lothian said it was doing all it could to recruit a new oral health medicine consultant, despite failing to fill the post after advertising twice.
Janette Howard, 52, from Edinburgh, said she was concerned she and other patients were having to wait so long.
There are 300 patients on the waiting list. NHS Lothian has been trying to recruit for the post for about a year.
Mrs Howard, a mother-of-two, told the BBC Scotland news website she had been waiting to hear from the Edinburgh Dental Institute since her doctor referred her on 6 January.
She said: "My dentist noticed white patches on the inside of my cheeks and under my tongue during a check-up.
"I hadn't noticed the patches and the dentist said because they were unusual he would refer me to the dental institute to get checked out and maybe get a biopsy.
"Then earlier this week I noticed I had ulcers in my mouth and sore gums and I called my dentist to ask if I had been referred because I hadn't heard anything from the hospital and he said he had referred me months ago.
"I was shocked when I called the hospital and was told they didn't have a consultant and that some patients had been waiting since last year. What if something was seriously wrong?"
She added: "You aren't referred for no reason so its always at the back of your mind. They always say the sooner you catch something the better so it is a concern to have to wait for an appointment."
Jim Forrest, NHS Lothian chief officer of the West Lothian Integration Joint Board, said: "I would like to apologise to patients at the Edinburgh Dental Institute who are waiting longer than normal for an appointment and reassure them we are doing all we can to recruit a new oral health medicine consultant to meet current demand.
"There is a national shortage of these specialist clinicians in Scotland and despite advertising twice, we have not been able to recruit to the post and are now exploring other options to ensure that swift and effective patient care remains the main priority.
"In the meantime, we are working with colleagues from other boards to provide some cover.
"All patients who are referred to the institute are triaged by consultants and if there is any suspicion of cancer, they are referred in the normal way to St John's Hospital for further treatment and care."
