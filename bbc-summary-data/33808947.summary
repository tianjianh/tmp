Thousands of fans are expected in Dumfries this weekend for what is billed as Scotland's largest free youth music festival.

Youth Beatz is being staged in the town's Dock Park.
Some 12,000 young people from across Dumfries and Galloway have been allocated tickets for the event.
The council-sponsored festival - organised by the Oasis Events Team - features headline acts Scouting for Girls and Union J.
Mark Molloy, the principal officer for youth work in Nithsdale, said the whole event was organised by the young people themselves and was a testament to the many volunteers.
"Logistically it is very complex to deliver an event of this scale in a park such as Dock Park where it is a huge part of the community and a community asset," he said.
"Because of that, we have to do a great deal of work to make sure the park is protected and gets handed back at the end of the event in the same state we received it."
He added that the safety of everyone attending was also a key element of the preparations.
Mr Molloy said: "The security element is hugely important when you bring that number of young people together. Parents need to feel reassured that their children can come along to an event that is safe.
"Also the young people need to feel safe when they come along.
"That's why we work with our partners from a number of agencies including Police Scotland to have a very robust security and policing plan in place which makes the event safe."
