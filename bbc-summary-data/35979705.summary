Criticised Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust 'must improve'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An under-fire health trust, criticised after a teenager drowned in a bath, has been told to significantly improve protection of mental health patients.

Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust was issued the warning notice by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) following an inspection in January.
An inquest found neglect contributed to the death of Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, at Slade House in Oxford in 2013.
The trust said it was "completely focused" on tackling the concerns.
Last year an independent report blamed a "failure of leadership" for failing to investigate the unexplained deaths of hundreds of patients.
It was ordered after Mr Sparrowhawk was found unresponsive n the bath following an epileptic seizure at the Oxford learning disability unit, which has since closed.
The CQC found the trust's investigation of incidents, including deaths, was not robust enough.
It said not enough was done to learn from incidents to prevent future risks to patients, and concerns raised by patients, their carers and staff were not effectively responded to.
Dr Paul Lelliott, CQC deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said the safety of patients with mental ill health and or learning disabilities required "significant improvement".
"We found longstanding risks to patients, arising from the physical environment, that had not been dealt with effectively.
"The Trust's internal governance arrangements to learn from serious incidents or investigations were not good enough, meaning that opportunities to minimise further risks to patients were lost," he added.
Following the report's publication, trust chief executive Katrina Percy said she had been "clear and open" about the work needed to address concerns raised.
"Good progress has been made, however we accept that the CQC feels that in some areas we have not acted swiftly enough," she said.
"My main priority is, and always has been, the safety of our patients. We take the CQC's concerns extremely seriously and have taken a number of further actions."
Earlier this year the trust said there would be no resignations.
Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, Sara Ryan, responded to the report on Twitter by repeating her call for resignations from the trust's senior leadership.
She posted: "Completely baffled the board are still in place."
"Nothing else is needed. Just action. Why the feet dragging? Astonishing," she wrote in another.
Dan Scorer of learning disability charity Mencap, said the CQC warning notice showed little had changed since the independent report was published.
"Families are being left questioning whether the death of their loved one should have been investigated and whether the death might have been avoided," he said.
"The lack of urgency to tackle this national scandal is unacceptable," he added.
The trust is one of the country's largest mental health trusts, covering Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and providing services to about 45,000 people.
