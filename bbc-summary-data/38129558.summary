The 19-year-old put in a man of the match performance after an assist for Charlie Austin's early goal.
But the academy graduate confessed his pass across goal into Austin's path may have been a mis-hit shot.
"The chance fell to me really," he told BBC Radio Solent. "It might have been a shot, but I'll take the assist."

Sims was only told he would be starting against the Toffees on the day of the game, something he believed helped settle his nerves.
"I felt relaxed really and I settled into the game really quickly with the assist obviously helping," he added.
"I wanted to impress on my debut, but most importantly, I wanted to keep it simple to begin with and work my way into the game. But, I think everyone out there today was brilliant which really helped me.
"I know what my game is and I just played how I have been playing for the under-23s and that's why I've been given my chance."
