Jeremy Bamber: Petition to release case documents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners fighting for the release of convicted murderer Jeremy Bamber have started a petition asking for documents relating to his case to be released.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bamber, 54, is serving a whole life term for killing five members of his family in Essex in 1985.
His supporters say documents they believe police withheld under "public interest immunity" should be released.
Essex Police said there had "never been anything to suggest he was wrongly convicted".
Bamber has always denied killing his adoptive parents, his sister and her six-year-old twin sons at a farmhouse in Tolleshunt D'Arcy.
He claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself.
Those who believe he is innocent say documents, including handwritten logs, statements, photographs and medical records they claim were withheld under "public interest immunity" principles, should be disclosed.
The principles can be invoked by police when material could be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution.
"As 30 years have now elapsed since the tragedy took place, there is no beneficial reason for withholding the documents and photographs by refusing disclosure under public interest immunity or for any other reason," campaigners wrote.
"The public have a right to insist that they are released to his defence counsel forthwith so that a fresh appeal can be lodged on Jeremy's behalf."
An Essex Police spokeswoman said the force had "no comment to make on these claims given that Jeremy Bamber's conviction has been subject to several appeals and reviews by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and there has never been anything to suggest he was wrongly convicted".
