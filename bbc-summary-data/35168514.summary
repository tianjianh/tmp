Conwy Bridge refurbishment to begin in new year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Refurbishments to the Conwy Bridge in Conwy will begin in the new year, the county council has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work will be done to address structural corrosion and to repaint the bridge, which was first opened to traffic in 1958 and carries vehicles on the A547 over the River Conwy.
The 20-week project will begin in January, with one lane closed at times.
Cabinet member Dave Cowans said the council will "minimise" any disruption.
The majority of the work on the bridge will take place beneath or to the side of the road surface.
Mr Cowans said: "The town is busy all year round, but particularly so during the summer season and the timing of this work is very sensitive.
"We realise the refurbishment work will cause some disruption but we will monitor the project carefully and make every effort to minimise any difficulties."
