[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Oldham Athletic have appointed Newport County boss John Sheridan as their new manager following the sacking of David Dunn.

The Latics parted company with Dunn on Tuesday after a run of seven league games without a win.
Former Plymouth and Chesterfield boss Sheridan, 51, had been in charge of League Two Newport since 2 October.
He was previously Oldham manager for nearly three years before leaving Boundary Park in March 2009.
"Everyone knows how much I love this club," he told the club website.
"I was here for a long time as both a player and a manager so I'm really chuffed and excited to be back.
"I feel like I've got unfinished business from last time and I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's a big one, but I'm really excited about it."
Sheridan's assistant Warren Feeney and first-team coach Michael Flynn will take charge of Newport for the rest of the season.
In his three-month spell in charge at Rodney Parade, Sheridan led Newport from the bottom of the table to 20th, with five wins, seven draws and five defeats from 17 games in all competitions.
The Welsh club suggested they might take action against the Latics.
"The board of directors would like to put on record their thanks for the work John has done during his brief spell at the club," County said in a statement.
"Whilst John leaves with our best wishes, we are disappointed with the way that Oldham have conducted themselves during this process and are considering our position."
Oldham were 19th in League One when Dunn first took charge on a temporary basis in September, before being confirmed in the role after a month, but they have since fallen to 22nd, five points adrift of safety.
The 36-year-old, who joined the Latics as a player last summer, won just three of his 20 games in charge.
The team failed to win a home league match under his management, and have not done so since beating Fleetwood in August.
Dunn's assistant Dean Holden and first-team coach Keith Brown have also left the club.
