Drama 'not appealing' to black and Asian viewers

Popular dramas such as Call the Midwife and Silent Witness are not a draw for audiences from ethnic minorities, research suggests.

Sitcoms too do not appeal to black and Asian people as much as white viewers.
"Members of minority ethnic groups do not identify themselves in many of our most-watched narratives," said David Graham, of TV analysts Attentional.
Its research also found that minorities "have less to get excited about from mainstream channels" such as BBC One.
Viewing preferences among different groups were deduced using viewing data from the first six months of 2016.
The findings suggest black British viewers have a "modest preference" for Channel 5 and ITV Be - home to such shows as The Only Way is Essex and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
Asian Britons are more likely to watch Sky Sports 2 due to its cricket coverage, while white European viewers tend to favour BBC Four and Film 4.
Factual dramas, football, cookery shows and US films are most likely to appeal to all audiences, the data suggests.
Overall, said Mr Graham, the research showed that "our broadcasting system seems to offer the range needed for different groups to explore their own special interests and cultures".
The findings are outlined in a short film posted this week on YouTube.
