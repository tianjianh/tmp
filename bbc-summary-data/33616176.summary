The three men, Antonio Pampliega, Jose Manuel Lopez and Angel Sastre, were working in the northern city of Aleppo.
They have not been heard from since shortly after entering Syria via Turkey on 10 July, according to the Spanish press association FAPE.
The Spanish foreign ministry said it was aware of the situation and was "working on it".
"We don't know (if they were together) doing their investigative reports in Aleppo, just that another three Spanish journalists were kidnapped in the same area nearly a year ago," said FAPE president Elsa Gonzalez.
The Islamic State (IS) group, which has kidnapped and killed Western journalists in Syria over the past year, controls areas in the north and east of Aleppo province.
The city of Aleppo has been the scene of daily fighting between forces belonging to the Syrian regime and rebel groups for more than three years.
Fighting on the ground and government air strikes have left thousands dead, and destroyed more than 60% of the Old City.
