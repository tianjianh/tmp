Here, BBC Sport looks ahead to where and when we might expect some of each day's key moments.
You can access the action across the BBC on television, radio, online, red button, connected TVs, mobiles and tablets.
Scheduled start times are in BST.
Gold medals won today: 11. Badminton (men's singles and doubles, women's singles and doubles, mixed doubles), cycling (men's and women's road races), hockey (men's final), netball, squash (men's doubles and mixed doubles).
Day in a sentence: The last remaining sports reach their climax ahead of the closing ceremony.
Highlights include:
08:30 - Cycling road race: If you go shopping in Glasgow on Sunday, be prepared for your day out to involve cyclists: the shops of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street will form the backdrop for parts of the men's and women's road races, which take on a 14km circuit starting at Glasgow Green.
Mark Cavendish had been a leading contender for men's road race gold, but a crash on the opening day of the Tour de France has ruled the Manxman out. That could create an opening for Scotland's David Miller given that he finished close behind Cavendish in last year's British Championships, held on a similar Glasgow course. Despite Cavendish's absence, the Isle of Man will still have British national road race champion Peter Kennaugh in contention, while Team Sky's Geraint Thomas will sport his Welsh colours.
Many riders are unavailable for selection as a result of pro cycling commitments; for example, Australia will be lacking Cadel Evans, Richie Porte and Mick Rogers, but the likes of Mark Renshaw will still ride in Glasgow despite participating in the Tour de France.
England's Lizzie Armitstead will have riders such as Laura Trott riding in support of her in the women's race. Scotland's Claire Thomas, meanwhile, broke her hip in June when her bike slipped on spilled diesel, but is determined to reach the start line.
10:00 - Badminton: All five individual badminton events come to a close with the mixed doubles first, then the women's and men's singles and doubles.
There's an all-England clash in the mixed doubles, with Chris Langridge and Heather Oliver taking on married pairing Chris and Gabby Adcock.
Kirsty Gilmour will become the first Scot to contest a women's singles badminton final in the Commonwealth Games when she goes for gold against Canada's Michelle Li.
Malaysia contest both doubles finals, the women facing India, the men taking on Singapore.
Parupalli Kashyap attempts to claim India's first badminton gold in 32 years in the men's singles when he plays Singapore's Derek Wong.
12:30 - Hockey: The men's gold medal will be decided by the same two countries for the second Games in a row when Australia, who beat England 4-1 in the semi-final, face India, who made the final after coming from two goals down to beat New Zealand 3-2. The beaten semi-finalists contend for the bronze medal at 10:00.
12:30 - Netball: New Zealand face Australia in the final after beating England in the last second of an enthralling semi-final. The Kiwis claimed a 35-34 win to break English hearts and will take on their rivals from across the Tasman Sea in the final for the second consecutive Commonwealth Games. England take on Jamaica for the bronze medal in a match that starts at 10:00.
13:15 - Squash: England's Peter Barker and Alison Waters take on David Palmer and Rachael Grinham of Australia in the mixed doubles, while the same countries contest the men's doubles with English pairing Adrian Grant and Nick Matthew facing David Palmer and Cameron Pilley.
