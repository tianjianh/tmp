Martin Hughes, 51, was injured in Woodhouse Park near to the Robinswood Road Metrolink stop in Wythenshawe at about 07:00 GMT.
He was treated at the scene by the ambulance service but died a short time later.
An investigation is under way to establish the circumstances. Metrolink services to Manchester Airport were suspended for several hours.
In a tribute, Mr Hughes' brothers said: "Martin was a great lover of the outdoors and loved going for long walks in the countryside and hills around Greater Manchester and beyond, he was also a keen cyclist.
"We are all devastated that he has been taken from us so suddenly."
Peter Cushing, Transport for Greater Manchester's Metrolink director, said a "thorough operational investigation" has begun and the driver and staff were being supported.
