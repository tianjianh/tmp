The Reds were beaten 2-0 as they suffered a fifth successive defeat.
Osborn, 22, told BBC Radio Nottingham: "It was shocking, especially in the second half. It was two teams low on confidence in the first half.
"They grew in the second half. At times they were playing around us and I felt embarrassed out there at times."
Fellow Championship strugglers Wigan had lost their previous six home matches, but eased their way into Monday's fourth-round draw.
Osborn continued: "Everyone is trying to come together. I just think 50-50 battles on the pitch, they won the majority, which has been the same in recent weeks.
"At the moment, we think we are better than we are. We need to go back to basics, we need to be disciplined and hard to break down, instead of being absolutely all over the place."
