[SN]TITLE[SN]
In pictures: A Portrait of British Songwriting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new exhibition by photographer Rachel King looks at the world of songwriting, picturing a number of writers alongside audio interviews by Rachael Castell. Here we present a small selection of the songwriters who offer a glimpse into what inspires them.

"I write in the bedroom, I write for the bedroom.  The places I want the music to live is for people who listen to music in their bedroom...
"Your room's everything, everyone knows that. That is the aspiration, to be part of that lineage of people who write about the outside from inside. You only have your own thoughts... that's what I consider it to mean to be someone who makes art."
"Sometimes I'll be walking along and a lyric will come to me, but normally I'm just working on the music and some idea will come.
"Then I'll start messing about with it so it's not too much by the book.
"I'm not very good at writing normal formula pop. I write songs that are a bit 'to the left'. I try and mess things up, to throw them up in the air a bit and see where they land."
"Everything is rich, everything wants to communicate with you. Everything.
"I was on a ferry last night.  There's these families coming back from their holidays, and it was the most beautiful thing, this tender moment where you get a glimpse into all these different lives.
"If you're an artist, your eyes are open to these tiny little moments that ring out so strong, it's like being struck by a mallet, and you're ringing."
"This chance we've been given - to record this album in this way and to do these shows, if we treat that as ground level and make sure not to dip from that, then we're laughing. We just want to constantly evolve and create, fun times and smile, jive, boogie."
"It's all about generating little dialogues and little antagonisms. That sparks off a process, like a connection of events.
"When it gets interesting is when you're trying to push the boundaries of those structures or trying to create textures that may be novel. You need some kind of creative friction."
"I just played guitar in my little room here at my parents' house for about two years and didn't really tell anyone.
"Songwriting has always been a private thing for me - I still see it like that. To make anything that's exciting for me, to really get the unusual stuff which is usually the most honest and interesting things, I've just got to be locked away in my room."
A Portrait of British Songwriting is presented by Wolf and Diva, in conjunction with Sonos Studio and Domino Publishing. The exhibition runs at Sonos Studio in London from 9-25 October.
