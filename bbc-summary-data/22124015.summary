Sgt Jeremy Scott of the Metropolitan Police is understood to have published a number of offensive messages since the former prime minister's death.
Sgt Scott is said to have claimed her death was "87 years too late" and added that the world was a "better place".
The Met described the comments as "completely unacceptable".
After the tweets were widely reported Sgt Scott took the matter to the Directorate of Professional Standards.
He then submitted his resignation before a police suspension over the incident came into force. It was accepted with immediate effect.
Sgt Scott had reportedly described news of the death as "marvellous stuff" and expressed a wish that the current prime minister, chancellor and home secretary were next.
Commander Allan Gibson said: "This officer's behaviour was completely unacceptable and it is right that he has resigned."
On Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron branded some reaction to the death of Lady Thatcher as "pretty distasteful".
He went on: "I think the overwhelming sense across the country - and you can see it yesterday in the House of Commons - is that we are mourning the loss of someone who gave a huge amount to this country, an extraordinary leader."
Baroness Thatcher's funeral is to be held in London on Wednesday.
