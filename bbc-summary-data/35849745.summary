[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pars' win, combined with nearest challengers Peterhead's loss to Cowdenbeath, gave Allan Johnston's side an unassailable lead.
Fassal El Bakhtaoui struck twice in the first half to put the hosts in control.
Robert Thomson pulled one back for Brechin but El Bakhtaoui completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, superbly volleying past Graeme Smith.
With so much at stake for the home side, they came out of the traps quickly and pinned back their opponents.
El Bakhtaoui made space for himself on the edge of box but his effort was blocked.
There was a blow for the visitors when player-manager Darren Dods came off injured to be replaced by Euan Smith.
And Brechin soon fell behind with El Bakhtaoui involved in the build-up and finish.
His ball across was inches away from David Hopkirk but Ryan Wallace returned it into the area for El Bakhtaoui to convert.
Smith made a terrific stop to deny Hopkirk when he was clean through but it merely delayed Dunfermline doubling their lead.
Jason Talbot's deep cross eluded the Brechin defence and El Bakhtaoui was able to volley back across Smith into the net.
A times it looked too easy for the Pars but the visitors rallied and forced Sean Murdoch into a couple of decent saves before eventually reducing their deficit.
The home defence were caught napping as Thomson latched on to a ball through the middle and slid in to find the net.
The goal rattled the large home crowd, who had turned up in expectation of claiming the title on home turf.
Wallace's second-half volley crashed off the crossbar and El Bakhtaoui smashed the rebound straight at Smith.
But the striker did get his treble and a 29th goal of the season - capping a fine performance with another fine finish.
