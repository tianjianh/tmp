The men were arrested after the 25-year-old woman filed a complaint.
Infosys said it was also investigating the "alleged incident at our Pune campus involving our partners' contractual staff".
Activist say the latest incident has once again highlighted India's inability to protect women.
The police said the men "worked in the canteen [at Infosys Pune campus], as a cleaner and a waiter".
"The woman works as a cashier at the canteen and had gone to the washroom in the evening when one of the men assaulted her while the other filmed it," police inspector Suresh Bhonsle told the AFP news agency.
Infosys, India's second-largest IT firm, said it would take necessary action against the two men.
"We have stringent security measures in place on all our campuses and have a zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment which extends to our contractual staff as well," it said in a statement.
The gang rape and murder of a student in 2012 in Delhi led to protests and new anti-rape laws in the country.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
