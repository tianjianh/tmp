The fire began around 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Monday, and the cause of the fire is not yet known.
Firefighters struggled to contain the blaze as -15C (5F) temperatures froze water lines, the CBC reported.
The damaged multi-million dollar Classy Lane Stables is widely known in Ontario's horse-racing community.
"This is devastating for our community. This is the highest loss that our community has faced by far," the area fire chief, Steven Goode, told the CBC. "Unfortunately, none of the horses could be saved."
The Canadian broadcaster said that the 50 fire fighters from five departments fought the blaze, trucking water to the site since no hydrants were located in the remote area. It was first reported by a neighbour who spotted it and called emergency services.
Puslinch is located about 38 miles (61km) southwest of Toronto.
