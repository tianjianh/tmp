His debut single Gangnam Style reached number one in the UK charts in September after becoming a worldwide hit on YouTube.
Psy, 34, will address the union on 7 November and is expected to talk about the hype and excitement surrounding the single's "horse-riding" dance craze.
He was personally invited by president of the union and Korean compatriot John Seungyoon Lee.
Both originate from the Gangnam area of Seoul, from where the eponymous hit song takes its name.
Mr Lee said it was the artist's "first ever English public speech".
He added: "Speculation and interest have been stratospheric, and we are pleased to finally confirm the rumours that Psy will be visiting us.
"With over 600 million views on YouTube, we are expecting him to attract a record turnout."
Union spokesman Finbar McLoughlin earlier said it would be a great opportunity to hear from someone "topical and current".
Band McFly, Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford and publicist Max Clifford are also due to address the union next week.
"We're expecting the chamber to be full to capacity to hear what Psy has to say," said Mr McLoughlin.
"It's great for our members to be able to welcome someone who has had a huge impact on life in such a short space of time."
Michael Jackson, the Dalai Lama, Sir Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa, Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan and Kermit the Frog are among the many famous characters who have addressed the union in the past.
