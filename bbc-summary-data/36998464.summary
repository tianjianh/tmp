With a theme of 'We are One', the parade was led by Mary Ellen Campbell, Belfast's first openly gay deputy mayor.
The Pride festival, which runs over 10 days, finishes on Sunday.
More than 100 events have showcased the creativity, arts, history and culture of the LGBT community in the city.
Festival goers and musicians gathered in Queen's Square before parading through the city centre.
The 'Pride Village', aimed at families and children, was a smoke and alcohol-free zone.
Custom House Square hosted a celebration concert on Saturday evening.
Sean O'Neill, chair of Belfast Pride, said the event is now one of the biggest in the city.
"It keeps getting bigger every year," he said.
"The point of pride is about visibility - bringing LGBT people on to the streets to challenge stereotypes and making a point that we want to be full and equal citizens with the rest of the city."
