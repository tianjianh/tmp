[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 2-2 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Whitfield scored a last-gasp equaliser in the sixth minute of stoppage time to rescue a 2-2 draw for Yeovil at Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Town had taken first blood on 47 minutes when Ryan Hedges sprinted clear and fired past Jamie Jones with his left foot.
But Stevenage winger Ben Kennedy transformed the game with two brilliant goals to put the hosts ahead.
For his first, he cut in from the right wing before beating Yeovil goalkeeper Artur Krysiak with a low left-footed shot.
He then made it 2-1 with an even better effort, curling a powerful shot over Krysiak into the top corner of the goal.
The home side looked set for all three points when the fourth official showed four minutes of stoppage time on his board.
But the referee extended the game further and in the extra added time, Whitfield volleyed in from a tight angle with the aid of a deflection to earn the Glovers a point.
