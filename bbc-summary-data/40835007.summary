[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 2-1 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Erhun Oztumer's 90th-minute winner gave Walsall their first victory of the season as they beat Oldham at the Banks's Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan McLaughlin gave Oldham a first-half lead but the Latics slipped to a third straight defeat as goals from Joe Edwards and Oztumer completed a Walsall turnaround.
Oldham took the lead on 32 minutes as McLaughlin's low cross evaded everyone in the box and trickled home.
It could have been 2-0 on the brink of half-time but Aaron Amadi-Holloway's 20-yard strike was clawed away by Walsall keeper Mark Gillespie.
Walsall levelled as a corner broke to Edwards, 18 yards out, and his deflected drive found the bottom corner.
It was all Walsall from there as Oztumer nodded wide from close range and later struck the post from 20 yards, with Amadou Bakayoko firing the rebound wide from six yards.
But the Saddlers found the winner they deserved as James Wilson's flick-on from a long throw was prodded home by Oztumer from close range.
Oldham could have rescued a point deep into stoppage time but Tope Obadeyi's bullet header was superbly foiled by Gillespie's point-blank save.
