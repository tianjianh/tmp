The rapper served eight months of a one year sentence in New York's Rikers Island jail after pleading guilty to gun possession.
The book, called Gone Till November, is due to be released later this year.
The memoirs will feature Lil Wayne's thoughts on family, children and the people he has met in his lifetime, Grand Central Publishing said.
The 29-year-old, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, has also written about his plans for the future.
Ben Greenberg, executive editor at the publishing company, said the journal would be "revealing".
"[Lil Wayne] kept detailed journals of his inner and outer life while he was on Rikers Island, and they certainly tell a story. They are revealing," he said.
The book is set to be released on 28 November 2012.
The rapper is best known for his singles Lollipop, Drop The World and BedRock - which reached number nine in the UK singles chart.
In September, his current album Tha Carter IV broke iTunes sales records.
Carter is nominated for four Grammy awards at next month's ceremony, including best rap album and best rap song for Look At Me Now - a collaboration with Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes.
Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Bruno Mars and Foo Fighters are due to perform at the event.
