England v Fiji: I won't put pressure on myself - Alex Goode

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens full-back Alex Goode says he will not try to "pull rabbits out of a hat" as he prepares to return to the England starting XV.

The 28-year-old is in line to replace Mike Brown for Saturday's match with Fiji at Twickenham.
Goode has not been involved in a matchday squad since the Six Nations in February, but says he will not take unnecessary risks on his rare start.
"You don't want to put too much pressure on yourself," Goode said.
He told BBC Radio 5 live: "You have to be quite structured, quite controlled, and make sure the team functions well. At full-back you can't be too reckless and loose."
Bath's Fijian-born winger Semesa Rokoduguni is poised to join Goode in the back three for the clash with the Pacific Islanders.
"He's an incredible talent," said Goode. "You see it in training all the time. He is lethal in space. He's a joy to train with."

Meanwhile scrum coach Neal Hatley says Tom Wood being dropped from the squad had nothing to do with his performance against South Africa, his first start since last year's World Cup.
He has been left out of the 25-man group preparing for the Fiji game, despite starting at open-side flanker in the 37-21 win over the Springboks.
Nathan Hughes is set to replace Wood, with the Wasps forward expected to resume training on Thursday after a minor lower leg injury.
"Woody did exceptionally well - we are just looking at it on a game-by-game basis," Hatley told 5 live.
"Nathan did well when he was on and we want to give him an opportunity potentially. We think he carries the ball well and he has good stopping power."
Hatley also says fly-half George Ford will not be distracted by speculation over his club future.
It is understood the Bath player is considering his options elsewhere in the Premiership, although his club insist it is up to them whether the player leaves with a year remaining on his contract.
"George and Owen Farrell are two of the most focused individuals I have ever worked with," said Hatley, who was part of the Bath coaching staff before joining England.
"All Fordy has been focusing on is Fiji and we haven't seen anything outside of that."
