Bardsley, 32, began her career in the United States and joined City in 2014 from Lincoln Ladies after a two-year spell at Swedish side Linkopings.
She has won 67 caps for England, as well as five for Great Britain.
"The support of everyone at the club, from the coaching staff to the fans, has been unbelievable," she said.
