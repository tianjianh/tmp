NHS 111 provider IC24 resists pleas to publish leaked report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS call provider has rejected demands to publish a leaked report that revealed "significant" safety risks and that staff had altered records.

Integrated Care 24 (IC24), which handles non-emergency 111 and out-of-hours GP calls in Norfolk and Wisbech, was criticised in an interim report.
Former health minister Norman Lamb has said it was "outrageous" the findings had not been formally published.
IC24 said the report would not make sense without added background details.
The report was conducted by the Norwich Clinical Commissioning Group (NCCG) following unannounced inspections in November of five IC24 bases in Norfolk and one in Cambridgeshire after staff complaints.
Issues highlighted included patients waiting more than 12 hours after their first call, which posed "a significant risk to patient safety", a lack of GPs and staff concerns over the skills of recruits to fill the GP shortfall.
IC24 chief operating officer, Lorraine Gray told BBC Look East the firm had only had the NHS contract since September and changing provider was "stressful" for everyone.
"You need to understand the whole detail behind everything that is said in there and all our policies and procedures behind it and everything we are doing to address the issues," she said.
The company said it had now put in new measures including a "GP clinical oversight role" so urgent patients are treated first.
Ms Gray said staff were not asked to alter clinical records, but instead had been told not to include "operational notes in patient records".
IC24 said it would meet North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb on 17 February to explain the report "line by line" and why it should not be published.
The NCCG has said it would be "unfair" to publish the report in its present form.
It will discuss the report at a public board meeting next week, along with the firm's two missed key performance targets.
