Burton almost took a first half lead through Mark Duffy, but his effort was well saved by Daniel Bentley.
The Brewers went ahead on 52 minutes when defender Tom Naylor's speculative effort deflected off of Prosser into his own net.
Dave Mooney almost rescued a point late on for Southend, but his header was saved comfortably by Jon McLaughlin.
Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink told BBC Radio Derby:

"It was not a classic one; to be honest, it was not one where you would say wow.
"It was a very difficult one, a battling one, digging deep, being together, being organised, lot of set pieces, lot of long balls, winning second balls; a lot of those things and I think we did that well.
"We were fortunate with the goal, but if you don't keep on knocking on the door, you're not going to get it."
