[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs await European draws

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four Scottish clubs will feature in Uefa's draws for the initial qualifying rounds of the Champions League and Europa League on Monday from 11:00 BST.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The draws for the first and second qualifying rounds of both competitions will be made in Nyon, Switzerland.
Celtic enter the Champions League at the second qualifying round stage, with the first leg on either 12 or 13 July.
Aberdeen and Hearts are in the Europa League first qualifying round, with Hibernian joining in the next round.
The first qualifying round leg dates are 30 June and 7 July, with the second round taking place over 14 and 21 July.
Both competitions have a third qualifying round and a play-off round before their respective group stages begin in September.
Celtic, Aberdeen and Hearts - first, second and third in last season's Scottish Premiership - will all be seeded in Monday's draws.
Scottish Cup winners Hibernian, who missed out on promotion from the Championship, will be one of the unseeded sides.
Last season, Celtic had a second successive Europa League group stage campaign after losing their Champions League play-off round.
The Dons missed out on the Europa League group stage last term, losing their third-round qualifier for a second year in a row.
Hearts lost at the Europa League play-off phase in 2012, with Hibs exiting in the second qualifying round the following year.
Two of the Scottish clubs involved are starting the season with new managers with Brendan Rodgers taking over from Ronny Deila at Celtic and Deila's predecessor in Glasgow, Neil Lennon, now in charge of Hibs.
Rodgers' team could face one of four first-qualifying round winners in the Champions League, or unseeded sides like Hungary's Ferencvaros or Welsh outfit The New Saints.
