[SN]TITLE[SN]
Meeting over third Aberdeen River Don crossing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public meeting about a controversial new road bridge project in Aberdeen is to be held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The so-called third Don crossing will link the Bridge of Don and Tillydrone, the aim being to improve access in the north of Aberdeen.
The meeting will take place in Bridge of Don Academy from 19:00 to 21:00.
The council said the meeting is open to members of the Bridge of Don and Danestone communities who want to know more about the scheme.
Balfour Beatty has been appointed to construct the new bridge.
Construction will start later this year and the new bridge is due to be open to the public by late 2015.
The total cost is expected to be about Â£18m.
The bridge was given the go-ahead last year after the council's ruling Labour party - which had long been against the bridge - dropped its opposition.
