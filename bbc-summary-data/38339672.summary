A glasshouse built in honour of British explorer Sir Joseph Banks has been rebuilt at a wildlife park after being saved from demolition.

The building was to be pulled down as part of a redevelopment of the Lawn complex in Lincoln.
Woodside Wildlife Park stepped in to save it and moved it to their site near Langworth.
It will be used as an attraction to house exotic animals, crocodiles and coral reef aquariums.
The conservatory is named after the Lincolnshire botanist who travelled with Captain James Cook on his first voyage to the South Pacific in 1768.

Park officials said it will tell the story of the voyage and "highlight changes in our planet".
Ben Pascoe, head keeper at the park, said: "We are currently working with London Zoo and Chester Zoo to discuss what will work best inside.
"We are hoping to have some kind of crocodilian and red panda species inside."
The park was home to the oldest tiger in the UK, which died in September aged 22.
Tango moved to Lincolnshire in 2014 after being rescued from a German circus, along with his partner Julia.
The park is also home to white wolves, lemurs, sloths and birds of prey.
The conservatory is due to open at Easter.
It's original home, the Grade II listed Lawn complex, was sold by City of Lincoln Council last year to the Stokes coffee company which plans to open a cafe and museum on the site.
The council has donated a parcel of land at the Lawn to the Sir Joseph Banks Society to build a new conservatory.
