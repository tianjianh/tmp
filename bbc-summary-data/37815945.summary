England's world number one Mark Selby comfortably beat home favourite Ding Junhui 10-1 to win the International Championship in Daqing, China.

Selby, who also beat Ding in the World Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible in May, won eight of the first nine frames as the Chinese number one managed a top break of just 47.
The 33-year-old cleared to pink having trailed 54-0 in what turned out to be the penultimate frame.
He then sealed victory with a 78 break.
Ding, 29, who won the title in 2013, was looking to build on September's Shanghai Masters win, where he beat Selby 10-6 in the final.
