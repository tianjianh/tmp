Action is needed to restore popular paths to the summit of Snowdon and in the Brecon Beacons, experts have said.

The British Mountaineering Council campaign, Mend Our Mountains, aims to protect key routes from erosion.
It has started a crowd funding project to raise £100,000 to maintain paths to some of Britain's main peaks.
Snowdonia National Park Authority said the campaign was vital if it was to find enough money to maintain paths following budget cuts.
The BMC said a section at the top of the Watkin Path just below the summit of Snowdon was "notoriously eroded".
Meanwhile, a path above the Neuadd Reservoir en route to Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons can cost up to £170 per metre to repair due to its remote location, according to the British Mountaineering Council.
Other paths in the Lake District, Peak District and Yorkshire Dales among others are also included in the project.
