Emergency repairs have been completed on a Lincolnshire Dambusters memorial after part of it collapsed.

The central section of the memorial in Royal Square in Woodhall Spa began to crumble earlier this month.
East Lindsey District Council said it had now been repaired ready for a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Dambusters raids over the weekend.
It is believed the damage to the central plaque of the structure was due to its age rather than vandalism.
The 617 Squadron, also known as the Dambusters, operated from RAF Woodhall Spa from January 1944 to May 1945.
The wall depicts the night time raid on dams during World War Two and is dedicated to the memory of those from the squadron who died during the operation.
The memorial, which was put up in 1987, had to be cordoned off while work was carried out.
