The fight happened after the Hearts v Hibernian Scottish Cup match on Sunday 12 February. Two men needed treatment for face and head injuries.
Men were arrested in Oxgangs, Newington and Meadowbank in Edinburgh and Newtongrange, Ormiston and Aberfeldy.
The men, aged between 16 and 48, are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday.
Ch Supt Kenny MacDonald, of Police Scotland, said: "The disorder on Brougham Place was football-related and caused a great deal of concern to local residents, businesses and patrons in the area.
"We will not tolerate such offences and will actively pursue anyone believed to be involved to ensure they are brought to justice.
"The vast majority of supporters of both Hearts and Hibernian are regularly a credit to their clubs and behave responsibly whenever their teams are in action.
"However, a small minority behave in a manner which puts themselves and others at risk."
