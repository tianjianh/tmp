The National Poisons Information Service in Newcastle is one of four units around the UK and says poisoning is a "major public health issue".
Staff at the centre treat patients who have arrived at A&E and also advise health professionals how to treat and manage cases.
The Newcastle unit took 17,000 calls in 2103, with 28% of those involving children under the age of four.
