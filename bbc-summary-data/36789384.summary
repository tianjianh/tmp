[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brexit 'could take over assembly work' - Elin Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaving the European Union could "completely" take over the assembly's work as it will have to create its own Wales-only policies, according to Presiding Officer Elin Jones.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Issues including common agricultural policy, fisheries policy and structural funds were decided at EU level.
But scrutinising new policies would bring a "huge amount of work" she said.
She added a balance had to be struck between dealing with Brexit, and the day to day work of delivering services.
Ms Jones, the Plaid Cymru AM for Ceredigion, became presiding officer in May following the assembly election.
She told the Newyddion 9 programme: "The EU is part of so many differing aspects of the assembly's work - the common agricultural policy, fisheries policy, structural funds.
"We will have to create Wales only policies for these issues.
"It's important that the government is scrutinised fully, and that it includes the Welsh people and their priorities, when it comes to creating policies that were created at the European level, and that we now want to see being decided here in Wales.
"This will be a huge amount of work."
Ms Jones added: "I'm keen that the assembly strikes a good balance between the day to day matters, and the extra work it will have to keep an eye on over the next few years."
