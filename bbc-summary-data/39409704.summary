A Borders-based cleaning and detergent firm has secured a multi-million pound contract extension with holiday company Bourne Leisure.

RP Adam will provide products and services to the group which operates brands including Haven, Butlins and Warner Leisure Hotels.
The Selkirk firm described the deal as "significant" for its business.
Bourne Leisure said the extension was "largely due to the great service and support" it received.
RP Adam, part of the Arpal Group, employs more than 80 staff across the UK.
Last year it completed a Â£400,000 upgrade of its headquarters in the Borders.
UK operations director Lee-Anne Gillie said the five-year contract extension was a welcome boost.
"We have enjoyed a long-term partnership with Bourne Leisure and its companies over the years, having first started supplying Butlins in Ayr as far back as 1993," she said.
"We have held the Bourne Leisure contract for the last four years, and to get this kind of long-term future commitment from a business of their stature and scope is testament to the fact we deliver on our 2013 tender promises, providing an unmatched level of service and quality product."
Mel Jeffrey, head of purchasing at Bourne Leisure, added: "It all comes down to trust  - and our team trust that the products will work well, and that the Arpal team will be there to provide the service, back-up, support and training required.
"That is what we truly value."
Max Adam, RP Adam's sales and marketing director, said the deal made the company's goal of reaching a Â£20m turnover target for 2020 more achievable.
"At the last count our renegotiations over the last 12 months total nearly Â£16m to 2020, which is hugely important for us as a business as we continue to invest in people, plant and legislation compliance," he said.
