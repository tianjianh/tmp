A dolphin has died after becoming stranded on a Ceredigion beach - despite efforts from coastguards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The female common dolphin died in Ynyslas, near Aberystwyth, before it could be refloated, while awaiting an assessment from a marine vet.
Surfers alerted Natural Resources Wales once they spotted the dolphin, thought to be about 18 months old, on 18 March.
A post-mortem examination will be completed to help understand how the dolphin became stranded.
