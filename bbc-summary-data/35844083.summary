All buses in London will be fitted with speed-limiting technology from 2017, says Transport for London (TfL).

TfL says it wants to reduce the number of people killed on the road and the technology, which prevents acceleration above speed limits, could help.
The move follows the conclusion of trials on two bus routes with a range of road conditions and speed limits.
Buses with the technology stayed within the speed limit 97 to 99% of the time, said the organisation.
The incidents of excess speeds were seen on downhill sections of road, it added, but such events were "rare".
Leon Daniels, managing director of surface transport at TfL, said: "We are investigating a range of new technologies that can make our bus network the safest in the world."
He said he would now work with manufacturers so all buses coming off the production line could be fitted with the technology from next year.
