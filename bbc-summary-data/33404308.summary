[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unbeaten century stand between Peter Trego and James Hildreth helped Somerset recover from a difficult position against Sussex at Taunton.

On another rain-affected day, the home side were reduced to 36-4 before tea.
Hildreth (63 not out) passed 1,000 first-class runs in 2015 as he and Trego (71no) guided Somerset to 176-4.
Earlier, Luke Wright's half-century helped Sussex to a batting bonus point as they were bowled out for 208, with Alfonso Thomas taking 4-46.
Only 42 runs were scored in 20.3 overs during a truncated morning session as Steve Magoffin was the only wicket to fall, edging veteran pace bowler Thomas to Marcus Trescothick at slip.
A patient eighth-wicket stand of 48 between Wright and Ashar Zaidi got Sussex past 200, but the innings came to an abrupt end once Zaidi edged Thomas to wicketkeeper Michael Bates.
Wright (51) was out in the next over, top-edging a pull shot off Lewis Gregory, and last man Matthew Hobden lasted only two balls before becoming Thomas's fourth wicket of the innings.
Somerset, not helped by another interruption for rain, were initially circumspect in reply and then lost four wickets before tea, including three in the space of 14 balls.
Tom Abell and Jim Allenby were both caught behind off the bowling of Ollie Robinson, sandwiching Hobden's dismissal of Johann Myburgh lbw for nine.
However, Trego and Hildreth scored at more than four runs per over in their unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 140 as Somerset moved towards what could be a handy first-innings lead.
Somerset all-rounder Peter Trego:
"I always enjoy batting with James Hildreth and we have had some joy with partnerships against Sussex before.
"If we can get a lead of 50-plus tomorrow we will be right in the game. It's a brilliant cricket pitch with something in it for everyone. Before tea I was making a pig's ear of my innings, not knowing quite what to do.
"Steve Magoffin is a quality bowler, who has been a pain in our backside on many occasions. He has decent pace and moves the ball both ways so I can't speak highly enough of him.
"A lot of batsmen tend to leave a lot of his deliveries whereas I like to throw my hat in the lottery ring and go after him, on the basis that if you let him dictate he is going to get you out."
