The 35-year-old, who married Portman in 2012, will take up his role in October 2014.
Portman, 31, won an Oscar for her work in Black Swan, collecting the award in February 2011 while pregnant.
She and Millipied welcomed their son, Aleph, in June that year.
Millepied is a former principal dancer with the New York City Ballet who left in 2011 to create his own dance company in Los Angeles.
Founded in 1661 by Louis XIV, the Paris Opera Ballet is the oldest and one of the most prestigious ballet companies in the world.
Portman will be seen later this year reprising her role as scientist Jane Foster in comic book sequel Thor: The Dark World.
