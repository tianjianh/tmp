Engineering students from Queen's University are hoping to set a new world record by building a 100ft footbridge made entirely from Meccano.

The temporary Meccano bridge is being built across Belfast's Clarendon Dock.
It has been designed and built by a group of third year civil engineering students and school children.
It will be unveiled at a free public event on Saturday.
The year-long project is part of the university's outreach programme to encourage more children to think about careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
Around 11,000 pieces of Meccano were used to build the bridge, which weighs 600kg (around 1,300lbs).
Representatives from Guinness World Records will be on site to confirm if the project has earned a world record for the world's largest ever Meccano construction.
Dr Danny McPolin from the School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, who led the project, said: "We see this event not only as an opportunity to celebrate the students' and staff's incredible work over the past year, but also a chance to give local children an insight into the exciting courses on offer at Queen's.
"We hope to welcome as many youngsters as possible on the day and cement their interest in studying Civil Engineering and other STEM subjects at university level."
The project has received funding from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, AECOM, Meccano and Queen's Annual Fund.
