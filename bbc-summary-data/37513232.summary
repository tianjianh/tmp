There had been fears that potential tourists would be put off by the devastation caused by the winter storms.
However, Cumbria Tourism has revealed that room occupancy in June was at its highest level in a decade.
In July 80% of all self-catering places were booked up - for the first time since records began.
Ian Stephens, from Cumbria Tourism, said: "These are positive figures for the county's Â£2.62bn tourism industry, with an increasing number of people deciding to stay in the UK for their summer holidays and making the Lake District their destination of choice.
"The challenge now is to maintain this momentum for the traditionally quieter months of the year.
"We are planning to collaborate with a range of different organisations to launch a major winter marketing campaign to promote the area as an all-year-round visitor destination."
