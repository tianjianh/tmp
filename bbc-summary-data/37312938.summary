A shotgun was used in the attack in Brixton, south London, at about 19:00 BST on 12 May.
A 21-year-old man was found shot in the chest and windpipe while a 16-year-old schoolboy was also injured.
In the CCTV footage the three suspects are seen at the junction of Marcella Road and Serenaders Road.
One of the suspects can be seen pulling a sawn-off shotgun out of his bag and handing it over to another of the group before they run up the road.
The suspect with the gun then points and shoots towards people standing in the street on Marcella Road, injuring the man and boy.
The 21-year-old man suffered a punctured lung and serious damage to his windpipe.
He was taken to a south London hospital, where he received immediate surgery but subsequently made a full recovery.
The 16-year-old suffered a minor wound to his arm.
The suspects fled the scene running down Ferry Mews, in the direction of Brixton Road.
Det Con Jo Ross, from the Met's Trident gang crime unit, said: "The 21-year-old victim was fortunate to recover from what were potentially life-threatening injuries at the time of the incident.
"Other passers-by were threatened by having a shotgun pointed at them - these are dangerous people."
