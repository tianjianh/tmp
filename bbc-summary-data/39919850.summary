Before his death from cancer on 14 May, 2014, the 19-year-old from Staffordshire helped raise about £4m for the Teenage Cancer Trust.
He became well known after posting a picture online of himself giving a thumbs-up from his hospital bed.
His mother Jane said it was great to see events still happening in his name.
Organisers said several hundred motorbikes and classic cars took part.

Participants weaved a 27-mile (43km) rural route through villages between Lichfield and Burntwood.
Mrs Sutton, who rode on the lead bike, said £5.6m had been raised so far for the trust in Stephen's memory.
"The amount is going up all the time and I know that is helping other teenagers with cancer," she said.
Stephen, who died from bowel cancer, took part in the first Ride Out event in 2013.
The trust said £2.7m of the funds raised had been spent refurbishing cancer units at hospitals across the country.
