With the event reduced to 54 holes by bad weather, Levy completed his second round in 63, eight under par, to close in on a third European Tour title.
Swede Michael Jonzon also shot a 63 to sit second on 13 under at Bad Griesbach, with England's Ross Fisher on 12 under after a six-under 65.
Martin Kaymer, part of Europe's Ryder Cup team, is in a tie for fourth place.
The German is 11 under overall after a seven-under 64.
Alexander Levy: "I will just go and practise a bit, go for a gym session and be ready for tomorrow. I'm just trying to think about my own game and do the best I can."
Ross Fisher: "There's still a lot to play for and it's nice to know that we've only got one round to go. It's a tough decision but I think they've made the right call."
Martin Kaymer: "I just need to keep going, and obviously Levy is playing great golf. He played well last week too and you have to give him credit. It's a little bit of a different approach now from playing four rounds."
