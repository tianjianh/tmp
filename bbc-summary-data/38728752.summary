Shoreham air crash: Watchdog accepts AAIB safety measures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A raft of safety measures recommended in the wake of the Shoreham air disaster have been accepted by the aviation watchdog.

A vintage hawker hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during a stunt at the show in August 2015, killing 11 men.
Pilot Andy Hill, 51, survived and is being investigated for manslaughter.
All 21 safety recommendations made by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been accepted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
They include a review into whether changes should be made to the minimum distance required between the public and display aircraft, and a review of guidance for air show organisers, including how they carry out risk assessments.
George Bacon, spokesman for the British Air Display Association, said most of the measures aimed at improving safety at air shows were already in action.
The AAIB made seven safety recommendations in December 2015, and a further 14 three months later.
It is expected to publish its final report, concluding its investigation into the accident on 22 August 2015, within the next few months.
A CAA spokesman said it had completed more than half of the safety recommendations.
"Some are longer term work, but the aim is to have as many in place as possible before the start of the air show season."
Mr Bacon said the final AIIB report "may well have far more urgent issues to address... but nobody can argue with making the flying of aircraft safer".
The 11 victims were killed when the vintage jet fell to the ground during a rolling manoeuvre, destroying a number of vehicles and bursting into flames.
An inquest is yet to be held.
