Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s.
The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.
Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did.
Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays.
"We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them," she said.
"There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed."
Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was "possible that many others have been affected".
"I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch."
Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school.
They are considering taken further legal action.
A Hackney Council spokesman said: "Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals."
Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: "Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school."
