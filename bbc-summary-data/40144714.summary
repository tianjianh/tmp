Up to 170,000 people were in the city on Saturday to see Spanish holders Real Madrid beat Italy's Juventus 4-1 in the world's biggest club football match.
Many flights left Cardiff and Bristol airports overnight while those using trains had waits of up to 45 minutes, but were offered blankets and sweets.
South Wales Police said three people were arrested over ticket touting.
A 35-year-old from Napoli was arrested on Friday after a tip-off from an off-duty Italian officer and he will appear before city magistrates on Monday.
On Saturday, two other men, aged 32 and 28, were arrested on suspicion of fraud after being found with four tickets and a significant quantity of money. They remain in police custody.
Most roads have reopened following wide-scale closures in the build-up to the final.
Castle Street will remain closed until Monday morning, as will Lloyd George Avenue and the immediate roads around the Champions Festival in Cardiff Bay, which ends on Sunday.
Organisers said more than 60,000 fans went to the festival on Thursday and Friday with another capacity crowd flooding in on Saturday.
Supporters of Juventus and Real Madrid mixed in a friendly atmosphere at the festival in Cardiff Bay on Saturday afternoon ahead of the game's big kick-off at the National Stadium of Wales.
