Her comedy is all about how she spent far too long making people want to like her as well as dealing with a mother that doesn't have a filter.
For this funny woman, seeing the funny side of being an occasional outsider is the best medicine.
Even though she goes on tour with some of the UK's best comedy acts, she says it's still OK to have nerves when you have to meet new people.
Having low self-esteem is part of who she is, she still has days when she has to work a little bit harder on her confidence, but now she's taking the UK comedy scene by storm.
