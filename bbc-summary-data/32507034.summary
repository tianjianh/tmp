Surrey's Championship match against Essex ended as a draw after heavy rain led to a final-day washout at The Oval.

After the morning session was lost, umpires Martin Bodenham and Nick Cook inspected the outfield at 14:30 BST.
However, they deemed it was too wet to play and decided to abandon the match with Surrey on 95-2, still 175 runs short of making the visitors bat again.
Surrey have now drawn both their Division Two fixtures, while Essex have one win and one draw.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty:
"I think we would have batted out the game for a draw anyway. The pitch was getting better and better - it was an excellent batting surface and very hard work for the bowlers.
"To give credit to Essex, they took control of the game on the second and third days and batted extremely well.
"We didn't have Jade Dernbach to bowl yesterday, and to be honest it was a mark of his commitment and attitude that he actually bowled as many overs as he did on day two.
"The scan on his side strain has shown up some significant damage and he will be out of action for a while, sadly. With side strains, you have to be careful."
Essex coach Paul Grayson:
"We are disappointed with not being able to get out there at all today because of the rain, obviously.
"We feel we played very well over the three days and it could well have been an interesting final day."
