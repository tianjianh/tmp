Since the beginning of the year across the West Midlands force area a total of nine people have lost their lives to knife crime.
That includes the attack on Christina Edkins as she sat on a bus going to school.
But what has caused the latest alarm is the two unrelated deaths of teenagers in September, fatally stabbed in Birmingham.
Such deaths grab headlines and heighten concern but the police say it is important to remember that knife crime in the West Midlands is going down.
Since 2006 it has fallen by more than 60%.
Yet to those in the midst of grief its little comfort, people want tougher sentences for carrying knives and a constant rolling knife amnesty to get bladed weapons off the streets.
The police launched their Knives cost Lives campaign in January.
Young people tell me that knives get carried for a variety of reasons, but it is also part of a macho culture, amongst some young men knives have become a fashion accessory.
"Look at the consequences of what's happened. My son's gone, his friend's gone, all the other kids who have been killed by knives have gone," she said.
"Their mothers are in the same pain I'm going through now. No mother should have to bury their child.
"All mothers have to come together. We have to do something to stop these kids killing each other."
According to figures released by police, knife crime in Birmingham dropped by 25% between April 2011 and 2012.
In 2012-13 there were 1,615 knife-related incidents in the city, although police said over the past six years knife crime had fallen by 63% across the force area.
However, West Midlands Police said the killings of Azim Azam and Joshua Ribera within a few days of each other last month had "rocked communities across the city".
Azim, 16, from Billesley, was found collapsed in the street after getting off a morning rush-hour bus in Moseley. A post-mortem examination revealed he died from a single stab wound to the chest.
The force said combating knife crime was a priority and that as part of its Knives End Lives campaign officers routinely visit schools and use metal-detecting "knife wands" on patrols in some areas.
Homeless Phillip Simelane, 23, from Walsall, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Christina Edkins at a hearing in Birmingham Crown Court earlier.
Christina was stabbed while on her way to Leasowes High School in Halesowen on 7 March.
A post-mortem examination found she died from a single stab wound.
