[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 0-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mikael Mandron's first-half strike was enough to earn Eastleigh victory at Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt McClure had a great chance to put the Shots ahead in the opening seconds from a Jim Kellermann cross, but his effort was blocked.
The two sides continued to push for the opener in the first half, and Mark Smith pulled off a smart save from Mandron's strike.
The Spitfires then broke on the stroke of half-time to go in one up. Scott Wilson released Joe Partington, who squared for Mandron to tap in.
In the second half, Kellermann had an effort ruled out for the hosts when he turned in Anthony Straker's cross from close range, but he was offside.
