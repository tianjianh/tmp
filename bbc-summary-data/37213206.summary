Beamish Museum is replicating an end of terrace shop from Bow Street in the town for its new 1950s attraction.
A public vote is being held to decide whether it should be a hairdresser's, a toy shop and dolls' hospital or an electrical goods store.
The Â£10.75m 1950s-style development will also include shops, a cinema, cafe, community centre and houses.
People will be able to cast their vote during a series of events, starting on Tuesday at Captain Cook Square Shopping Centre.
The decision will be announced at the museum during the October half-term holiday.
Lisa Peacock, from Beamish, said: "This shop will be a replica of the one in Bow Street, Middlesbrough, so we wanted people from the town to choose what type of shop it will be.
"We'd also love to hear people's memories of shopping in Middlesbrough during the 1950s and see any photographs they may have."
