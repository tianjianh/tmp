An exhibition at the Barbican in London explores life in Britain as seen through the eyes of international photographers. Work from the 1930s to the present depicts the social, cultural and political life of the country.
Strange and Familiar: Britain as Revealed by International Photographers is curated by photographer Martin Parr, who said the show was based on the "notion that many people had come to Britain since the war and photographed here,  and yet here we are in England and Britain and we weren't familiar with these pictures".
"The exhibition will reveal a very different take on British life than that produced by British photographers. It is both familiar and strange at the same time."
