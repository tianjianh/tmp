Crystal Palace have appointed ex-Newcastle boss Alan Pardew as their new manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

The announcement was officially made on Saturday, two days after Pardew watched the London side draw 0-0 with Aston Villa in the Premier League.
Pardew, 53, was given permission by the Magpies to speak to Palace after the clubs agreed compensation on Monday.
The former Palace player replaces Neil Warnock, who was sacked last Saturday.

"I am absolutely delighted to be the new manager of Crystal Palace," said Pardew, who spent four years playing in the club's midfield from 1987.
"Everyone knows my history here, what's important now is to move the club to the next level.
"I believe with the backing of [chairman] Steve [Parish] and the board I can help achieve that and create some new exciting history for the club."
He also paid tribute to his former club, saying: "It has been a privilege to manage Newcastle United.
"I must thank [owner] Mike Ashley and the board for their unwavering support during my tenure at the club."
Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish said his club had wanted a manager with a great track record and proven experience in the Premier League.
"In Alan we have both these things as well as a man who has great affection for this club and shares my determination to take us to the next level," he said.
Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley said Pardew left St James' Park with "our best wishes and thanks", adding: "Four years [after Pardew's appointment], the club is in a far better position, both on and off the field, and Alan has had a big part to play in that."
Pardew was in the stands as Palace claimed a goalless draw at Aston Villa on New Year's Day, a result that kept the Selhurst Park club in the relegation zone.
He leaves Newcastle with the Tyneside club sitting 10th in the Premier League. The compensation package demanded by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has not been disclosed.
After becoming Magpies manager in December 2010, former Reading, West Ham, Southampton and Charlton boss Pardew guided United to a fifth-placed finish in the Premier League in 2012.
But supporters on Tyneside called for Pardew - who was under contract until 2020 - to be sacked earlier this season when Newcastle were in the bottom three.

Pardew has strong links with Palace and he scored the winning goal as the Eagles beat Liverpool 4-3 after extra time in the 1990 FA Cup last four.
Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen said Pardew had been helping to prepare the team for Sunday's FA Cup third-round tie against Conference side Dover Athletic.
"Alan has held a staff meeting when he spoke about a number of things," Millen said on Friday. "He spoke to the players and then we had training.
"We're preparing for the game on Sunday and I'm sure Alan will be taking the game. He'll be taking training on Saturday."
Millen has been in charge of Palace since the sacking of Warnock a week ago.
Palace are without a win in eight league games - a run dating back to the 3-1 home win over Liverpool on 23 November.
However, they have claimed two points from their last two games - successive away goalless draws at QPR and Aston Villa.
Palace's next Premier League outing is at home to Tottenham on 10 January.
Pardew will face his old side on 11 February when Newcastle visit Selhurst Park.
