Silver and bronze-winning weightlifters Marina Shainova and Nadezhda Evstyukhina have been sanctioned along with 4x400m runner Tatyana Firova.
Russia had already lost their 2008 4x400m relay silver.
A further five athletes have also been punished after their old samples were retested, the IOC said.
They are:
The five have had their Beijing results annulled and their sports' governing body asked to reassign any medals.
The IOC carried out more than 4,500 drugs tests at the 2008 Olympics but only nine athletes tested positive.
It has since retested more than 450 samples, using new methods to uncover banned substances that would have gone undetected at the time.
The IOC has also carried out about 250 retests on samples from London 2012.
Russian track and field athletes were banned from competing at Rio 2016 by the IAAF after widespread, state-sponsored doping was uncovered in the country.
