The Australian hit eight fours and four sixes in his first ton for the Tykes before being caught behind for 111.
Opener Alex Lees (67), Jack Leaning (58 not out) and Adil Rashid (41) also contributed as Yorkshire made 345-6.
Worcestershire's in-form Ross Whiteley hit 77, but wickets tumbled around him as the hosts were all out for 212, with Steven Patterson claiming 5-24.
After stand-in captain Lees was out in the 24th over, Maxwell took the game away from Worcestershire, putting on 105 in 13.4 overs with Gary Ballance, who contributed only 28 runs in the partnership.
Whiteley struck five sixes in his List ' A' career-best 51-ball innings, but was last man out when he skied Patterson to Leaning at deep mid-wicket.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes:
"Yorkshire played really well and we weren't quite at our best at all. The result was inevitable.
"When you play against someone who has a real 'A' game you've got to make sure you have an 'A' game and we didn't do that.
"We were a bit sloppy in the field. We had some silly run-outs at the top of the innings and possibly we could have started with the ball a little bit better as well."
Yorkshire first-team coach Jason Gillespie:
"For me, honestly, Glenn Maxwell could have gone on even further and scored even more runs.
"To perform like he did was absolutely fantastic. He really gave us an opportunity to make a 300-plus score.
" We have done a lot of talking about our limited-overs cricket and this morning was about 'We have done enough talking, just go out and do your job'."
