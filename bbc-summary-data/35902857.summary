[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stoppage-time goal from Harry Panayiotou denied Rangers victory and meant their Scottish Championship title will have to wait.

The Raith Rovers sub had a penalty saved seconds earlier but redeemed himself by scrambling an equaliser with the last kick of the ball.
Kenny Miller had added to first-half goals from Harry Forrester and Michael O'Halloran to put Rangers on the brink.
But goals from Louis Longridge and James Craigen helped spoil the party.
The draw not only extends Rovers' unbeaten run to seven games but also takes Ray McKinnon's fourth-top side closer to securing a place in the promotion play-offs after Greenock Morton and Queen of the South drew their matches.
Several thousand Rangers fans had packed the stands at Stark's Park in anticipation of a title party.
However, when Longridge's perfectly-struck shot sailed over goalkeeper Wes Foderingham, it was the first hint that the celebratory champagne might remain on ice.
After watching a point-blank shot somehow turned round the post by Kevin Cuthbert, Forrester planted a header in off the post from the resultant corner to renew the visitors' hopes.
Forrester had looked Rangers' greatest threat and he showed great composure to pick out O'Halloran for a tap-in when a less cool customer might have shot himself.
For all their attacking muscle, Mark Warburton's side have a vulnerability in defence and Craigen had far too much room to fire in a long-range shot that may have taken a slight deflection but should not have been allowed to slip into the net by Foderingham.
What looked like the winning blow was struck by Rangers stalwart Miller, who raced on to Andy Halliday's pass to hammer the ball past Cuthbert for his 17th goal of the season.
As much as the goal meant to him and his team-mates, it was nothing compared to the feeling of jubilation among the visiting fans as they prepared for life in the top-flight of Scottish football.
However, although Panayiotou had a spot kick saved by Foderingham after being fouled by Halliday, the on-loan Leicester City forward grabbed a sensational equaliser by forcing the ball over the line at the end of a goalmouth scramble.
Rangers will have another chance to claim the title on Tuesday, though, when they welcome Dumbarton to Ibrox.
