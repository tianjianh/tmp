Natasa Kovacevic will make her debut for Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
The accident occurred when the 21-year-old was with another team - Gyor - and claimed the lives of the team's coach and general manager in September 2013.
Kovacevic, whose Twitter bio reads 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger', uses a special prosthesis.
At 6ft 2in and as a bronze medallist at the European Under-18 Championships in 2012, Kovacevic was seen as one of her country's most promising players.
But after her accident, intensive treatment and rehabilitation allowed Kovacevic to sign for Red Star in early November.
