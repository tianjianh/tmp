Bradley Parker, 19, was one of two men who died when their car collided with a Land Rover Defender on Newfield Lane, near Lelley, on 15 November.
Driver Daniel Maston, 18, from Burstwick, also died in the crash.
Mr Parker's funeral started at 12:30 GMT at St Peter's and St Paul's in Burton Pidsea.
BBC Look North reporter Victoria Holland said the church was full, with more than 100 mourners listening to the service outside.
Mr Parker's parents described him as "a confident and special young man".
They said: "We will miss you Brad... you have probably achieved more in the 19 years of your life than most people would in a full lifetime.
"We adore you and will miss you but you will live on forever in our hearts."
Hull FC said it was supporting the family and would be collecting donations for the RFL Benevolent Fund and the Epilepsy Society after the service.
