Wales international Angharad James has joined Yeovil Town Ladies for the Spring Series, following her departure from defunct Notts County.

The 22-year-old former Arsenal and Bristol Academy midfielder has been capped more than 50 times.
James had been left without a club when Notts County Ladies folded one day before the start of the Spring Series.
"After the disappointment of what happened at Notts County, I'm delighted to join Yeovil Ladies," she said.
"I'm looking forward to working with Jamie [Sherwood, Yeovil's manager], who I can't thank enough and the talented group of players we have here.
"The ambition is to get maximum points from the next four games, putting us in a strong position leading up to the winter season."
