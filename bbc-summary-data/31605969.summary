[SN]TITLE[SN]
The fans who REALLY love Taylor Swift tell us why

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yes it's official... Taylor Swift has been named the world's most popular artist for 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She popped into the Radio 1 Breakfast show this morning after being given the title by the record industry.
And she left Newsbeat in no doubt just how popular she REALLY is.
Many fans camped outside the studio for nearly 24 hours, armed with gifts for the super-star singer.
So here's why the Swifties LOVE Taylor so much.
"She stalks us online and she's more of a friend. She understands us on a more personal level than anyone else
She's literally an older sister, she gives better advice. She's more of a friend to me than some of my actual friends.
I got her loads of presents, a personalised coaster saying Morgan loves Taylor, cat pyjamas and all the gift tags have cats on because she loves cats.
She's the best thing that's ever happened to me, I'm not even joking.
I'm going to wee myself when I see her."
"She just connects with her fans on another level. We're not really fans though, we're an extended family
Everyone can relate to every single thing she writes. She talks to us on Tumblr.
We arrived yesterday at midday. We've been camping all night, we haven't really eaten but we don't care because we're going to see Taylor.
She's just an icon."
"She's done so much for fans which other celebrities won't consider doing.
She goes way out of her way to do it and we just love her for it.
We've been waiting for hours to see her. We ordered pizza at midnight, there was a lot of singing and Taylor Swift fangirling, screaming and crying".
We're freezing but it's OK."
"You don't see her as a world wide pop star. You see her more as a close friend.
She is probably the greatest woman out there.
She's the best and worst due to stress she causes but it's definitely worth it in the end.
We went to one of her favourite shops to buy her a journal for her to hopefully write lyrics in and a really cute headband because she's kind of in that phase of headbands."
"Her lyrics are different to anyone else's.
She's the only one who can write lyrics how she does to connect with us.
She really does write how we feel."
"Her lyrics really do make you feel like she's in our brains and she just says it.
No one else really does that and sings their own songs with it."
"She's allowed us to meet so many friends.
We're all friends because of her."
