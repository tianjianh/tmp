A court in India is due to hear a plea for bail by Salman Khan, who has been convicted of culpable homicide in a 2002 Mumbai hit-and-run case.

On Wednesday, a court in Mumbai sentenced Khan to five years in prison for killing Noor Ullah Khan by driving over him as he slept on the pavement.
The Bombay High Court gave him interim bail for two days after his lawyers filed an appeal against his sentence.
Noor Ullah Khan, 38, was one of five people run over in the incident.
Three others were seriously injured and another person received minor injuries when Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai late on 28 September 2002.
Khan had always said his driver was behind the wheel, but the judge said the actor was driving and was under the influence of alcohol.
Following his interim bail Khan - who had faced a possible 10-year jail term - went to his home, where a number of Bollywood stars met him.
Reports say that Khan is not needed to be present in the court on Friday when his bail plea comes up.
The case has gripped Bollywood and India for years.
Judge DW Deshpande, who found him guilty on the charge of culpable homicide, said in his 240-page ruling that the actor "didn't visit hospital to meet injured, provide aid".
He said Khan "could have visited cops immediately if he did no wrong".
