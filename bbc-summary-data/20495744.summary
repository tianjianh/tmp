Cosgrove said it was "an honour and a privilege" to receive the special prize in recognition of his 40 years of programme making.
Eddie Izzard, Alesha Dixon and Jedward also presented prizes on Sunday.
The awards, given by Bafta, recognise excellence in children's film, television, games and online media.
Cosgrove co-founded Manchester-based Cosgrove Hall Films with animation partner Mark Hall - who died last year - in 1976 and went on to become a major producer of children's television and animated programmes.
The company also made film versions of Roald Dahl book The BFG and children's classic The Wind In The Willows, as well as popular animations Jamie and the Magic Torch and Count Duckula.
"Hopefully, via the programmes we made, we brought pleasure to many generations of viewers," Cosgrove said.
For a third consecutive year, CBBC show Horrible Histories won the prize for comedy, while Peppa Pig won the pre-school animation award.
Box office hit The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, was named best feature film.
CBeebies presenter Justin Fletcher was given the third Bafta of his career for presenting Something Special - a programme he developed aimed to help children with learning and communications difficulties - making him the most awarded children's presenter to date.
CBBC was also named channel of the year.
Two awards were given to Cartoon Network series The Amazing World of Gumball in the animation and writer categories.
Khalil Madovi, a 14 year old rapper and actor, was given the best performer accolade for playing Josh Carter in 4 O'Clock Club.
The young stars of Friday Download, a run-down on subjects including games, music and style, were honoured in the entertainment category.
Charlie Hutton-Pattemore, 15, from Somerset, Christopher Purdy, 13, from West Sussex, both took home gaming awards.
Hutton-Pattemore received the game concept award for Vacuum Panic, in which players must clean up a house room by room before "mum" gets back.
While Purdy won the game-making prize for his game Smiley Dodgems, in which the main character is attacked by faceless shapes.
