Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's border investigation team, said: "We are now working with Border Force, the Coastguard Agency and Norfolk Police to try and establish how the bags ended up where they did, however it is extremely unlikely that this was their intended destination.
"This is obviously a substantial seizure of class A drugs and its loss will represent a major blow to the organised criminals involved."
Supt Dave Buckley, from Norfolk Constabulary, said: "Whilst we believe we have recovered all the packages, should any member of the public find one they are urged to contact Norfolk Constabulary immediately.
"We will have extra officers in the area to monitor the situation."
