A van driver who murdered a man by reversing over his head has been jailed for life with a minimum of 16 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Turner, 57, deliberately drove at Frank Buckley, 51, after the pair had a fight in the street.
Mr Buckley suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured skull, and died at the scene on 26 June last year.
Sentencing Turner, from Turnford in Hertfordshire, Judge Andrew Bright QC said: "It was a shocking case. You used your van as a weapon."
Turner had denied murder and was convicted at St Albans Crown Court last month.

Jurors heard there had been "bad feeling" between the pair for 20 years, and Turner had stopped his van in Groom Road, Turnford when he spotted Mr Buckley.
The men fought and it was claimed Mr Buckley sprayed an unknown substance in Turner's face, before Turner got back in his van and ran him over.
The bumper struck Mr Buckley on the leg, knocking him down. Turner then reversed over him.
He claimed to have lost control of his van as he tried to drive away after being sprayed in the face.
However, prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC told the jury Turner "deliberately turned his van into Frank Buckley and knocked him down".
Mr Donnellan said the attack "was carried out by a man who was angry and in a temper, possibly he acted in revenge about something that had happened in the course of the confrontation".
