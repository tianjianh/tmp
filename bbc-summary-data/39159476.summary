A driver who dragged a pedestrian along a road under his car, ignoring the trapped man's desperate attempts to get him to stop, has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marc Dightam, 32, fled the scene after hitting Colin Bowler, 41, in Cheadle, Greater Manchester on 26 December 2016.
He went on the run for two days before being arrested at his family's home in Knutsford, Cheshire.
Dightam, who admitted speeding up to shake Mr Bowler free, was sentenced to 32 months at Manchester Crown Court.
The 32-year-old, who had pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing, was also given a driving ban of six years.
The court heard it could not be established if Dightam was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when he hit Mr Bowler as he went into hiding after abandoning his car and mobile phone.
When arrested, Dightam initially made no comment before he later "broke down" and admitted he could hear Mr Bowler knocking from underneath the vehicle and decided to drive faster in a bid to shake him free.
He said he then "panicked" as he thought he had killed Mr Bowler.
Sentencing, Judge Martin Rudland told the defendant his behaviour was "shocking and deplorable".
He said Dightam's victim had sustained "grievous and life-changing injuries" and was fortunate to have survived.
Mr Bowler, from Stockport, had to be placed in an induced coma after he suffered fractures to his skull and left leg.
He also received cuts to his head and face, abrasions to his chest and knee and frictions burns to his back.
Paul Bryning, defending, said his client had displayed "genuine remorse", adding: "He is horrified at what he has done."
