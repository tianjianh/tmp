More than 100 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at an industrial unit on Western Road in Park Royal.
London Fire Brigade said the ground floor and first floor were alight and a large section of the roof was also on fire.
The brigade was called at 00:29 BST on Thursday. The cause of the fire is not yet known.
Station Manager Bill Dunn, who is at the scene, said: "The fire is causing a lot of smoke in the Park Royal area and locals should shut windows and doors."
An eyewitness who lives near the scene of the blaze said visibility was down to zero.
"I was woken up by the smoke. My windows were open. I could hear sirens," he said.
"It looked completely foggy outside."
He said the area, close to a petrol station, had been cordoned off.
Mr Dunn said the fire was likely to be a "protracted incident" and would probably cause rush-hour disruption. The public has been warned to avoid the area.
Fifteen fire engines went to the scene from Willesden, Acton, Park Royal, Wembley, Chiswick, Hammersmith, Paddington, and Northholt.
