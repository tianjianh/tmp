Konta won 7-5 6-2 and will now face the Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova.
The fifth seed beat Russia's Daria Kasatkina 3-6 7-5 7-6 (9-7).
Konta, 25, is 11th in the race to Singapore, with only the top eight qualifying for the tournament, which takes place from 23-30 October.
Konta could also break into the world's top 10 for the first time if she continues her run at the China Open.
Currently ranked 14th, she would join Virginia Wade, Sue Barker and Jo Durie as the only Britons to achieve the feat on the WTA Tour.
