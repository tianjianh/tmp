Both keepers were called on to make good saves before Walsall's Anthony Forde rattled the bar from 20 yards.
Gregory converted Jed Wallace's cross to put the Lions ahead before debutant Mahlon Romeo made it 2-0, beating Liam Roberts after a one-two with Wallace.
Hopes of a Walsall fightback ended when Gregory ran onto Shaun Williams' pass to add Millwall's third.
Millwall's unbeaten run is now up to five games, keeping them sixth in League One, only one point behind fifth-placed Coventry, while Walsall remain second despite their fourth home defeat of the campaign.
The Saddlers had third-choice keeper Roberts making his debut in goal following injuries to Neil Etheridge and his deputy Craig MacGillivray. They then lost top scorer Tom Bradshaw to an early second-half injury,

"They're disappointed more with the scoreline than the way we performed. We got caught, I suppose, chasing the game that was always going to be reliant on whoever scored first.
"It was always going to be a second ball game, them getting it forward early to (Steve) Morison and Gregory to play off that.
"For a large part, we did really well, just couldn't quite get a goal - blocks on the line and hitting the post, hitting the bar, but their spirit was really good."
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"Walsall are a really good team, but the league table doesn't lie, especially when you get into February.
"It was a stern test for us and we had to stay in the game at times and we had to dig in, we had to throw our bodies on the line and I thought we did that.
"The youngsters are getting a lot of praise, and rightly so because they're a good group."
