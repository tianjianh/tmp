They are wanted for an exhibition at the Artlink Gallery to celebrate the extravagant fashions worn by the men.
The trawlermen were known as the "three-day millionaires" because after three weeks at sea they had just three days ashore to spend their wages.
Textiles expert Claire Day has been researching the look for a new exhibition about a fashion specific to Hull.
Some trawlermen bought traditional suits, but others would ask for extravagant details and colours - including half-moon pockets, Spanish waistbands, bright fabrics and coloured linings, made at tailors like Waistells on Hessle Road.
The exhibition wants to track down an original - in particular, a powder blue suit.
