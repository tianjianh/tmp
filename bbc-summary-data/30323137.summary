Denmark Hill Station in south London was shut after flames were spotted underneath a Southeastern train travelling from Victoria to Dartford.
A spokesman said the driver evacuated the train as it approached Denmark Hill Station at about 18:45 GMT. The station has since reopened.
It is the second fire involving a Southeastern train in 10 days. The firm said it was investigating.
Passengers filmed sparks which were visible above the track from inside the train.
London Fire Brigade said the fire affected eight carriages and one electrical box was damaged. There were no reports of injuries.
Cosmin Suttu, who was on board, said: "I saw big flames from the train window.
"When the train stopped at Denmark Hill station I saw more flames.
"Everyone got out of the train and ran out of the station."
A spokesman for Southeastern said: "The driver took the decision to evacuate the train and the station was also evacuated as a precautionary measure.
"The cause is currently being investigated."
He confirmed the fire was underneath the train.
On 23 November Charing Cross Station was closed for about two hours because of a fire.
The Southeastern spokesman said that incident was due to a track fire.
