Steve McNulty says it is time to "be a dad again" after leaving Luton for Tranmere to move closer to his family.

The 32-year-old defender left for Merseyside on loan with a view to a permanent move, after making 124 appearances for the Hatters.
"I would have loved to have stayed but circumstances with the missus and two kids just weren't ideal at this time," he told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"It was only right for me to start being a dad again after three years."
He continued: "I'm down in Luton all week and the kids are up there. My oldest girl is six now and my other girl's one and she's growing up and a handful.
"Selfishly, I would have loved to have stayed but I had to make the decision for my family and the kids more than anything."
McNulty moved to Kenilworth Road from Fleetwood in January 2013, and helped the club end their five-year absence from the Football League in 2014.
And McNulty, who was recently captain of the Hatters, says he has been touched by the support he has received from fans.
"Looking back, I only signed on a short-term deal from Fleetwood," he said. "You don't expect things to go as well as they did.
"Maybe it would have been right to move the family down when I first signed, but circumstances weren't right.
"Things have gone really well, that's the sad thing about it - I really do believe the club are going to get promoted (this season).
"Obviously I get a lot of negative press, and it took me a while to win some people over. I'd like to think that the majority of Luton fans think I served the club well and every time I pulled the shirt on I gave 100%.
"I couldn't have asked much more from them and I'd like to think that they couldn't have asked much more from me."
