Wrexham Glyndwr University is taking part in Global Game Jam (GGJ) for the seventh year from Friday to Sunday.
The event uses technology to connect people across the world and to develop video games from scratch within 48 hours.
Last year, 6866 games were created at 600 locations in 93 countries.
Organiser of the Wrexham event, Richard Hebblewhite, senior lecturer in computing at Glyndwr University, said it was beginning to broaden beyond simple, computer-based games.
"I'm hoping for a diverse group of participants this year so we can have people working on everything from board games to physical arcade machines and traditional digital products," he said.
Last year's event in Wrexham saw a team of 58 design and develop 18 individual games within the 48-hour period.
