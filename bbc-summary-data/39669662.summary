Drivers are being warned to expect delays on all approaches to the Raith Interchange on the M74 due to road works over the next two weekends.

Work is being carried out to replace the mini roundabout at Bothwell Bridge, which links Hamilton and Bothwell Road (B7071), with three-way traffic signals.
It is part of the Â£500m M8 M73 M74 motorway improvements project.
Transport Scotland said the changes would speed up traffic flow.
The works, which started at 20:00  on Friday and will run until 06:00 on Monday, will be spread over two weekends.
During the first phase, Bellshill Road (B7071) will be closed in both directions.
There will be no access to or from Bothwell, from Hamilton to the M74 Junction 5 Raith or the A725.
The A725 southbound carriageway through the Raith underpass will also be closed over the full weekend with traffic diverted via Raith roundabout.
Hamilton and Bothwell Road (B7071) will be reduced to a single lane on approach to Bothwell Bridge roundabout, with temporary two-way traffic signals in operation.
Access from the M74 Junction 5 Raith to both the A725 Bellshill bypass and East Kilbride expressway will be maintained during both weekend works.
Signed diversions will be in place on all approaches to provide road users with alternative routes. However, delays are anticipated and motorists are being advised to plan their journey in advance.
Graeme Reid, project sponsor for the project, said: "These works are necessary as the mini roundabout near Bothwell Bridge is too small to cope with the volume of traffic trying to access and leave this major junction.
"The installation of new traffic signals will improve the flow of traffic to and from the local roads during peak times, as well as provide improved access through this junction for pedestrians."
"I'd like to thank the thousands of road users who travel through the works on a daily basis for their continued patience, and would ask that they bear with us as we approach the final stages of construction."
Work in the M8 M73 M74 improvement project began in February 2014 and is due to be completed by the end of the spring.
It has also included major work at the Shawhead junction of the M8.
Transport Scotland say it will result in journey times along the A8/M8 corridor between Glasgow and Edinburgh being cut by 20 minutes, and approximately 15 minutes through Raith Interchange at Junction 5 on the M74.
