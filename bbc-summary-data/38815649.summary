Carlisle United have signed strikers George Waring from Stoke City and Jamie Proctor from Bolton Wanderers on half-season loan deals.

The pair come in as fellow forward Charlie Wyke moved to Bradford earlier on transfer deadline day.
Waring, 22, spent the first half of the season with Shrewsbury, playing 19 games without scoring.
Former Preston and Bantams player Proctor, 24, has played 29 games for the Trotters this season, scoring once.
He would be available for the Cumbrians in the League Two play-offs, if they get there.
Ex-Everton academy forward Waring joined the Potters aged 19, and has had loan spells at Barnsley and Oxford United.
"He's got good technical ability, as you'd expect from a player coming from a club at that level," Carlisle boss Keith Curle said.
"He definitely won't struggle with the physical aspects of the game."
