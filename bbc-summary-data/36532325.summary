[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man fined for taking wild bird eggs in Orkney

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A retired solicitor who took wild bird eggs from a nest in Orkney has been fined Â£4,200.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Beaton, 73, from Devon, admitted wildlife crimes carried out in late May and early June this year.
Beaton was spotted collecting an arctic tern egg on a beach at Furrowend, Shapinsay.
He was later found to be in possession of eggs, including those of rock doves and great skuas, and an extending spoon, used to collect eggs.
'Serious implications'
Beaton was fined at Kirkwall Sheriff Court under Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 legislation.
Gary Aitken, procurator fiscal for wildlife and environment, said: "Scotland is home to a wide range of wild bird species, both rare and common, and all are protected by law.
"It is an offence to intentionally take the egg of any wild bird as it can have serious implications for their conservation and habitat.
"We hope this prosecution will serve as a clear message to others who participate in the illegal practice of collecting wild bird eggs that this type of offending will not be tolerated."
