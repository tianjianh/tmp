The bomb disposal squadron carried out a series of controlled demolitions between 06:30 and 07:00 BST on Tuesday.
They were blowing up misfired flares left over when search and rescue services moved from RAF Valley to Caernarfon last month.
Members of the public were warned to expect explosions and smoke on the airfield on Tuesday morning.
