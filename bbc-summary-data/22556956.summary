The decision to bestow the honour - Glasgow's highest - was taken a meeting of the city council on Thursday.
Comedian Billy Connolly was the last person to receive the award in 2010.
Other recipients include Kenny Dalgleish, Sir Alex Ferguson, David Livingstone, Jim Watt, Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela.
The honour was confirmed after councillors approval of a motion by the council's "veterans champion", Councillor Malcolm Cunning.
The motion noted the regiments strong links with Glasgow and its upcoming 350th anniversary.
It stated: "Council wishes to demonstrate its highest respect for the proud history of the Royal Marine Corps and the dedication and sacrifices it continues to make to protect the interests of the United Kingdom.
"Therefore, council agrees to award the Freedom of the City of Glasgow to the Royal Marines, to publically acknowledge the regard in which the unit is held and highlight the strong relationship that continues between the Royal Marines and Glasgow."
Lord Provost Sadie Docherty said: "I am delighted that the remarkable work of the Royal Marine is being recognised with the Freedom of the City.
"It will mark a wonderful 2014 for Glasgow, the year we host the Commonwealth Games, and the year this proud service celebrates its 350th anniversary."
