Three members of Osama Bin Laden's family had to be identified by their dental records after a plane crash at Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An inquest into the deaths and that of the pilot heard all four victims were "incinerated".
North Hampshire Coroner's Court was told the plane overshot the runway and burst into flames.
Coroner Andrew Bradley said they all died in an "intense" blaze.
The inquest comes two years after the crash which happened in July 2015 when a jet crashed into a car auction site.
Bin Laden's brother-in-law, Zuhair Hashim, half-sister, Sana Mohammed Bin Laden, and her mother Raja Bashir Hashim were killed along with pilot Mazen Al-Aqeel Da'jah Salem.
They all survived the crash impact but were "incinerated" by the fire, the inquest heard.
A report previously published by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) said emergency warnings prior to landing may have "saturated the pilot's mental capacity".
AAIB inspector Afandi Darlington told the inquest the Bin Laden family were found close to the plane door.
He said: "They may have attempted to vacate the aircraft but that attempt proved unsuccessful."
