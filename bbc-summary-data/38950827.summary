James Moorfoot had been playing for Langtoft AFC in Rudston, near Driffield, East Yorkshire, on Saturday.
An air ambulance was called when he collapsed at about 15:30 GMT but Mr Moorfoot died on the pitch.
Officials at the club said they were "numb with grief" but said the player had died "doing what he loved, in the village he loved, surrounded by the people who loved him".
The Hull Daily Mail is reporting that Mr Moorfoot was an English teacher at Hornsea School and Language College.
According to the paper, acting headteacher Steve Ostler told parents of Mr Moorfoot's death in an e-mail sent on Sunday.
On a Facebook tribute page, Mr Moorfoot was described by current and former pupils as a "top bloke" and a "fantastic teacher".
Students discussed setting up a memorial to him at the school on Monday.
Tributes also flooded in from Langtoft AFC and other sides affiliated to the East Riding County FA.
Langtoft AFC said: "We are currently trying to come to terms with the tragic and sudden passing of James Moorfoot.
"James had a contagious energy and humour which lit up a room and will be dearly missed by so many."
Club officials said they could not "thank enough" the emergency services and Hedon Rangers players "who worked so bravely to save James".
"Everyone associated with Langtoft Football Club, past and present, sends their love and condolences at this difficult time."
Writing on Facebook, Keith Simmonds said: "A real privilege to play against James and his team only this year.
"Our deepest thoughts go out to his family, friends and team mates. RIP from all Cottingham Rangers."
Yorkshire Ambulance Service said a number of paramedics and the air ambulance were called to the ground.
A spokeswoman said: "Despite everyone's efforts the patient sadly died at the scene."
