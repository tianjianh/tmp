The victim was attacked in the close, near to the Bank of Scotland on Main Street, at about 20:15 on Tuesday.
He is currently being treated for his injuries in Wishaw General Hospital.
Police have appealed for witnesses and said they were keen to speak to some people who walked past the scene and may have looked in the close.
Det Insp Kevin Jamieson said: "From our inquiries so far we know that there were a number of people walking by the close, one or two of whom looked in, around about the time of the assault.
"I would ask they, or indeed anyone with knowledge about the incident, contact police as their information could prove vital to our investigation."
Officers are believed to be following a positive line of inquiry.
