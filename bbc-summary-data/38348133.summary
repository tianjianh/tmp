Swissport strike 'will not impact on Cardiff Airport'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Airport has said a 48-hour strike by Swissport workers just before Christmas will not impact on its operations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew employed by Swissport are involved in the strike action across 18 UK airports.
Those striking are members of Unite the union which said it had six members at Cardiff Airport.
The strike, on 23 and 24 December, is part a long-running pay dispute.
