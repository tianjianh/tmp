Welsh cyclist Elinor Barker "will probably" quit Great Britain's track pursuit team to concentrate on individual races in 2017.

Barker, 21, was part of the British team that won gold at Rio 2016.
"I'm going to have a break now, then come back and re-evaluate what I want to do next year," said Barker.
"But I'll probably take a little step away from team pursuit and maybe do some more individual races instead for the next year at least."
Barker, from Cardiff, added: "I'm very interested in the individual track races so the points race, the scratch race, the individual pursuit.
"Also I was junior time trial world champion four years ago now and it would be nice to, as a senior rider, have a go at that and maybe see if I could win nationals or something like that."
Barker's Welsh compatriots Owain Doull and Becky James have also won medals in Rio.
Doull was the first Welsh competitor to win gold for Britain in the men's team pursuit and like Barker came through the ranks at the Maindy Flyers club in Cardiff.
"It's really special. We rode for the same club when we were little. I think Maindy Flyers has got a lot to answer for," said Barker.
James took keirin silver and hopes to win a sprint medal after setting a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Barker says she is now a "fan" in Rio having already enjoyed the success of Welsh compatriot Jazz Carlin, who claimed two swimming silvers for Britain.
"Watching Jazz Carlin, particularly, was a very special moment to me," said Barker.
"I've been following her progress for quite a few years since she did so well at the Commonwealth Games in particular.
"To see her come here and do so well is amazing."
