Sun hacking claims can go ahead, judge rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claims against the Sun newspaper by phone-hacking victims can go ahead, a High Court judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
News Group Newspapers (NGN), which has previously settled a large number of cases brought against the now-defunct News of the World, has always said there was no hacking activity at its sister tabloid.
But on Thursday in London, Mr Justice Mann allowed the claims to proceed.
More than 1,000 phone hacking claims have been settled by NGN - now News UK.
The judge said four claimants could amend their cases to include the daily newspaper for the first time in the proceedings against NGN.
Two of those claims are among a number scheduled for a trial in July.
Chris Hutchings, one of the lead solicitors for those claiming their private voicemail messages were hacked, said: "Today's ruling brings the Sun squarely into the civil litigation being brought against News Group."
"The court has now allowed claimants, for the first time, to include claims of phone hacking by the newspaper.
"The decision will also affect up to 50 further cases which are about to be commenced against the Defendant and will widen the disclosure of documentation it will have to provide going forward."
