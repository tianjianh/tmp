Welsh snooker champion Matthew Stevens says a stolen snooker cue was like "a best mate" to him.

He has had it since he was 12-years-old and used it in every tournament he has played since turning professional in 1994.
The two-times World Championships finalist from Carmarthenshire discovered the cue was missing from his car on Wednesday in Llanelli.
He is now having a new cue made - for the first time in his life.
"I've had it 27 years, so it's a bit devastating," Stevens told BBC Wales.
"It's my best mate really. It goes everywhere with me. It's the only one I use."
It was taken from his white BMW between 20:00 BST on Sunday and 08:30 on Monday while it was parked on Gilbert Crescent in Llanelli.
It was in a black case with the word MAXIMUS written in gold on the casing.
Dyfed-Powys Police is investigating the theft and Stevens has offered a reward for its return.
"It's sentimental value really. I can get used to another cue - that's not a problem - it will take a couple of weeks, probably, but it is just sentimental value, you know," says the 39-year-old.
"It's a great cue and it's lasted well. I'd obviously have played with it until the end of my career.
"But it hasn't returned yet, so I'm having a new cue made as we speak. Hopefully, it will come back but, if not, I'll have to get used to a new one."
The snooker star says he is travelling to London in the next week to pick-up his new cue, but would rather his old one is returned.
"Thieving - it's not nice, is it? Unfortunately, that's the world we live in these days.
"Obviously it is devastating but worse things happen - no-one's died. But it is still very upsetting - fingers crossed that it comes back."
