Fracking: Cheshire East Council leader accused of U-turn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fracking could happen in parts of Cheshire after all, a council leader who previously ruled it out has said.

Michael Jones, the Conservative leader of Cheshire East Council, said he would back plans to drill for shale gas if the process is found to be "safe".
Labour Councillor Sam Corcoran accused Mr Jones of making a U-turn, going back on "assurances" he gave last year.
The government last week awarded licenses for oil and gas exploration in Cheshire as part of a national policy.
The process of fracking - where water, chemicals and sand are blasted at shale rocks to release the gas trapped within - has proved deeply controversial in recent months.
Opponents have voiced concerns about earth tremors, water contamination and disruption to rural communities.
The industry, meanwhile, insists many of these fears are overblown, and that fracking can be carried out safely under the right regulations.
Leaving the safety issue aside, Mr Jones stressed he did not believe fracking would be "viable" in Cheshire East.
He told BBC Radio Manchester: "Most of our county is geothermal which is up to 5km deep and I believe if you go below 5km to find shale deposits they will evaporate.
"We don't think it is viable here. Our experts don't think it is viable.
"If they can get the evidence to say it is safe, if they can show people it is a good, viable entity, then I'm sure we'll pass it."
"We are in difficult times. National security, having our own energy is key. Geothermal in Cheshire East yes. If fracking works elsewhere and it is safe, I'm for it. But let it be safe."
Mr Corcoran said: "The problem is with the bombastic style of the statement made last year. It was a promise that was never in the power of Councillor Michael Jones to keep.
"So the current U-turn comes as no surprise to me."
Cheshire East will remain "fracking free", said the council in January last year. Leader Michael Jones told residents he was committed to exploiting much less controversial reserves of geothermal energy instead.
That caused problems though as councils are legally obliged to consider any planning application on its merits.
Today's dispute comes down to a battle of research - with Mr Jones claiming his research shows fracking just won't be viable in many parts of his borough.
But there does appear to have been one major concession made - Mr Jones said if fracking can be proven to be safe "then I'm sure we'll pass it".
Mr Corcoran agreed that the onus should be on those who want to frack to prove that it is safe.
He claimed government pressure meant instead that "local authorities have to prove it is dangerous before they reject planning applications".
In June, Lancashire County Council refused permission for Cuadrilla to frack at two sites. The company is appealing against the decision.
Ministers recently announced plans to fast-track fracking applications, saying they could take over the power to decide if councils repeatedly take longer than the 16-week statutory timeframe to evaluate plans.
