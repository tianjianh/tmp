The ParalympicsGB team for London will be the biggest ever to represent the country, with 288 athletes selected, alongside a further 13 team members, including sighted goalkeepers, tandem riders and guide runners.
Below is the list of those who have been officially selected by the British Paralympic Association.
Beijing medals: Four - two golds, one silver, one bronze
Ones to watch: Danielle Brown, John Stubbs
Performances by the Great Britain archers in the qualifying period allowed them to have a team of 13 athletes for the London Games.
A total of 20 hopefuls took part in a two-stage selection shoot at Lilleshall before the final squad, including six debutants, was announced.
Defending Paralympic champions Danielle Brown and John Stubbs topped the standings in the men's and women's compound events with Sharon Vennard, who is making her Games debut, and Phil Bottomley, who competed in Beijing, leading the way in the recurve events.
John Cavanagh, who won silver in Beijing in the compound W1 event, and women's bronze medallist Mel Clarke will both be hoping to add to their Paralympic medal tally.
Squad: John Stubbs, Richard Hennahane, Phil Bottomley, Kenny Allen, Murray Elliot, Paul Brown, John Cavanagh, Danielle Brown, Mel Clarke, Pippa Britton, Sharon Vennard, Leigh Walmsley, Kate Murray
Beijing medals: 17 - two gold, seven silver, eight bronze
Ones to watch: Dave Weir, Aled Davies, Jonnie Peacock, Libby Clegg, Shelly Woods, Katrina Hart
After a disappointing Beijing, where wheelchair racer David Weir won Britain's only gold medals, things are looking brighter for the GB athletics team in London.
The influence of performance director Peter Eriksson, who was appointed in late 2008, is evident, including the arrival of Canadian wheelchair racing star Chantal Petitclerc as a coach/mentor. Closer links with the Olympic set-up are reaping rewards.

The 49-strong squad includes established figures like Beijing medallists Weir, Stephen Miller, Dan Greaves, Libby Clegg, Ben Rushgrove and Mickey Bushell, as well as a crop of outstanding newcomers who still have plenty of experience like Hannah Cockcroft, Jonnie Peacock and Richard Whitehead.
At last year's World Championships in New Zealand, the 40-strong squad won 38 medals to finish third overall, and a similar haul in London would please coach Eriksson.

BC3 competitors Jessica Hunter and Jacob Thomas have been fast-tracked and won pairs gold in the recent test event at the Olympic Park, while brothers Peter and Stephen McGuire will be hoping to make an impact in the BC4 event.

At the 2010 World Equestrian Games they won 13 medals, including seven golds, and at last year's European Championships, the all-female squad won eight golds.
Nine-time gold medallist Lee Pearson returns to the squad after injury kept him out of the Europeans and he is joined by fellow Beijing medallists Sophie Christiansen and Debbie Criddle as well as Paralympic debutants Sophie Wells and Natasha Baker.
