[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Workers who work in maintenance, repair and overhaul at Cardiff Aviation will not be paid in full before Easter.
Bruce Dickinson, who said money had not cleared in time for staff to be paid, apologised to the employees involved.
Welsh Government small business subsidiary Finance Wales has invested Â£1.6m into the St Athan based firm.
It is thought around 100 staff might be affected.
Bruce Dickinson, chairman of Cardiff Aviation and Iron Maiden front-man, said: "Unfortunately, monies due to Cardiff Aviation will not have cleared in time for our maintenance, repair and overhaul staff to be paid in full before the holiday weekend.
"I have therefore decided to personally pay 50% of wages owed, in advance of Easter.
"I, and the wider management team, truly regret this situation, and appreciate the impact it will have on our team.
"We expressed our apologies to staff during a briefing earlier today, and reaffirmed our commitment to address the shortfall as soon as possible."
He said the funds should clear within the next two weeks, and added: "I know Cardiff Aviation has a bright future."
Meanwhile it has emerged that  Welsh Government and Cardiff Aviation have come to an agreement over the non-payment of rent.
BBC Wales previously reported that, as of January, the firm had not paid rent to the Welsh Government for the use of a hanger at St Athan owned by the administration.
In a joint statement the two organisations said "agreement has been reached on the terms of Cardiff Aviation's continued tenancy of St Athan Business Park".
