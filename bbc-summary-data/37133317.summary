Dashcam footage shows the black VW Golf travelling at speed down Leeds Road, Dewsbury, when it overtook a lorry and hit a white Ssangyong Korando, causing it to spin around.
A 35-year-old woman in the white car was airlifted to hospital with serious facial injuries. Her two-year-old daughter was unharmed in the 12 July incident.
The suspects then left the scene, West Yorkshire Police said.
