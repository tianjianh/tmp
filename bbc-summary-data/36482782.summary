A  man has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his neighbour after switching his plea days into his trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Tingle, 50, died at a property in Suffolk Square, Norwich, last December, after a dispute over a Â£40 debt, police said.
Kristian Tarragan, 31, also of Suffolk Square, had denied murder, but the jury at Norwich Crown Court was discharged after Tarragan admitted manslaughter.
He has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 29 July.
A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Tingle died as a result of a single stab wound.
Hours after the stabbing, armed police surrounded an address on the estate where Tarragon had fled and arrested him.
