[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Madison Glinski raised the money for terminally ill children by playing her violin in her hometown of St Ives.
She was nominated for a Young Fundraiser of the Year award and earlier this year her efforts were recognised by the prime minister.
Madison handed over a cheque for £52,006 for the Little Harbour Children's Hospice in St Austell.
She began fundraising in 2014 after making a new year's resolution and set an initial target of £500.
"I love making music and sharing my music with other people," Madison said.
"I do it because I enjoy helping other people - I get pleasure from seeing the smiles on children's faces."
