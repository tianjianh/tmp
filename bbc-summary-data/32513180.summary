Eco Comics said it had been forced to alter the ancient naked chalk hill figure in its online comic because some outlets had refused to release it.
The comic said the Cerne Giant's "rather renowned region" would be fully concealed in an alternative version.
The giant features in the comic's Englishman series alongside a superhero character based on St George.
A spokesperson for the comic said: "It seems a sad indictment of the times when a legendary landmark like the Cerne Giant - which any man, woman or child can visit any day of the week - must be covered up in a comic book."
"Through pressure, our hand has been forced. Outlets, particularly in the US, refuse any form of nudity in comic books," the spokesperson added.
The 180ft (55m) tall giant is owned and managed by The National Trust.
Helen Mann, the trust's West Dorset general manager, said: "The Cerne Abbas Giant stands out as a unique character in the Dorset countryside and the National Trust has never censored images of him.
"We like him as he is."
The landmark is given regular grass trimming and a full re-chalking every 25 years.
Local folklore describes the club-wielding figure, which dates back to at least 1694, as a symbol of spirituality and fertility.
In November 2013 in support of Movember, a campaign that raises awareness of prostate and testicular cancer, the figure sported a giant moustache
In the summer of 2007 a temporary chalk figure of Homer Simpson was drawn next to the giant, to promote The Simpsons Movie.
