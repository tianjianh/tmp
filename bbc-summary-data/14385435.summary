The 26-year-old centre, who also plays as a winger, has scored 13 tries in 44 appearances for the NRL side.
Purtell started his career with Canberra Raiders where he ran in 30 tries in 64 matches.
"I'm at a point where I'm looking for a new challenge and a new experience and this is the biggest challenge I could've taken on," he said.
"I will be 27 by the start of next season and entering the most important years of my career."
We needed longevity in our signings so it's a good deal for both sides
Bulls head coach Mick Potter added: "Adrian has played virtually every game in first grade in the past two years, in every position from lock to the wing.
"He's a big guy with speed and he'll be an asset to our team next season. I'm pleased to get him signed up for a few years.
"He wanted the security and we needed longevity in our signings so it's a good deal for both sides."
