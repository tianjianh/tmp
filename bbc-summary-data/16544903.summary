Warner, 25, raced to 104 not out as the hosts piled on 149-0 after bowling India out for only 161.
It was the fastest Test century by an opener - only 69 balls - and he brought it up with a huge six over long on.
India lost their last six wickets for 30 runs, with pacemen Ben Hilfenhaus taking 4-43 and Peter Siddle 3-42.
Warner, who played county cricket for Durham in 2009, said: "It's a pretty good feeling. The ball moved about but I just played my game.
"I've been lacking self-confidence but I showed the aggression I normally play with.
"In my mind I think India are bowled over already. I hope we can get this Test out of the way, capitalise on the start we've got and win this Test first.
"We're 2-0 up in the series, hopefully we can put 400-500 runs on the board and bowl them out again.
"If we can take the series that will be fantastic. Time will tell if we win 4-0 or 3-0."
Ed Cowan was unbeaten on 40 alongside Warner and Australia, who lead the four-match series 2-0, are on target for a victory which would hand them the series.
Australia's all-pace attack gave them the platform to work from by ripping into the Indian top order after winning the toss.
Hilfenhaus removed Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir in the morning session.
Siddle accounted for Rahul Dravid, bowled for the fourth time in five innings, while Ryan Harris, in his first Test appearance since November, disposed of Sachin Tendulkar.
Virat Kohli and VVS Laxman provided some resistance but once they subsided India fell apart.
Warner came in not long after tea and got straight to work, shrugging off a blow to the side of the head from paceman Umesh Yadav.
He changed his helmet and then rattled the next two balls to the boundary on the way to his magnificent century.
"I was a bit shaken up, but that's cricket," Warner said. "You have to watch the ball and I didn't."
