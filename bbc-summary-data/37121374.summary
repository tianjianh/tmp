Swansea City record signing Borja Baston will not be able to make his debut for another three weeks because of a thigh injury.

Manager Francesco Guidolin confirmed the Â£15m Spanish striker could be out until after the international break.
Borja will miss Saturday's visit of Hull, Tuesday's EFL Cup trip to Peterborough and the game against champions Leicester on 27 August.
"It would not be a clever move to play him against Hull," said Guidolin.
"It is a little problem. I would like to have him for Peterborough but it is not possible.
"I am not sure when he will be back but maybe after the international break."
Borja may return against Chelsea on 11 September.
Midfielder Jack Cork will captain the Swans in Saturday's home game with Premier League new boys Hull.
Leon Britton, who skippered Swansea to victory in their league opener at Burnley, is a fitness doubt.
Guidolin conceded that Wales left-back Neil Taylor is unlikely to feature on Saturday, but Iceland's Euro 2016 playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson and South Korean captain Ki Sung-Yueng are set to play.
