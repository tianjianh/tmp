The public has been invited to give its views on a £104m redevelopment of Glasgow's Queen Street station.

Network Rail has unveiled new designs for how the station will look as it begins an initial three-month process to gather passenger and public views on the project.
Queen Street is Scotland's third busiest station with 20 million passengers a year.
The work is due to begin this year and will be completed by 2019.
There will be a number of major new developments at the station and surrounding areas, including an extension of the east side of the building into the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre.
The current entrance will also be replaced with a glass facade.
The project is part of the Scottish government's £650m Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP), which aims to reduce journey times and increase capacity on Scotland's main rail routes.
Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "Queen Street station is at the heart of Glasgow's railway network and passengers using the station should enjoy an experience befitting of that role.
"The EGIP scheme will result in 30% more seats and around 20% faster journey times on our flagship route.
"It's already delivered the stunning new-look £25m Haymarket station in Edinburgh and this complete transformation of Queen Street means passengers will benefit at both ends and at all points in between."
The first part of the public consultation will run from 25 February until 31 May, with a second phase taking place between September and December 2014.
