Ranveer Singh was in the city to promote his new film, Befikre, with a free staged event in City Park.
Mr Singh is the first major Bollywood star to visit the city since it hosted the Indian Film Awards (IFA) ceremony in 2007.
Bradford was one of the first places in the UK to hold regular screenings of Hindi language films.
Mr Singh, who has more than 3.6m followers on Twitter, said the large concentration of people living in the area who came from the South Asian diaspora was the reason for his visit.
"I was told it has been a while since anyone had come to Bradford and usually stuff happens down south," Mr Singh said.
"It is a good move to come here because there are so many people who are interested in Hindi films who are based here."
Alongside his co-star and co-star Vaani Kapoor he also unveiled a statue of the pair based on a scene from the movie.
Befikre is billed as a romantic crime comedy set in Paris and opens on 9 December.
Bradford's long association with film was recognised by the UN in 2009 when it became the first city to be named City of Film by Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).
Analysis: Bradford's Bollywood Background
By Shabnam Bashir Mahmood, BBC Asian Network News
To have a Bollywood superstar, like Ranveer Singh, visit Bradford is a big deal for fans of Indian cinema in the city.
Bradford's love of Bollywood began almost 50 years ago when it became one of the go-to places for screenings for the South Asian immigrant communities.
Several cinemas opened specifically showing the all-singing, all-dancing movies that provided escapism for Pakistanis and Indians who'd settled in the UK.  For many it was the only source of entertainment.
My dad and his brother were among the first men in Bradford to show these films in the cinema after they had picked up the reels from distributors in London.
Sometimes they would play host to one of the many actors of the time like the legendary Waheeda Rahman, Vaijayanti Mala and Helen.  I was only 6 months old when I attended my first Bollywood premiere.
The love for Bollywood is still as strong among Bradford's South Asian diaspora and has spread to other communities too
