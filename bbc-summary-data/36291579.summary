[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heavyweight champion Tyson Fury should be barred from boxing, according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA).

Fury, 27, was filmed making homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic comments in a video posted on YouTube last week.
The Manchester fighter also voiced his views on bestiality, paedophilia and women during the 57-minute clip.
"This is not his first offence, he specialises in outrageous offensive and racist slurs," said CAA spokesman Jonathan Sacerdoti.
"Behaviour like this should prompt his sponsors to withdraw their backing. Britain does not tolerate or support racism.
"These specific anti-Semitic slurs are centuries old, and his use of them today in 2016 shows ignorance and malice."
The British Boxing Board of Control was not immediately available for comment.
Fury caused an upset by outpointing 40-year-old Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, with the rematch for his WBA and WBO heavyweight titles to take place at the Manchester Arena on 9 July.
His previous comments on homosexuality, paedophilia and women saw more than 100,000 people sign an online petition in an attempt to get him removed from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.
Fury apologised at the award ceremony last December.
