Oliver Ruse, a fifth generation butcher from Long Melford, Suffolk, was pronounced dead near Parkway car park, Bury St Edmunds, on Thursday.
About two hours later police found the body of his wife Deborah at her home in Long Melford.
Mrs Ruse's death is suspicious and Mr Ruse's said to be "unexplained".
The couple were both thought to be in their 30s, police said.
Ruse & Son Family Butchers, in Hall Street, Long Melford, was closed with police officers outside guarding the area. A single bunch of flowers had been left outside.
A house in Park Terrace, Little St Mary's, Long Melford, has also been sealed off.
Mr Ruse was found dead at about 12:10 GMT, while Mrs Ruse's body was discovered at about 14:40.
The BBC understands the couple had four daughters and Mrs Ruse had recently returned to the village after a period of living abroad.
The Rev Matthew Lawson, rector of Holy Trinity Church in Long Melford, said the community was "in shock and very, very sad".
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and all of those affected and we're particularly thinking of those four precious children," he said.
"I do hope our community pulls together to help all those affected, and I'm confident it will.
"There are questions we'll all be asking ourselves - could we have done more and supported them? - and hopefully the church can provide a place where people can reflect and work through these difficult questions."
Councillor Paul Moreton, of Long Melford Parish Council, said: "It's rocked the heart of the community.
"Obviously, everyone knows Ruse's butchers and they're a respected family and business.
"It's very, very sad for the children."
