Sean Gavin, of Charlestown Road, Manchester also stamped on 53-year-old John Terrell's head in July in a "tirade of abuse", police said.
The 28-year-old, who pleaded guilty to murder at an earlier hearing, was told at Manchester Crown Court that he would serve nearly 14 years in prison.
Duncan Thorpe, of Greater Manchester Police, said it was a "despicable" and "sustained brutal attack".
Shortly after 06:50 BST on 1 July, an eye-witness called 999 to report a disturbance outside Mr Terrell's flat on Peakdale Drive in Crumpsall, Manchester.
He was lying face down on the grass while Gavin shouted at him before punching and kicking him.
He then dragged Mr Terrell across the ground into the flat.
The only time Gavin stopped dragging him was to deliver further kicks, punches and stamps, police said.
He then walked away, leaving Mr Terrell unconscious.
Officers arrived soon afterwards and stopped Gavin before they found the victim badly injured on the floor.
He later died in hospital from his wounds.
Mr Thorpe said: "This was a sustained brutal attack on a vulnerable man.
"To this day we still don't know why he launched into the violent attack in the way that he did. He has never showed any remorse for his despicable actions."
