Wrexham have signed goalkeeper Luke Coddington on a month's loan from Huddersfield Town.

Both of the Dragons' senior goalkeepers, Shwan Jalal and Chris Dunn, picked up injuries during last weekend's goalless draw at North Ferriby.
Coddington, 21, moved to Huddersfield in the summer after leaving hometown club Middlesbrough.
He will make his senior debut at home to Braintree on Saturday.
