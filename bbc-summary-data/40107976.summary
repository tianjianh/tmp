Goalkeeper Tom McHale says Truro City are capable of pushing for promotion from National League South next season.

The Cornish club finished the 2015-16 campaign in the play-offs, but ended last season just one place above the relegation places.
McHale spent much of last term on loan at Weymouth, but impressed on his return and has signed a one-year deal.
"I think we've proved, as a young group of players, that we can kick it with the big boys in that league," he said.
"I do want to repay the club and see if we can get promoted this year, and I really think that there's an opportunity to do that with the squad we've got now."
Truro have already seen a large turnover of players this summer, with Martin Rice, Les Afful and captain Arran Pugh among seven players released.
Manager Lee Hodges has begun rebuilding his squad with the signing of Jordan Copp, and former loanees Stuart Yetton and Ben Gerring joining permanently.
"The players who have left the club to chase other ventures, good luck to them - we were an absolutely brilliant bunch of lads, I could never criticise that," McHale told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I had a few things going on, looking at a few different paths to be nearer to the family [in Scotland], but I'm delighted to be staying with Truro.
"Hopefully we can try and push on to try and do what we did in our first season in National League South, and maybe look for the play-offs and even promotion."
