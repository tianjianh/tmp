[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 33-year-old man arrested by police investigating the murder of 26-year-old David Clarke in north Belfast 14 years ago has been released unconditionally.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was arrested in the Bangor area on Thursday morning.
Police re-opened an investigation into the murder of Mr Clarke last month after they received new information.
The victim, who had learning difficulties, was beaten to death in his flat at Forthriver Road on 6 June 2001.
At the time, police said Mr Clarke's killing was one of the most savage and brutal they had ever dealt with.
