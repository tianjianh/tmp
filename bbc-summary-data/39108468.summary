NI Conservative party launches manifesto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservative party in Northern Ireland has launched its manifesto for the upcoming assembly election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The document is entitled "Time for a Real Fresh Start".
It sets out the same pledges and priorities listed by the party ahead of last year's Assembly election.
It includes a draft "statement of wrongs" on the past, which places blame for the Troubles on all groups and individuals who acted outside the law.
The party wants to lower corporation tax in Northern Ireland to 10%, create enterprise zones for research and development and abolish air passenger duty for short haul flights from Northern Ireland.
It also plans to increase spending on health and education and commit to completing the upgrade at the M2/M3/Westlink/York Road Junction.
The Conservative party is fielding 13 candidates in the assembly election and says it is "determined to remove the sectarian blinkers from Stormont politics".
