In the final seconds of a dull first half, Sam Vokes put the Premier League side ahead when he converted Defour's pull-back.
Defour sealed the win when he chipped Fabian Giefer from the edge of the box.
Vokes had a chance to score his second but he hit the post from Defour's free-kick.
Neither club named a full-strength side, with Burnley making eight changes and City keeping six of their previous line-up.
And once Burnley went in front, City - who have lost their past eight league games - never really looked like getting back into the game.
Indeed they almost conceded another when Aden Flint's over-hit backpass had to be saved by Giefer.
In the end, Burnley were far too strong and reached the fifth round for the first time since 2011.
