[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Valencia beat Alaves to secure their first win of the season, a day after sacking head coach Pako Ayestaran.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A penalty from Dani Parejo on 88 minutes gave Valencia a 2-1 victory that moved them off the foot of La Liga with five matches played.
Victor Laguardia's own goal had given Los Che the lead but a header from Gaizka Toquero levelled matters.
Ayestaran replaced Gary Neville in March but Los Che lost eight of their 12 matches while he was in charge.
Salvador Gonzalez Marco, also known as 'Voro', was named caretaker coach following Ayestaran's dismissal.
