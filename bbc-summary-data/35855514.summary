Kenichi Phillips, 18, was killed as he sat in a Seat Leon on St Marks Crescent shortly before 19:00 GMT on 17 March.
His father, who did not want to be named, said Kenichi "was loved and will not get the chance to see his son born".
A 22-year-old Birmingham man arrested on Friday has been released on police bail as inquires continue.
A post-mortem examination confirmed Kenichi died from a gunshot wound.
His father said: "Kenichi was only 18 years old. He was a great grandson, a grandson, a cousin, nephew, brother, son and friend."
West Midlands Police said several people are thought to have been in the area at the time and appealed for witnesses to contact the force or Crimestoppers.
Det Supt Mark Payne said: "This happened in the early evening at a time when people were returning home from work and children may have been playing outside. Innocent people going about their daily business could easily have been caught up in this.
"It's shocking, totally unacceptable. We need to get the person responsible, and the weapon used, off the streets as soon as possible.
"If anyone saw what happened, or suspects they know who is responsible, please call us so we can take action."
In January, officers expressed "great concern" over a spike in gun crime in Birmingham.
Chief Constable Dave Thompson said he had not known such frequent shootings during his five years with the West Midlands force.
However, overall gun crime figures for the city dropped from 524 in 2014 to 357 in 2015.
