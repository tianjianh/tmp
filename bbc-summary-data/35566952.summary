Oldham Athletic boosted their League One survival hopes with a comeback win over promotion-chasing Gillingham.

The chances of the Latics earning a first home league win since August looked slim when Gills captain Doug Loft blasted in a 35-yard shot.
But the hosts had looked threatening both before and after Loft's opener and levelled through Curtis Main's header.
And Jonathan Forte volleyed the winner with 17 minutes left, when he crashed home James Wilson's cross.
Gillingham slip to third, one place out of the automatic promotion places following Wigan's win over Walsall, while Oldham are 22nd, four points from safety.
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I'm chuffed for the players because they've had a tough season at home.
"I think that performance today has shown that they're really ready for a fight until the end of the season.
"It was a brilliant performance against a good team. In the manner we won it, I thought was really positive and I think it was a fully deserved win."
