Brazil corruption probe: Rio state ex-governor Cabral held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Brazil have arrested a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Sergio Cabral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said his arrest was connected to an investigation into allegations that the Rio state government embezzled more than $64m (Â£51m) of federal funds aimed for construction projects.
Federal officers searched his home on Thursday. The probe is part of Brazil's wider "Car Wash" corruption inquiry.
Bystander shouted "Thief!" as Mr Cabral was taken away for questioning.
He is the most high-profile politician to be arrested in recent months over corruption allegations.
Mr Cabral, from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), served two terms as governor of Rio state from 2007 to 2014.
Investigators said the directors of two construction companies had incriminated him.
They allege that Mr Cabral received kickbacks in return for awarding them lucrative contracts, such as the refurbishment of Rio's Maracana stadium.
Mr Cabral has not yet commented.
Police said his arrest was part of a major operation involving 230 police officers carrying out dozens of search and arrest warrants.
Mr Cabral is the latest in a long line of Brazilian politicians and top business people who have come under scrutiny as part of "Operation Car Wash".
One of the best-known politicians to have been named in connection with the investigation is former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Dozens of powerful figures have been found guilty and jailed, including the CEO of construction giant Odebrecht, Marcelo Odebrecht, and the treasurer of the Workers' Party, Joao Vaccari.
The scandal has rocked Brazil and led to mass street protests against corruption.
