Somerset are "still interested" in bringing back 36-year-old Gayle, despite his Â£4,900 fine for asking a reporter on a date during an interview.
The West Indies batsman was disciplined for "inappropriate conduct".
"If Somerset decided he was remorseful and wanted to sign him that would be no problem for me," said Shrubsole.
Somerset said negotiations to bring Gayle back to the club this summer are "ongoing".
He has been described as "box office" by the club's director of cricket Matthew Maynard, with Somerset selling out six of their seven T20 Blast games last year "essentially on the back of him signing".
Gayle, who scored 328 runs in three appearances for Somerset in 2015, is playing for Melbourne Renegades in Australia's Big Bash League.

He was answering questions from Network Ten's Mel McLaughlin at pitch-side in Hobart on Monday when he made the remark, also telling her, "Don't blush, baby", which was widely condemned as sexist.
Asked whether it would bother her playing for the same club as Gayle, 24-year-old Shrubsole told BBC Somerset: "No, not at all.
"It's Somerset's decision entirely as to whether they want him to come back or not. He was exceptional when he was here in those three T20 games and the amount of runs he scored was unbelievable."
Shrubsole, who will be part of the England women's squad for the tour of South Africa, said she felt his comments were "inappropriate".
She added: "The matter has been dealt with and Melbourne themselves have come out and punished him and I think the matter will be closed."
