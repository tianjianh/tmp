Naming-breach accused 'suffered enough'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Polish woman accused of breaching a judge's order when she named her daughter in an interview in her native language will not be jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, who lives near Oxford, was found to be in contempt of court after speaking to a Polish journalist about her circumstances.
But Judge Simon Oliver, at a family court hearing in Reading, said she had suffered enough.
He also issued a global ban on naming the woman to protect her daughter.
Oxfordshire County Council's social services had accused the woman of being in contempt of court after her interview.
However, Judge Oliver said she had already suffered by losing contact with her daughter, who has been at the centre of family court proceedings.
Issuing the ban, the judge said more publicity could cause her further emotional harm and, if her mother spoke to foreign journalists again, information could get back to England via the internet.
The publication of her circumstances on the internet had distressed the girl, the court heard.
At a previous hearing in December, the judge told the woman she could spend Christmas at home but could still face jail in the New Year.
Former Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who campaigns for improvements in the family justice system, has raised concerns about the case, saying it raised free speech issues.
