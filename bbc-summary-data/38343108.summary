[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trinity Mirror, which publishes the Western Mail and South Wales Echo, received £7.8m for the building on Park Street in central Cardiff.
Its Welsh arm, Media Wales, moved to the six storey purpose-built office block in 2008 but following cuts, it will retain one floor as a tenant.
Accountancy firm Deloitte has taken some of the vacant space but it is not known who has bought the site.
