[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 0-3 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe eased their relegation fears with a convincing victory at Crawley to send Dermot Drummy's men crashing to a fifth defeat in their last six home games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Alex started brightly, and recalled forward George Cooper had a shot blocked by goalkeeper Glenn Morris before Jordan Bowery missed a sitter from six yards from Chris Dagnall's pass.
Morris parried a goalbound drive from Cooper and Crewe threatened again when Bowery put a deflected shot wide, after Zoumana Bakayogo had forced another save from Morris.
The visitors deservedly went ahead when James Jones fired in his eighth league goal of the season from the penalty spot, after Josh Lelan brought down Ben Nugent.
Morris had previously saved two successive penalties, but was sent the wrong way in the 36th minute.
Crewe got firmly on top by scoring twice in two minutes at the start of the second half, with goals from Bowery and Dagnall.
Bowery rifled his first goal for the club in the 51st minute from a pass by Cooper, and then Callum Cooke set up Dagnall for the striker to stroke home his 10th goal of the season in all competitions.
Striker Rhys Murphy carried most threat for below-par Crawley, forcing saves from Ben Garratt either side of the interval and striking the crossbar late on.
