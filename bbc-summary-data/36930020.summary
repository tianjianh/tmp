[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 3-1 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brilliant second-half goals from Kevin van Veen and Josh Morris helped Scunthorpe come from behind to beat newly-promoted Bristol Rovers 3-1 on the opening day of the League One campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matty Taylor had given Rovers a first-half lead but Dutch striker Van Veen equalised in the 66th minute with a flashing drive from a tight angle that flew past goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall after the visitors had failed to clear a corner.
And nine minutes from time summer signing Morris popped up with the winner, cracking a blistering shot on the run from just outside the box past a stunned Mildenhall.
It was a real kick in the teeth for hard-working Rovers who had looked comfortable and composed for the opening hour.
They took the lead in the 31st minute from their first chance of the game through last season's 28-goal leading marksman Taylor, who controlled a ball into the box from Chris Lines to sweep an effort past keeper Luke Daniels from 10 yards.
But the visitors could not add to their advantage before cracking under increasing pressure in the second half as Scunthorpe hit back in style.
Substitute Kyle Wootton added the gloss in stoppage time when he broke clear to steer a shot past Mildenhall from the edge of the box.
