[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andre Murphy, 56, who was known as Nick and from County Wexford, died in the early hours of Monday after the incident at junction 28 eastbound.
Mr Murphy was thought to have been fixing a flat tyre on a horse trailer at about 04:10 GMT when he was hit.
A man, 45, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
Newport Coroner's Court heard Mr Murphy had been on his way to deliver horses when the incident happened.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The hearing was told that the provisional cause of death was multiple external and internal injuries to head, chest and abdomen and blunt vehicular trauma.
The coroner, Mr David Bowen, said due to ongoing police inquiries the inquest would be adjourned for three months.
The incident brought the motorway to a standstill for much of Monday morning, with tailbacks stretching to 11 miles.
The man arrested in connection with the crash has been released on police bail.
