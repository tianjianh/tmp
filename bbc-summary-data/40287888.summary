Champions Trophy 2017: Tournament director happy with Cardiff matches

ICC Champions Trophy tournament director Steve Elworthy says he is happy with how Glamorgan staged their four games.

Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan had criticised some of the low crowds in Cardiff during the tournament.
England captain Eoin Morgan said his side had no home advantage from the pitch in the semi-final defeat to Pakistan.
Elworthy said: "I think they have done an exceptional job, so we are happy."
Cardiff hosted three group games and England's semi-final defeat, as Wales staged matches in the Champions Trophy for a second time.
"We always have had a wonderful relationship with Glamorgan," said Elworthy.
"They hosted the 2013 edition of the tournament and it was hugely successful then and we have built on that.
"Hugh Morris (Glamorgan chief executive) runs a fantastic ship and they have a wonderful team who deliver the tournament for us."
Pitch not perfect?
Questions were raised about the semi-final wicket in Cardiff when England were bowled out for 211, but Pakistan chased down their target with only two wickets lost.
It was a used wicket which Morris had stated was the International Cricket Council's decision, but Elworthy insisted tournament bosses had taken advice on the decision not to have a fresh strip for the semi-final.
"There is no real policy towards the pitch," said Elworthy.
"We are guided by the groundsmen at the venues and the ICC pitch consultant who goes around the ground.
"For example, at Edgbaston we played three matches on one pitch.
"It's an old clich√© but you can only see how a pitch performs until both teams have batted on it.
"Pakistan produced an incredible performance on the day.
"There is no set guide and when we spoke to the groundsmen about the game playing from the semi-final perspective, he said he was going to produce a good one-day wicket.
"That's all we are after. We have seen some of that during the tournament and the guys at all three venues have done a fantastic job.
"So I think they are fine and no issues at all."
Crowd control
Vaughan made his comments about the Cardiff crowds following the three group games involving England, New Zealand, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
"We have learned a little bit but we have had had some great results down there in Cardiff," said Elworthy.
"Everybody is entitled to their opinion and you have to take the good with the bad.
"There are going to be people who don't see it as well as you do, that's just the way it is.
"Both the England game against New Zealand and the semi-final were sell-outs.
"We were affected in that England-New Zealand game by some bad weather and had a few no-shows.
"It's difficult to know why people haven't come but we have that data and will be speaking to them why they didn't pitch up on the day."
Vaughan also stated he believes Trent Bridge should have been used, but Elworthy believes Cardiff complemented the Oval and Edgbaston.
"It works well because they are very much in a triangle and close proximity so the logistics work well," said Elworthy
"Those three venues have worked incredibly well in the past and have done again."
Elworthy believes these lessons can be learned ahead of the World Cup in 2019, with Cardiff set to host four matches.
"We will work with Glamorgan towards 2019 to see how we can mitigate that down there," said Elworthy.
"We have 11 venues pencilled in at the moment for the World Cup 2019 and Cardiff is one of those."
'Spectacular tournament'
Elworthy is satisfied with the 2017 tournament as India and Pakistan face each other in the final at The Oval on Sunday.
"It has been spectacular and another great tournament," said Elworthy.
"We had a few matches at the beginning that were rain affected and some side were on the wrong end of those results.
"I have always judged a tournament by the attendances.
"In 2013 we had 83 per cent capacity and this tournament so far we have had over 90 per cent, so we have grown.
"I am happy with where we are at."
