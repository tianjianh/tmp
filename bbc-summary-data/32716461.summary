A teenage girl has appeared in a Mexican court in a custody case filed by a US woman, weeks after another girl was wrongly sent to America.

Alondra Diaz was in the court in the western Michoacan state to confirm her identity and consider DNA tests.
This comes after a video emerged showing another girl, Alondra Luna Nunez, being taken against her will by police to the US.
DNA tests later revealed the mistake and the girl was returned home.
Alondra Diaz appeared in the court in Los Reyes on Tuesday.
Mexican officials are now expected to conduct DNA test to confirm whether the girl is indeed the daughter of Dorotea Garcia - a Houston resident who filed the case.
The case dates back to 2007, when Mexico received Ms Garcia's request to help return her daughter who was allegedly taken by her father to Mexico.
Last month's video of Alondra Luna Nunez resisting police after she was seized in her school on court orders spread widely on social media, prompting protests.
She was reportedly mistakenly identified by a scar on her nose.
"The other girl had a scar, but on the eyebrow, and I have one on my nose," Alondra Luna Nunez told the Associated Press.
"I mean, all this was stirred up over that."
