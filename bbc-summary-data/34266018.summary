The A27 has fully reopened for the first time since the Shoreham air crash in which 11 people died when a vintage jet plummeted on to the road.

Highways England said the last westbound lane had reopened, but a 40mph speed limit would remain on the carriageway as recovery work continued.
Work to replace damaged traffic lights could still take up to eight weeks.
Asset manager Peter Phillips said highways staff had been working closely with police on vital investigations.
"We would like to thank drivers for their patience during this difficult time and send our heartfelt condolences to anyone who has been affected," he said.
He said the road was repaired as quickly as possible after Sussex Police and other partners left the site at the weekend.
The westbound entry slip road at the Adur Flyover and the north access to Shoreham Airport have also reopened.
At the Sussex Pad junction, a barrier has been installed in the central reserve to prevent right hand turns while the traffic lights are replaced.
Drivers are being diverted to the next junction to return on the other carriageway.
Highways England said a crossing for pedestrians, horse riders and cyclists would not be safe to provide until the lights were repaired.
The four-lane A27 was completely closed in both directions after the crash on 22 August during the Shoreham Airshow. Two lanes opened on 30 August.
