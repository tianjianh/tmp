The track shares the honour with Clean Bandit's Rather Be, according to the Official Charts Company.
Mike Read's UKIP Calypso finished just outside the top 40, at number 44.
Earlier this week, the former BBC Radio DJ "apologised unreservedly" and asked for the song to be withdrawn following complaints that it was racist.
UKIP Calypso, performed with a mock Caribbean accent, sings the praises of party leader Nigel Farage.
"I am so sorry that the song unintentionally caused offence," Read said. "I have told the record company to withdraw the single immediately."
