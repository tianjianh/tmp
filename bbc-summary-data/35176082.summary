The Ministry of Defence has released pictures of some wearing Santa hats and Christmas jumpers over their uniforms and taking part in carol singing.
Thousands of UK military staff are stationed around the world carrying out patrols and anti-terrorism work.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon praised their professionalism.
About 1,000 personnel are involved in the campaign against the so-called Islamic State group, with the majority based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.
In the Gulf, HMS St Albans and other Royal Navy warships are serving over the festive period.
In the South Atlantic, 1,200 are stationed in the Falkland Islands while HMS Protector is on patrol in Antarctica.
In Afghanistan, 450 personnel from the Army and other services are supporting Afghan National Security Forces.
Mr Fallon said: "This Christmas our brave servicemen and women are serving overseas and here at home to keep us safe, whether securing the skies, patrolling the seas, or leading in the fight against Daesh [Islamic State].
"I pay tribute to their determination, professionalism, and everything they have done this year."
