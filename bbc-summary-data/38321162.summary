[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nico Donnelly jailed for Glasgow stabbing murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for the murder of Jamie Johnstone, who was the third member of his family to be killed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Johnstone, 21, died after suffering two chest wounds in an attack by Nico Donnelly outside a tower block in Sandyhills, Glasgow in January.
At the High Court in Glasgow, 23 year-old Donnelly was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years.
Mr Johnstone's mother and cousin were killed in a Glasgow flat in an unrelated incident 2006.
Donnelly, of Cambuslang, has a string of assault convictions.
Judge Lord Beckett told him: "As a result of your inexcusable violence, Mr Johnstone has lost his life at the age of only 21, and his family has lost him forever."
Donnelly had claimed that he and his friend, Cameron Ferguson, had been approached by Mr Johnstone while they were waiting for a taxi.
He claimed that Mr Johnstone had threatened his friend, so he took a vegetable knife out of his pocket to "scare" him.
Donnelly claimed Mr Johnstone then tried to hit him with a bottle - but this was disputed by the prosecution.
It was claimed the knife then came into contact with Mr Johnstone as Donnelly tried to shield himself and that he had no intention of stabbing him.
However, he was found guilty of murder.
Mr Ferguson had also faced a murder charge, but prosecutors dropped the allegation during the trial.
Mr Johnstone's mother Bernadette and her 25-year-old nephew John Park were killed in a hammer attack in the Cranhill area of Glasgow in 2006.
Gerald McLeish was convicted of the murder of Mrs Johnstone and the culpable homicide of Mr Park.
