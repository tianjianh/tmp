Cameroon have refused to travel to play an international friendly in a dispute over money.

Their game against Algeria, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, has been called-off as a result.
The row broke out after the team played two games, against Morocco and Sudan, in Marrakesh.
Bonuses and appearance fees for the mini-tournament were not paid and the players decided not to go to Algeria in protest.
The players reiterate their patriotism [but] call on the authorities to fulfill their commitments
"The problem of the fees was raised a week ago and no solution has been found," the players said in a statement.
"The team played with commitment and professionalism in Marrakesh, but have decided not to go to Algeria to play the match scheduled for 15 November.
"The players of the national team reiterate their patriotism and call on the Cameroonian football authorities to fulfill their commitments to the players."
The dispute is a major problem for new Indomitable Lions coach Denis Lavagne, who replaced the sacked Javier Clemente last month.
Not all the players were happy with the departure of Clemente, despite the Indomitable Lions' failure to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.
Lavagne is understood to be resisting moves by Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot) officials to impose wholesale sanctions on the squad.
The failure to pay bonuses and appearance fees on time is part of a long-standing dispute between Fecafoot and the country's sports ministry, which largely funds the international team.
