Traffic between Scotland and England faces major disruption over the weekend.
North and southbound carriageways between J4 Maryville and J5 Raith were shut at 20:00 on Friday and were due to reopen at 06:00 on Monday.
It is for the safe demolition of Bothwellpark Road Bridge near Hamilton.
Transport Scotland said the old bridge was brought down on Saturday morning and the new one put in its place.
The weekend closure means there is no access from the M73 to the M74 southbound at J4 Maryville or to the M74 northbound at J5 Raith.
Signed diversion routes will be in place via the A725, A8 and the M73, although Transport Scotland is warning road users to expect major delays on all surrounding routes.
Motorists will continue to have access to the M74 southbound at J5 Raith and the M74 northbound at J4 Maryville and J3A Daldowie.
However, there will be no access to Bothwell Services from the M74 southbound.
The next available service area is the M74 southbound at J11 Happendon and J13 Abington.
Graeme Reid, Transport Scotland project manager for the M8, M73, M74 Motorway Improvements Project, said his team would be working around the clock to get the demolition completed on schedule.
He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "The current bridge isn't wide enough. The road on this location was three lanes - with the new upgrade it will be four lanes and a hard shoulder. So we need a wider bridge and we have constructed that bridge ahead of this demolition.
"It is just to the north of the Raith Interchange, which is one of the most congested junctions in Scotland.
"We have undertaken significant change to the Raith Interchange with the construction of the underpass, and these four lanes from the M73 down to Hamilton, and also four lanes from the Raith Interchange north from the M73, will make a significant improvement to journey time."
He added: "We expect significant disruption at the start. Overnight, it's been quiet and we thank drivers for avoiding the area. However, as we move into today, we expect significant disruption on the A725 and on the M73 in particular.
"If you are travelling east to west, and you are using the A8, I would ask drivers to consider alternative routes via the M80.
"If you have to go south this weekend, then consider the A1. If that's not possible, then allow additional time for your journey."
In a bid to reduce congestion on alternative routes, South Lanarkshire Council will put in place parking restrictions on a short section of Main Street, Bothwell, for the duration of the weekend closure.
ScotRail will also provide extra capacity on trains on Lanarkshire railway services throughout the weekend.
