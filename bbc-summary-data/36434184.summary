Figures released by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) show how one 38-year-old Liverpool man took 39 goes to pass the driving test.
Heckmondwike, in Yorkshire, accounted for a fifth of the top 20 practical test repeaters.
The Driving Instructors Association questioned whether people should be able to sit tests so many times.
DVSA's chief examiner Lesley Young said: "The result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.
"It's essential that all drivers demonstrate they have the right skills, knowledge and attitude to drive safely."
The figures also include the top 20 repeat theory test candidates. Between them, the top 20 have attempted to take the test 1,309 times. Only eight have yet managed to pass.
Topping the list was a 30-year-old woman who has sat the theory test 113 times at the Ilford centre.
The second spot was taken by a 40-year-old man who has tried 107 times at the Ilford centre followed by a 30-year-old man who has failed 86 times in Peterborough.
Olivia Baldock-Ward, training manager at the Driving Instructors Association, said: "There is the issue of whether people who are failing the theory test 100 times should be allowed to try again and again. There is an issue of road safety here.
"On average, people might need two or three goes at passing the tests. If it is much more than that, then there may be other issues involved.
"Driving is a serious matter - people do die on the roads."
