Second win for Glee Club in 20th Century Fox trademark case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a British comedy club chain has won a second trademark appeal hearing against the makes of the hit US TV show Glee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twentieth Century Fox had appealed against a High Court ruling that it breached a trademark registered by The Glee Club chain.
But three appeal court judges dismissed its latest argument that EU trademark law affected the earlier ruling.
The broadcaster said it will now "seek consideration" from the Supreme Court.

But the owner of the Glee Club chain, Mark Tughan, said he now expected compensation.
"Ultimately, they just infringed my intellectual property and they need to pay.
"My business was affected and I've persuaded two courts so far that I have suffered detriment."
He said he was not asking for the name of the TV programme - which started in 2009 on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox Channel - to be changed.
"The TV show is over reallyâ€¦ Things may change if they revive it, who knows? But I think the moment has passed," he said.
The Glee Club name was first registered as a trademark in 1999.
Mr Tughan launched proceedings against Fox in 2011 and successfully argued in the High Court in 2014 that the show breached its trademark right to The Glee Club name.
Fox appealed but lost its case in February.
But because they claimed EU law affected the ruling, a new hearing, with the UK Intellectual Property Office present, was scheduled on 25 May.
There, three judge dismissed Fox's latest challenge.
The Glee Club opened in Birmingham in 1994 and now has branches in Cardiff, Nottingham and Oxford.
