[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A crew from Cwmbran, Torfaen, was attacked with bottles by about 15 youngsters after putting out a bonfire in the Greenmeadow area of the town.
Youths also threw stones and shouted abuse at firefighters putting out a grass fire in the Phillipstown area of New Tredegar, Caerphilly, on Saturday.
Two people were arrested in Newport after reports fireworks were thrown.
Gwent Police said the pair were arrested on suspicion of public order offences after the alleged incident in Corporation Road in the Pill area of the city at around 19:20 GMT.
The attacks on firefighers come after a crew was attacked with fireworks in Cardiff on Tuesday.
No-one was injured in either of the incidents but South Wales Fire Service confirmed CCTV footage from its appliances would be passed to Gwent Police.
The incidents happened within 30 minutes of each other on a night when firefighters in south Wales had 309 calls between 16:00 GMT and midnight with the "majority relating to bonfire/firework activity".
The Aberbargoed crew was targeted in the first incident on Saturday at around 21:30 near Fernhill Terrace in Phillipstown.
A South Wales Fire Service spokesman added a "group of around 15 male and female youths" then attacked the Cwmbran crew near Barnets, just off Ty Gwyn Way.
Meanwhile, Barry firefighters were called to a second-floor fire at a hair salon in Church Road just after 21:30 after a firework accidentally went through an open window.
North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had between 10 and 15 calls linked to fireworks between 17:00 and 20:00 but confirmed there were no major incidents.
