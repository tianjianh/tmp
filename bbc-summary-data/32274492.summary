Two men were trapped in a disused bank vault in Cardiff for over four hours before being freed by firefighters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Specialist rescues teams were called to the building at Wood Street in the early hours.
Air supply to the vault was limited and firefighters drilled a hole so they could speak to the men as they worked.
The pair, who were believed to be at the building for a function, were freed uninjured at 06:45 BST, according to South Wales Fire and Rescue Service.
