Alvaro Morata hit the crossbar for the hosts with a long-range effort before Mario Mandzukic headed in from Paul Pogba's chip just before half-time.
Riccardo Saponara had Empoli's best chance but he shot over.
The victory takes Juventus six points above Napoli, who play away at Udinese in their game in hand on Sunday (11:30 BST).
Massimiliano Allegri's side had chances to extend their lead but Kwadwo Asamoah just failed to reach the ball after Lukasz Skorupski spilled Morata's drive.
In the closing minutes, Morata ran down the left wing and pulled the ball back for Simone Zaza, whose shot was saved by Skorupski.
