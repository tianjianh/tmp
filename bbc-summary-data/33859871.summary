[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who set fire to his wife's clothes after discovering she had been having an affair has been given a community order and restraining order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Honeybell, from Nottingham, also accepted posting "revenge porn" photos of his wife on Facebook, but was not charged with a revenge porn offence.
Instead, he was charged with arson for burning the clothes and harassment for a series of abusive texts, phone calls and voice messages.
The 49-year-old pleaded guilty.
He told Nottingham Magistrates' Court he was "upset and sorry" for setting fire to his wife's clothes on 4 June, as well as harassing her by sending 18 text messages and leaving six voicemails on 16 June.
The naked photos were mentioned at the previous court hearing but not at his sentencing.
When asked outside of court about the posting of naked photos of his wife he said he could not justify it.
"I can't now, obviously," he said.
"When you think back on what you've done you shouldn't have done it.
"It was just impulse, it was a thing, when you get angry you just do things off the cuff."
He and Sarah Honeybell, who had been married for 23 years, are now divorcing.
On the day he harassed her with the texts and phone calls, he wrote on his Facebook wall that he was "Off to see the rozzers" as he had "burnt her clothes, put naked photos of her on the Internet".
After admitting arson and harassment in court on 8 July he posted a newspaper article about the case on his Facebook wall and wrote "Famous" in the caption underneath.
The Crown Prosecution Service was asked to comment on why Honeybell was not charged with a revenge porn offence.
A spokesperson said: "The charge of harassment without violence was pursued because it gave the court sufficient sentencing powers for the full extent of David Honeybell's offending.
"The CPS also took into account the needs expressed by the victim for the case to progress through the court expeditiously.
"As a result of the approach taken, the defendant pleaded guilty without the need for the victim to give evidence."
The restraining order and community order will both apply for a year.
