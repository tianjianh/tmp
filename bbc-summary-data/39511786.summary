[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A first edition of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, originally bought for £14, has sold at auction for £13,500.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The book had unknowingly been bought as part of a lot by a woman from Lancashire.
After discovering it she approached auctioneers Dominic Winter. Chris Albury said he almost "fell off his chair" when he saw a photo.
Crime And Punishment was first published in Russian in 1866 and in English 20 years later.
"I could trace fewer than 10 copies in libraries worldwide, and only one auction record for a New York auction in 1991 for the equivalent of £1,000," Mr Albury, from the Gloucestershire auctioneers, said.
No other copies of the London or New York first editions have been seen at auction since.
English publisher Henry Vizetelly was the first person to sell a translated version as part of his "One-Volume Novel" series.
