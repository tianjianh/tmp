Stuart Gallear, 51, had admitted fatally stabbing his wife Mandy, 42, at their home in Hindley, Wigan, in October 2016, but denied murder.
He told a jury at Manchester Crown Court he momentarily lost control, but was found guilty of her murder.
Judge Mr Justice Openshaw sentenced Gallear to a minimum of 17 years.
He said Gallear, who is originally from Wolverhampton, "gave way to self-indulgence, verging on self-pity", as he faced the break-up of his family.
Mrs Gallear was found motionless on the kitchen floor of their home in Makinson Avenue with three deep wounds to her chest by police on 6 October.
She was rushed to hospital but later pronounced dead.
Six months earlier, she had confessed to an extra-marital relationship, but said it had ended.
Gallear told police he remembered talking "amicably" with his wife before the attack after he returned from drinking in a local pub.
He said she told him "I love him more than you", but his memory of what happened next was "blurred".
The prosecution said the stabbing was the culmination of his anger and resentment, which built up over two days.
Mr Justice Openshaw said Gallear "believed... she would leave him, take their children, the house would be sold and he would be left with nothing".
"It only needed a small matter to detonate these pent-up emotions," he said.
"I accept there was no premeditation, but I am unable to find there was any substantial provocation.
"She believed she would find greater happiness with another... this does not excuse, justify or simply mitigate his conduct in fatally stabbing her."
