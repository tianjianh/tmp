Egg throwers and amateur radio enthusiasts have joined forces in a bid to launch an egg into "space".

Eggsplorer-1 was launched at the 10th annual World Egg Throwing Championships held at Swaton in Lincolnshire.
The event saw teams from around the world competing in Russian Egg Roulette, Egg Trebuchet and throwing eggs at a bodybuilder.
Organisers said they had "high hopes" for the pairing of eggs and ham - another name for amateur radio fans.
The idea for the flight came from South Kesteven Amateur Radio Society (Skars) chairman Andrew Garratt who suggested putting an egg into space inside a high-altitude balloon.
The mission, which launched on Sunday, hoped to reach a height of 40km (24 miles) and to set a record for transporting raw food at the greatest altitude.
Mr Garratt said onboard cameras and technical equipment were used to monitor the egg and identify issues with raw food transportation at extreme temperatures.
He said if successful the team would look at the possibility of supplying the International Space Station (ISS) with eggs.
After the flight, the balloon craft is expected to return to earth under a parachute, landing somewhere in the sea between Skegness and Hull.
The egg-throwing championship, part of Swaton Vintage Day, raised money for good causes.
It attracted about 300 competitors from around the world and 12,000 spectators.
