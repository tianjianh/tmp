Cheshire East: Plans for 36,000 homes backed by government inspector

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan for 36,000 new homes across east Cheshire have been approved by the government's planning inspector.

The inspector said the proposals were "soundly based" after "serious shortcomings" were identified with an earlier version of them in 2014.
Ancient woodland south of Macclesfield has been removed from the plans to "secure its long term future".
Cheshire East Council has previously described itself as being "besieged" by property developers.
Cheshire East Council Leader Rachel Bailey said: "We are confident that our Local Plan, which is comprehensive and robust, will give the people of Cheshire East its best protection against unplanned and unsustainable development."
Land for an extra 7,000 homes was added to the strategy in 2015, a year after a government inspector found that the borough's economy was likely to grow faster than anticipated.
A number of extra greenbelt sites were earmarked around Knutsford, Wilmslow and Macclesfield, in addition to land already included near Crewe, Nantwich, Sandbach and Congleton.
Reacting to the latest proposals, inspector Stephen Pratt told the council in a letter that they were "appropriate, justified, effective, deliverable and soundly based".
But Mr Pratt instructed the council to remove controversial proposals to earmark ancient woodland at Cock Wood near Macclesfield for housing after 2030, after "concerns" from local residents.
Cheshire East Council will begin a final six-week consultation in January before the strategy comes into effect.
