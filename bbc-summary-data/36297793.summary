The former Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Dundee United and Celtic midfielder featured for the last time in a 4-0 home hammering by Ross County.
"We wanted to go out with a winning performance for him after the great career he has had," McInnes said.
"It really was a disappointment; that's not how we wanted it to play out."
McInnes gave a debut to Australian goalkeeper Aaron Lennox and also started defender Scott McKenna, 19, and 18-year-old striker Scott Wright, while 17-year-old defender Daniel Harvie and forward Joe Nuttall, 19, featured off the bench.
"It's not often I have the chance and the luxury of playing a lot of youngsters," he noted.
"Losing 4-0 at home is unlike us and the attitude of the players up until today has been terrific, so we won't get caught up too much in what happened.
"But I know what needs to be done next season. I would like to get more options in forward areas, I would like another goalkeeper and another defender - and maybe one or two others.
"I feel we need to bring in enough good players to help the group of players I have."
Robson, who also played for Middlesbrough, Vancouver Whitecaps and Sheffield United, intends to go into coaching and management after a career featuring more than 650 games, 17 caps for Scotland, a league title with Celtic and League Cup winners medals with the Glasgow side and Aberdeen.
"He has been a great player to have worked with even if his influence hasn't been so great for the team in the last couple of years," added McInnes, who played alongside Robson at Tannadice.
"He has always given 100% effort to every aspect of his game. He is a great professional and his whole approach and length of career is something youngsters can learn from."
County boss Jim McIntyre hailed a "fabulous" final-day display from his side, rounding off "the most successful season in the club's history" in style.
Brian Graham's penalty, Alex Schalk's spectacular scissor-kick, Liam Boyce's 20th goal of the season and a long-range Martin Woods effort brought County only a second win in their final nine league games since winning the League Cup final against Hibernian.
"It was a fantastic performance," said McIntyre. "The boys were right at it from the word go and showed real intent.
"I thought we showed real maturity about our play.

"We set the boys a target of top-six at the start of the season and they achieved that.
"We were looking for a good cup run and we managed to win it.
"It has been the most successful season in this club's history and the players deserve all the credit.
"They put in the performances week in, week out, and react to poor results as well."
