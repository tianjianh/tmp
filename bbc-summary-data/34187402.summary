Intelling Limited provides customer services support for companies, such as TalkTalk and O2.
The posts will be created over the next three years and pay salaries of Â£16,000 a year, on average. The company said 45 of the posts had already been filled.
Invest NI is contributing Â£1m towards the project.
Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell said the investment was "positive news" for the Northern Ireland economy.
"Intelling is an ambitious, young company and I welcome its decision to choose Northern Ireland as the location for its expansion," he said.
"It creates much-needed jobs that offer flexible employment and the opportunity to develop transferable skills."
Phil Morgan, chief executive of Intelling Ltd, said: "The availability of talent here and cost competitive environment, along with Invest NI support, made Northern Ireland the best choice for Intelling over alternative locations."
