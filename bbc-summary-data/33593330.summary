Dubbed the Papilionanda David Cameron, Singapore's National Parks Board described the purple orchid as a "strong and upright flowering spray that could bear up to 10 large and attractive blooms".
The special hybrid flower was named after Mr Cameron during the second day of a four-day visit to Asia.
It is a Singapore tradition to cultivate orchids, its national flower.
The tropical Southeast Asian nation cultivates special orchid hybrids and names them after visiting foreign leaders as part of its diplomatic practice.
Many visiting diplomats including the late South African leader Nelson Mandela and Princess Diana, to more recently, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have had orchids named after them.
Celebrities have also had orchids named after them.
British singer Elton John, who visited Singapore in 2012, had a purple and white orchid hybrid named after him.
And stars from the sporting world are also honoured with a floral namesake.
