A pun by comedian Darren Walsh has scooped the prize for funniest joke of the Edinburgh Fringe.

The 39-year-old, whose show Punderbolt is on at the Pleasance, took first place in the vote by TV channel Dave.
The winning joke was: "I just deleted all the German names off my phone. It's Hans free."
Walsh, from Peterborough, who won the first UK Pun Championship last year, said he was delighted. "What a punderful feeling," he said.
It was the eighth year that the joke award has been made. Previous winners include Tim Vine, Stewart Francis, Zoe Lyons and Nick Helm.
This year saw the youngest comedian make the award shortlist, as 12-year-old 'Grace The Child' claimed 10th place.
The funniest joke was chosen from a shortlist compiled by a panel of judges, who saw an average of 60 shows each at this year's Edinburgh Fringe.
The shortlisted gags were then put to 2,000 people, with no reference to the comedians who told them, who then voted for the jokes they found the funniest.
The judges also released a list of jokes which just missed out on the shortlist.
