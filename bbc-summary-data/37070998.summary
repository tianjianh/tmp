[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire's last-wicket pair Jordan Clark and Kyle Jarvis shared a record-breaking stand of 107 to help their side take control at Old Trafford.

Yorkshire had reduced the hosts from 238-1 to 299-7 after tea on Saturday, but Lancs then plundered 195 runs in an extended morning session to hit back.
Clark (84*) and Jarvis (55) both made career-bests, helped by Arron Lilley (45) as Lancs were bowled out for 494.
Yorkshire then replied on 136-2, of which Alex Lees has so far made 62.
Jarvis continued an already good day by getting the first wicket to fall, trapping Adam Lyth for 25, while Jack Leaning edged Tom Smith to Liam Livingstone at first slip seven overs later.
But, although Lees then bedded in with captain Andrew Gale in a third-wicket stand so far worth 81, the Tykes will resume on day three still needing another 209 runs to avoid the follow-on.
That was thanks first to Clark's 87-run eighth-wicket stand with Lilley. And, although Nathan Buck went cheaply, Clark then helped reach a century partnership with ex-Zimbabwe seamer Jarvis, who made a maiden first-class fifty from number eleven.
Their efforts eventually delayed lunch by 25 minutes before the previously well plundered England leg-spinner Adil Rashid got his revenge by trapping Jarvis lbw to wrap up the innings in the 133rd over.
The 107-run last-wicket stand between Clark and Jarvis was Lancashire's best in a Roses match, surpassing the 82 put on in 1991 by Ian Austin and Peter Martin at Scarborough.
But it was just a run short of breaking the all-time Roses match last-wicket record partnership of 108 set by Lees Whitehead and the venerable Lord Hawke at Old Trafford in 1903.
Lancashire seamer Kyle Jarvis told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was set up nicely this morning by Arron and Clarky, who batted really well. I came in and played a few shots and it came off.
"We didn't have an ideal session last night losing those six wickets, and we were in a bit of trouble at 299-7. For them to go and play as positively as they did was fantastic. It took the pressure off.
"I haven't quite cracked that fifty before. I've got out for 48 a few times, so it was nice to get it. If I could choose any game to do it in, it would be the Roses."
Yorkshire batsman Jack Leaning told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We didn't quite start as we'd like with the ball. Sometimes you don't hit your straps. They got away from us, but the lads have clawed it back.
"They bowled well at us early doors. But Leesy and Galey fought back really well, and we're in a good position now.
"With the blokes we've got in our dressing room, there's no reason why we can't win."
