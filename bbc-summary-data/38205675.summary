Cloth Cat Animation Studio will collaborate with Beijing-based firm Magic Mall, who will produce a series outside of China for the first time.
The UK Government claims animation tax relief announced in the 2014 Autumn Statement helped the investment.
The Secretary of State for Wales says the deal helps 'showcase Welsh talent.'
The animation series will be based on the popular Chinese character Luo Bao Bei and Cloth Cat think "her popularity ensures the new series will have wide appeal, blending Chinese heritage with a dash of British humour and charm."
The Luo Bao Bei cartoon is expected to launch in China in the spring of 2017.
"This collaboration between Cloth Cat and Magic Mall will see the company reach new international markets and support jobs in Wales," said Alun Cairns, Wales' Secretary of State.
"I'm delighted that our fantastic animation and creative industry sector will be exporting to new markets, and showcasing Welsh talents across the world."
Cloth Cat, whose work has been on Netflix, Disney and the Cartoon Network, is a Cardiff-based animation production company that helped create TV programmes such as CBeebies comedy 'Grandpa In My Pocket' and S4C's BAFTA Cymru award-winning show 'Ha Ha Hairies'.
"The partnership between Cloth Cat and Magic Mall is an exciting opportunity to build our trade relationship with China and export our fantastic animation sector worldwide," added Karen Bradley, the UK culture secretary.
"I'm thrilled that thanks to the UK Animation tax credits, Wales will see even more jobs and benefits as a result of this deal."
