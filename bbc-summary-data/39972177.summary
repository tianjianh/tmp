Swansea City boss Paul Clement says talks over the future of striker Borja Baston will be a priority this summer.

Borja, 24, became the Swans' record signing when he arrived from Atletico Madrid in August 2016.
However, the Spaniard has scored just one goal in 17 appearances and started only four Premier League games.
"He hasn't had the kind of year he or we would have liked for various reasons - but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a future here," said Clement.
"We have to all talk about that and decide what we're going to do for the best of him and the best of the club moving forward."
Borja arrived at the Liberty Stadium having scored 19 goals on loan at Eibar in La Liga last season.
Swansea's American owners said in April that the forward's future at the club would be decided at the end of the season.
"Certainly we had higher expectations for Borja Baston," said Jason Levien, who bought a controlling stake with Steve Kaplan last summer.
Swansea play their final Premier League game at home to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday (15:00 BST kick-off).
The Welsh club secured their top-flight status last weekend when they won at Sunderland, while fellow strugglers Hull were thrashed at Crystal Palace.
