Royal Mail bans deliveries after Chippenham postman bitten by fleas

Royal Mail has banned deliveries to a street in Wiltshire after the regular postman was bitten repeatedly by fleas.

Deliveries to 13 properties in Queen's Crescent, Chippenham, were suspended after the postman received "nasty and painful bites on his arms and legs".
Residents have now been told they will have to collect their post from Royal Mail's delivery office in Bumpers Way.
A Royal Mail spokeswoman apologised to customers affected but said the "health and safety of our people is paramount".
The properties affected by the ban include private homes and bungalows owned by GreenSquare Housing Association.
But Val Bodden, a Royal Mail spokeswoman, said it was in the "surrounding grass and pathway" that the postman used to access the properties where he experienced the flea infestation.
"We are keen to resume deliveries as soon as possible and have already contacted the local environmental health department," she said.
"They have visited the area and have been treating the affected site."
Terri Yewkins, from GreenSquare, said treatment had been carried out on a property and a second would be carried out if required.
"It is unusual for us to become involved in cases like this as our tenancy agreements state that tenants are responsible for dealing with pest infestations," he said.
"However, in this instance, we have been dealing with the issue and working to eradicate the problem."
