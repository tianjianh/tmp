The video of Bailey Matthews showing him abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line has been viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times.
Bailey, from Doncaster, was given the Richard Whiteley award at a ceremony in Leeds on Friday night.
Cricketer Joe Root received the Sporting Achievement award.
The Yorkshire Awards, now in their 27th year, "recognise the many and varied achievements of people and businesses in the county".
Bailey competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for four km and running for 1.3 km.
Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame.
Bailey's family said: "We are extremely honoured to receive the Richard Whiteley award for Bailey's efforts and it makes it all the more special with being proud northerners."
Sheffield-born Root became the leading batsman in the ICC world rankings after helping England beat Australia to regain the Ashes.
The 24-year-old has established himself as one of England's key performers and is closing on 3,000 test runs.
Root said the award was a "real honour" and he wanted to thank everyone who had supported him.
TV chef Rosemary Shrager, who has worked and lived in Yorkshire for many years, was presented with the Woman of the Year award, while Rotherham-born William Hague was named Man of the Year.
Mr Hague, former MP for Richmond, said: "Whatever I have done, and wherever I have been in the world, I have never stopped being a Yorkshireman, and never will."
Sir David Wootton picked up the Lifetime Achievement while Huddersfield-born poet Simon Armitage won the Arts and Entertainment award.
Mr Armitage's numerous accolades include a BAFTA winning film Feltham Sings for which he received an Ivor Novello award.
The Business Enterprise award was given to timber company Howarth Timber.
Starting in Leeds in 1840, it has expanded from a one-man business to an employer of more than 1,000 people.
North Yorkshire famer Gareth Barlow was presented with the Countryside award while junior football coach Stephen Shipley won the Community Hero award.
