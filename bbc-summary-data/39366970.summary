Major trauma centre: University Hospital of Wales' case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales already sees about 350 major trauma patients a year and is making the case that its specialist expertise at dealing with severe head injuries could be a clincher.

The pitch:
Dr Graham Shortland, medical director for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said their case was being made across a series of core specialisms, from "world class" paediatrics to neurosurgery but there was also an "enthusiasm" to get the major trauma centre.
"We are very much up for this," he said.
"We have a significant number of committed senior clinicians and managers to deliver a coordinated service in Cardiff."
Dr Shortland added: "Neurosurgery is key in terms of having a surgeons available very rapidly and having decisions made.
"This includes when not to do surgery but having expert opinion and support systems in terms of radiology and a high-care bed facility."
But he also said Cardiff would ensure routine orthopaedic operations continued at a high level and was aware of the risk to elective surgery if this was not managed as the trauma unit was brought on stream.
