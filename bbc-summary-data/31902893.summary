[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colwyn Bay stores get 'retail chaplains'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seaside town in north Wales is launching what is claimed to be the first chaplaincy service in Wales for store staff and shoppers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three volunteer chaplains have been appointed to serve the Bay View Centre in Colwyn Bay.
The chaplains are promising to offer a confidential "listening" service to retail staff, shoppers or visitors "whether people of faith or no faith".
Initial funding has been donated by the now closed St John's Uniting Church.
Its congregation was determined to leave a legacy to the town, when it finally closed its doors in May 2013.
The lead chaplain appointed by the joint churches group Cytun is the Welsh language folk singer and minister, Tecwyn Ifan.
