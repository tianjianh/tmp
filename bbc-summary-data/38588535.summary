[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales football manager Chris Coleman has been awarded an honorary degree from Swansea University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coleman, 46, who is from the city, was presented with the master of science (MSc) accolade at the University's Great Hall on Wednesday.
He was recently appointed an OBE after guiding Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 - its first major tournament in 58 years.
He said he was "delighted and honoured" with the award.
"It means so much that the recognition comes from my home city," he added. "I accept on behalf of all my family and friends who have helped me succeed in my chosen profession."
Swansea's honorary degree awards are made annually to recognise those who have made outstanding contributions to the university, region and Wales.
Coleman, whose side was knocked out by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal, was granted the freedom of Swansea in October.
