[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey lieutenant governor's car set to be replaced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The official car of the Queen's representative in the Bailiwick of Guernsey is set to be sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The black Daimler DS420, which was due to be replaced in three to five years, has been retired after 24 years of service.
The car has carried the Princess Royal, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during visits to Guernsey.
The car is to be replaced by a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit III model, in a claret livery.
Major Marco Ciotti, secretary to the lieutenant governor, said "an unexpected opportunity" had arisen to acquire a Rolls-Royce locally, in a similar colour to that of some of the cars in the Royal Household.
"The Rolls-Royce will bring better reliability and lower running costs, with a genuine British pedigree. We're looking forward to its first ceremonial outing," he said.
The lieutenant governor's ceremonial car is owned and run by the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.
