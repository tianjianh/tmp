Toilet access improvements noted at HMP Cornton Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inmates at Scotland's only all-women prison now have unrestricted access to toilet facilities, a new inspection report has noted.

A previous inspection of HMP Cornton Vale in Stirling found many prisoners had to wait more than 10 minutes to use a shared toilet overnight.
Inspectors visited the jail after about 110 prisoners were transferred to HMP Polmont, near Falkirk, last August.
The new report said prisoners' access to healthcare had also improved.
HM Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotland's (HMIPS) previous report, published in February 2016, said night-time sanitation arrangements at the jail were "wholly unacceptable in the 21st Century".
It noted that, in some cases, women were told to "pee in the sink" by staff.
HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, David Strang, said he was "encouraged" by the changes that had been implemented since the last inspection report.
He said: "There are still challenges for staff who are caring for some of the most vulnerable women in Scotland.
"When women return to the community after serving their sentence, it is vital that the right support is in place to encourage a successful reintegration into the community."
Cornton Vale is due to be replaced with a purpose-built 80-bed facility and five regional units holding 20 women each.
The new report is based on a three-day inspection carried out last October when the prison held 93 offenders, aged between 18 and 74.
It said that HMP Cornton Vale was a "significantly different establishment" since the previous inspection.
The report noted: "Inspectors found that good progress had been made in adjusting to the new arrangements.
"In particular all women now had unrestricted access to toilet facilities, which had not been the situation a year ago.
"The reduction in the number of women allowed more time for staff to work constructively with the women to make the most of their time in custody."
The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it welcomed the new report.
It noted: "SPS also welcomes HMIPS' comments that everyone in HMP & YOI Cornton Vale has worked diligently, with purpose and focus, to achieve the best possible outcome for the women who remain there.
"The report recognises that staff are able to take a more person-centred approach to working with, and caring for, those in custody."
