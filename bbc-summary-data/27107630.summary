An NHS trust in East Yorkshire has appointed a new chief executive after the former boss resigned ahead of a report into his management team.

Phil Morley, who had led the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust since 2010, quit his role on Thursday.
A union said it was aware a number of complaints had been made by senior managers at the trust.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected the trust in February and is due to publish its findings on 7 May.
John Saxby, who was the head of the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust in Lancashire, has now replaced Mr Morley as the interim chief executive.
Mr Morley courted controversy when images of him appeared in the local newspaper dressed as Superman.
In an article by the Hull Daily Mail, he was reported to have been ridiculed for dressing up in a staff video.
In a statement, Mr Morley said: "I can confirm that I will be moving on as chief executive.
"This was a personal decision that I took several weeks ago and I shared it with my senior team in order that we could put transitional arrangements in place.
"It was an extremely difficult decision for me to take and I will miss my colleagues and all the incredible staff at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust."
Ray Gray, a spokesman for Unison, said: "We are aware there have been a number of complaints from senior managers at the trust and know they have been reported to the National Trust Development Authority.
"We are not aware whether these claims have been investigated yet."
The trust runs Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital.
