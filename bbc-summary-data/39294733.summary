The funeral of a kayaker whose body was found after a major search operation has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Jackson, 35, was reported missing after leaving from Portsoy in Aberdeenshire in early February.
His kayak was found near Lybster in Caithness and his body was later found in the same area.
Mr Jackson's funeral was at Fettercairn Parish Church at 13:30. His family asked for donations to be made to a charity promoting sea safety.
The campaign set up by relatives - called PLanB - encourages the use of personal locator beacons (PLBs). It has already raised thousands of pounds.
His family have said they will be "forever grateful" to the "brave and wonderful people" who helped in the search.
Mr Jackson was originally from Uckfield in East Sussex, and later moved to Fettercairn.
