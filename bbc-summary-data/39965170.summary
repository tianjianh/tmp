[SN]TITLE[SN]
Family will be funded in Keane Wallis-Bennett school wall death inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of schoolgirl Keane Wallis Bennett will receive public funding to pay for legal representation at an inquiry into why she died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Legal Aid Board has agreed Keane's parents should be represented at a Fatal Accident Inquiry.
An inquiry has been called into the circumstances surrounding the death of the 12-year-old at Edinburgh's Liberton High School in April 2014.
She lost her life when a PE block modesty wall collapsed on top of her.
The fatal accident inquiry is due to take place in June 2017.
Lawyers acting for the family had previously told Sheriff Principal Stephen they thought the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) did not think there was a need for the family to have legal representation at proceedings.
However, SLAB said misleading information had caused the confusion.
A spokesman said: "The family has been granted legal aid for representation at the Fatal Accident Inquiry.
"As the sheriff principal pointed out today, the court was previously given misleading information by the family's legal representative about their situation with legal aid.
"We prioritise legal aid applications for FAIs but can only grant them when the required evidence is provided.
"We had explained what was required to the nominated solicitor prior to the previous hearing but the sheriff principal was instead given an incorrect explanation for why legal aid had not been granted at that time."
