OAP admits causing death of friends in fatal crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 85-year-old woman has admitted causing the deaths of her two friends after her careless driving resulted in a fatal crash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Garven was driving a group of friends on a day trip to Crieff in September 2012 when she pulled out onto the main road without giving way.
Two women aged 78 and 83 died following the crash near Tibbermore.
Sentence was deferred at Perth Sheriff Court, and Garven was banned from driving in the meantime.
Garven, of Perth, had picked up four friends and was driving to Crieff on the Windyedge to Tibbermore road when she pulled out at the junction of the Huntingtower to Madderty road.
She admitted failing to give way and driving into the path of another motorist, a 24-year-old woman who had three toddlers in her car. The court was told that Garven should have seen the other vehicle.
The passengers in the back of Garven's car were seriously injured, and Rhoda Lawton, 78, was pronounced dead at the scene. Richmal Southwood, 83, was placed in a coma at Ninewells Hospital but also died a few days later.
A third passenger suffered injuries including a broken pelvis and collapsed lung and needed to have part of her thumb amputated.
Crash investigators found that the other driver had been travelling within the speed limit at 48mph, but was unable to avoid Garven as she pulled out in front of her at 13mph.
However, the court also heard that the families of the deceased women had accepted the incident was a "tragic accident", with one arguing that Garven had "self-punished" and "suffered enough".
Garven admitted driving carelessly and causing the deaths of her two friends on 28 September, 2012.
Sentence was deferred for reports.
