The Scot, 23, clocked three minutes 55.22 seconds to break the national record for the second time in five weeks and set a 2016 world-best time.
Muir beat Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon into second place, with the Kenyan running 3:56.72.
Bahrain's Ruth Jebet, who also won gold in Rio, ran 8:52.78 seconds to set a 3,000m steeplechase world record.
The Kenya-born 19-year-old smashed the previous record of 8:58.81 set by Russian Gulnara Galkina at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
"I'm so happy," said Jebet. "I've tried to beat the world record several times, but tonight we decided to push ourselves to go looking for a good time."

Muir's performance came five weeks after she broke Dame Kelly Holmes' 12-year-old British record in the 1500m at the London Anniversary Games.
She then went on to finish seventh at the Olympic Games, but put any disappointment from Rio behind her with a stunning run in Paris, saying: "The race was amazing.
"I couldn't believe the time, especially since I didn't do one track session since Rio. I just went with the pacemaker and I knew I had to dig in and hold on during the third lap."
Britain's Lorraine Ugen was second in the women's long jump with 6.80m, Desiree Henry ran 22.46 seconds to finish second behind Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands in the 200m, and Cindy Ofili came third in the 100m hurdles in a time of 12.66secs.
British sprinters Joel Fearon (10.05secs) and Chijindu Ujah (10.15secs) finished fourth and eighth respectively in the men's 100m.
Diamond League highlights are on BBC Two at 13:00 BST on Sunday, 28 August.
