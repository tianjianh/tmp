Window Shopping, at Seventeen on the city's Belmont Street, features pictures from the 1950s through to the 1980s.
Among the images are some drawn from a collection which was donated to Aberdeen City and Shire Archives by the city's planning department.
The exhibition runs from Friday until 16 December.
Many of the featured images are from the Union Street, George Street and St Nicholas Street areas.
'Bit of nostalgia'
Included are George Street's Rubber Shop, from the 1970s, and Woolworths.
A spokesperson for Aberdeen City Archives said: "Whenever the archives team post images of old shop fronts on Facebook or our website they always get a great response.
"It was these positive reactions that gave us the idea of staging this exhibition.
"We then decided to hold the exhibition in the run up to Christmas when many are doing their Christmas shopping. Not only will this offer a break to weary shoppers, it also provides a bit of nostalgia - and who doesn't love a bit of nostalgia at Christmas."
You can hear more about the Window Shopping exhibition on BBC Radio Scotland's Out for the Weekend on Friday from 14:00.
