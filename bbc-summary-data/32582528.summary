With just two days until the polling stations open, all the Scottish party leaders are warning of the risks of backing their opponents.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said voters had "48 hours to get the Tories out".
Former Labour leader Gordon Brown, who was campaigning with Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, said the SNP stood for "divide and rule".
The Lib Dems said voters should stick with them and the Scottish Tories said a vote for them was a vote for the UK.
During a visit to a nursery in Livingston, West Lothian, Ms Sturgeon criticised Prime Minister David Cameron who had warned the public they risked "five long years" of a minority Labour government reliant on "bribes" to smaller parties like the SNP.
She hit back saying: "[There are] 48 hours to get the Tories out, to get an alternative to austerity and to make Scotland's voice heard.
"The fact of the matter is, if there's an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning, I want to see that anti-Tory majority come together to get the Tories out, but then make sure that it's replaced with something better.
Ms Sturgeon added: "The SNP will be a positive, constructive and progressive force in the House of Commons but will stand up very firmly for the things we believe really matter."
In Glasgow, Mr Brown urged voters to reject the SNP and join what he called Labour's fight to reach the "the mountaintop of social justice".
And he warned that the election was "not just about the future of the UK but about the very existence of the UK".
In an impassioned address, he said: "While the SNP will talk only about deals and pacts and coalitions and bargains and hung parliaments, we will talk day after day, hour after hour, in this late stage of the campaign about only one thing - to end poverty, to end unemployment, to end injustice.
"Within days and hours of getting into government, Jim Murphy could be providing money for our foodbanks and we could be ending foodbank poverty. Delivered under a Labour government, with Labour MPs - undeliverable under a Conservative government, even with 59 SNP MPs.
"And within weeks, we could be providing the resources that the health service needs: 500 doctors, 1,000 more nurses - deliverable under a Labour government with Labour MPs - undeliverable under a Conservative government with 59 SNP MPs."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he wanted his party to continue to have influence on government at Westminster.
He said: "Liberal Democrats have been at the heart of government over the last five years with 11 members of parliament in Scotland - many at the cabinet table giving a really powerful voice.
"Danny Alexander, right at the heart of the government, making it tick - delivering tax cuts, pension rise childcare expansion.
"I want that to continue, because Liberal Democrats can hold others back when they travel too fast."
While on a visit to Aviemore, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson discussed the possible deals that could be done between parties after polls close and votes are counted.
She said: "We have said from the very start that each and every MP elected across all parts of these islands has the same rights and voting as everybody else. But it is up to individual political parties who they do a deal with.
"The Scottish Conservatives will not do deals with any nationalist parties in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland who want to break up our United Kingdom.
"Each vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to keep the UK intact."
