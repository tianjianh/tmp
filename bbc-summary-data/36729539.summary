Thousands of campers have started arriving at this year's T in the Park music festival at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire.

Large queues were reported at the festival entrance ahead of the start of the three-day festival on Friday.
Revised campsite and campsite plans have been put in place at this year's T in the Park.
DF Concerts said improvements include colour-coded zones, better signage and 24-hour dedicated management teams.
Festival Director Geoff Ellis said: "The moment we open the T in the Park campsite gates and welcome the first campers is always my favourite part of the weekend.
"It's an amazing feeling to see the first festival fans arrive.
"There was a phenomenal atmosphere today, and a great sense of excitement amongst the campers."
This year's festival headliners include the Stone Roses, Calvin Harris and Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Organisers hope to avoid a repeat of the traffic chaos which marred last year's event as revellers tried to leave.
This year there will be separate roads for buses and cars and an improved bus station.
Last year angry music-lovers demanded refunds after being unable to leave the park.
DF Concerts apologised but said problems were compounded by people not following directions and going to the wrong exits.
