The game was organised after Thursday's scheduled match at Bready was called off without a ball being bowled.
The match in Belfast did get underway, with Cecelia Joyce and debutant Meg Kendal making a positive start before play was halted.
The pair shared an unbeaten opening stand of 68 runs in 18 overs.
Joyce hit five fours in her 37 not out, while Kendal found the boundary twice in her 26 not out.
Ireland's Lucy O'Reilly did not make it on to the field as she made her 50th international appearance aged just 16.
The teams will meet again on Saturday (10:30 BST) at the same venue in the final game of the series.
