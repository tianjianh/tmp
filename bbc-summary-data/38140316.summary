Mr Moise polled 55.67%, well ahead of his closest rival Jude Celestin's 19.52%, provisional electoral council chief Uder Antoine said.
Jean-Charles Moise secured 11.04% and Maryse Narcisse 8.99%, he added.
The election was held on 20 November, more than a year after the previous poll was annulled following allegations of widespread fraud.
That vote, in October 2015, was won by Mr Moise but opposition challenger Mr Celestin called foul and, after violent unrest, the ballot was annulled.
Violent clashes have also marked the wait for results since the latest election.
Interim leader Jocelerme Privert appealed for calm ahead of the announcement.
"Resorting to acts of violence can only spoil the fruits of the beautiful day we had on 20 November," he said.
Mr Privert was appointed by parliament in February after the incumbent President, Michel Martelly, stepped down at the end of his term. Mr Moise was President Martelly's chosen successor.
Haiti has been blighted by political instability and poverty for decades and is still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake in 2010.
Tens of thousands of people still live in temporary shelter while cholera has caused nearly 10,000 deaths.
