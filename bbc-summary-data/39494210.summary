Rangers captain Lee Wallace could miss this month's Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic as he is expected to be sidelined for up to four weeks.

The left-back has undergone surgery on the abdominal problem he picked up playing in Scotland's 1-1 friendly draw with Canada.
On Tuesday, Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said: "Lee Wallace should be finishing his surgery right now.
"So maybe, for the next three to four weeks, he will be out of the team."
Caixinha was undaunted by the series of injuries that have struck his side only two games into his tenure and hopes his team can cope with the loss of their captain and beat the newly-crowned Scottish champions at Hampden on 23 April.
"His problem is in the stomach area, but he can still celebrate with us at the end of the season, which means I hope to have him back for further on than the semi-final," said Caixinha.
Injuries in defence mean 20-year-old David Bates, who signed from Raith Rovers in January after a spell on loan, and Myles Beerman, an 18-year-old Malta international who arrived from Manchester City last summer, are poised to make their debuts against Kilmarnock on Wednesday.
As well as Wallace, Rangers' Portuguese coach is missing centre-backs Clint Hill and Rob Kiernan, who both have calf injuries, and Philippe Senderos, who has a knee problem, as well as full-back Lee Hodson, who has a fever.
At his pre-match conference, Caixinha surprised reporters by taking the unusual step of naming his starting line-up to face Kilmarnock 36 hours before kick-off.
Rangers will start with Wes Foderingham in goal and a back four of James Tavernier, Bates, Danny Wilson and Beerman.
Sitting in front will be Andy Halliday and Jason Holt, while striker Joe Garner will be supported by Barrie McKay, Emerson Hyndman and Martyn Waghorn.
"It is not important which players are out and which players are in," Caixinha insisted.
"It's important that the players we have starting the game and those on the bench are players we trust and believe in, that we have total confidence in.
"After all, we are Rangers and the players from our youth squad have to be ready when these chances come. So this is the moment.
"I have passed my trust and confidence to the guys.
"Now I've told them to go to Kilmarnock, enjoy it and do their work."
