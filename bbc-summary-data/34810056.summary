Northampton nightclub crush: Calls to leave 'significant factor', inquest finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Repeated announcements by DJs urging revellers to leave a nightclub contributed to the deaths of two students killed in a crush, a jury has found.

Nabila Nanfuka, 22, and Laurene-Danielle Jackson, 19, suffered fatal injuries while trying to leave the Lava and Ignite club in Northampton in 2011.
An inquest jury found 14 announcements in the space of 30 minutes had been the most significant cause of overcrowding.
A narrative verdict was delivered.
During the two-week hearing, the court heard a series of announcement reminding people not to miss their coaches had been made in the early hours of 19 October.
During the inquest, David Osahon, one of the DJs on the night, admitted to making up a series of announcements, including that the driver of a bus going to Luton was angry and waiting to leave, and that local hotel rooms were fully booked.
Around 900 students had travelled to the club from around the country and the DJs called for universities to leave one after the other, often with just a few minutes between them.
One played to the jury said: "Kingston, Roehampton, Kent, your coach is leaving in 20 minutes."
Minutes later they were told: "If you don't get on your coach you'll be left behind."
The jury concluded the second most significant factor was the lack of overall management of the cloakroom.
The foreman added: "We believe the crowd's attitude and behaviour was a significant factor.
"We believe another factor that contributed was the lack of monitoring and overlooking of the evening's events."
The Crown Prosecution Service previously determined there would be no criminal charges brought against anyone following the incident.
However, a spokesman for Northampton Borough Council said the authority will now look at the evidence and "decide whether any enforcement action is appropriate".
He added: "We are keen that any lessons that can be drawn from the deaths should be learned, so that young people visiting pubs and clubs are safer as a result."
But Northampton South MP David Mackintosh, who was leader of the borough council at the time of the incident, said it was "hard to see where the justice is in this outcome".
He said: "I feel very strongly that there must be a clearer understanding of accountability from this tragedy."
A statement on behalf of Ms Jackson's family said they hoped lessons would be learned following their daughter's death.
It said the family believed the jury's decision "rightly identifies that the safe exit of the clubbers was not adequately considered and that the DJ announcements were the most significant factor".
It added: "Danni was a beautiful, bright, outgoing young woman."
Ms Nanfuka, of Neasden, north London, was studying a leisure and tourism degree at the University of Northampton. She died at Northampton General Hospital on 19 October.
Ms Jackson, of Wembley, was studying psychology at Kingston University and died at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital on 6 November.
