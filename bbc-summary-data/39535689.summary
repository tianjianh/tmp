[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Candystripes keeper Gerard Doherty denied Sean Maguire before Garry Buckley's clever flicked finish put the Leesiders in front on 34 minutes.
Karl Sheppard slotted between Doherty's legs to double the lead before Maguire rifled home after 64 minutes to give Cork an eighth win from eight games.
Aaron McEneff came closest for Derry with a late strike against the bar.
It's a second straight defeat for Derry since the tragic death of their captain Ryan McBride last month.
Maguire burst clear on 10 minutes but his low shot was blocked by the onrushing Doherty.
Cork keeper Mark McNulty saved efforts from Nathan Boyle and McEneff but the incisive attacking football came at the other end.
Doherty tipped over a curling Kevin O'Connor free-kick before Buckley netted from a Stephen Dooley cut-back.
Sheppard struck 10 minutes into the second half, racing through and sliding in from 14 yards to make it 2-0.
The dominant Leesiders added a third when Derry failed to clear and the ball broke kindly for Maguire, who sent a fizzing shot past Doherty.
McEneff was denied by the woodwork with two minutes left in what was a rare highlight for the visitors.
