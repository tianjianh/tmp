Welshman Cordina, 24, showed good movement in the contest, but failed to land combination shots on his opponent.
The last-16 contest was level after the first round but Tojibaev, 26, was a comfortable winner in the next two.
"I can't complain, the better man won on the day. I just couldn't get going in the last round," said Cordina.
"He's the hardest hitter I've been in the ring with, but I've got a lot to take from this experience."
He follows fellow Britons Lawrence Okolie, Anthony Fowler and Galal Yafai in being knocked out of the Games.
European champion Cordina faced an experienced opponent in Tojibaev, who is competing at his second Olympics having appeared in Beijing eight years ago.
Despite being docked a point in the second round for punching below the waist, Tojibaev was given scores of 29-27 by the Colombian and Chinese judges to advance to the quarter-finals.
Cordina used classy footwork and counterpunching to beat bustling Filipino Charly Suarez in the first round.
