The MEP and North Wales AM has been at the centre of a power struggle with Neil Hamilton, who won a vote to lead the UKIP group in the Welsh Assembly.
New UKIP leader Diane James, meeting the party's AMs in Cardiff on Monday, said she understood Neil Hamilton was leader in Wales "at the moment".
Mr Gill - named UKIP Wales leader by Nigel Farage in 2014 - told ITV Wales the post expired when Mr Farage quit.
"Nigel made me the leader of UKIP in Wales, so on the sixteenth of this month was when that expired," he told the channel's Sharp End programme.
Asked if he had spoken to Ms James about regaining the title of UKIP Wales leader, Mr Gill said: "We've had many conversations ... you're going to just have to wait and see for her announcements."
UKIP won seven seats at the assembly election in May, entering the Senedd for the first time.
But divisions surfaced when Mr Hamilton won a vote to lead the UKIP group in preference to Mr Gill.
In July, Mr Gill quit the group to sit as an independent AM, claiming "infighting" had become a "distraction" from its work.
On Monday, he told ITV Wales he had not been invited to return to the group but added: "You never say never in politics."
Following her election as UKIP leader earlier in September, Ms James said Mr Gill had her "100% support" but later said UKIP did not have "two kings" in Wales.
Ms James, visiting Cardiff on Monday in a bid to heal the rift, told BBC Wales she would "love to see" Mr Gill rejoin the group.
Asked who was UKIP's Welsh leader during a series of chaotic impromptu interviews in the Senedd, Ms James told ITV Wales: "I understand it's Neil Hamilton at the moment."
She walked away without answering when asked the same question by BBC Wales.
