Borders General Hospital report seeks operating theatre improvements

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Healthcare Environment Inspectorate is seeking improvements in several areas after an inspection of operating theatres at Borders General Hospital.

It follows an unannounced visit to the site near Melrose in May this year.
Inspectors raised concerns about hand hygiene, the handling of contaminated mop heads and the proper management of blood spillages.
NHS Borders announced last week that an action plan had been put in place to improve cleanliness and hygiene.
The HEI carried out the inspection at the Borders hospital on 13 and 14 May.
As a result it came up with a list of seven requirements for improvement in order to meet NHS standards.
Among the actions they have called for are:
Speaking of the report, Jacqui Macrae, Head of Quality of Care, said: "Overall, our inspectors found that NHS Borders demonstrated varying compliance with the standards to protect patients, staff and visitors from the risk of acquiring an infection.
"Further improvement is required in a number of areas, particularly in relation to staff following standard infection control precautions.
"For example, staff should ensure that all equipment used for cleaning the theatre environment is cleaned following each use and is stored appropriately."
The full details of the inspection can be found on the HEI website.
NHS Borders said last week that an action plan to improve cleanliness and hygiene techniques had been put in place ahead of the publishing of the report.
Director of Nursing and Midwifery at NHS Borders, Evelyn Rodger, said: "Feedback from the inspectors indicated a number of instances where policies and procedures were not being correctly followed, in particular in relation to cleaning methods.
"In these instances our standards fell below those expected by our patients and staff.
"I would like to stress that staff from theatres and beyond took immediate action to address the issues that were pointed out to us during the inspection, which is acknowledged within the report."
Medical Director Dr Sheena MacDonald said the main risk of poor standards of cleanliness would be an infection in a patient's wound resulting from surgery.
"We investigate every single instance of infection and identify and take action in order to continuously improve," she stressed.
Dr David Love, consultant in anaesthesia and critical care, said the report would help "continuous quality improvement" in operating theatres.
"Whilst being disappointed with the findings, changes were immediately made, both to practice and training, and our continued vigilance and monitoring will provide assurance of sustained improvement," he said.
"It is also appropriate to acknowledge that, despite these findings, our measured outcomes and quality indicators remain good.
"By using our learning from this report we will ensure that the people of the Borders continue to receive the high standard of safe surgical care they expect and deserve."
