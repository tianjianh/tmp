A mobile police station has been set up outside a nightclub as the search continues for a clubber who went missing two weeks ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deakon Wilkins vanished after leaving Motion nightclub in Bristol in the early hours of 14 January.
Police divers have checked canals and rivers for the 24-year-old from Weston-super-Mare and his family are offering a reward.
Officers will speak to people about Mr Wilkins as they arrive at the club.
Det Insp Steve Cartlidge from Avon and Somerset Police said the force was doing everything it could to find him.
"Officers will be outside the club to see whether anyone remembers seeing him leave a fortnight ago," he said.
"And we're still keen on speaking to anyone who was in the area and saw Deakon and who hasn't already made contact with us."
Mr Wilkins is described as 5ft 10in (1.78m) tall, medium build with ginger hair and a tattoo between his neck and chest that says "Rush".
When last seen he was wearing a red fitted jumper, black blazer, dark jeans and red trainers.
His parents will be distributing leaflets about him in Bristol city centre again later.
