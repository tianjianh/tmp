Both clubs were fined by Uefa following their Europa League last-16 tie last season, as supporters mocked tragedies suffered by each side.
"I will be really sad if in such a big football match that was a negative point," said Mourinho.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said the fixture "will never be a normal game".
The Reds defeated their rivals 3-1 on aggregate in the first meeting between the clubs in European competition, but the tie was marred by a number of unsavoury scenes.
Liverpool were sanctioned for setting off fireworks, a late kick-off and had to pay for damage caused by fans at Old Trafford, while United were charged for stairways blocked at their stadium.
Rival fans were also seen fighting in the stands, seats were thrown and flares were lit in Manchester.
Klopp added: "We should use this opportunity on the pitch to make sure all the nice stories are written about what happens on it, and not around.
"Big respect is what this sport stands for and you face your biggest opponents and play football against them. That is the battle we have, that is where we should show who is the best and create a special atmosphere."
Last season's games were marred by chanting about Munich and Hillsborough.
In 1958, eight United players were among 23 people who died after their plane caught fire and crashed in Munich.
Ninety six Liverpool fans died as a result of a crush during an FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989.
"In football you have some football tragedies," said Mourinho. "You lose a big match or make a mistake. You can make fun of it.
"Human tragedy is something much more serious. It is the last thing someone should use in a football pitch. Really big tragedies are serious."
Mourinho's side go into Monday's game - which kicks off at 20:00 BST - sixth in the Premier League with 13 points, two places and three points adrift of Liverpool.
