Hosni Mubarak resigns: World reaction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eighteen days of protests have brought an end to three decades of rule by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The dramatic events have been watched by Egypt's neighbours and the wider world.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here is the reaction of some governments around the world.
The people of Egypt have spoken, the voices have been heard and Egypt will never be the same.
By stepping down, President Mubarak responded to the Egyptian people's hunger for change. But this is not the end of the Egypt's transition. It is a beginning.
The military has served patriotically and responsibly as a caretaker to the state and will now have to ensure a transition that is credible in the eyes of the Egyptian people.
That means protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free.
The United States will continue to be a friend and partner to Egypt. We stand ready to provide whatever assistance is necessary and asked for to pursue a credible transition to democracy. Egyptians have inspired us.
They have done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice best gained through violence. For in Egypt, it was the moral force of non-violence, not terrorism, not mindless killing, but non-violence, moral force, that bent the arc of history toward justice once more.
The EU respects President Mubarak's decision today. By standing down, he has listened to the voices of the Egyptian people and has opened the way to faster and deeper reforms.
It is important now that the dialogue is accelerated leading to a broad-based government which will respect the aspirations of, and deliver stability for, the Egyptian people. The future of Egypt rightly remains in the hands of the Egyptian people. The EU stands ready to help in any way it can.
This is a historic moment for Egypt, Egyptians, and even the Arab world - an unprecedented step, an unprecedented wide revolution and national consensus that has created an exceptional situation in Egypt.
Now is the moment to build a national consensus to move towards the future, and I believe the future - our future, Egyptian future - should be built on both democracy and reform. And I think this will be the case. I'm very optimistic about that future after the events of the last couple of weeks, and in particular today.
This is a popular revolution, a popular uprising, that has influenced events. It's not a coup. The President stepped down, and handed over power to the Higher Military Council, just to arrange things - I don't know the details of this - but no, it is not a coup.
As an Egyptian citizen, I am proud to serve my country with all the others at this stage, to build a consensus of opinion.
Egypt now has a really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the country together. As a friend of Egypt, and the Egyptian people, we stand ready to help in any way we can.
We believe it must be a government that starts to put in place the building blocks of a truly open, free and democratic society.
France ardently hopes the new Egyptian authorities will take steps that lead to establishment of democratic institutions through free and transparent elections.
Despite all the (West's) complicated and satanic designs... a new Middle East is emerging without the Zionist regime and US interference, a place where the arrogant powers will have no place.
It's your right to be free. It's your right to exercise your will and sovereignty... and choose the type of government and the rulers.
It's too early to foresee how [the resignation] will affect things. We hope that the change to democracy in Egypt will happen without violence and that the peace accord will remain.
The resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is the beginning of the victory of the Egyptian revolution. Such a victory was the result of the sacrifices and the steadfastness of the Egyptian people.
We call upon the new Egyptian leadership to take an immediate decision to lift the blockade of Gaza and open Rafah [border] crossing permanently to allow people's free movement and in order for the reconstruction process of Gaza to begin.
Social stability should be of overriding importance. It is hoped that the Egyptian military, government and its people will  make every effort to maintain social stability and restore normal order.
We hope the latest developments will help restore stability and normal functioning of all power structures. We hope that not only the government but also the opposition will show willingness to stabilise the situation.
Today is a day of great joy. We are all witness to an historic change. I share the joy of the people of Egypt, with the millions of people on the streets of Egypt.
Congratulations to the Egyptian people. And we hope that a system meeting the expectations of the Egyptian people will emerge.
This is a positive, important step towards the Egyptian people's aspirations of achieving democracy and reform and a life of dignity.
The UAE, which has closely monitored developments in Egypt, confirms its confidence in the ability of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in running the country's affairs in these delicate circumstances in such a way that would realise aspirations and hopes of the Egyptian people.
The resignation of President Hosni Mubarak is a step in the right direction because it came as a response to Egyptians' desire and will for change, and we have confirmed trust that our sister Egypt and its great people, with their experience, history and efficiency, will select leadership that will fulfil their ambitions and keep Egypt's security, stability and great position in the world.
I welcome President Mubarak's decision. I have consistently called for a speedy, orderly and peaceful transition to democracy, respecting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Egypt.
In the long run, no society can neglect the will of the people. Democracy means much more than majority rule - it also means respect for individual freedom, for minorities, human rights and the rule of law.
We take note of the evolution that has happened in Egypt. This is an  important development for the Egyptian people and its legitimate democratic  aspirations.
Together with many other concerned nations, Australia calls for  fundamental reform that will ensure the opportunity and freedoms that ordinary  Egyptians have been calling for.
Australia calls for constitutional reform and a clear timetable towards  free and fair elections and a representative civilian government that will  govern for all Egyptians.
We welcome the decision of President Mubarak to step down in deference to the wishes of the people of Egypt.
We also welcome the commitment of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to ensure a peaceful transition of power in a timebound manner to establish and open and democratic framework of governance.
