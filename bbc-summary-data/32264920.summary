Bridgnorth park-and-ride trial launches on Saturdays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trial park-and-ride service has been launched in a bid to ease parking problems in a Shropshire town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bridgnorth Chamber of Commerce said traffic build-up on Saturdays had affected businesses in the area.
It said it would monitor the effect of the new Saturday service - which operates between 09:30 and 16:00 BST - over the summer trial period.
People parking at the Nock Deighton Auction site can ride for free until 6 June, when a Â£2 charge is introduced.
