The emergency services and staff from the Department of Infrastructure worked to clear the roads of fallen trees and other debris on Friday.
Flights and ferry crossings were cancelled to and from the Isle of Man due to windy conditions.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company cancelled all sea crossings.
Most of the roads shut by the bad weather had reopened by Friday morning but the promenade at Port Erin remained closed due to collapsed fencing protecting an area of missing wall.
Michael Street in Peel was also closed due to falling slates from properties.
The Emergency Services Joint Control Room managed about 33,000 calls from 1500 GMT on Thursday to 0800 GMT on Friday.
The police dealt with 80 incidents in the same period and 102 incidents in the 24-hour period.
Police praised islanders who took "the sensible option of cancelling events and, where possible, keeping indoors".
