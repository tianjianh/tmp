[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham's search for a first win this season continued as Steven Fletcher's second-half goal gave Sheffield Wednesday victory at Craven Cottage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wednesday had the first chance to take the lead when Gary Hooper headed over from David Jones' cross.
Fulham fought back and almost led themselves when Stefan Johansen smashed a half-volley just over the bar.
But Fletcher broke the deadlock just after the hour mark with a left-footed volley from Adam Reach's delivery.
The defeat was Fulham's first in the league this season and means they are still without a win from their opening four games, after draws against Norwich, Reading and Leeds.
It was Sheffield Wednesday's first Championship victory of the season.
Owls forward Fernando Forestieri was left on the bench for the trip to the capital after a reported training ground bust-up, but came on for Hooper with just under 10 minutes left.
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:
"Our lack of goals is a worry. It was the same story that we have had before.
"We were the better team but we couldn't put it in the net. We couldn't get the quality opportunities.
"We are missing a little bit of speed with the ball. That would make a difference and it's something we must work on."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"I was very calm even when we were not winning games. There's expectations and pressure here but I believe we will achieve our results.
"We had played well before this in our other games and hadn't won, so didn't need to change anything. I have always slept well. There was no panic.
"It was good to get a win against one of the strongest teams in the league and away from home in their stadium."
