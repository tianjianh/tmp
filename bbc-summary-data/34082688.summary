[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Usain Bolt was knocked down by a cameraman in Beijing on Thursday night, shortly after winning a race.

Bolt was celebrating his win in the 200m sprint at the World Athletics Championships when the cameraman lost control of his motorised scooter as it rolled over a post and crashed into the runner's legs.
The Jamaican did a backward roll and got back on his feet - he briefly rubbed his ankle before continuing to celebrate with fans.
He later told reporters: "Accidents happen. I have a few cuts but it is nothing that I have never done to myself in training. I will be all right."

Cherish the supreme showman in Bolt
The two men came face to face again on Friday when the cameraman presented Bolt with a gift, said to be a friendship bracelet, to apologise for the accident.
