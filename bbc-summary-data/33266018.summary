Anita Kapoor, 34, was found on 23 June on the A413 at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. She was last seen alive in London, police said.
A 34-year-old man from Southall, west London, was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of murder.
A 50-year-old man initially detained on suspicion of murder has been released without charge.
An address in Southall was being examined as part of the investigation, Thames Valley Police said.
Ms Kapoor, from Hayes, west London, died from "asphyxiation, due to compression of the neck", a post-mortem examination found.
Thames Valley Police said it wanted to establish Ms Kapoor's whereabouts between 03:00 BST on Tuesday, when she was last seen in Oswald Road, Southall, and 08:36 BST, the time her body was found.
A force spokeswoman said she was believed to have been wearing a black, thigh length coat with zips at the sides, black tracksuit bottoms with white writing down the sides, and white Reebok trainers.
Police would also like anyone who was driving past the lay-by in the early hours of Tuesday and saw anything suspicious to contact them.
