Zak Ansah: Newport County sign Charlton Athletic striker on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton Athletic striker Zak Ansah has joined League Two side Newport County on a month's loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ansah started his career at Arsenal before joining Charlton in 2014, but is yet to make a senior appearance for the Addicks.
The 21-year-old ended the 2014-15 season on loan at Plymouth Argyle, scoring once in six league appearances.
He is County's second loan signing of the week with midfielder Josh Laurent arriving from Brentford.
A former England youth international, Ansah was in Ghana's training squad for the 2013 Under-20 World Cup.
Ansah, an unused substitute for Arsenal in a Champions League tie in 2012 , is the son of former Southend United midfielder Andy Ansah.
