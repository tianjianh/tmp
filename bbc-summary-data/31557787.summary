The Met Office said snow could settle to lower levels in northwest Scotland by mid-morning on Saturday.
Elsewhere, snow is most likely on higher roads.
Further wintry showers and winds gusting to 50mph could lead to blizzard conditions on Sunday on high level routes.
A yellow warning has also been issued for Monday, covering Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and the Midlands.
This anticipates more widespread snow, with accumulations of up to 3in (8cm) even at lower levels.
