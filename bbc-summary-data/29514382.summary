The Gossip Girl star posted a picture of her baby bump on her lifestyle website Preserve.
Since the announcement, Blake Lively has been trending on Twitter, with many users talking about the baby's chances of being, well, gorgeous.
So far no-one's tweeted about the possibility of the baby being a top scientist but there's still time.
"It's time to prepare yourself for the most genetically blessed baby ever," the Gossip Girl website claimed.
"With family on our mind, we looked to the origin of it all - to the women in our lives who are right there, at that special moment; at the creation of family," said the Preserve website, as part of the announcement.
"Today we celebrate them. With food to fill their tummies (as if that needs more filling), presents to soothe their tired (and swollen) soles, toys to warm their baby's souls, projects to provoke them, and decorations to inspire creativity and merriment in all.
"Congratulations to all the expecting mothers out there."
Lively and Reynolds, who were married in 2012, met on the set of Green Lantern.
The 27-year-old is known for her love of homemaking.
In addition to her lifestyle website, she has also appeared on numerous television shows and in magazines, talking about cooking, baking and her everyday life at home.
Previously, she has told Vogue that Reynolds will "be a great father and leader and patriarch - he's so meant to be all of those things".
Reynolds, 37, has also previously said they would like to have a "big family".
