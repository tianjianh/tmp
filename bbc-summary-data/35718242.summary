The flat-bottomed D-class dinghy will be moored on the River Mourne. It has been supplied by the local section of the community rescue service.
The dinghy is already being used in the search of local man Sean Diver who went missing over a month ago.
Mr Diver, 39, was last seen in the Townsend Street area on 27 January.
Mr Diver's brother, Mark, told BBC Radio Foyle that the addition of the boat means a lot to his family.
"It's a godsend because that boat is now in the water nearly every day carrying out searches.
"Unfortunately it's taken the tragedy of my brother going missing to get this in the area but we're still very thankful," he said.
"It is a lot of water to cover, people have been here everyday, they are 100% behind us and we want to thank them as well for their continued support to our family."
Sean McCarry from the community rescue service said they would need the support of the local area to keep the service going.
"We have had a ground rescue team based here for over two years and we now feel it's the time, in light of Sean Diver going missing, to have a permanent boat here.
"We'll be relying on the local community for volunteers and to help us to fund the boat."
