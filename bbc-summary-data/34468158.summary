[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seven-month-old baby boy who lost 17% of his body weight in just a few days, died from neglect, a court was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy named in court only as "Baby Imran" was found by his mother lifeless in their Luton home on 17 January 2014.
The baby's mother, Jessica Price, 23, and grandmother Angela Price, 62, both of Morris Close, deny causing or allowing the death of Baby Imran.
Angela Price denies a charge of causing or allowing a child to suffer severe physical harm, Luton Crown Court heard.
The mother and daughter also denied cruelty to a person by failing to provide the baby with adequate food and drink.
They also pleaded not guilty to a second charge of cruelty to a child by failing to obtain medical aid for the infant when he failed to thrive.
At the start of the trial the court was told Jessica Price had pleaded guilty to cruelty to a person by failing to seek medical assistance for the severe nappy rash her son was suffering from in the weeks leading up to his death.
Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC said Baby Imran had been born 10 weeks prematurely in June of 2013 and weighed 1.5kg or a little over 3lb.
Mr Donnellan said the child's mother ignored advice to regularly take her son to a local clinic so he could be weighed.
The jury then heard how, at 17:30 GMT on 17 January 2014, the mother made a 999 call after finding her son lifeless and cold on a bed.
Paramedics arrived and the baby was pronounced dead at 17:48 GMT.
Mr Donnellan said experts concluded Baby Imran had died due to dehydration and not getting enough food and liquid.
The trial continues.
