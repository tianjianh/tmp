It's after the guitarist lost his passport boarding a plane to the UK from New York.
The other members Ashton Irwin, Luke Hemmings and Calum Hood flew without him and played a gig at the O2 Arena in London on Sunday night.
The band told BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw Michael is "relaxing in America" while he sorts out a passport.
Luke says it's incredible that he managed to lose it in the first place: "Because our tour manager holds our passports and will give it to us before the flight. Then we'll have it for maybe an hour and then he'll take it back off us. In that time he's lost it."
Although he adds that Michael has previous: "I've seen Michael lose a ticket before he gets on the plane, I mean he's given it in the line and he's lost it."
The band lined up for photos after performing at The Jingle Bell Ball on Sunday with drummer Ashton saying it was weird playing a big gig as a three-piece.
"I hated him not being there it was the worst. It's just so wrong when you're in a band and a guy's not there.
"It's almost like you're betraying him. We were on stage as a three piece and it just wasn't awesome at all."
It's not known when the band, who are from Sydney, will have their red-headed guitarist back.
They're currently applying to the embassy in the US for a new emergency passport.
"He's just relaxing having a bit of Michael time," said Aston.
Calum joked with Nick Grimshaw that the group is planning dates without Michael as they don't know where he is.
"We normally have a group text but he's not in it. We're making plans so you don't want to have him it (laughs). Where is he? New York?"
On Twitter Michael said: "Really, really sorry for anyone who I've let down for not being able to come. You get a free pass to call me stupid."
The boys are due to perform another gig in Liverpool on Wednesday night but it looks like Michael will miss that too.
Earlier this year the Australian boy band announced a new UK tour.
The Rock Out With Your Socks Out tour will take place in May and June 2015.
