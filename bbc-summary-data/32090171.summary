The Old Town Hall in central Oldham will eventually house a seven-screen cinema and six restaurants.
It was built in 1841 but stopped being used as a public building in the 1990s.
The development, due to open next spring, is at the centre of the council's regeneration plans for the town centre and will see the creation of 74 full-time and 159 part-time jobs.
Contractors, who have been working on the site since October 2013, have found lost items like spectacles, coins, shoes, council papers - and even an old photograph of Marilyn Monroe (pictured).
Oldham Council Leader Jim McMahon said contractors were "undertaking painstaking work" to restore the building.
Barry Roberts, area director at Morgan Sindall, said: "This is a fascinating project to be involved with from a technical perspective.
"It requires a blend of care, consideration and energy to deliver the restoration."
The Old Town Hall will have five restaurants on the ground floor and one on the first.
