Christopher Oates, who runs camel treks at Rosuick Farm on the Lizard Peninsula, said they were very sociable animals and would make great pets.
He said a successful breeding season meant the farm had more camels than required.
The camels, which range in age and trekking experience, are expected to sell for between Â£3,000 and Â£8,000.
