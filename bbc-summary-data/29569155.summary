Sleaford Bass Maltings: Compulsory purchase order served on link road land

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A compulsory purchase order has been served as part of plans to redevelop one of the largest Grade II-listed buildings in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a long-running development row between two Lincolnshire councils.
In June, North Kesteven District Council (NKDC) voted to compulsorily purchase part of a Sleaford park, owned by the town council.
It said it was key to plans for a link road and redevelopment of the derelict 13-acre Bass Maltings complex.
A six-week consultation period will run from 15 October to 27 November.
The Victorian Bass Maltings in Sleaford was built by Bass Brewery and has been derelict for more than 50 years. It was damaged by a fire in July.
English Heritage has classified it as one of the the largest at-risk buildings in the country.
The development would see a new road built between Boston Road and Mareham Lane, allowing the regeneration of the Maltings, which would be turned into shops, office space and houses.
A scheme to convert it had been due to start in 2011 but was blocked when the town council said it would not sell the recreation ground, citing a loss of public amenities.
Opponents claim the new road will also lead to more congestion in the town.
Ian Fytche, NKDC's chief executive, said: "It's clear there are people who are very much in support of the regeneration and those who are very much opposed to it.
"We've done everything we can to consult on proposals going back about 10 years, and there is an invitation to the town council to keep talking to us."
The authority said the project, which also includes plans for a new supermarket, would create about 500 jobs and bring millions in investment.
