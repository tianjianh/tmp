But former Slavia Sofia centre-back Plamen Krachuno continues his stint training with the Perth club.
Saints boss Tommy Wright said: "Julien has had a couple of offers, I believe one in America and another offer.
"I fully understand why he has gone. Maybe warmer climates are more attractive."
Wright said that the France-born Martinique international, who left Bordeaux in the summer, had impressed while at McDiarmid Park, playing in a reserve game against Hearts.
"He did extremely well here, a really good professional," said the Saints boss, who is looking to add to his defensive options after captain Dave Mackay was ruled out for the rest of the season.
Faubert, who once had a loan spell with Real Madrid, watched St Johnstone beat Motherwell 2-1 in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday at McDiarmid Park.
However, he has become the second player to cut short a trial spell with St Johnstone within a week.
Nigerian defender Daniel Adejo, who left Greek Superleague club Kalloni in January, reportedly had an offer from a club in Serie B, where he previously performed for Reggina.
"Plamen Krachuno is here for another couple of days, which he was originally booked in for," added Wright of the 27-year-old who played the first half of the season in Bulgaria's top flight.
