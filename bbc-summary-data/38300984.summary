Police in Italy have launched an investigation into the crash which seriously injured the wife of an ex-Wales rugby player.

Kate Weaver-Gibbs, 32, suffered head and spinal fractures when she was hit by a scooter in Verona on 2 December.
Ms Weaver-Gibbs is married to former dual code international Scott Gibbs, 45, who was not injured.
The beauty and travel writer remains in hospital and Italian police said a recent operation went well.
The couple were crossing the road when Ms Weaver-Gibbs was struck. It is believed the scooter was overtaking a car at the time.
No arrests have been made.
Verona's chief of the municipal police - Luigi Altamura - told BBC Wales that investigators have used CCTV footage, a camera on a bus and footage from a mobile phone to reconstruct the crash.
A report will now be compiled by police for a magistrate to consider.
Mr Gibbs retired from rugby in 2004, having played 53 Tests for Wales and going on three tours with the British and Irish Lions.
He also played rugby league for Wales and St Helens, winning the Challenge Cup.
He made his Wales union debut in 1991, with probably his most famous moment the last-minute try against England in 1999 which helped his country to a 32-31 win.
The couple married in 2014 in Cape Town.
