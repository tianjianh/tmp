[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 0-1 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby ended Cambridge's four-game unbeaten run in League Two with a first-half winner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mariners had been the better side by the time Dominic Vose beat Bradley Halliday on the left and swung in a cross which was headed home by James Berrett from close range.
Omar Bogle nearly doubled the lead six minutes before the interval, striking a free-kick from 25 yards which crashed off the angle of post and crossbar.
Cambridge almost equalised against the run of play with the last action of the first half as Harrison Dunk headed Piero Mingoia's cross onto the post, with James Dunne somehow missing when trying to turn the rebound home.
Dunk saw an effort blocked after half-time and Adam McGurk diverted another chance over the bar from close range.
Grimsby should have sealed the game 14 minutes from the end, but Mark Roberts recovered to deny Bogle after he had seized on Leon Legge's poor backpass and rounded David Gregory.
