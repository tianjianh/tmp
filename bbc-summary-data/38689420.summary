The 25-year-old, who is 6ft 9ins tall, came through Sparta Prague's academy and spent the last three years on loan at various Czech clubs.
"It has always been a dream of mine to play in England," Holy, who is new manager Ady Pennock's first signing, said.
"I cannot wait to get the chance to help the team move up the table."
The Gills are 17th in League One having lost their past three matches.
