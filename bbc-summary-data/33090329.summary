The new recruits will work on the production of the Q30 model - the first large scale manufacturing of a new car brand in the UK for 23 years.
This will be followed by a second smaller Infiniti model, the QX30.
The company, which employs nearly 6,800 staff, said it was the "beginning of a new era". The cars will be targeted at the Chinese and North American markets.
