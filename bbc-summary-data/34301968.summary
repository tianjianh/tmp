The incident happened at about midnight in the Eastern Cemetery off Easter Road.
The woman went to catch a bus at the north end of Easter Road at about 23:30 on Friday.
She was attacked after she decided to walk towards the city centre when she was told there was no bus scheduled to arrive.
Police said she had a brief conversation with an older man who was waiting at the stop before starting to walk.
The suspect, who was with another male, engaged her in conversation as she walked up Easter Road in the direction of the city centre.
The other man, who wore a distinctive pink-coloured top, quickly left the suspect alone with the woman.
They walked as far as Drum Terrace before entering the graveyard where the man pushed her to the ground and attacked her.
The suspect is described as white, in his early 20s, about 5ft 6ins tall with a thin build. He spoke with a local accent and had been wearing a grey jumper with blue jeans.
Det Insp Morag Bruce said: "The victim has, understandably, been left very badly shaken by this ordeal and I want make clear that we will do everything in our power to find this man as quickly as possible.
"There is a strong possibility that he had been drinking in the local area and I would ask anyone who remembers him to come forward immediately.
"I am also very keen to hear from the man in the pink top who had been with the suspect and also the older gentleman who was waiting at the bus stop and who spoke to the woman."
Det Insp Bruce said Easter Road would have been very busy at the time and asked witnesses to contact her.
