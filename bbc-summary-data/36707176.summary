The 20-year-old McMullan will spend a season on loan at East End Park.
He also spent last season in the Scottish Championship, first with St Mirren then Greenock Morton.
The 17-year-old Crossan had only made two first-team appearances for the Pars but was out of contract and rejected the offer of a new deal.
He has signed a three-year contract with the Scottish champions.
Dunfermline chairman Ross McArthur, whose side won League One last season, said: "I would like to wish PJ well in his future career at Celtic, which is naturally a fantastic opportunity for him.
"I would also like to thank Celtic for their assistance in this matter to ensure the matter could be resolved amicably.
"However, the only disappointing aspect is the wholly inaccurate reporting in recent days relating to the agreed compensation figure, which will remain confidential."
It will be the fourth loan spell for Scotland Under-19 international McMullan, who is a product of the Celtic youth system.
He scored three goals in 19 games for Stenhousemuir in League One at the start of 2015.
McMullan only found the net once each for St Mirren and Morton in 22 games for the Paisley outfit and nine outings for the Greenock side but hopes to shine with the Pars.
"I knew, having played here before with Stenhousemuir, how big a club it is and I'm looking forward to be part of it," he told Dunfermline's website.
"It's a hard league, I played in it last year, it was tricky, but it's one I hope I can do well in."
