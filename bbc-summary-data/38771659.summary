The incident happened at the Esso Service Station on Drygate Street, Larkhall, at about 20:30 on Monday.
The 51-year-old female assistant refused to hand over money from the till and ran out of the garage, raising the alarm with nearby business owners.
The man, who wore a scarf and glasses and carried a holdall, ran along Drygate Street towards Station Road.
He was white, about 5ft 8in, of medium build and also wearing dark clothes.
Det Con Ruth Whyte, from Police Scotland, said: "Our inquiries are continuing to trace the cowardly individual who attempted and failed to rob the service station. No-one should be placed in a state of fear or alarm as they go about their daily lives.
"We have conducted local inquiries and are continuing to assess CCTV to help identify the suspect.
"I would ask anyone with any information to get in contact. You may have seen a man in dark clothing hanging about the area in a suspicious manner before the attempted robbery or running along Drygate Street following the incident."
