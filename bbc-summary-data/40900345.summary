Niall Quinn drilled in the opener and then crossed for Kirk Millar to head the second before half-time.
Joe Gormley marked his return to Cliftonville by scoring twice as Barry Gray celebrated his first match as boss with  a 6-3 victory over Ards.
Coleraine had Steven Douglas sent-off but still won 3-1 at Dungannon while Glentoran beat Ballinamallard 2-1.
On Friday night, last season's runners-up Crusaders beat Ballymena United 4-1.
Linfield's victory was never in doubt once Quinn drilled a low left-foot shot beyond Carrick keeper Harry Doherty in the 16th minute at Windsor Park.
David Healy's double winners, unbeaten in domestic competition since early January, went 2-0 up though Millar and could have made it three after the break but Jordan Stewart's tame penalty was saved by Doherty.
Cliftonville, boosted by the return to the club of record scorer Gormley after a spell at Peterborough, had an early scare at home to Ards when Jonny Frazer gave the visitors an early lead.
But Gormley's double, two more from Jay Donnelly, a Chris Curran strike and a Scott Davidson own goal saw new boss Gray get off to a winning start at Solitude.
Former Warrenpoint manager Gray was appointed in May after Gerard Lyttle left to take charge of Sligo Rovers.
Coleraine, third last season, were drawing 0-0 at Dungannon when their defender Douglas was sent-off for a second yellow card offence.
But Oran Kearney's team went 2-0 up through Ciaron Harkin and Stephen O'Donnell before Ryan Mayse pulled a goal back for the Swifts.
Dungannon keeper Andy Coleman was sent-off for bringing down Brad Lyons late on and stand-in Jarlath O'Rourke had no chance as Ian Parkhill fired in a spectacular third for the Bannsiders.
Two goals by top striker Curtis Allen gave Glentoran their 2-1 win away to Ballinamallard United.
But Ballinamallard furiously protested that Allen had netted the 87th-minute winner with his hand.
The hosts had taken the lead through a Ryan Curran penalty but Allen levelled before the break.
Marc Griffin scored twice on his debut to help Glenavon edge Warrenpoint Town 3-2 at Milltown.
Griffin fired twice early on to give the Lurgan Blues a two-goal lead before Point rallied back through Darren Murray.
The former Cliftonville striker headed past Jonathan Tuffey before firing a second from the penalty spot, having been fouled by Simon Kelly.
Bobby Burns smashed a great strike in from the edge of the box to give Gary Hamilton's side the points.
