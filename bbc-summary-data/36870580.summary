Alastair Cook and Joe Root hit centuries as England laid down a strong platform on day one of the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford.

Cook's 105 was his 29th Test hundred, putting him level with Sir Donald Bradman, and helped his side to 314-4.
Root, who put on 185 with Cook for the second wicket, was unbeaten on 141 at stumps, his 10th Test century.
Mohammad Amir took 2-63, including bowling Cook, but Pakistan - who lead the series - toiled on a flat pitch.
England's batting was much improved from their 75-run defeat in the opening Test at Lord's, when they were dismissed for 272 and 207.
Much of the pre-match talk surrounded their struggles against Yasir Shah, who took 10 wickets at Lord's, but Cook and Root scored 39 and 45 respectively against him.
On a pitch expected to provide assistance to the spinners, Yasir conceded 111 runs off his 31 overs.
James Vince was dropped by Younus Khan at slip before being caught behind for 18 off Rahat Ali, while Gary Ballance combined for 78 with Root before falling for 23.

Alex Hales' departure in the seventh over - bowled by a seaming Amir delivery for 10 - meant England's captain and new number three had to negotiate the recovery.
Cook once again showed his ability to accumulate - his 81 at Lord's was quick by his standards - as gentle pushes with excellent timing, described as 'polite' by former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja, regularly found their way to the boundary.
Root, in fact, briefly overtook his partner and was first to the half-century, but Cook was soon back in front and raising his bat to a standing ovation.
The century partnership was near chanceless, barring an edge from Cook off Yasir that flew just wide of slip, though the left-hander would eventually be bowled off an inside edge by another swinging Amir delivery on the stroke of tea.
Root's last Test hundred came 10 innings ago, against South Africa in January, and while his place has not been under pressure, the move to number three after the Sri Lanka series has been under scrutiny.
He made 48 and nine at Lord's, though it was the manner of his dismissals - two slogs, one to Yasir - that had prompted further scrutiny.
At Old Trafford, he exuded calmness in defence and attack, with his first slog coming when he was on 66. He batted for six hours and struck 18 fours.
The only time Root looked nervous was when Amir narrowly beat his outside edge twice in the same over, while his celebration on reaching three figures had more than a hint of past exasperations being put to rest.
Indeed, as he said at the end of play: "There was some frustration from before of not getting a big score. It was nice to do so. We played a lot straighter."

Hales and Vince were out cheaply on what was described as a "belter" of a pitch by former England batsman and Test Match Special's Sir Geoffrey Boycott.
Hales was superbly set up by Amir, who first beat him with an inswinger then bowled him with the same delivery, the right-hander's footwork letting him down on both occasions.
Later, with Root in the 90s, Vince was caught behind trying to drive from wide of off stump, soon after he had been dropped at slip playing a similar shot.
Cook told Test Match Special: "I thought the way we played was much calmer. We've set the game up. I've been in good nick all through the summer, with Essex as well. I've not quite got a good score for England this year. I know this is not a massive score but it's nice to get a hundred.
"We're happy at the moment playing four seamers and a spinner. Just because we had one bad performance, I don't think you should change everything. We are a comfortable side playing that system, and I didn't think we should change it."
Root: "I thought the way he played was a really mature innings, which is what you expect from your captain. We've bounced back as a batting unit in this Test match. The way we responded is really good leading into the rest of the game."
