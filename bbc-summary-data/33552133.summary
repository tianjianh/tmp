[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley vicar 'pocketed' £24,000 in wedding and funeral fees

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A vicar pocketed thousands of pounds of cash in fees for weddings, funerals and graveyard memorials, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Reynolds, of Farnham, Surrey, denies stealing £24,000 from the diocese and parochial church council.
The money was paid to him by bereaved families and engaged couples while he was at All Saints Church in Darton, near Barnsley.
Sheffield Crown Court was told the Church of England priest had committed a "significant breach of trust".
Mr Reynolds, of Upper Church Lane, is on trial charged with four counts of theft between 2007 and 2013.
The first three relate to fees he should have sent to the Wakefield Diocesan Board of Finance for marriages, funerals and memorials, the court heard.
The fourth relates to payments for monuments that should have gone to the parochial church council.
Prosecutors said an investigation showed the defendant had only passed on a fraction of what he should.
The trial continues.
