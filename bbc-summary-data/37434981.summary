It is in connection with a phone call in January 2014 over the sale of the Northern Ireland property portfolio by the National Asset Management Agency (Nama).
The Â£1.2bn sale by Nama of its Northern Ireland property loans portfolio to US firm Cerberus was Northern Ireland's biggest ever property deal.
Following a similar invitation, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, has agreed to appear before the same committee.
A Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson said: "The Deputy First Minister supports and will cooperate fully with all efforts to uncover the truth around the Project Eagle sale and the wider issues relating to NAMA."
PAC chairman Sean Fleming said the committee would begin hearings on 29 September.
