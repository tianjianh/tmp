A relief lifeboat has arrived to replace the Spirit of Guernsey while it undergoes a major refit.

The RNLI Severn class lifeboat Roger and Joy Freeman moored arrived on Wednesday to cover the St Peter Port lifeboat station.
The Spirit of Guernsey, also a Severn class, is due to sail to Poole on Thursday for 8-10 weeks of work.
The refit will include electrical upgrades, repairs to the bow thruster controls and a propeller change.

The Spirit of Guernsey arrived in the island in 1997 and her last major refit was in 2008.
