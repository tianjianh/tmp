A Bristol hospice says it will be able to care for more terminally ill people in their own homes thanks to a grant.

St Peter's Hospice has been awarded Â£15,000 from a programme financed by the St James's Place Foundation.
Julia Di Castiglione, from the charity, said the grant meant it could continue to help seriously ill people live in comfort until they die.
"It will also enable us to provide support for their family and friends," she said.
"Last year our team cared for over 350 patients at home - it's great that we will be able to help even more people this year."
