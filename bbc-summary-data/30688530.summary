The project in the Greater Manchester town will feature a 1,200-seat performance venue, new homes, shops, gardens and facilities for boats.
Known as Wigan Pier Quarter, the 10-year scheme will go ahead after Wigan Council signed a deal with developers.
The aim is to transform a run-down area close to the town centre around the Leeds Liverpool Canal basin.
The council's deputy leader David Molyneux said: "There's been a lot of talk in Westminster political circles about Wigan Pier and the country going back to the 1930s.
"Well the reality here in Wigan is we're looking to the future not the past.
"We've come up with an exciting new vision for a Wigan Pier Quarter and signed a deal with a proven developer to deliver this. It will bring prosperity and opportunity to the whole town."
The former Wigan Pier nightclub building will be demolished and replaced by a new community garden as part of the plans.
There will also be improved canal moorings.
