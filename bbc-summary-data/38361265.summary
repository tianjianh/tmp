Both sides spurned plenty of good openings, before the former Dagenham winger struck decisively in the closing seconds.
Nicky Bailey headed over after five minutes for the visitors and Matt Tubbs fired wide following a scramble from a corner.
George Porter missed two good chances for the hosts in the closing stages of the first half, firing over Blair Turgott's pass and missing the target from David Martin's cross.
Adam Cunnington fired wide from Turgott's cross, and winger Turgott was then denied by Ross Worner.
Alan Julian made a good save at the other end and Bradley Goldberg missed a great chance late on as he fired wide.
The game appeared destined for a draw until Dennis struck in injury time.
