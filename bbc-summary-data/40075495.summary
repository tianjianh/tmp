Hernandez headed in his 47th goal with four minutes left in Saturday's friendly in Los Angeles, a warm-up for the Confederations Cup in Russia.
It took the Bayer Leverkusen forward, 28, past Jared Borgetti's record in his 91st international appearance.
"Javier is one of the best finishers in the world," Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said.
Hernandez, who was the fastest Mexico player to score 40 goals for his country, equalled Borgetti's record in March.
He scored 59 goals in 156 appearances for United after arriving at Old Trafford in 2010, before joining German side Leverkusen in August 2015.
