[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mahela Jayawardene's unbeaten century led Somerset to a crushing nine-wicket victory over Worcestershire to reach the semi-finals of the One-Day Cup.

The visitors, with England all-rounder Moeen Ali back as opener at Taunton, looked well placed at 155-3.
But once Moeen went for 81, followed by Worcestershire skipper Daryl Mitchell (64), they collapsed to 210 all out.
Openers Jayawardene (117 not out) and captain Jim Allenby (81) then put on 188 as Somerset raced to 214-1.
Allenby's side will now face Warwickshire at Edgbaston in the last four, after they beat Essex by 70 runs in Wednesday's other quarter-final.
While Somerset made the chase look simple, with Jayawardene's superb, chanceless innings coming off 111 balls, it was the wicket of Moeen which turned the match in the hosts' favour.
The 29-year-old, who scored 316 runs at an average of 63.20 in the four-match Test series against Pakistan, looked at his fluent best once again, striking 10 fours and a six in his 76-ball knock.
However, just as he seemed to be taking Worcestershire to a sizeable score he miscued Peter Trego into the leg side in the 30th over and was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Max Waller.
Seamer Trego (3-33) followed it up with the wicket of Mitchell and, by the time last man Jack Shantry was pinned lbw by Roelof van der Merwe, Worcestershire had lost their last seven wickets for 55.
Former Sri Lanka captain Jayawardene demonstrated all of his international class in bringing up his 21st List A limited-overs hundred, mixing wristy flicks to the boundary with more aggressive shots - one of his two sixes landing on the roof of the Sir Ian Botham Stand.
Allenby's dismissal, when he skied Moeen to Tom Fell, was only a minor blip as the hosts got home with 13.1 overs to spare.
