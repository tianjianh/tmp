Tests are being carried out on the knife and the car is being examined, Sussex Police said.
Earlier on Saturday the family of Don Lock, from Worthing, paid tribute to a "gentle, kind and loving" man.
Police now have until midnight on Sunday to question a 34-year-old man from Worthing on suspicion of murder.
In a news conference given by a family members, Mr Lock's son Andrew told reporters they had been "incredibly overwhelmed" by the messages of support they had received.
The family he said, was "deeply grateful" to the people who had tried to treat Mr Lock at the side of the road after what he described as an "horrific, unprovoked attack".
He then spoke about his father's love of cycling and road racing in which he had been involved for more than 60 years.
He said Mr Lock still kept a diary of the miles he had covered and his entry for Thursday said he had already ridden 20 miles that morning.
Andrew Lock recalled attending Brighton & Hove Albion games with his father, taking along "jelly babies and liquorice allsorts".
The family wanted to "remember dad for the fantastic person he was - full of wisdom, full of wit, always calm.
"Always supportive, the perfect role model, and full of charm. Don, dad, granddad and great-granddad, the best."
Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said Mr Lock was the victim of a "violent, unprovoked attack that he had no chance to defend himself against".
He revealed that detectives had been given an extension until midnight on Sunday to continue questioning a man on suspicion of murder.
He described the investigation as a "fast moving operation" and renewed his appeal for anyone with information that might be of use to the inquiry team to come forward.
Mr Lock, who was recently given the all-clear from prostate cancer, was treated by paramedics but died shortly after the attack near Findon at about 20:40 BST on Thursday.
Both cars were travelling southbound.
Mr Lock's best friend, Stuart - a member of the same Worthing cycling club - paid tribute to him, describing him as "a truly perfect human being".
"He was placid and kind and supported everyone. He was Mr Worthing. The area won't be the same without him."
Another friend and member of the cycling club, Malcolm Hales, described him as a "quiet and unassuming guy" who "always had a smile for anyone he met".
