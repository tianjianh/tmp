Crowds of people chanting and setting fire to bins gathered in Gwilliam Court, in Monkton, Pembrokeshire, at about 21:30 BST on Tuesday.
Police were called and took two people from a property before the disturbance ended six hours later.
On Wednesday, about 100 protesters gathered outside a council office.
The crowd outside the office in Argyle Street, Pembroke Dock, were shouting and chanting about the situation in Monkton, with some saying they were not leaving until they had answers.
Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were present and "engaging with the community about their concerns".
It comes after the overnight protest on the housing estate.
Police issued members of the 100-strong crowd with dispersal orders and the incident ended at about 03:00 BST on Wednesday.
Nobody was arrested or injured.
Dyfed-Powys Police said it received additional help from South Wales Police and Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Team.
Officers remained at Gwilliam Court on Wednesday and extra patrols are being carried out in the area to reassure people.
Pearl Llewellyn, a local councillor, said she would contact the housing office.
"They'll be made aware of it," she said.
A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed the force was "liaising with Pembrokeshire County Council housing officers, and the concerns voiced by the community during the incident will be raised with them".
Pembrokeshire council said it was aware of the incident on the council estate.
"Housing officers from Pembrokeshire County Council attended the scene at the request of police," a spokesman said.
