Una Crown was found stabbed to death in her bungalow in Magazine Lane, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on 13 January 2013.
The attackers stole ??40 cash and her engagement ring, police said.
On second anniversary of her death, Cambridgeshire Police made a new appeal for information, calling on any witnesses to contact them.
A post-mortem examination revealed she died as a result of stab wounds to her neck and chest. Her body was then set on fire in an apparent attempt to disguise her injuries and destroy evidence.
Police said a ??10,000 reward from the independent charity Crimestoppers was still on offer, for information leading to the arrest and successful conviction of Mrs Crown's killer.
Det Ch Insp Sharn Basra, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "It has been two years since this terrible crime happened and we still believe the answer to solving it lies within the local community.
"I'm asking people to really think about what they were doing in the days before and after Mrs Crown's death - did you see anything suspicious? Did someone you know come home smelling of smoke, acting strangely, or had clothing that was burnt or had blood on it?
"We are determined to get justice for Mrs Crown and her family."
A 44-year-old man from Wisbech, arrested on 11 November on suspicion of Mrs Crown's murder, was released on bail, to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough, on Tuesday.
Three men, previously arrested on suspicion of murder were all released with no further action.
