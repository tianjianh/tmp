West Yorkshire police chief questioned in PSNI bribery investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief constable of West Yorkshire has been questioned by Northern Ireland police investigating alleged bribery and misconduct in public office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Gilmore, from Belfast, was suspended on full pay in June in connection with an investigation into the awarding of vehicle contracts.
He said he had conducted himself with the honesty and integrity expected of someone in his position.
He voluntarily attended a police station in Belfast last week.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: "Detectives are preparing a file on a 49-year-old man following inquiries into bribery and misconduct in public office which were initiated by this investigation.
"He voluntarily attended a police station in Belfast last week for interview."
Seven men have been arrested as part of the investigation by the PSNI.
Among those arrested was former PSNI assistant chief constable Duncan McCausland, who has said he "strenuously denies" any wrongdoing.
Police have said files on all seven of those arrested are being prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service.
The BBC understands that due to the complexity of the investigation it could be months before the review of those files is completed and the police are in a position to decide whether to bring charges.
Mr Gilmore  is from the Shankill Road area of west Belfast and joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in 1983, which has since been transformed into the PSNI.
He rose to the role of superintendent, before being seconded to Lancashire Police in 2008.
He became assistant chief constable at West Yorkshire Police five years ago, before being promoted to chief constable last year.
