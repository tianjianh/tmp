Ireland women hammered by dominant Canada in Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's women were outclassed by Canada at the UCD Bowl in Dublin as the 2014 World Cup finalists ran in seven tries in a 48-7 victory.

Tries from DeLeaka Menin, Julianne Zussman and Karen Paquin left the dominant visitors 24-0 up at half-time.
A Nikki Caughey try and conversion cut Canada's lead but Emily Belchose, Laura Russell, star wing Magali Harvey and Zussman replied with further scores.
The Irish were unable to cope with Canada's pace and physicality.
Despite only being together for a week as they began their November tour, the Canadians produced impressive handling and patterns of play to which the Irish had no answer, while Burk slotted six out of eight kicks at goal.
After his side had only been edged out 12-10 by world champions England last weekend, Ireland coach Tom Tierney was hopeful his players would test Canada but instead they were handed a lesson.
Tierney made 10 changes from last with an entirely altered pack and only backs Mairead Coyle, Alison Miller, Niamh Kavanagh, Nicole Fowley and Sene Naoupu retains as first caps were handed to Anna Caplice and Nichola Fryday.
Menin's seventh-minute try was converted by Andrea Burk and the fly-half notched seven further first-half points as Zussman and Paquin added more touchdowns in the second half.
A Sene Naoupu burst was Ireland's only first-half attack but the home side did get on the scoresheet straight after the break as Ulster fly-half Caughey touched down.
However, a Jacey Murphy burst set up Belchos' try as the Irish had replacement prop Lindsay Peat sin-binned.
After Laura Russell finished off another forwards-created try, star wing Magali Harvey brushed off Alison Miller to touch down in the corner before Zussman's second touchdown completed the scoring.
Canada will be back in action against New Zealand in Donnybrook on Wednesday while the Irish face the Kiwis at the UCD Bowl next Sunday.
