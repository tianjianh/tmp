Pupils from 23 schools joined students at Wellesley House School in Broadstairs to speak to the astronaut on the International Space Station (ISS).
It was the seventh in a series of UK-wide events designed to inspire scientific interest in pupils.
The astronaut is on a six-month mission for the European Space Agency.
On Sunday, he is set to run the equivalent of the London Marathon on a treadmill on board the ISS.
Initially, the group struggled to make audio contact with the astronaut, whose face appeared on a screen on the stage.
Victoria Neilson, spokeswoman for Wellesley House School, said: "It was extraordinary... like one of those movies when they are trying to make contact."
She added: "It was very exciting for everyone".
The project is a collaboration between Amateur Radio on the ISS (ARISS), the Radio Society of Great Britain, the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency.
