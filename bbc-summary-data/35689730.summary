Glasgow City Council staff vote for industrial action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of staff at Scotland's largest local authority have voted in favour of strike action in an on-going dispute over pay and conditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The GMB union said it would ballot for strike action unless Glasgow City Council "immediately withdraw" proposed cuts affecting its members.
In a consultative ballot of 1,000 staff, more than 80% voted, with 95% backing industrial action.
The council said it had consulted with the unions "every step of the way".
Those balloted work in areas such as refuse, street cleaning and parks.
GMB officer Benny Rankin said: "There has never been such a level of support for strike action in living memory.
"After years of pay freezes and seeing their standard of living eroded, our members have had enough."
Mr Rankin said GMB members were "not going to pay for the financial crisis in Glasgow".
"We don't care if the financial problems are down to John Swinney's cuts or failings in Glasgow City Council, enough is enough," he said.
"We demand that Glasgow City Council immediately withdraw the cuts to pay and conditions they tabled. If they do not, we will move to a formal ballot for strike action."
Cllr Frank McAveety, leader of Glasgow City Council, said: "I'm surprised to hear of these claims from the GMB. When the budget options are put to the council next week, I believe there will be no grounds for the threat of strikes.
"We have consulted with the unions every step of the way and have delivered our pledge of no compulsory redundancies. Staff will also have among the best terms and conditions in the country.
"This is despite having to save Â£130m over the next two years after the Scottish government made unprecedented cuts to our budget."
