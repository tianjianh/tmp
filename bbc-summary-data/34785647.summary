[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some officers involved in a police pursuit in which a teenager was killed did not understand police guidelines, a watchdog has found.

Matthew Seddon, of Reading, died in the crash on the A33 in February 2013.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found some Thames Valley Police officers involved did not know what the guidelines permitted or prevented them from doing.
In-car video recording equipment in one pursuing car was also faulty.
The force said it had reviewed some policies and training as a result of the case.
The IPCC investigated the circumstances of the crash, including examining CCTV and in-car video footage.
Nine officers and one member of police staff were served notice that their conduct was under investigation by the IPCC.
One officer has since had six penalty points placed on his police driving licence.
A headset used in the control room during the pursuit was also found to be faulty, according to the report.
At the time of the collision several police vehicles were involved in the pursuit of the 19-year-old's Ford Fiesta which involved speeds of up to 100mph.
The pursuit started when Mr Seddon, who was driving on a provisional licence without insurance, failed to stop for an officer.
Mr Seddon, who had not been wearing a seat belt, was thrown into the road and hit by one of the pursuing vehicles.
Last month, a jury inquest ruled there was insufficient reason to call off the pursuit.
IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell described the crash as a "tragic accident".
However, he added: "It is vital that all police officers who engage in pursuits are trained and equipped to make the right decisions."
The IPCC recommended Thames Valley Police take steps to improve the reliability of the equipment used in its control rooms and the in-car video recording equipment in its vehicles.
Following the investigation, the force held misconduct meetings in respect of five officers involved in the pursuit.
One officer was given "management advice" and had six penalty points placed on his driving licence, the IPCC said.
No disciplinary action was taken against four other officers, although a case against one officer was proven on one point.
Assistant Chief Constable Alan Baldwin said the force had acknowledged the report.
"As a result of this tragic case Thames Valley Police has reviewed a number of our policies and our training, and has improved the way we respond to incidents," he said.
He said all control room sergeants and supervisors involved in managing police pursuits had also been given additional training "on how to make and record their decisions and actions".
