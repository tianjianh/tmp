Trio jailed for Ballymena wheelie bin attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have been sentenced to three-and-a-half years for imprisoning a man who was found naked and battered in a taped-up wheelie bin in Ballymena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teri Lau, 28, of Dunclug Park, and Roddy Patterson, 28, of Glendun Drive, Ballymena, had pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm and false imprisonment.
They will serve half their sentences in custody and the rest on licence.
Paula Wilson, 22, of Main Street, Cullybackey, was sentenced to two years, half to be spent on licence.
She had pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting false imprisonment.
The trio were originally charged with attempting to kill Adam Robinson, who was 21 at the time, in September 2013, but pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
The attack happened after they took part in a drink and drugs binge over 72 hours.
In sentencing, the judge said a factor was that Mr Robinson had been left suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
He said the victim truly believed he was going to die when he was left in a bin, unable to see and with limited air to breathe.
The judge said this was clearly meant to "punish, humiliate and demean" Mr Robinson.
He said if he had not been found, the consequences could have been far worse.
It is understood that because of time already served in jail, all three will be released soon.
Earlier hearings were told that Mr Robinson was only found by chance, when a dog sniffed out the bin, which was propped up against a tree in dense undergrowth and sealed with parcel tape.
The pet's barking alerted its owner who then rang the emergency services.
Mr Robinson's father Mervyn said he was disappointed by the sentences.
He said the trio would be released "very shortly" and "will most likely be back in Ballymena very soon".
"Adam wants to go down the town in Ballymena and walk about freely, and who knows who he is going to bump into some day when he walks around a corner," he said.
"It's tough for him. Ballymena is not that big a town and he realises the possibility of that happening and it probably plays on his mind too, which he doesn't need because he has been through so much.
"It's been very very traumatic for him, so hopefully he can put this behind him."
