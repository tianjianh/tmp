Train services at Glasgow Queen Street are to return to normal next month with the re-opening of the station's rail tunnel a day earlier than planned.

ScotRail said services would restart on Sunday 7 August after the completion of a 20-week Â£60m works programme.
During the closure, trains to Stirling, Edinburgh and Aberdeen were diverted to low-level platforms or Glasgow Central.
The project is part of wider plans to revamp Queen Street and allow longer, faster trains to run from the station.
Phil Verster, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, described the tunnel works as "an extraordinarily complex job".
"Our people have been working round-the-clock, often in really challenging circumstances, to get this job done," he said.
"I'm incredibly grateful to our customers for the patience and understanding that they have shown over the course of the last five months."
ScotRail said the tunnel closure was necessary to enable the renewal of 1,800m of existing concrete slab track formation, which carries the rails through the 918m tunnel.
The project involved the removal of 10,000 tonnes of existing concrete slab and the installation of 4,000m of new rails.
Transport Minister, Humza Yousaf, said he was pleased the tunnel works were to be completed on schedule.
He said: "Like all rail passengers, I am looking forward to the resumption of normal services. I would like to thank the public for their patience during the closure."
Work to redevelop Glasgow Queen Street station is due to begin later this year with completion expected in 2019.
