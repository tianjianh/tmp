Liverpool striker Fabio Borini has signed for Sunderland on a season-long loan deal.

The Black Cats have also added former Liverpool defender Andrea Dossena, 31, from Napoli on a one-year deal.
Black Cats boss Paolo Di Canio rates Borini highly, although the 22-year-old has scored just twice since becoming Brendan Rodgers's first Reds signing.
The Italian, who played for Rodgers at Chelsea's academy and Swansea, moved from Roma in July 2012 for Â£11m.
Liverpool's signing of Victor Moses from Chelsea on loan pushed him further away from first-team contention.
Capped once by Italy, against the United States in February 2012, Borini has made 20 appearances for the Anfield club.
Dossena, who made 31 appearances during an 18-month spell at Anfield from 2008, helped Napoli to second-place in Serie A last season.
