Former Middlesbrough defender Fleming has joined from Hartlepool United, where he was assistant manager.
The 48-year-old has had spells coaching at Scottish side Livingston and Bolton, and previously worked alongside Holloway at Crystal Palace.
Rangers have lost four of their five Championship games, winning the other, since Holloway took charge in November.
"You have to have the right balance with your staff and I think we've got that now with Curtis on board," Holloway said.
"Different voices are important, and players respond to that."
Rangers are three points above the Championship relegation zone, after suffering a fourth straight league defeat against Derby on Wednesday.
The R's have failed to score in three of their past four games but Holloway was encouraged by his side's performance in the 1-0 loss at Loftus Road, which he described as a "huge improvement" on previous showings.
"I am going to be picking them up because it is much more like a team of mine," the 53-year-old told BBC Radio London.
"Unfortunately everybody is always looking over their shoulder all the time but I am concerned with us improving and having an identity.
"Our identity is getting better and stronger but unfortunately results at this level are all about scoring. If we keep missing we'll have to look at who is playing up front and what we are doing with them."
