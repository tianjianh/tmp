The captain pounced after Kieran Smith's shot was spilled by Peter Jehle in the visiting goal.
Vaduz had led 2-0 at half-time after goals in quick succession from Gonzalo Zarate and Maurice Brunner.
Stuart Jones should have claimed a late equaliser for Bala but headed just wide when Nathan Burke's free-kick found him unmarked at the back post.
The return leg at the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz is on Thursday, 6 July.
Ballymena United or Norwegian side Odd await the winners in the second qualifying round.
Bala manager Colin Caton told BBC Wales Sport:
"I don't think we started the game very well - we were very flat and wary of knowing the opposition.
"We still had good chances and a blatant penalty when Kieran [Smith] has gone through and has been pulled back.
"They had two chances in the first half and that's the difference at this level. It's a bit frustrating really... we have had the better chances.
"If we get the first goal out there, it's an away goal and they will be in a sticky situation.
"They were panicking towards the end here.
"It just frustrates me we have done ever so well but you have to take the chances at this level."
