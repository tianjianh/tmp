Surrey Police and Surrey Fire and Rescue Service concluded that a fatal fire in Trumpets Hill Road, Reigate on 24 January was arson.
Officers have ruled out searching for any other suspects in connection with the blaze.
The people who died have been named as Adriana Nunes, 41, her husband Tiago Nunes, 30 and their son Tiago, six.
Emergency services were called to the house at 11.10 GMT on 24 January following reports of a fire.
The fire had been burning overnight and three bodies were found inside and an investigation was started.
Det Ch Insp Paddy Mayers said: "This was a tragic incident and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the Nunes family, who have requested that their privacy be respected at this distressing time."
"I would like to thank the community for their patience while we have continued to investigate. This case will now be passed to the coroner's office," he said.
