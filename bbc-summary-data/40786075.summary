Barrow 0-0 FC Halifax Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow and FC Halifax played out a goalless draw in their National League clash at Holker Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had lost their opening fixture, so were looking to produce a positive response.
Midfielder Asa Hall sent an early chance over for the hosts before Jordan White was just off-target with a free-kick, but Halifax then went close as Connor Oliver hit the crossbar.
In the second half, Barrow substitute Dan Cockerline saw an effort saved just after coming on and Liam Hughes had his shot pushed over as the visitors held out for a point.
