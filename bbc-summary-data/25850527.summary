The cost of repairing Aberystwyth promenade and other locations in Ceredigion severely damaged by storms in early January has topped £1.5m.

Ceredigion council said the final cost could well be higher as it prepares for another high tide on 2 February.
The council has started talks with the Welsh government on submitting a bid to help fund the seafront's restoration.
On Tuesday, Welsh ministers said £2m was available to repair flood defences damaged by the storms.
Aberystwyth was one of the towns that was hardest hit by the heavy rain, strong winds and high tides that battered the Welsh coast between 3 and 6 January.
A Grade II-listed shelter partly fell into a hole after its foundations were washed away as massive waves pounded the seafront.
The 1920s landmark was badly damaged and has been dismantled for repair.
More than 200 volunteers armed with buckets and shovels helped start the clean up operation on the promenade on 11 January.
A Ceredigion council spokesman said; "The estimated costs associated with the immediate necessary work of clearing-up and repairs to assets amount to at least £1.5 million.
"We are in the process of collating all of these costs and the final figure could well exceed this estimated sum once all the information has been received."
The spokesman added that the local authority could access funds from three Welsh government sources but would have to match fund the money from its own reserves.
Meanwhile, promenade repairs are ongoing with workers trying to shore up defences due to fears that storms during a high tide on 2 February could cause more damage.
Tides of up to 7.8 metres (25ft), the second highest of the year, are forecast for the start of February.
The council aims to completely reopen the promenade to the public by Easter.
