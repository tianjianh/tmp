Two men have been jailed over a bungled shop robbery in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Telfer, 48, and his nephew James Telfer, 31, both of Maryhill, used air guns in the raid on Price Cutter, in the Riddrie area, in October 2015.
They left empty-handed after staff forced them out and were traced through a tobacco pouch they left at the scene.
Both men admitted assault, robbery and firearms charges. Thomas Telfer was jailed for five years and James Telfer was ordered to serve 45 months.
Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lady Scott said she had no other option but to send the pair to prison.
The court heard that following the failed raid, police discovered a tobacco packet which was of a type the shop did not sell.
This later linked the two men to the raid and they were arrested by police.
Thomas Telfer's solicitor advocate, Philip McWilliams, told the court that his client owed money to drug dealers.
Mr McWilliams added: "He was blamed by drug dealers for a package which had gone missing from a bookmakers in the Maryhill area of Glasgow.
"This package was worth approximately Â£40,000 and he was told he must recompense the people concerned for the loss of this package.
"He expresses remorse for his role in the incident."
James Telfer's solicitor advocate, Eddie Gilroy, told the court that his client had appreciated that he had placed the two shop workers under stress.
He added: "He fully appreciates that this was a terrifying incident for those individuals who were caught up in the incident."
