She added: "Tournaments like Birmingham, Eastbourne, and Nottingham have such an incredible history, you just need to look at the roll of honour to see that, and you can sense that when you step on court."
The Aegon Nottingham Open at the Nottingham Tennis Centre starts on 10 June.
Konta was beaten in the second round last year, losing 6-4 7-5 to Zheng Saisai of China, having reached the quarter-finals in 2015.
