The BBC's Andrew Marr said the party's fiscal credibility was at stake because Ms Long-Bailey was unable to provide a detailed breakdown of its plans - suggesting her numbers were "£30bn short".
But she maintained independent research showed reversing a series of Conservative tax cuts benefiting the most wealthy in society would raise £70bn by 2020.
