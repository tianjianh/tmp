A man from Scotland was among three people gored during a bullfighting festival in Spain.

The man, who has not been identified, had been taking part in Ciudad Rodrigo's Carnaval del Toro festival when he was injured by a bull.
A US national and a Spaniard from nearby Salamanca were also gored.
The American man, who has been identified as 20-year-old Benjamin Miller, from Georgia, was the most seriously hurt.
He underwent a three-hour operation to repair damage to his thighs, sphincter and back muscles and is recovering in a hospital intensive care unit.
It is understood Mr Miller was gored and tossed by a large fighting bull on Saturday, which was the first day of the festival.
Town councillor Pedro Munoz confirmed that "One man from Scotland and a Spaniard from Salamanca were also injured" during Saturday's events.
He said the two men had suffered less serious goring injuries than Mr Miller.
Fiestas featuring bulls are common in Spain, and critics and aficionados agree that the events, which attract international audiences, are dangerous.
Mr Munoz said somewhere between 45,000 and 50,000 people had been attracted over the weekend to this year's four-day fiesta, which includes afternoon bullfights and bull-running events.
Ciudad Rodrigo - which has a population of 14,000 - is a small cathedral city close to the Portuguese border which is a popular tourist destination.
It retains its ancient defensive walls and was the site of key battles between Napoleon's army and British forces under the command of the Duke of Wellington from 1810 to 1812.
