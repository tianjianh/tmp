Sonny Bradley's header was cleared off the line for the hosts, before full-back Elliot Johnson fired Barnet ahead from 25 yards.
Akinde collected Justin Nwogu's pass to slot in the second after the break.
And the 26-year-old then lobbed Crawley goalkeeper Jack Rose to secure all three points for the visitors late on.
Barnet stayed 15th in the League Two table despite picking up their first win in three games, while Crawley finished the season 20th.

Crawley head coach Dermot Drummy told BBC Surrey: "We can go on about like an old record talking about the levels in the first half and we weren't at the races in the second half, physically or mentally.
"There's definitely going to be changes. I will get players that can play that certain way and also play the way I want to."
