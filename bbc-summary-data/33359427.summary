Air India 'offloads' family to fly minister Kiren Rijiju

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Indian minister Kiren Rijiju has been criticised extensively on social media after reports alleged that a family of three, including a child, was offloaded to accommodate him on a flight.

The Economic Times said the government-run Air India flight was also delayed by an hour in the process.
Many have taken to Twitter to express their resentment at the alleged privilege given to the minister.
Mr Rijiju said he was not aware that people were offloaded for him.
Indian media reports said on 24 June, the Air India flight from Leh for Delhi was set for departure when an air force officer, his wife and child were asked to get off the plane for "last-minute passengers" who were identified as Mr Rijiju, India's junior minister for home, his aide, and Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh.
Mr Rijiju said reports that the flight was delayed because of them were incorrect.
"Air India had rescheduled the 11.40 am flight and advanced it at short notice," he said and added that there was "a communication gap".
Mr Rijiju's defence notwithstanding, many Indians have taken to social media to criticise the alleged privilege given to the minister.
