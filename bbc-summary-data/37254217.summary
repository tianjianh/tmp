Liam Hall had tried to swim to shore when the dinghy they were in, along with two other friends, started taking in water on Tuesday afternoon.
The 17-year-old, from Southwick, got into difficulties and disappeared. He was found two hours later following a search operation but died in hospital.
Courtney Anne Richardson, 18, said Liam had not been a good swimmer.

The four friends had taken a trip on the dinghy from Roker Beach on a sunny day in calm seas, but it began drifting further out to sea and taking in water.
Miss Richardson said: "Liam wasn't that much of a good swimmer, but we didn't know that at the time.
"He swam about half way and then just stopped.
"All I can remember is just panicking, seeing Liam's head going under the water and not coming back up.
"It was horrible, I can still see it all the time. I can still hear him shouting for help."
The three others tried to help but were unable to get to him. They were eventually helped to safety and there was a major search operation to recover Liam.
He was recovered from the water and taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary but could not be saved.
Miss Richardson said: "It doesn't even feel like he's gone. Sometimes I hope he walks through the door.
"He was a really happy person, who loved to be out with his friends. He just laughed at everything."
