The 25-year-old sustained the injury in Tigers' 25-24 win over Wakefield Trinity.
"It's a bit of a blow. He's been influential for us this year," head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds.
"He's a smart player with the ball. We need some of the other guys in the middle to step up."
Larne Patrick has had tests following a problem picked up in the same game on 6 July, while Jake Webster is out with a rib injury.
