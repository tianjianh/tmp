Thousands of smaller schools 'financially not viable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of smaller primaries and secondaries in England are becoming financially unviable, heads say.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) says one-form entry primaries and secondaries with 600 pupils or fewer will "fall off a cliff" financially unless new funds are found.
The government says it has been protecting school budgets.
Independent experts say they face real-terms cuts of 8% to cover cost rises in pension, pay and national insurance.
The Institute of Fiscal Studies says having been insulated from real-terms cuts over the last Parliament, schools are likely to feel the pinch more over the current Parliament, with spending per pupil set to fall.
A one-form entry primary has about 210 pupils, just 65 less than the average-sized primary school.
Some 20% of primaries (3,478) in England have fewer than 200 pupils, and 30% (5,037) have fewer than 300 pupils.
The average-sized 11-to-16 secondary has about 970 pupils, while a three-form secondary has about 450 pupils and a four-form primary has about 600.
Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL, told the BBC: "At some smaller schools, the funding will become such that they would not be able to support their teaching infrastructure.
"They will not be financially viable.
"One-form entry primary schools, and three- to four-form entry secondary schools, are going to find it extremely difficult, especially in low-funded education authorities.
"This size of school is quite common, and they are under real threat.
"They are going to find it extremely difficult to provide a full curriculum and maintain the support staff infrastructure needed to run the school.
"It's all down to the cost pressures that have come home to roost - the unfunded pay rises, national insurance costs and pension contributions."
He said with continuing delays to the publication of the long-awaited new national funding formula, due now to be introduced in 2018, schools were really struggling.
"The big, big issue is because [the Department for Education] is not doing anything until 2018, they really need to do something for schools who are going to fall of a cliff financially or run into a wall in 2017."
He suggested schools might find solutions to their funding issues by sharing specialist teachers with a group of neighbouring schools.
Alternatively, they might choose to share some of their support services with other schools.
The Department for Education said: "In reality the schools budget has been protected and in 2016-17 totals over Â£40bn, the highest ever on record.
"The government's fairer funding proposals will ensure that areas with the highest need attract the most funding and end the historic unfairness in the system."
