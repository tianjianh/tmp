[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eighty jobs are being created in Belfast by a London-based financial services company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
FinTrU provides services for investment banks allowing them to outsource many of their regulatory processes.
The jobs will generate around £1.9m for the economy with salaries of around £24,000.
The investment is being supported by government grants totalling £840,000. Invest NI has offered £480,000 of support for the new jobs.
A further £360,000 is being offered through skills development funds.
The company was founded in 2013 by Irish man Darragh McCarthy, who previously held a series of senior jobs at the investment bank Morgan Stanley.
He said increasing regulatory requirements in the financial services sector  lead him to identify an opportunity to provide process outsourcing to help companies achieve compliance.
The firm plans to begin recruiting immediately and aims to have all jobs in place by 2016.
The Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said the company's decision to locate in Belfast had also been influenced by "the availability of good quality graduate talent and our cost-competitive business environment".
