Blackman, who has yet to make a senior appearance for Chelsea, has extended his contract at Stamford Bridge until the end of the 2020/21 season.
The 23-year-old spent last season on loan at League Two side Wycombe, making 52 appearances in all competitions.
"Jamal has been our number one target right the way through the summer," said Blades boss Chris Wilder.
Blackman, who has also signed a new contract to 2021, is one of a number of Chelsea players to have moved away on season-long loan deals, including defenders Michael Hector to Hull and Tomas Kalas to Fulham.
