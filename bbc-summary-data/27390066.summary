Tributes have been paid to Scottish rugby great Hugh McLeod, from Hawick, who died on Monday at the age of 81.

The Scottish Rugby Union said it was "saddened to learn" of the death of the former Scotland and British Lions prop.
He made his international debut against France in 1954 and won 40 consecutive caps for his country.
Mr McLeod, dubbed the "Hawick Hardman" due to his strength and fitness, was inducted into Scottish Rugby's Hall of Fame last year.
As well as playing for the British Lions in 1955 and 1959, he played 14 times for the Barbarians between those years.
His last international was a draw against England in March 1962.
Off the field, he worked in the building trade and went on to own a sports shop.
He played all his club rugby for Hawick, went on to be president, and was named in the club's greatest ever team.
Current Hawick president Rory Bannerman said: "He was the consummate professional and a legend throughout the rugby world.
"He will be a well-missed figure cycling up and down the High Street in Hawick where you didn't want to get in his way just like on the field.
"Hugh was probably the greatest ever player to pull on the green jersey for Hawick."
