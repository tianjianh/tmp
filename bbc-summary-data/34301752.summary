Investigating officers said the woman was running along Heol Las and Birchgrove Road with her dog when she was attacked on Friday at about 19:40 BST.
South Wales Police said a man was later arrested and is in custody.
The attack comes days after a woman was sexually assaulted in the same area, but Det Insp Trudi Meyrick said the two incidents were not being linked.
