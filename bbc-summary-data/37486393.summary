[SN]TITLE[SN]
A matter of principle: Jeremy Corbyn and Trident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the reasons Jeremy Corbyn is so lauded by his supporters is his life long objection to nuclear weapons. The way he has stuck to that principle has won him the respect and admiration of many.

But even though he is the Labour leader, the party's policy is still to back the renewal of the British nuclear deterrent, Trident.
His attempts to reverse that since he has been in the job have not worked, and indeed, yesterday, the shadow defence secretary told the conference that the party shouldn't keep going back to the issue, saying Labour shouldn't keeping "picking the scab" over such a divisive issue.
But it's clear Mr Corbyn hasn't given up. He told me he was "sure" it would be raised in future, and he wanted to continue to "make the case" for scrapping them.
Mr Corbyn also suggested that if he was prime minister he might call off UK air strikes on so called Islamic State.
For his supporters, it is Mr Corbyn's commitment to his principles that is so appealing. For his detractors, it's stubbornness that sows division.
Labour says the party's ready for a general election. It's Mr Corbyn's task to prove to his party and the public that he is ready for the job.
It was also clear from our interview that Mr Corbyn does not see overall levels of immigration into the UK as being a problem.
During the referendum campaign, I asked Mr Corbyn if too many people came to live in the UK from other parts of the EU. His answer then was no, and he seemed to stick to that line now, despite the concerns expressed by so many in the Brexit vote.
He said the "crucial" issue was the undercutting of wages, and not the numbers, although he acknowledged that in some parts of the country, voters have concerns about how fast their communities are changing.
Some of his colleagues have suggested that in the wake of the referendum campaign, Labour ought to consider changing its attitude to freedom of movement. But Mr Corbyn seems to have little appetite to tighten up the rules.
