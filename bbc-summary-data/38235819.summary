Between Worlds by Tansy Davies, staged by the English National Opera in 2015, triumphed in the stage works category at the awards ceremony.
The opera explores the feelings of fear, courage and loss experienced by those caught up in the attacks.
Other winners this year included a sound compilation designed to bring a train journey to life.
Sonorama by Claudia Molitor, which was composed to soundtrack the journey between London's St Pancras and Margate, won in the sonic art category.
The piece brings together music, interviews, readings and archival material and reflects what the listener can see from the train window during the journey.
The ceremony, hosted by BBC Radio 3 presenters Sarah Walker and Andrew McGregor, took place at the British Film Institute in London on Tuesday evening.
Alba, an original composition inspired by the writings of Samuel Beckett, netted Rebecca Saunders composer her second British Composer Award.

Shri Sriram took home the wind or brass band award for Just a Vibration - a work which combines Indian melodies with a brass band.
Roderick Williams won the choral award for Ave Verum Corpus Re-Imagined while Freezywater by Leo Chadburn won the chamber ensemble prize.
Alan Davey, controller at BBC Radio 3, said: "This year's unprecedented numbers of first-time winners encompass a broad array of different musical genres and ideas, demonstrating that the UK's contemporary classical music scene is more alive than ever."
