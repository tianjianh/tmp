The English League One club are understood to have offered £100,000 up front, with add-ons which could have taken the deal to £200,000.
But Kilmarnock's board rejected what Charlton have indicated will be their final offer for the 25-year-old, who is in the final year of his contract.
"It is fantastic news for me," said Lee Clark after their loss to Motherwell.
The manager told BBC Scotland: "Josh was honest enough to say he didn't feel right for today's game, and when you have a player of his quality out of the squad, it has a big effect.
"The board has spoken to Josh, who has said that if the club have turned down the offer, he will give everything for as long as he is here.  Whether that is until the end of the August window, or the end of his contract, we will see.
"But I am hoping to have him in the group next week for the Hamilton game."

The Ayrshire club turned down a slightly smaller bid from Oldham for the player earlier in the week.
Magennis, who featured as a substitute in all of Northern Ireland's games at Euro 2016, was Killie's top scorer last season with 13 goals.
