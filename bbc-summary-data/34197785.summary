Labour leadership: Corbyn was urged to pull out of race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Today is the last full day of campaigning in Labour's extraordinary summer leadership contest.

A race that has turned the political rules on their head, we'll know in few days if the actual result does so too.
And here's a reminder of how a Jeremy Corbyn victory might seem almost unintentional. I understand a few weeks ago, one of Mr Corbyn's own senior supporters urged him to consider pulling out of the race.
The left wing's point of making its voice heard by entering a candidate had been proven, they said.
The supporter told Mr Corbyn that he should think about withdrawing because, after all, he's never entered with any intention of winning. The message was, this has gone far enough, time to stop.
The request fell on deaf ears I'm told.
After the success Corbyn's campaign has had in attracting new supporters and crowds around the country, who can blame him for answering that he believed he could win, and go on to become prime Minister? He is not like most politicians, but he is a politician after all.
His team won't confirm that such a conversation took place, but they don't deny it. A spokeswoman said "Jeremy Corbyn is standing to be the next PM. The question is, who will be the Tory candidate?"
This gives an intriguing picture of how despite the hype, even some of his senior supporters have concerns about his mission and its long term impact on Labour's fortunes. As the former Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, who knows Corbyn well, suggested, perhaps the person who is most terrified about Jeremy Corbyn winning is Jeremy Corbyn.
Despite the clamour of the summer, there is not enough reliable data, nor understanding of the implications of the new expanded electorate to predict the result with any confidence.
And in the last couple of weeks the fizz has gone out of the Corbyn campaign and both Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham's teams report support coming their way.
But if Mr Corbyn does win, he may well be haunted by a sense that he didn't really want the job in the first place.
Refreshing to some perhaps, but for the Labour Party itself, a worry to many more.
