They will defend their advantage in the second leg in Mauritius on Tuesday, with the aggregate winner progressing to play in Group B for a place at the Cameroon finals.
Mauritius were dealt an early blow in Friday's first-leg match when Emmanuel Vincent was sent off after only 12 minutes for elbowing Comoros' Ben El Fardou.
And although it took until the second half to make the breakthrough, Comoros capitalised through goals by Youssouf Ben Jaloud, who was put through by Mohamed Mchangama on 69 minutes, and Chaker El Hadhu, who struck eight minutes later.
Morocco, Malawi and reigning champions Cameroon will also play in Group B with the Indomitable Lions qualifying automatically as hosts no matter where they finish in the final standings.
Only the pool winners earn a place at the tournament.
