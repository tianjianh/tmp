Election 2015: Who are the 56 new SNP MPs?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP will have its largest ever tally in the new Parliament, with 56 MPs. But who are the men and women representing the party at Westminster?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new SNP group at Westminster is a mix of hardened party activists and recent recruits. Among the ranks are some who have joined the party with in the last year, as well as experienced councillors and former members of the Scottish parliament at Holyrood. From a 20-year-old student to a former rock star, here's a guide to some of them.
Tommy Sheppard
The new MP for Edinburgh East is an ex-Labour councillor and former deputy general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party. For years, he has run the Stand Comedy Club, which plays hosts to some of the top names in British comedy. In that job, he has played a key role in Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Mr Sheppard has been a member of the SNP for a matter of months, joining after the Scottish independence referendum last year. At the time, he told the Edinburgh Evening News that he was not a nationalist, but thought the party best represented Scotland's interests.
John Nicolson
Mr Nicolson beat senior Lib Dem Jo Swinson to take the East Dunbartonshire seat.  He is a former speech writer for a US senator and a former BBC journalist, who reported for Panorama, Newsnight and Watchdog among others. He presented BBC News 24's live coverage of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.
Mr Nicolson has been a member of the SNP since he was 16.
Natalie McGarry
The new MP for Glasgow East comes from a family of SNP activists - her mother is a councillor and her aunt is an MSP. But her partner is Glasgow's sole Conservative councillor.
Ms McGarry was a prominent member of the Women for Independence campaign during the referendum campaign. On Thursday, she defeated Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran to win this seat, where Labour had a massive 11,000 majority last time. It was, however, held briefly by the SNP before, when John Mason won a by-election in 2008.
George Kerevan
The new MP for East Lothian is a prominent Scottish journalist and another former member of the Labour Party. He served as a Labour councillor in Edinburgh for 12 years before switching allegiance to the SNP. He stood for the Nationalists in Edinburgh East in 2010 and was beaten by 9,181 votes, but has managed to turn that deficit around and unseat Labour's Fiona O'Donnell.
Alex Salmond
You might have heard of this man before. Mr Salmond was an MP for 23 years before standing down to focus his attention on the Scottish Parliament. He was leader of the party twice and is Scotland's longest-serving first minister.
Now, he's back at Westminster. But what role will he play in the new SNP team? Angus Robertson was the party's Westminster leader in the last Parliament. Does Mr Salmond want his job?
Mhairi Black
One of the most remarkable upsets of election night, Ms Black beat Labour's election guru and former shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander in Paisley and Renfrewshire South.
Ms Black is a student at Glasgow University and has said she intends to sit her finals despite becoming one of the youngest MPs in recent times, aged just 20. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she studies politics.
Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh
The new MP for Ochil and South Perthshire has not always been an SNP supporter. She was a member of the Conservative Party until 2000, standing for the Scottish Parliament for the Tories in 1999. She left the party over its policy on asylum seekers and joined the SNP in 2000. It later emerged that she had also been a member of the Labour Party in the 1990s and campaigned for former Glasgow Labour MP Mohammad Sarwar.
In 2013, she was made an OBE for services to business and to Scotland's Asian community.
Roger Mullin
Mr Mullin scored another remarkable victory on election night, overturning a Labour majority of 23,000 in what used to be Gordon Brown's seat. Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath was, in 2010, Labour's safest seat in Scotland.
Mr Mullin is an honorary professor at the University of Stirling and a former vice-convenor of the SNP.
Kirsten Oswald
Ms Oswald was responsible for another of the biggest SNP coups on election night - taking Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy's seat in East Renfrewshire. She joined the party last year and was a member of the Women for Independence group that campaigned around the referendum.
She was criticised by some after writing to Conservatives in the constituency asking them to "lend" her their vote.
Ian Blackford
Mr Blackford hasn't always been a favourite of the SNP leadership. In 2000, he was suspended as party treasurer after a motion of no confidence was passed at the SNP conference. He threatened to sue Alex Salmond amid the row.
But now he's back in the fold. On Thursday, he beat former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy in Ross, Skye and Lochaber.
Joanna Cherry
The new MP for Edinburgh South West is an advocate who was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2009. Ms Cherry joined the SNP in 2008 and co-founded the Lawyers for Yes campaign ahead of the independence referendum. She succeeds former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling - who had a 5,447 majority in 2010 - as MP.
Stuart Donaldson
Mr Donaldson, the new MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, comes from a political family. His mother Maureen Watt is minister of public health in the Scottish government. After her son, 23, was selected to contest the seat, she told the Press and Journal newspaper: "I am flabbergasted. Someone who was quite resistant to ever delivering a leaflet for me is now standing for the Westminster parliament."
Drew Hendry
Mr Hendry - the leader of Highland council - beat former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. He has previously told the Ross-shire Journal it was the 1979 devolution referendum in Scotland that sparked his political awakening - when he was just 13 or 14.
Pete Wishart
Mr Wishart has represented Perth and North Perthshire since 2005, and was MP for North Tayside before constituency borders were redrawn. As well as being a prolific tweeter, he was a member of the bands Runrig - of Loch Lomond fame - and Big Country.
Until 1998, he was a member of the Labour Party.
Anne McLaughlin
Winning Glasgow North East is another major scalp for the SNP. In 2010, Labour had a massive majority of 15,942. Willie Bain, the former MP, took almost 70% of the vote last time. Ms McLaughlin was an MSP between 2009 and 2011, having taken one of the SNP's regional list places after the death of Bashir Ahmad.
