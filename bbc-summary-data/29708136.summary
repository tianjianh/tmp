Tinder's making changes but would you 'beg' for them?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One Newsbeat listener told us that Tinder "is the finest app that the technological world has to offer".

But would you be willing to pay for it if it had added features?
The dating app's co-founder and CEO Sean Rad has told Forbes magazine: "We are adding features users have been begging us for.
"They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them." Only thing is - he hasn't actually said what the changes will be.
Tinder is reportedly launching the paid-for "premium" service next month, without shutting down the original free app.
The app doesn't currently include adverts or subscription fees, which has helped boost its popularity, with more than 15 million matches being made every day.
But the introduction of a premium feature is a sign of Tinder trying to monetise.
Mr Rad told Forbes that the app had to build a significant amount of users before asking for money.
"Revenue has always been on the road map," he said. "We had to get our product and growth right first."
According to Rad, users swipe through 1.2 billion profiles every day.
Although no details were provided on the new features, including how much they will cost, it's thought they could include extended location settings that would allow people to go beyond the limits set by the free version of the app.
Tinder currently lets users see profiles of other people within a selected distance based on their preferences.
It isn't the first dating app to start charging users though.
Grindr, designed for gay, bi-sexual and curious males offers a premium service called Grindr Xtra.
Whereas free members can only view 100 profiles in their area, those using the paid version benefit from a push notification, even if the app is closed, which lets you see who's online, lets you view up to 300 profiles and removes banner ads which appear in the free version.
Also, sites like Match.com have been charging users for ages - so there's nothing new there.
Someone else on the Newsbeat Facebook wrote: "(Tinder is a) Fun app to pass the time but definitely wouldn't pay for it."
But another post added: "It doesn't need extra features but I would pay for them nevertheless."
Though it's worth mentioning that the premium features won't be compulsory, there are alternatives if the Tinder price tag puts you off.
Meet Moi, which works in a similar way to Tinder with a chat screen launching when you find a match, and Badoo which includes a "yes/no" format are both free on iPhone and Android.
OkCupid and MeetMe are among the other free dating apps.
