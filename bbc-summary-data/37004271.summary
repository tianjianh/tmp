The Ballymena boxer, who is seeded eighth, had a unanimous first round win on a 29-28, 30-26, 30-27 score card.
The 27-year-old will face Tuvshinbat Byamba of Mongolia, who is a two-time Olympian, in the last 16 on Thursday 11 August (16:45 BST).
Donnelly needs two more victories to guarantee at least a bronze medal.

After easing his way into the opening round, Donnelly looked comfortable with quick combinations and landed several punches on his Algerian opponent, all three judges scoring it 10-9 in favour of the Ballymena fighter.
His growing dominance was reflected in a second round card of 10-9, 10-9, 10-8.
Donnelly continued to pick off his opponent and eased through the third round in a comfortable start to his Olympic campaign.
Also on Sunday, Donnelly's Irish team-mate David Oliver Joyce progressed to the last 16 in the lightweight division as he earned a unanimous decision over Andrique Allisop of the Seychelles.
Joyce will face a tough next bout against Azerbaijan's number two seed Albert Selimov.
Selimov won a silver medal in the division at last year's World Championships and clinched gold in the inaugural European Games 14 months ago.
