[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old had been linked with Scottish Premiership rivals Motherwell after playing second fiddle to Zander Clark for much of the season.
But he regained his place in mid-March and will continue to fight for the number one jersey.
The former Linfield player has made 202 appearances for Saints since joining from Shamrock Rovers in 2011.
Mannus made only 18 appearances, having lost his place in August.
