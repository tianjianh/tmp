[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tobias Gordon, 32, was one of two men hurt in the blast, which destroyed the ground floor home in Aldersmead Road.
Mr Gordon and a 27-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life, police said.
Detectives previously said they were investigating illegal drug production as a possible cause.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the exact cause of Mr Gordon's death, police said.
The younger man remains in a "serious but stable condition" in hospital.
Det Insp Justin Spanner, of West Midlands Police, said the cause of the 23 November explosion had yet to be established.
The property, in West Heath, has been slated for demolition.
