[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New York Giants kicker Josh Brown has admitted physically abusing his ex-wife and described himself as a "repulsive man", in documents released by police.

The journal entries were seized when police investigated allegations of domestic violence in 2015.
No charges were brought at the time but a separate NFL investigation led to a one-game ban for Brown, 37.
The NFL says it will reopen that investigation following the release of the documents.
"It is unfortunate that we did not have the benefit or knowledge of these materials at the time," it said in a statement.
"In light of the release of these documents, we will thoroughly review the additional information and determine next steps in the context of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy."
Brown's side were flying to London on Thursday before this weekend's game against the Los Angeles Rams at Twickenham. However, the Giants said Brown would not be travelling with the group.
The documents were originally given to police by Brown's ex-wife Molly following his arrest last year. She accused him of more than 20 instances of domestic violence.
In one of the documents, Brown wrote: "I have physically, mentally, emotionally and verbally been a repulsive man. I have abused my wife."
Brown is one of the NFL's top kickers and scored a career-high 134 points last season.
