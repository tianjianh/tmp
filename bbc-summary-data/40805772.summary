Southend United: Amadou Ba signs two-year contract, as Theo Robinson extends stay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One club Southend United have signed Amadou Ba on a two-year-deal, while fellow forward Theo Robinson has extended his stay by a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robinson, 28, arrived from Lincoln on a two-and-a-half year deal in January and has scored twice in 18 games in what is his second spell at the club.
Nineteen-year-old Ba joins after a successful trial at Roots Hall.
Southend manager Phil Brown told BBC Essex: "He's someone we've decided to take a bit of a punt on.
"He's had a couple of seasons at Le Havre, so we're just basing it on what we've seen in training and friendlies."
