Oxfordshire councils trade blows over unitary study

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review into the proposed abolition of a county council has led to a war of words between council leaders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
District councils have told Oxfordshire County Council to "get on board" with a study into proposals to create "four unitary bodies".
The districts around Oxfordshire have proposed scrapping the county council.
But the county council has accused them of "putting headlines over joint working".
Leader of the Vale of White Horse district council, Matt Barber, said: "Everyone knows the county council is having extreme budget difficulties, leading to cuts in services people value. Two-tier local government is broken in our view and we want to look at all the options for unitary councils.
He added the county council should "get on board" with the work being done by district councils and not "waste the public's money duplicating the study".
Oxfordshire County Council leader Ian Hudspeth said: "Once again the districts are putting headlines ahead of joint working.
"We have written to the districts twice asking them to discuss terms of reference for a joint study, with the public also given a chance to comment.
"They made it clear they weren't prepared to do that."
The four proposed unitary bodies - which would include district councils from Northamptonshire and the Cotswolds -  would work in partnership with the NHS and Local Enterprise Group.
According to district council leaders, abolishing Oxfordshire County Council would save the taxpayer money.
County council leaders have said the four unitary body proposal has ruled out the benefits of having a single unitary council in Oxfordshire.
