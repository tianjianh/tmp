There are 65,000 unemployed, 25,000 fewer than a year earlier.
The unemployment rate in Wales is 4.3% for the latest quarter, according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.
This compares to 4.6% for March to May. It is still lower than for the whole of UK, which remains at 4.9%.
Only the south-west,  south-east and east of England have lower unemployment rates than Wales.
The unemployment rate is also down 1.7% on a year ago.
There are now 38,000 more people employed in Wales than in June to August 2015.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: "These figures are the latest glimpse of the jobs market in Wales post-EU referendum vote and they suggest the Welsh economy continues to power ahead.
"Welsh businesses and entrepreneurs are clearly getting on with what they do best - creating jobs and selling their expertise across the world.
"The record employment rate in Wales is testament to our outstanding companies buoyed by the long-term effects of welfare reform which means it pays to be in work."
First Minister Carwyn Jones said the decline in unemployment in Wales continued to outperform the rest of the UK.
"We have big ambitions for Wales and its economy and will continue to work hard to support business and ensure the economic conditions to create and safeguard sustainable jobs and training in Wales," he said.
