Masters 2017: I didn't play well enough - McIlroy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory McIlroy admits he underperformed after finishing tied for seventh at the Masters to miss out on completing a career Grand Slam.

The world number two from Northern Ireland needs victory in the Masters to become only the sixth player to have won all four major titles.
McIlroy's closing 69 came after rounds of 72, 73 and 71.
"It wasn't quite good enough - I gave a decent account for myself and will come back next year and try again," he said.
McIlroy felt he still had a chance of claiming a first green jacket if he could match, or better, his lowest score in the Masters, a 65 in the first round having seemingly set himself on course for victory in 2011.
However, after making a birdie on the par-five second, he three-putted the fourth from 95 feet and had to scramble to save par on the next two holes.
Birdies on the eighth, 13th and 16th ensured McIlroy broke 70 for the first time this week and he refused to blame a limited schedule this year, caused by a rib injury, for his performance.
McIlroy finished on three under and six shots behind winner Sergio Garcia.

"It wasn't quite as adventurous as previous Masters have been for me," added McIlroy.
"I didn't get too high with some really low nine-hole scores, but I didn't shoot any nine-hole scores that were in the 40s. It was quite a consistent, steady Masters for me.
"I felt like I had an opportunity on Saturday to shoot something in the mid to high 60s which would have got me closer to the lead and I didn't quite do that."
McIlroy is the only player to have finished in the top 10 in each of the last four Masters.
