Kanye West was not asked to perform at Donald Trump's inauguration, which will be a "traditionally American" event, the chief organiser has said.

There has been speculation since the star told a concert crowd he would have voted for Mr Trump - if he had voted - and then turned up at Trump Tower.
But Tom Barrack, the Presidential Inaugural Committee chair, told CNN the ceremony is "not the venue" for West.
He said the rapper is "a great guy" but "we haven't asked him".
Mr Barrack said: "He considers himself a friend of the president-elect, but it's not the venue.
"The venue we have for entertainment is filled out, it's perfect, it's going to be typically and traditionally American, and Kanye is a great guy but we just haven't asked him to perform. We move on with our agenda."
