Brentford 1-2 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak made a string of fine saves to help Birmingham edge out Brentford at Griffin Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clayton Donaldson put the Blues ahead, converting the penalty he won when fouled by goalkeeper Daniel Bentley.
Ryan Shotton blocked Lasse Vibe's shot on the line, before Kuszczak denied Vibe, Maxime Colin and Scott Hogan.
Shotton smashed home Donaldson's flick on before Hogan's deft header reduced the arrears, but the striker then had a late effort ruled out for offside.
Brentford are now without a win in four at home, but had plenty of chances to get something from the game.
Colin's shot just after half-time was parried by Kuszczak, who quickly recovered to save from Hogan, and moments later Birmingham doubled their advantage.
But his most impressive save came when Hogan's downward header bounced up and looked destined for the net, only for the former Manchester United goalkeeper to push the ball onto the bar.
Gary Rowett's side stay fourth in the table after back-to-back wins, and picked up a much-needed first away victory in six attempts.
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"If it was a boxing match it would have been stopped, but football matches in the Championship change on small moments and we were a little loose once or twice and got punished for it.
"It was just one of those games where we didn't take our chances. It's when you don't create them that you need to worry.
"This is a team that are in the top five and we have dominated them. We passed well and created chances so it's very hard to go into the changing room after that."
Birmingham boss Gary Rowett:
"We rode our luck and if luck was a horse I have won the Grand National today.
"We've defended last-ditch and part of that was because we were sloppy and didn't get close enough to them at times, but we've scored two good goals and then had to hang on and be gritty and tough.
"We are not an easy side to beat, but we work incredibly hard and we want to keep improving because if we play like we did today we will struggle to stay in fourth."
