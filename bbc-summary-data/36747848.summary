A brick was reportedly thrown through the window of the Village Shop, in Magdalen Street, and a small fire started in the early hours of Friday.
Police said they were keeping "an open mind" after suggestions it could have been racially motivated.
A crowdfunding appeal on the JustGiving website has so far raised £28,509.
Officers were called to the shop, which sells "Eastern European and British products", at about 03:00 BST.
They said two people who were inside a flat attached to the shop at the time were unharmed, but that stock had been damaged and a window broken.
Maria Burgea, who works in the shop and was sleeping in the flat when the fire started, told the BBC via a translator she was "really, really scared".
The fundraising appeal was launched by Helen Linehan, who posted on the website: "While protesters rallied against Brexit in Norwich last night, an Eastern European food store was petrol-bombed.
"The owner was asleep upstairs with her daughter. She has no insurance. She could do with an act of kindness from her neighbours. Please donate. A small token will go a long way."
Det Insp Chris Burgess said: "We are aware of suggestions this may have been a racially motivated incident and whilst there is currently no information to suggest this to be the case we will of course keep an open mind."
