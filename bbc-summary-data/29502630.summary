All four forces in Wales have launched a two-week campaign which will run until 19 October and involve Go Safe safety camera vans.
Drivers caught using their mobile phones will face three points on their licence.
Between January and July this year North Wales Police fined 1,069 drivers for the offence.
"This campaign is just one part of our ongoing effort to target and reduce the number of drivers who risk becoming involved in a serious or fatal collision due to using a mobile phone whilst driving," said Ch Insp Darren Wareing of North Wales Police.
"With the increased use of smart phones we are also seeing drivers being distracted whilst accessing their apps, reading their emails or accessing the internet."
Chairwoman of Road Safety Wales Susan Storch added: "Driving a vehicle requires us to multi-task, so anything above and beyond that needs to wait until we are safely parked up or until our journey has finished."
During the same campaign in 2013, more than a 1,000 drivers were caught using their mobile phones while driving.
Case study: Driver jailed for killing cyclist
In August, Andrzej Wojcicki was jailed for five years for killing cyclist Owain Richard James, 30.
The 45-year-old minibus driver from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, was "distracted" while he looked at pictures of vintage sports cars on his mobile phone - while he drove at 50 mph.
Wojcicki ploughed his two and a half tonne minibus into Mr James, who was thrown into the air, hit the bonnet and windscreen before falling into the road on the A472 near Newbridge.
He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.
At Cardiff Crown Court Judge David Wyn Morgan told him: "Mr James didn't stand a chance."
