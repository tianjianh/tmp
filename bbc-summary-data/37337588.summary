The Archers: How could the press report Helen's trial?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For Borsetshire's journalists, Helen Titchener's trial would have been one of the biggest stories in recent years. But they would have broken the law if they had reported the biggest revelations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The editor of the Borchester Echo will no doubt have had an emotional week.
It started so well.
Ambridge's trial of the century was bound to be the paper's splash, replacing reports of proposed bypasses or village fetes - not to mention the miracle dog reappearing months after vanishing in floods.
Punters would be queuing at newsagents around the county eager to read the latest on the woman who stabbed her husband, the Echo's website would be preparing for a cavalcade of clicks.
I dare say they even had a reporter live-tweeting the case direct from the courtroom's press bench.
But then Helen Titchener, accused of attempting to murder Rob, took to the stand and, to the astonishment of even her own barrister, told how he had raped her multiple times.
In half a dozen words, she turned a guaranteed most-read into a legal minefield.
A person is granted automatic lifetime anonymity the moment they claim to have been a victim of a sexual offence - be it the unwitting witness of a flasher or, like Helen, a victim of multiple violations.
From that point on, she could not be identified in any reports of the trial that also included her rape claims.
Lifelong anonymity is granted to the victim automatically as soon as an allegation has been made.
This is enshrined in section one of the 1992 Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act and is taught to all journalism students.
Identifying the victim of a sexual offence is a criminal offence which is investigated by the police and prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service with the consent of the attorney general.
Both the paper's publisher and the editor can be prosecuted with maximum fines of up to Â£5,000.
And it applies to everyone else as well, members of the public can and have been prosecuted for publishing restricted details, for example on social media.
If someone falsely claims to be the victim of a sexual offence and is subsequently prosecuted for wasting police time or perjury, then their identity can be reported.
The press had several options.
The only way her identity could be used would be if she waived that right (preferably in writing) or, in truly exceptional cases, if the media successfully applied to the court for her anonymity to be lifted.
They could argue that the automatic restriction makes it impossible to report the case, that it is "substantial and unreasonable" and not in the public interest.
But they would be highly unlikely to succeed, reckons Carole Watson, a former Daily Mirror journalist and now senior lecturer in media law at Sunderland University.
"They could argue that her name is already out there, the genie is effectively out of the bottle, but I think the judge would probably err on the side of caution and would not lift the anonymity," she said.
"It's one of the most important rules in court that victims of sexual offences deserve anonymity, it would have to be truly exceptional for him to deviate from that.
"I was a court reporter for many years, thankfully I never came across a case of this happening during a trial."
So, having reported the initial stabbing, subsequent arrest and charging, first appearances at magistrate and crown courts and finally the first few days of the trial itself, the Echo and Borsetshire's other media outlets could now no longer identify the defendant if they wanted to report the rape claim.
And they almost certainly could not call Rob a rapist, as to do so would surely identify Helen (and if you're thinking they could not call him a rapist anyway because it would be defamatory, you're right, it would be, but the press have absolute privilege for court cases which means they can report anything said in a hearing - subject to other reporting restrictions - without fear of being sued).
Could he be prosecuted for abusing Helen?
Yes.
"We would and do investigate historic allegations which are brought to our attention," said a spokesman for Durham Police. "In the past this has been as a result of a disclosure from a victim, witness or, in some cases, by a judge themselves.
"If there was sufficient evidence to pass the prosecution code test then the file would be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service who would review the case and provide a charging decision based on evidential and public interest criteria."
Could he lose his new job?
In the days before his wife's trial, Rob was appointed estate manager by Justin Elliott.
Could he be sacked even though he has not actually been found guilty of doing anything wrong? Surely he could sue for unfair dismissal?
"No Rob couldn't," said a spokesman for Acas, the service which aims to resolve employment disputes.
"He doesn't have any rights to claim unfair dismissal about anything until he completes two years' service. The employer could terminate Rob's employment and Rob could not take any action against that."
The ball's in your court Justin.
The press could decide to report the rape claims but not identify Helen, but they would still be at huge risk of being prosecuted thanks to a process known as jigsaw identification.
Readers of the previous day's coverage would know the names of all those involved, it would not take a great feat of deduction to link the new anonymised copy with the old, Helen's identity would still be blindingly obvious.
Even if they went through all their old online articles and removed identifying features, the trial is so fresh in everybody's mind that it would be unlikely to hold much sway with a judge were the paper to be prosecuted.
"Of course, another option would be to just not report any of the rape allegations," said Ms Watson, "but how practical is that given the importance of that claim to Helen's defence?"
Not reporting the rape aspect would be the lesser of two evils though, no matter how much it might stick in the craw.
And judging by the headlines read out in the next episode, that would appear to be the approach the Echo and others took.
"Husband's cruel jibes led to stabbing horror," declared one paper. "Serial abuser posed as Mr Nice Guy," shouted another.
Which should be fine, the Echo's editor will hopefully have sought legal advice and he can breathe easily knowing a disaster has been averted.
But wait, it hasn't.
During the trial, Rob's father Bruce was rather venomous about the Echo.
"Six months ago they were still calling (Rob) a hero," he ranted, "now they decided to brand him a rapist".
Oh dear - this suggests the paper had reported the allegations made by Helen in court.
And it's not the only thing the Echo has to worry about.
In this article, published while the trial was still taking place, the paper quoted Bruce calling Helen "deranged", which could be construed as contempt of court.
Were the jury to see his comments (which were made outside of the trial), it may prejudice their thoughts thereby not giving Helen the fair trial she is entitled to under law.
The Echo's editor might well have a court date of his own soon enough.
