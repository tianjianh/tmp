The 20-year-old, who has three caps, spent five years at Fulham before leaving for the Cherries in the summer on a four-year contract.
He made his first Bournemouth start in Saturday's FA Cup defeat at Millwall.
Rangers are also in talks with Arsenal over the loan signing of attacking midfielder Jon Toral, who is currently on loan with Grenada in Spain.
"I think the two clubs have similar styles which makes it an easy transition and all the boys have helped me out on my first day," Hyndman told Rangers TV.
"The philosophy here is the same as Bournemouth in the way that they like to press but when they have the ball they like to keep it in attack.
"In that way it is very similar which will hopefully make my transition a lot easier.
"There were a lot of reasons I wanted to sign for Rangers, it is a massive club, they are fighting for Europe and there are good players here.
"I think it is a good opportunity for me to play in, not just a good environment, but in front of 50,000 fans at home which is absolutely unbelievable."
Meanwhile, talks are on-going with Arsenal over Spaniard Toral, 21, who has only featured six times for Granada this season and was an unused substitute in their 5-0 defeat away to Real Madrid on Saturday.
Toral played under Rangers boss Mark Warburton in 2014-15 when he was in charge at Brentford, and spent last season on loan at Birmingham.
