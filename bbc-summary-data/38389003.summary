Australia's Prime Minister has written to the mother of a stabbed backpacker promising to look into her concerns about the safety of travellers.

Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, was killed at a workers' hostel in Home Hill, near Townsville, in Queensland in August.
Mother Rosie Ayliffe, from Derbyshire, called for Australian farm work to be regulated, saying an "aggressive atmosphere" contributed to Mia's death.
In his letter, Malcolm Turnbull pledged $20m to tackle staff exploitation.
Ms Ayliffe-Chung was doing unpaid work to earn a visa that would allow her to stay longer in the country.
Mrs Ayliffe said her daughter talked about the farm where she worked as if it was a "prison camp" and said "there was a tone of anxiety in her messages".
On 23 August, she was stabbed to death at the farm's hostel and another backpacker Thomas Jackson, who was also stabbed, died in hospital.
Smail Ayad, 29, a French national, has been charged with Ms Ayliffe-Chung's murder and that of Mr Jackson.
Following her daughter's death Mrs Ayliffe started a campaign and petition calling on the Australian government to introduce basic standards and a duty of care in the industry.
Mr Turnbull wrote back and said as well as extra funding for the Fair Work Ombudsman, "higher penalties" would be introduced for those who exploited migrant workers.
He also expressed his sympathy for her loss and thanked Mrs Ayliffe for her interest in protecting young backpackers.
Mrs Ayliffe said: "If you're up all night and all day suffering the grief I'm suffering, then it's good to have something to work on.
"It's a vindication because evidently Malcolm Turnbull recognises there's an issue in his country, so it's huge.
"It's nice to feel we might be making a difference out there."
