The top seeds beat second seeds Jiske Griffioen and Aniek van Koot 6-2 6-2 in one hour and nine minutes on court 17.
The defending champions were 2-0 down in the second set, but fought back to win six straight games and secure a comfortable victory.
Whiley had lost to Koot in the women's singles semi-final earlier this week.
The 24-year-old became the second Briton to win a title at SW19 on Sunday, following Gordon Reid's victory in the men's wheelchair singles.
