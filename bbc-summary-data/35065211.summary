A group of lightsaber enthusiasts have been learning to master the Jedi weapon's use in the run up to the release of the latest Star Wars movie.

Known as LudoSport, it has gained popularity in the UK since being created in Italy.
While described as a "playful fun sport" instructor Jordan Court wants it to become an Olympic sport.
He said while it did not have the strict regime of martial arts, students needed to be respectful to each other.
"I would love to think one day people competing in the Olympics with light saber combat once the number of participants have increased," Mr Court said.
"We've opened classes in Cheltenham, Bristol and London - with Birmingham and Cardiff not far behind - and there are plans for Swindon and up north as well.
"You don't need to use a lot of force as all the strikes are light which means we don't have to wear Kevlar armour or body padding."
There are several ranks for those wishing to become a fully-fledged Jedi Knight:
Children aged 8-12 are "apprentices", and those aged 13 or over are "younglings"
Younglings start with a blue blade but those who achieve stage three of the sport become a Jedi and may choose the colour of their lightsaber
Students can choose to be either a Jedi Knight or a Sith
There are seven different fighting styles
Combat encounters take place in a rectangular or circular arena
Opponents aim for non-mortal (the hilt of the lightsaber, forearms and legs below the knee) and mortal (the rest of the body) targets
If a contender puts a single foot totally out of the arena he or she loses the match
