[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 2-3 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jason Kennedy snatched victory for Carlisle as Keith Curle's side secured a thrilling win at Notts County and maintained their promotion push in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlie Wyke headed the visitors in front from close range after the home side failed to deal with a Nicky Adams corner.
Michael Raynes went close to adding a second, but Notts levelled on the half-hour mark when Jon Stead produced a brilliant header from Michael O'Connor's free-kick.
Notts then made it 2-1 when Jonathan Forte dispossessed a Shaun Brisley before firing beyond Mark Gillespie via the inside of the post six minutes before the break.
But in an entertaining first half, Carlisle equalised when Adams was afforded too much space on the left and his cross was headed in emphatically by an unchallenged Jabo Ibehre.
Both sides went in search of a decisive third goal and it was Carlisle who almost made the breakthrough when Ibehre forced a stunning save from Scott Loach.
Notts had their moments too and Rob Milsom should have done better when he was unmarked at the back post, but he tamely volleyed into the ground and into the arms of Gillespie.
It was then left to Kennedy to snatch the decisive goal when he flicked in Tom Miller's long throw to leave Notts County one place and one point above the relegation places.
