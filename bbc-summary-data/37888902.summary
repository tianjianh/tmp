Jamie Roberts: Wales centre says Australia loss was 'kick up the backside'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales centre Jamie Roberts admits the scale of their defeat by Australia was a "kick up the backside" ahead of their Test against Argentina on Saturday.

Roberts was at Twickenham in October for the Pumas' 33-21 loss to Australia.
"They'll play from their own half and they have big carriers, a physical side" he told BBC Wales Sport.
"Argentina will pose a similar threat [to Australia], with speed out wide. If we allow them speed of ball and space, it'll be another tough day."
"What we didn't do [against Australia], we have to do next week and that's meet them [on the gain-line] and stop their momentum" he added.
Argentina were 43-20 winners over Ireland in the 2015 World Cup on their last visit to Cardiff, and face Wales off the back of a 54-20 victory over Japan in Tokyo.
Wales should have Jonathan Davies available for selection in the second Autumn series game on Saturday, 12 November after a tight hamstring saw the centre pull out of the Wallabies encounter.
Full-back Liam Williams should also be fit again, flanker Sam Warburton played 80 minutes on his return for Cardiff Blues in Treviso, and lock Alun Wyn Jones is likely to be available after his family bereavement.
Improving Pumas
Roberts was one of only two Wales players to feature in a victory over Australia, back in 2008, but could not add another victory against the Wallabies on his 84th appearance for Wales.
"It's certainly a kick up the backside, we go into training and we have to address the issues. We've got to learn from it, I think the main thing to learn is to slow their speed of the ball. Argentina are a formidable outfit this year, I think they've improved a lot in these last few years" he said.
Roberts, who was partnered by Scott Williams after the late withdrawal of Jonathan Davies with a tight hamstring, says the scoreline has to galvanise the Welsh squad.
"It has to, but a lot of us have been there before. It was a bad day at the office but the guys will dust themselves off quickly and go again."
Moriarty bonus
One of the few positive points for Wales from the Australia match was the form of Ross Moriarty, with the Gloucester back-rower impressing in the number eight shirt. He was playing his first international  in the position in the absence of Taulupe Faletau.
"Personally I enjoyed the game, I felt comfortable at eight. Everyone's been saying how I'd never played at eight before but it didn't faze me.
"It's not too different [from flanker], my game's based round carrying and tackling and that's what I did. I just had to control the ball a bit more at the scrum and I felt comfortable. I'm just doing all I can to keep the coaches questioning who they pick."
