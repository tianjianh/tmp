[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fiona Brown was Scotland's creative force as they eased to a win over Romania in a Falkirk Stadium friendly.

Only two minutes had passed when Lisa Evans headed the hosts in front from a Brown cross.
They started the second half just as quick; Jane Ross directing another Brown cross beyond the goalkeeper.
In a slick performance from Anna Signeul's side, they could have had more goals as they stepped up their preparations for Euro 2017.
They face a tougher test on Tuesday, when they travel to Sweden, the world's sixth-best team in the world rankings, before the squad is then announced for the finals in Netherlands.
Scotland were keen to impose themselves on visitors who are 15 places below the 21st-placed hosts in the rankings.
Ross shrugged off her marker and laid it off to Leanne Crichton in the box, but her shot lacked power.
But, a minute later, Scotland were ahead when Evans met Brown's floating cross at the back post and nodded in.
Vaila Bardsley headed over then Caroline Weir had a free-kick pushed wide as Scotland continued their assault on the Romanian goal.
The movement and passing was electric and, in 21 minutes, the defence was opened up for Brown to burst through from the left, but she lifted her shot over.
As good as they were going forward, Scotland's frailties at the back were shown when Florentina Olar was able to easily pick out Cosmina Dusa, who should have done better with her header from close range.
Romania started the second half with 10 players, Laura Rus not yet ready to come on, but while they waited for a break in play, they were punished as Scotland made the extra player count to grab a second.
Brown picked out Ross and, although goalkeeper Andreea Paraluta got a touch to her header, she could not keep it out.
Romania were proving to be more stubborn as the game went on and Rus could have pulled one back when she rounded goalkeeper Gemma Fay, but Joelle Murray got back to clear.
Scotland were still creating chances. Brown cut inside and shot over, Lana Clelland and Bardsley both headed over and Erin Cuthbert's stab at goal was pushed wide by Paraluta.
Bardsley threatened again at a free-kick, being denied at the back post, then showed her worth at the other end when she cut-out Mara Batea's goalbound effort.
Scotland head coach Anna Signeul: "I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We defended well, we played as a team, everyone did really well from Gemma Fay to Jane Ross. I'm delighted with how we defended together.
"A lot of players were very good, but I was very pleased for Vaila Bardsley as that was her second game.
"Against Belgium, we didn't perform very well, but now she showed how good she can play."
