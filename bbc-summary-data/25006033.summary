[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has been jailed for 15 months after being found guilty of carrying out attacks against his family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Lever, 43, strangled Caroline Lever at hospital accommodation at Law Hospital, Carluke, while she was pregnant between 1997 and July 1998.
He was also convicted of attacking her son between July 2001 and March 2004 and his 16-year-old daughter between January 2008 and January 2010.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard the General Medical Council had been informed.
Mrs Lever, 42, told the court Lever moved in to the flat she shared with her son, Patrick George, at Dowanhill Street, Glasgow, within months of them becoming a couple.
She recalled the time when he attacked her after they moved to hospital accommodation at Law Hospital.
The witness confirmed Lever knew she was pregnant and she had no memory of how the incident began.
Mrs Lever told the jury: "He strangled me over a table."
In his evidence Mr George described how he recalled Lever strangling his mother.
He told the court: "I was scared that he was going to kill her."
The court also heard of an incident when Lever held a knife to his own throat during an argument with his wife and threatened to kill himself.
The incident, which took place at Sydenham Road, Glasgow, was also seen by Mr George and his mother, who were said to be scared.
The court heard that when the family lived in Denholm in the Scottish borders, Lever slapped Mr George on the side of the face for taking one of his university books with him to school.
Sophie Lever, 16, also gave evidence against her father and told how she was hit by a can of beer after an argument.
She told the jury that the family were living in Marchmont Terrace, Glasgow, when the assault happened.
Lever, from Nether Auchendrane, Ayr, denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
