The Scot, who had not raced since winning gold at London 2012, partnered Vicky Thornley to third in the double sculls behind Poland and Lithuania.
"We really are a work in progess, but to get on the podium is a start," the 39-year-old told BBC Sport.
Britain won two silvers and a second bronze to claim 10 medals in Poland.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning set a new European record with a convincing win in the women's pairs in Poznan.
Glover retained the title she won with Polly Swann last year, setting a new mark of six minutes 58.280 seconds alongside fellow Olympic and world champion Stanning.

"It's good to keep them tallying them up and keep it exciting, but we don't go flat out on the start line thinking the aim of the day is to break records," Glover said.
"Our aim each day is to win the race and we never take that for granted."
Kat Copeland added European lightweight double sculls gold to her Olympic title as the 24-year-old and new partner Charlotte Taylor outpaced the German challenge by almost five seconds.
Pete Chambers and Joel Cassells took gold in the men's lightweight pair, edging out France on the line, while James Foad and Matthew Langridge also held off a French challenge to win gold in the men's pair.
Imogen Walsh won the lightweight single scull, while Nathaniel O'Donnell, Alan Sinclair, Tom Ransley and Scott Durant outpaced Greece and Belarus to win gold in the men's four.
Matthew Gortel, Stewart Innes, Pete Reed, Paul Bennett, Mohamed Sbihi, Alex Gregory, George Nash, Will Satch and cox Phelan Hill held off a strong challenge from Russia to take silver in the men's eight, a length behind the winning German crew.
Richard Chambers and Will Fletcher won silver in the lightweight double skull, finishing almost three seconds behind the French pair of Stany Delayre and Jeremie Azou.
And there was a bronze medal for the quadruple scull of Graeme Thomas, Sam Townsend, Jack Beaumont and Peter Lambert.
