Wolves have signed Ben Marshall from fellow Championship club Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee.

The midfielder, 25, has agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Molineux.
Marshall, who played under Wolves boss Paul Lambert during the Scot's spell in charge at Ewood Park, scored 15 goals in 140 games for Rovers.
Lambert told BBC WM that signing Marshall was "a huge thing" for the club and added: "He is a terrific offensive player."
After starting his career as a trainee at Stoke, Marshall had a spell with Leicester City before joining Blackburn in 2013.
"He can play in defence as well and anywhere across the front so there is versatility as well," said Lambert.
"He is a really good footballer and will be a welcome addition. He will know with the results that are happening that he will have to fight to get in the team. I think the fans will love him."
Marshall was made unavailable for selection by Rovers boss Owen Coyle earlier in January once Wolves' interest in him was made public.
