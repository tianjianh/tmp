A political row has broken out over remarks made by the Northern Ireland health minister Jim Wells.

Social Media erupted on Thursday night over a video purportedly showing Mr Wells linking child abuse and gay relationships.
It was taken at a hustings for the South Down constituency.
The DUP MLA allegedly suggested that homosexual couples were more likely to be in unstable relationships and children were vulnerable as a result.
Alliance North Down MLA, Stephen Farry, has said that Mr Wells must apologise and retract the remarks he made.
"Alliance will be looking to raise this matter with assembly officials and ask them to investigate whether he has broken any assembly rules," he added.
SDLP MLA Colum Eastwood said Mr Wells must immediately withdraw "these comments and issue a full apology".
He said Mr Wells had gone "far beyond the limits of acceptable behaviour".
Mr Wells said that during a debate in South Down on Thursday evening, he refused to agree with an audience member that "marriage should be redefined".
"I oppose the redefinition of marriage.  Indeed the assembly has voted three times on this matter and every time a cross party selection of MLAs have supported the current definition of marriage," he said.
"At the hustings event, I said that marriage was a stable environment to raise children. I am saddened that some people were trying to misrepresent my comments.
"Where there are non-stable relationships involving children, whether heterosexual or homosexual, the children suffer.  I make no distinction between anyone who neglects a child on the basis of their sexual orientation."
