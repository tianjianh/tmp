[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stabbed husband David Edwards 'wore makeup to hide injuries'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solicitor who was stabbed by his new wife had to use makeup to disguise injuries on his wedding day, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharon Edwards, 42, is charged with murdering David Edwards at their home in Chorley, Lancashire, in August.
Pictures of Mr Edwards showed him with a black eye and burst lip while his face was described as black and blue.
Mrs Edwards told Manchester Crown Court she had been "protective" of Mr Edwards and the stab wound was accidental.
Solicitor Mr Edwards, 51, was found dead in bed with a chest wound two months after the couple married in Las Vegas
Prosecutors said Mrs Edwards' claim her husband had walked into a kitchen knife was "fictional".
Mrs Edwards previously admitted holding the knife that killed him but denies deliberately pushing it into him.
During cross examination, prosecutor Anne Whyte QC challenged Mrs Edwards' version of events.
She said: "It is a wound caused by a knife that has gone 8cm into his chest and you hadn't realised that had happened?"
The defendant said: "I hadn't realised."
Ms Whyte QC suggested to Ms Edwards she was "making it up as you are going along".
She said the defendant fully appreciated "the supreme gravity of what happened".
"You were busy worrying about yourself," she said.
Mrs Edwards replied: "That is not true."
The prosecutor said: "I'm going to suggest you knew perfectly well you needed an explanation of why you were holding the knife at the time of your husband's fatal injury.
"You were thinking of number one."
Ms Whyte suggested Mrs Edwards had told her husband to "rewrite history" and lie about injuries she had inflicted on him.
The court heard he had told a doctor and a nurse that his wife regularly assaulted him.
In a recording of a conversation Mr Edwards had with his wife, he was heard to say "we are going to have to refine the excuse for my eye, you know the garage door that we made up, that doesn't wash".
Mrs Edwards said she had only ever slapped her husband but claimed he had not been frightened of her.
She told the court: "I was a loving wife and I was protective of him."
Ms Edwards denies the murder charge.
The trial continues.
