Scores of bikers have taken part in a "demo ride" calling for rights to ride in Leeds's bus lanes.

Organised by Leeds Motorcycle Action Group (MAG), the ride started from Squires Cafe, near Sherburn in Elmet, and finished at a pub outside Leeds.
The group is campaigning for all motorcycles, scooters and mopeds to be allowed to use the city's bus lanes.
Leeds City Council said it would "fully harness" views during a consultation on its new strategic transport plan.
The event is also billed as an annual celebration of the "freedom and joy" of riding motorcycles.
Richard Manton, of Leeds MAG, said riding in bus lanes could give bikes a "safer area to commute in" and increased bike use could reduce traffic congestion.
He urged the council to see motorcyclists "as part of the solution, not part of the problem".
Organisers said the ride also was to draw the attention to what they claimed was the lack of motorcycles in the West Yorkshire strategic transport plan for the next 20 years.
Councillor James Lewis, of Leeds City Council, said the council's consultation for the plan would "fully harness the thoughts and views" of motorcyclists.
The riders came into the city centre as individual riders rather than a parade marshalled by West Yorkshire Police and the number of riders caused some slight congestion.
