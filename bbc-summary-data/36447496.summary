[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen police officer has driving ban overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police officer who crashed into two cars while running a red light on an emergency call-out has won a court battle to overturn a driving ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natasha Watt, 23, was originally given a 12-month disqualification after she admitted dangerous driving.
She collided with the vehicles after being called out to help colleagues who were under attack in Aberdeen.
The police constable activated the blue lights on 20 November 2014 despite having no emergency response training.
Appeal sheriffs have now quashed the Aberdeen Sheriff Court ban, and given her five penalty points.
Watt, of Kintore in Aberdeenshire, had only passed her test eight months before the crash.
She later resigned from the police service.
