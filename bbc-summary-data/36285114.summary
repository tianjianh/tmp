A baton representing the regiment's history is being taken around the world. It was handed over on the summit by 32 Regiment Royal Artillery.
Newport's 104 Regiment Royal Artillery are responsible for the Welsh leg of the journey.
The two-tonne gun was fired three times at 05:20 BST on Friday.
Cadets from Clwyd and Gwynedd Army Cadet Force took the baton from Snowdon to Blaenau Ffestiniog via the zipwire at Penrhyn Quarry, Bethesda.
The next stage of the journey will see the baton travel via bicycle to St Davids, Pembrokeshire.
The Welsh tour will also take in Brecon, Powys, Pen y Fan and Rhondda Heritage Park before ending with a gun salute in Cardiff on Sunday.
