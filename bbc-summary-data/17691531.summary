[SN]TITLE[SN]
BBC pound-for-pound British rankings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After much deliberation, staff at the BBC Sport website have come up with their top 10 British fighters, pound-for-pound.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ignoring weight, this subjective list takes into account fighters' recent results, their skills, resilience and punching power.
The list will be updated periodically and should be treated as a talking point.
Belfast (24-1, 14KOs)
Frampton became the first Northern Irishman to win a world title in two weight divisions by outpointing Leo Santa Cruz in New York but lost a majority decision in their rematch in Las Vegas at the start of 2017. Does a trilogy beckon?
Sheffield (36-1, 25KOs)
Brook gave a good account of himself against middleweight king Gennady Golovkin before being ground down by his rival in the fifth round. He will not give up his IBF welterweight title and is eyeing potential unification bouts.
London (22-1, 14KOs)
DeGale will fight Sweden's WBC champion Badou Jack in a unification match on 14 January, having fought only once in 2016. DeGale has plenty of options in a brimming 168lb division.
Bolton (31-3, 19KOs)
Khan caused a major surprise when he announced he was jumping two weight divisions to fight Mexico's Saul Alvarez in May. It was a step too far for Khan who is now evaluating his options.
Barry (22-1, 8KOs)
Selby put a scrappy world title defence against Fernando Montiel behind him with a stylish victory over American Eric Hunter. 'The Welsh Mayweather' could now be on a collision course with Carl Frampton.
Watford (17-0, 17 KOs)
Having won the IBF title in two quick rounds against Charles Martin in April, Joshua is now in line for a potential multi-million pound mega-fight with heavyweight great Wladimir Klitschko in 2017.
Doncaster (28-2-1, 13KOs)
The tough Yorkshireman defended his WBA title with a points decision against Venezuela's Liborio Solis in November. A match with fellow WBA title-holder Rau'shee Warren could follow.
Hatfield (23-0, 12 KOs)
Saunders was impressive in dethroning Ireland's WBO champion Andy Lee. He believes he is good enough to take on Gennady Golovkin or Saul Alvarez - but the unheralded Artur Akavov is next in November.
Manchester (31-5-3, 13KOs)
Crolla gave a fine account of himself despite losing the WBA belt to the gifted Jorge Linares. Everyone would like to see him challenge WBO champion and fellow Mancunian Terry Flanagan, but it might never happen because of promotional differences.
Manchester (31-0, 12KOs)
Flanagan next faces tough Cuban Orlando Cruz after defending his WBO title with a points victory over Mzonke Fana in July. A unification match against fellow Mancunian Anthony Crolla is a mouth-watering prospect but might be nixed by politics.
