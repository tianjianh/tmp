Coldplay have donated £10,000 to an "inspiring" quadruple amputee who lost his limbs from a deadly infection.

The band's frontman Chris Martin personally emailed Alex Lewis from Stockbridge, Hampshire, to say he had renewed his "faith in life".
Rosemary Court, who helps manage Mr Lewis's charity trust, said it had been "astonished" to discover the substantial donation from the band.
Ms Court said the generosity had been "such a lift" for Mr Lewis.
Mr Lewis, a father, contracted a streptococcal infection which led to the rare Strep A Toxic Shock Syndrome.
His infected limbs were starting to poison his body and had to be amputated to save his life.
He has since appeared on radio and TV to talk about how he wants to help others less fortunate than him.
The donation to the Alex Lewis Trust had been followed up by an email from a Coldplay employee, who wrote that Martin would like to personally get in touch.
Days later Mr Lewis received an email from the singer.
It said: "I was very moved by your story having read about it recently and wanted to reach out and say how incredible your approach to life is and inspiring.
"It seems like you have been on an amazing journey and handled it with awesome force."
The email ended: "I hope you are doing good and thank you for renewing my faith in life."
Ms Court said: "It was such a lift for Alex to have someone like that be so generous and take the time."
She added the donation may go towards a new pair of stubbies, which are foreshortened leg prostheses and cost about £15,000.
Mr Lewis's trust has also received fundraising support from celebrity chef James Martin and from the Stockbridge community, which turned its village fete into a music festival in aid of the trust.
