Noise pollution: 10,000 complaints received by NI councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blaring music, loud TVs and parties led to the bulk of more than 10,000 noise complaints to district councils last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barking dogs and noise from pubs and clubs also prompted people to call.
Most issues were sorted out by council officials without the need for enforcement.
But one council, Causeway Coast and Glens, did take a prosecution. 508 cases led to councils issuing abatement orders.
The figures are contained in a statistical report published by the Department of Agriculture and Environment.
The report said it is "disappointing" that only Belfast City Council has used powers to fine and in some cases seize equipment from premises making excessive noise between 23:00 and 07:00 GMT.
It also encourages councils to use their powers to designate areas where their staff would have powers to stop ringing alarms.
"This report shows that neighbourhood noise problems can arise from many quarters," the report said.
"The lack of consideration for the rights of others is a contributory factor in many of these problems."
