[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pothole has become so large and deep that ducks have taken to paddling in it.

Clare Skelton photographed a mallard as she was driving along Sedgwick Lane in Horsham, West Sussex.
She said some local potholes were deep enough to go over wellington boot tops and said: "It's almost deep enough for the dog to swim in."
West Sussex County Council said it would be filled in by the end of March.
Ms Skelton said of the ducks: "I think they're flying in, looking for somewhere to nest, and they thought that looked as good a pond as any".
She said the promised repairs came as a huge relief and added: "So many of us are having damage to our cars. Even the locals get caught - the people who know where the potholes are under the water.
"You see this water flooding down the road and you don't know which bit is a really deep, dangerous pothole and some of them are 12 inches (30cm) deep."
In a statement, the council said it was "not ducking this issue".
It said: "This pothole will be filled in before the end of the month. On average we fill in 70 potholes every single working day of the year."
