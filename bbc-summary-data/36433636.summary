[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Boring lessons' teacher removed from register following complaints

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Perthshire teacher whose English lessons were described as "boring" by pupils has been struck off for a catalogue of professional failings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gillian Scott's lessons at Breadalbane Academy led to complaints from parents that their children were not being "pushed, stretched or motivated."
Miss Scott failed to stop "out of control" pupils throwing chairs during one class at the school in Aberfeldy.
The teacher claimed she was the subject of a bullying campaign.
A fitness-to-teach hearing of the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) removed her from the teaching register.
The hearing concluded that Miss Scott failed to maintain the GTCS's standard for full registration between December 2010 and March 2013.
It was told that children in her class had "inappropriate sexual graffiti on their folders" and that her lessons were "repetitive and low-level".
In one class, observed by David Macluskey, the school's principal teacher of English, pupils described the lesson as "boring" and "always the same thing".
Mr Macluskey described in his evidence that he was "horrified" at "how bad" one lesson had been.
The hearing was told her S2 class was "out of control on various occasions and pupils were shouting out, throwing objects and throwing chairs".
Miss Scott did not attend the hearing and was represented by her father,
His position was that his daughter was the victim of a "sustained campaign of bullying and harassment" by her colleagues and Perth and Kinross Council following a complaint made by her and other colleagues.
The panel said Miss Scott was given "enormous" support, including another teacher taking on her classes and mentoring, but that she "would not accept advice from anybody" and that she thought that "certain people were out to get her".
In its summing up, the hearing noted: "It was also a general criticism by the witnesses that there was a lack of reflection on the respondent's part and that she did not recognise the existence of any deficiencies in her practice.
"Certainly, there was no evidence of any attempt by the respondent to remediate the shortcomings in her practice."
"The panel took account of all the matters raised in mitigation, including the respondent's ill-health, her personal life and the difficulties she experienced living and working in Aberfeldy.
"However, none of these explained what appeared to be fundamental attitudinal problems to the basic requirements of a registered teacher."
