A cat has been rescued from under the bonnet of a van after travelling about 60 miles in a space behind the heater matrix.

The unfortunate moggy was found by Darren Sumner when the vehicle broke down in Reading, Berkshire.
Mr Sumner said: "He was warm and scared so I sat and stroked him for about 30 minutes until I coaxed him out."
The RSPCA wants to reunite the cat with his owner, thought to be in Tottenham where the van started its journey.
The cat, nicknamed Sparky, was unscathed by his ordeal on 28 August.
Mr Sumner, who took the cat home overnight, said: "He used a litter tray so I think he's probably someone's pet.
"He woke me up at about 3am in the morning for a play. I hope his owners can be found."
Sparky, who is thought to be about a year old, was taken to the vet for a check up.  He was also scanned to see if he was micro-chipped - which would have revealed details of his owner -  but unfortunately no chip was found.
Helena Peace, from the RSPCA in Reading, said: "He was traumatised but physically unhurt. He's certainly used up one of his nine lives."
