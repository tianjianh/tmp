There are no plans to change the line-up of weather presenters at BBC Wales despite the Met Office losing its contract with the corporation.

BBC Wales meteorologist Derek Brockway is employed by the Met Office but the BBC confirmed on Monday that no changes are planned to its weather coverage.
The Met Office has provided the data used by the BBC since 1922.
The BBC said it was required to secure the best value for money and will tender the contract to competition.
The Met Office said it was disappointed by the decision.
A replacement is expected to take over next year.
Steve Noyes, Met Office operations and customer services director, said: "Nobody knows Britain's weather better and, during our long relationship with the BBC, we've revolutionised weather communication to make it an integral part of British daily life.
"This is disappointing news but we will be working to make sure that vital Met Office advice continues to be a part of BBC output."
A BBC spokesman said: "Our viewers get the highest standard of weather service and that won't change.
"We are legally required to go through an open tender process and take forward the strongest bids to make sure we secure both the best possible service and value for money for the licence fee payer.
"Our graphics are already supplied by another provider and our long-standing relationship with the Met Office will continue as we intend to still broadcast their severe weather warnings."
