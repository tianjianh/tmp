New York's yellow taxi cabs lose their shine

New York's famous yellow cabs have been falling out of favour among locals and tourists, according to new figures.

The average number of trips each day fell 10.63% to 435,459 rides during the 12 months to April, the Taxi and Limousine Commission said.
The rise of taxi app firms like Uber and Lyft are partly to blame, along with more people using the subway to avoid the city's notorious congestion.
Authorities are considering a cap on taxi app rides to ease traffic jams.
Since 2012, the average number of trips daily has fallen 15.5%, with the pace of decline increasing as app firms expand.
In the past four years the number of cars on New York's roads looking for e-fares has jumped from 38,000 to 63,000.
With average driving speeds in the city now recorded at just 8.5 miles per hour, city mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed a freeze on new app-based services for a year.
In Manhattan alone, there are now about 40,000 taxis and other cab services competing.
Uber has said it will launch a car pool service in New York, which it hopes will improve congestion.
Meera Joshi, commissioner for the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), said that even the suggestion of limiting the expansion rate seems to be having an affect.
"One silver lining of a growth limitation mechanism is that it brings about better vehicle utilisation - as even the suggestion of one has just proven - so we expect that Uber will continue to promote more pooled services, as will other apps, and all of New York will benefit," she said.
Despite the fall in the number of yellow cab rides, the money taken by drivers has been increasing since 2012 because of a fares rise.
The 50,000-plus yellow cab drivers are now making a total of about $7m (Â£4.5m) a day in fares, against $6.4m in 2012 - and that does not include cash tips.
