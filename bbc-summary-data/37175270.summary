The 27-year-old, who spent the second half of last season on loan at West Brom, made his first appearance for the club since December 2015 in Tuesday's win.
"My dream is to play at that level, so let's see," the Brazil international told BBC Radio London.
"I feel better and strong. I think I will show I can play at that level."
Sandro made 11 appearances for QPR in the Championship last season before joining the Baggies in January, and he went on to feature 13 times for the Premier League club.
The former Tottenham player insists he is fully fit after reports that a proposed move to Portuguese side Sporting CP this summer was called off because of a knee injury.
"Last season I didn't have a pre-season because of my visa problems," Sandro added.
"This pre-season was very important for me, I feel fit and it was important to me to play 90 minutes.
"I am working very hard and there is more to come because it was my first game."
Rangers boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink said Sandro had "no problem whatsoever" with his knee and accepts he is looking for a move away from Loftus Road.
"I have a good relationship with him," the Dutchman added.
"He is acting very professional but he believes he is a Premier League player. We need to help him get to the Premier League or to the Champions League."
