Day, 31, played for Scarlets and Bath before leaving the Premiership and playing for Japanese side Toyota Verblitz and Super Rugby team Rebels.
The lock has three caps for Wales, featured in the 2015 World Cup and was named in the 2016 Six Nations squad.
"I've gained huge experience from my time in Japan and Super Rugby and I'm returning a better player," said Day.
Day joins Northampton flanker Calum Clark, Waratahs' lock Will Skelton, Toulouse hooker Christopher Tolofua and Scarlets' full-back Liam Williams as Saracens' signings for the 2017-18 season.
"He is precisely the kind of big, dominant lock forward we have been seeking to bolster our squad, and off the field, he is exactly the type of character who we believe will thrive in our culture," said director of rugby Mark McCall.
With two games left to play this season, Saracens, in third place, have already qualified for the Premiership play-offs while victory over Munster has also put them into a third European Champions Cup final in four years.
