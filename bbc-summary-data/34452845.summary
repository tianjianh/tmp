In pictures: Rebuilding lives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An exhibition by photographers working for the aid agency Concern, which offers both short-term and long-term support to those in crisis regions, is on show in London for two weeks. Here we present a selection of the images and the stories behind them.

Earlier this year, devastating floods affected half of Malawi forcing around 250,000 people from their homes. One of the worst affected areas was Nsanje in the south.
Lucia is a widow, and when the floods destroyed her home she turned to relatives for help. But they could not afford to feed her and her three young children so she made her way to Khulubvi - a camp for people displaced from their homes.
"I couldn't take anything but the clothes I was wearing. I have lost three bags of maize, 30 chickens and 10 ducks. We also lost a bicycle. I have nothing now. I am in a tent with seven other families."
There she was able to look after her family and hopes to return home and, with other families, replant the crops that were washed away.
Messy's family climbed on to the roof of their home in Nsanje in a desperate attempt to escape the rapidly rising floodwaters. Rescue boats arrived but could not take everyone, so Messy's husband stayed behind.
A boat returned for him but it capsized and he drowned, leaving Messy's children without a father. The family heard about other people sheltering in schools in Mchere so they travelled there to find refuge.
"Life is miserable here," said Messy. "I am very worried, I don't have anything. My biggest fear is, what next? Where am I going to stay?"
In April, a huge earthquake struck Nepal, flattening villages and, along with the aftershocks, killing an estimated 8,000 people. Hundreds of thousands of houses as well as thousands of classrooms were destroyed. Nearly three million people needed humanitarian assistance.
"My son, all my assets - all of it has been taken by the earthquake. All our work was swept away in one day. We had a good life before the earthquake. I am afraid we won't have any moment of happiness in the future."
When the earthquake hit, Sua was in the hotel she owned in Singati. The building collapsed but Sua managed to break through the rubble.
Her husband also survived but they could not find their son, Ningma. After a desperate night, Ningma's body was discovered.
Niv and Shanti spent years working hard to provide for their family. Before the earthquake, Niv worked locally as an electrician and plumber and Shanti had a successful tailoring business. All this hard work was wiped out by the earthquake that demolished their home and most of their possessions.
"Our work of the last 15 years - all of it was destroyed. My wife's sewing machines were buried. We salvaged some but they are not working properly. I had only one thought in my mind - it took me 15 years to build this life and will take another 15 years to get it back."
In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan tore a path of destruction  across the Philippines and left more than 6,000 people dead. About 14 million were affected, including about five million who saw their homes severely damaged or destroyed.
Typhoon Haiyan destroyed both Roy's home and his livelihood as a squid fisherman, working day and night to support his young family.
Roy initially relied on food and clothes supplied by local authorities before being given a new boat which means he can be independent again.
"Fishing has become easier and earning a living is more comfortable. I can load more traps and fish further out because of my sturdy boat. I can catch more crabs and fish - and since I can sell more seafood, I can look after my family better," said Jonel.
Jonel is a crab fisherman and following the typhoon started work as a carpenter in a local boatyard before obtaining a new boat, allowing him to head to sea once more.
The Ebola outbreak that started in March 2014 quickly became the world's worst, with more than 25,000 cases and at least 10,000 deaths. In Sierra Leone, one of the most severely affected countries, Ebola overwhelmed health systems weakened by previous conflict and instability.
"People fear that you might infect them. One day while I was on duty, one of my friends who lived with me saw me. He told everyone and he told me to pack and leave. They didn't want to live with me because of this job," said Patrick
As a burial worker, he is on the front line in the fight against Ebola and plays a vital role as unsafe burials spread the virus. As well as the emotional difficulties of burying bodies every day, Patrick and his colleagues endured abuse from local people upset by changes to burial rites.
Public awareness campaigns aim to help people to overcome suspicions about the disease and psychosocial support helps those in the teams cope.
When Ebola struck Alpha's village, it killed eight members of his family, including his younger sister, his elder brother, his niece and her newborn son.
Alpha and his extended family had to go into quarantine in the local school.
"No-one could look after the farm when we were in quarantine - everything got bad," said Alpha. "Chickens and goats were stolen. I am back farming now but don't have enough seeds to plant."
Aid agencies are distributing seeds and tools to farmers like Alpha and giving them training and advice in growing more varied, nutritious and productive food crops.
Conflicts in northern Uganda forced millions of people from their homes between 1987 and 2006 but more recently improvements in security have allowed hundreds of thousands to return to their villages to start rebuilding their lives.
However, the area now has to cope with about 180,000 refugees escaping fighting in neighbouring South Sudan.
There are some health centres in operation to treat malnutrition in young children from South Sudan, alongside sanitation services and agricultural training to help some restore their lives.
Nancy has spent her whole life in a refugee settlement in Uganda, after her mother fled to the camp during Sudan's brutal civil war.
In October 2014, Nancy gave birth to her first child, Cathred. The next day, she heard that her husband, who had gone to South Sudan to find work, was dead. Nancy earns a little money from growing spinach and amaranth and tending cattle, but she struggles to support herself and Cathred.
At eight months old, Cathred was severely malnourished but specialist nutritional care helped her recover and avoid long-term health problems.
"You can see the changes. Before my daughter Cathred was put on the feeding programme, she looked very weak. Now, you can see that she's improving," said 20-year-old Nancy.
Debora Adum and her four children made a 350-mile trip on foot to Uganda to escape the civil war in South Sudan. They eventually made it to a refugee settlement near Adjumani, home to more than 5,000 South Sudanese refugees in Uganda. At the end of the journey her youngest child was not well.
"I was so glad not to hear gunshots at night, to be able to sleep in silence once more. I'm very happy because my daughter Nyibol's health has improved - she's much better now." said Debora.
The exhibition opens on 13 October for two weeks at Battle Bridge Place, King's Cross, London N1.
All the pictures were taken by photographers from Panos Pictures.
