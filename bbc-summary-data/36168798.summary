[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Golfers at Dundee's public courses have been banned from bringing their dogs with them after complaints from fellow players and staff.

It follows reports of dog fouling and damage at the Camperdown and Caird Park courses.
Dogs can still be walked across the courses but not if owners are playing a round of the game at the time.
A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee said the rules were changed on 20 April.
He said: "This change reflects the concerns of many players and staff about dog fouling and damage being caused to the courses, particularly greens and bunkers.
"The new management rules, which do not affect the Right to Roam legislation, are clearly signed at the courses and on the Leisure and Culture Dundee website.
"Most golf courses in Scotland do not allow players to bring dogs with them."
