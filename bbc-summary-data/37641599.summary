Chigwell air crash: Pilot in double death crash had heart problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A light aircraft crash in which two people were killed could have happened when the pilot suffered a heart problem, an investigation has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Bull, 40, from Hornchurch, east London, and first officer Francis Simmonds, 46, from Luton, died when their plane came down last October.
Tests showed Mr Bull had a heart problem which may have led to unconsciousness or death.
Investigators said it was the "likely" cause of the crash.
The Beechcraft King Air 200, owned and operated by London Executive Aviation (LEA), had just taken off from Stapleford Airfield, Essex, and was heading for Brize Norton in Oxfordshire when it crashed just before 10:20 BST in a field near Chigwell.

Mr Simmonds had been unable to take over and recover the aircraft in time to avoid the accident on 3 October 2015.
A post-mortem examination of Mr Bull found evidence of an acute dissection of a coronary artery.
The pathologist was unable to say whether the heart condition occurred before or after the crash, but said it could have impaired consciousness or even caused sudden death.
A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said: "If there is no other cause identified for the crash then it is both possible and plausible that this was the precipitating factor."
It concluded "on the balance of probabilities" it was "likely" the pilot lost control of the aircraft due to medical reasons.
