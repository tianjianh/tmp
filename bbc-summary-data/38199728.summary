While being a fan of "Scandi dramas" like Borgen, Theresa May told the Radio Times she'd tune in to Doctor Who and "a nice Agatha Christie".
Earlier in the day, she'll have a drink with friends before helping churches in her Berkshire constituency who provide lunch for elderly people.
The PM also said she enjoys Strictly Come Dancing, but wouldn't take part.
"I always like to see Doctor Who on Christmas night, if possible, and a nice Agatha Christie to curl up with. David Suchet was a great Poirot - he got him to a T," she said in the Christmas issue of the magazine.
Church has always been an important part of Christmas, she said, as her father was a vicar.
"As a child I had to wait until my father had finished his services before I could open my presents. It felt like a very long wait."
Theresa May: The woman behind No 10
Discussing her TV tastes as a younger woman, the prime minister said she liked watching Diana Rigg and later Joanna Lumley in The Avengers, but never viewed them as role models.
"I have never had a female role model - I've always just got on with doing what I am doing," she said.
Mrs May admitted she had not seen much of former shadow chancellor Ed Balls on Strictly as she tended to be busy on Saturday evenings.
Asked if one day she would be tempted to give the show a try herself, she replied: "I can't dance. It's not a good idea."
