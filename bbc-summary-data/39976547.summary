At about 04:35 BST, the 35-year-old woman was woken up by a loud bang at her home at Ballydonaghy Meadows.
When she went downstairs, she saw smoke and flames and broken glass at the door.
The woman fled from the house with her children aged 15, 11 and six. The door of the house was badly damaged.
"While no-one was injured during this incident, there could have been serious consequences," Det Ch Insp Dunny McCubbin said.
He appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
