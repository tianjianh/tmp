[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old, who played 297 times for the Sky Blues between 2003 and 2011, also captained the club.
Doyle left City for a four-year spell with Sheffield United before joining Portsmouth in July 2015.
He scored three goals in 96 games in his time at Fratton Park, captaining Pompey to this term's League Two title.
Doyle will be the only member of the City playing staff who has experience of playing for City at their former home at Highfield Road.
Coventry will play in the fourth tier at the Ricoh Arena next season after being relegated from League One.
City's first summer signing increases the club's number of contracted players to 15, following the end-of-season release of nine men - Nathan Clarke, Kevin Foley, Vladimir Gadzhev, Andy Rose, Ruben Lameiras, Marcus Tudgay and three of their Under-23 squad, Kyle Spence, Jack Finch and Jacob Whitmore.
Defender Jordan Turnbull and striker Stuart Beavon have the option to leave the club before 31 July, due to existing clauses in their current contracts.
City are also in talks over new deals with seven players - goalkeeper Lee Burge, defenders Chris Stokes, Ryan Haynes, Dion Kelly-Evans and Devon Kelly-Evans, midfielder Gael Bigirimana and top scorer George Thomas.
