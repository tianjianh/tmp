Port Vale P-P Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saturday's League One fixture between Port Vale and MK Dons at Vale Park has been postponed because of snow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The referee deemed the pitch unplayable following an inspection at 09:00 GMT on Saturday.
Heavy snowfall on Friday had covered the playing surface at Vale Park, prompting the officials to call an inspection well ahead of kick-off.
Vale are currently 15th in the league table, three points ahead of the 18th-placed Dons.
This match has been postponed to play at a later date.
