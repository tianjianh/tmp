A driver captured the footage on a dashboard camera shortly after a cash-handler was robbed in Newton Heath, Manchester.
The robber threatened to blind the handler with a squeezable bottle of liquid before snatching cash and riding off on a motorcycle with another man.
Officers later found a box of cash and a burned-out motorcycle.
Greater Manchester Police have released the footage along with CCTV in a bid to find the suspect.
The robbery happened on the afternoon of 18 January in Old Church Street.
Bags filled with cash and a deposit box were taken, before the men fled on a Yamaha R6 motorcycle, later found set alight.
About 20 minutes later, in Mossley, a driver noticed two men running across some fields, one carrying bags filled with cash.
Det Con Phil Caine said: "The nature of this incident is truly shocking and we need to make sure those responsible are off our streets, unable to cause any more harm."
