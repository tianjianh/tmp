Thieves broke into the house in Intake, Doncaster on Thursday, a week after Paris Mulholland's 11th birthday.
In the letter, she tells the burglars "how much they hurt me", that she cries for two hours each night, and they had made her "scared of the dark again".
Paris wrote the letter after speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield.

Gemma Mulholland said the letter helped her daughter tell the thieves "how she feels, and how it's affected her."
She said: "I really am super proud of her."
Paris' new iPhone, a laptop she got for Christmas, and birthday money was taken from her bedroom, as well as her grandmother's gold watch.
Cash, jewellery and other items were taken in the robbery, along with Paris' and her younger brother Thomas' belongings.
Ms Mulholland said Paris was too upset to sleep in her bedroom after seeing it ransacked.
Lego models were broken and photos taken on Paris' phone during a recent trip to Disneyland may have been lost forever.
Paris wrote: "To my burgler [sic]. I hope you are happy with yourself, I can no longer sleep in my own bed [...]
"Why could you not have left when you saw to [sic] picture of a happy family and when you saw my birthday card, but anyway thank you for scaring me so much I cry 2 hours straight nearly every night."
Ms Mulholland called the thieves "despicable human beings" but said the community had rallied round.
PC Adam Watkinson of South Yorkshire Police said: "Burglary is a highly intrusive crime which can have a huge impact on the victim. In this case, a young girl has been left feeling scared and upset after her home was broken into.
"I would like to reassure Paris and her mum that we are doing everything we can to find the person responsible for this incident.
"It is totally unacceptable that someone should feel scared in their own home and lose valuable possessions."
