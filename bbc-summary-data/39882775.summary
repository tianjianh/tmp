[SN]TITLE[SN]
Work to start on Wrexham Library police station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is set to begin on a new Â£1.9m police station for Wrexham town centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 14-month scheme starts on Monday at the former Oriel Gallery at Wrexham Library.
The new building will house frontline services while the divisional headquarters are being moved to a new command and custody base in Llay.
Both facilities will replace the present Wrexham headquarters, based in a 1970s tower block at Bodhyfryd.
That site is being sold off and the building earmarked for demolition.
The former gallery space in the library has been made available to North Wales Police on a 10-year lease with Wrexham council.
The council-run gallery has already been relocated with work under way on new arts and culture hub in the town.
