[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby discharged from unit which shut due to infection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of 12 babies who tested positive for a bacterial infection which forced a neonatal unit in Cardiff to close to new admissions has been discharged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said 11 babies on the University Hospital of Wales unit were being cared for and their condition was improving.
New admissions stopped in late August because of a "cluster of infections".
The board has not confirmed whether or not the unit has reopened to new patients or what the infections are.
A spokesman said one baby was discharged last weekend.
