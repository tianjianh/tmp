Claudio Bravo lucky not to concede penalty - Ian Wright

Manchester City keeper Claudio Bravo was "lucky" not to give away a penalty in the 2-1 win against Manchester United, says Ian Wright.

Wright believes 33-year-old Bravo, who has replaced England's Joe Hart at City, should have been punished for a second-half challenge on Wayne Rooney.
"It's is a penalty. His studs are up," Wright told Match of the Day.
"He jumps in off the ground. He is out of control of his body. It is reckless. It wasn't given and he was lucky."

Bravo was signed for Â£15.4m this summer which signalled Hart's departure to Italian club Torino on loan.
But Bravo, making his debut against United, was also at fault when he dropped a free-kick with City leading 2-0, which allowed United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to score.
"The way Joe Hart was jettisoned from the squad, I'm thinking Claudio Bravo must be unbelievable," said Wright.
"He has to catch it or punch it and doesn't do either. The communication has to get better. For me, that is terrible."
He added: "I fancy City for the league this season but with him in goal, especially off today's showing, he's going to give people a chance."
