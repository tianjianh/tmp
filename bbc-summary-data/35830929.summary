Hampshire police pay system 'not fit for purpose'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire Police Federation, which represents Hampshire and Isle of Wight's police officers, says the force's pay system is "not fit for purpose" after further mistakes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An allowance due to 3,003 officers was wrongly calculated in March.
Hampshire Constabulary apologised and said it would pay all the officers a flat rate allowance.
In February, 1,300 officers received the wrong pay, with half being underpaid and half overpaid.
Since November 2014, salaries have been the responsibility of H3 - a partnership between the county council, fire service and police, providing back-room services such as finance and payroll.
Hampshire Police Federation said that since its introduction, there had been a "catalogue of errors".
Chairman John Apter said: "We have lurched from one crisis to another. We have now reached the point that, when an officer looks at their pay slip, it's a guessing game as to whether it is correct or not.
"H3 is not delivering the promises it made. It is not fit for purpose and a rethink on the future delivery of these services is now required."
The latest error relates to "Bear Scotland" payments in which officers working overtime are compensated for loss of holiday pay.
Hampshire Constabulary said the calculation for the year was based on a three-month period, creating "winners and losers".
It said it would rectify the mistake by paying all the officers Â£60. Those paid more would not have to repay it.
Acting Deputy Chief Constable David Pryde said: "I would, again, like to apologise to anyone who has been affected. We have acted swiftly to put this right."
County council chief executive John Coughlan said: "We have been working closely with the constabulary to diagnose exactly what the underlying reason for the problems are and progress is being made. We'd like to apologise to anyone impacted."Â
