[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves have signed defender Roderick Miranda from Portuguese Primeira Liga side Rio Ave on a  four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Portugal Under-20 international Miranda, 26, is reunited with former coach Nuno Espirito Santo who took over at Wolves a fortnight ago.
He started out at Benfica and went on loan to Servette and Deportivo La Coruna before joining Rio Ave in 2013.
"This is perhaps one of the best leagues in the world," Miranda said.
"To be a part of this league is a dream - I want to help Wolves to be as high as possible."
Sporting director Kevin Thelwell added: "He's very good on the ball and I'm sure he'll be a great addition to Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo's squad going forward."
