[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neil Doyle death: PC denies 'conspiracy of silence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A colleague of a police officer who was killed on a night out has denied there was "a conspiracy of silence" about what happened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Neil Doyle, 36, died following an attack in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of 19 December last year.
Andrew Taylor, 29, Christopher Spendlove, 30, and Timmy Donovan, 30, are on trial for murder at Liverpool Crown Court.
The three men also deny wounding with intent and causing grievous body harm.
The court has previously heard how PC Doyle was struck by a "pile driver" punch, in a confrontation in Seel Street just before 03:00 BST and died from an injury to an artery in his neck.
Police officer Michael Steventon, who was attacked alongside PC Doyle, has been giving evidence about the disturbance, which broke out after the two groups met.
Under cross examination from Lord Alex Carlile QC, Mr Steventon agreed PC Doyle was an older officer he viewed as a "mentor".
The court heard that on the night of the attack, Mr Taylor spoke to PC Doyle, repeatedly addressing him as "officer".
But Mr Steventon denied this had left PC Doyle's blood "boiling over", and denied it led to the officer needing to be restrained by another colleague.
He also admitted Mr Taylor made no threats to PC Doyle, adding that he could not remember if the 29-year-old had offered to shake the officer's hand.
And he denied that PC Doyle repeatedly swore at Mr Taylor, or that he angrily followed him into nearby Colquitt Street.
Mr Steventon was then challenged by Mr Carlile, who accused him of "a conspiracy of silence" after all involved had "piled in".
Mr Carlile said Mr Steventon was "not telling the truth in the witness box in order to protect the memory of an esteemed colleague", a claim denied by the officer.
The trial continues.
