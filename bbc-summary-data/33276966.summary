Hayley Pointon was shot at a house in Hinckley, Leicestershire as she visited her on-off boyfriend Nigel Barwell, a drug dealer, in February 2013.
The court previously heard the 30-year-old from Coventry was shot "by mistake" by two masked gunmen.
Aaron Power and Aaron Newman, both from Coventry, are on trial at Leicester Crown Court, where they deny murder.
Giving evidence at Leicester Crown Court, Mr Power said he thought the intention was to steal cash and drugs from Mr Barwell's house.
Mr Power, 25, said co-accused Mr Newman and another man were the gunmen, while he waited with a getaway car nearby.
Prosecuting barrister James House QC suggested Mr Power was lying and blaming his friends: "You were paid to target Nigel Barwell weren't you?
"So now I'm a hitman?" said Mr Power. "You are wrong."
Mr Newman, 24, told the jury that although he joined Mr Power and Mr Walker on a recce of the house a day earlier, he was at home on the night of the shooting.
"I was waiting in my flat but Power came back without anything and said something went wrong.
"He didn't give me any details."
Mr Power's barrister Joel Bannathan QC asked him: "Why has he [Mr Power] named you in the case if you were not there?"
"Clearly to get himself off with it," said Mr Newman.
Craig Adamson, 23, Dylan Whitty, 30, and Jamie Simpson, 26, all also from Coventry, and Matthew Dicey, 40, from Rugby, are on trial accused of assisting an offender, which they deny.
The trial continues.
