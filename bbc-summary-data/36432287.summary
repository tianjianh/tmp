The shooting happened near St Kieran's Primary School in Poleglass at about 22:20 BST on Wednesday.
The victim was treated in hospital for his injuries and later discharged himself.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said those behind the shooting were "at war with the community".
"Their campaign against people in their own community should end now," the west Belfast MLA added.
In an unconnected attack in north Belfast about an hour later, three men broke into a house in Cranbrook Gardens and took a man in his 30s outside.
He was shot in both feet but the bullets failed to penetrate his footwear.
He was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the attacks to contact them on the non-emergency number 101.
