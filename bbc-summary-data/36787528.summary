The 25-year-old will be seen as a replacement for Nigeria's Ahmed Musa who joined English champions Leicester City on Friday.
Traore has already played in Russia between 2011 and 2014 for Kuban Krasnodar and Anzhi Makhachkala.
In January 2014 he joined Monaco, who immediately loaned him to Everton.
He scored on his debut for Everton in an FA Cup tie but then picked up a hamstring injury that ruled him out until the final match of the Premier League season.
Last season he scored three goals in 19 Ligue 1 appearances for Monaco.
He was also part of the Ivory Coast squad that won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, but only played the final moments of the semi-final win over DR Congo coming on as a substitute.
CSKA start the new campaign on 23 July  when they face Zenit St. Petersburg in the Super Cup. They have qualified for the group stages of the Champions League.
