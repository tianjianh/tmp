Shrewsbury Town defender Anthony Gerrard hopes that talks can take place next month with a view to him signing a full-time contract at the club.

He has played 12 games since arriving in October on non-contract terms.
"It's down to the club to put something on the table in January and we can take it from there," 29-year-old Gerrard told BBC Radio Shropshire.
"If somebody wants a player badly enough, those funds can miraculously appear from out of the blue."
The cousin of former Liverpool and England skipper Steven Gerrard, he was released by Huddersfield Town in the summer, having made only 10 appearances in 2014-15.
He is grateful for the opportunity given to him by Town boss Micky Mellon, who has warned that he will not spend money the club does not have.
"It's the first time I've strung a consecutive amount of games together in about a year and a bit," said Gerrard. "I'm just concentrating on each and every 90 minutes that I can get under my belt.
"For a player who has played whole seasons, last year was a bitter blow to my career. But it's done now. I'll be glad to see the back of 2015, and look forward to a promising 2016. I'm here to play.
"I'm here to do what I can for the team and help them get to a nice solid base. I can see myself staying here, but obviously there's a lot to be talked about and figures to be spoken about before that can happen."
