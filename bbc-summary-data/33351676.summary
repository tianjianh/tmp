Green Hedge Renewables has drawn up initial plans for the development of Baldoon Airfield near Wigtown.
They claim it could generate up to 20MW of renewable energy annually.
The developer outlined its proposal for the 53.8 hectare (133 acres) site in a "pre-application" submission to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Rows of solar panels would be built on former runways and on farmland south-east of the airfield, under the plans.
Fixed at a 20 degree angle, the front of the panel would be 80cm (31 inches) from the ground, the back would be two metres (6.5 feet) high.
The farm would be surrounded by a two metre high boundary fence, with infra-red motion sensor CCTV cameras "to deter trespassing or any criminal activity".
The site borders the Crook of Baldoon RSPB reserve and it is close to two sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) - Wigtown Bay and the Cree Estuary.
The developers have mooted plans to re-seed the ground beneath the solar panels built on farmland.
It would allow sheep to continue to graze the land, therefore managing the growth of vegetation.
In a report to Dumfries and Galloway Council, project planner Adam Banting, of Green Hedge Renewables, stressed that the plans are at a very early stage.
He said: "Any proposal that is considered viable on this site will be subject to full consultation and liaison with the local community and other stakeholders who may have an interest in this proposal."
The energy it generates would be fed into the National Grid.
After 25 years, the development would be decommissioned, all equipment removed and the site reinstated to its current state, the developer said.
