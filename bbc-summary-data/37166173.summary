The chairman of a GAA club at the centre of a row over funding for a community project has resigned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eddie Haughey resigned from County Antrim's Oisín Glenariffe club following a vote to move a set of gates commemorating two IRA men.
Causeway Coast and Glens Council withdrew £180,000 from the project in June.
DUP councillors said the gates would "re-traumatise" people affected by terrorism.
They carry the names of Charlie McAllister and Pat McVeigh, who were killed in 1922.
The money was to be allocated to the Friends of Glenariffe group to help build a shared community space.
At a meeting last Thursday, club members voted to relocate the gates from the club entrance to a position next to a hurling pitch.
"A cultural war is being waged within Causeway Coast and Glens Council," independent councillor Padraig McShane told Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
"Oisíns should never have been put in this position," he said.
Mr McShane's SDLP counterpart, Margaret-Anne McKillop, said it was "unfortunate this has been turned into a political football".
The councillor said Oisíns "has always been a cross-community club and will always be a cross-community club".
The council is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting  on Tuesday night.
