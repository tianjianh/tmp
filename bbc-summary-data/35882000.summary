Andy Capp cartoon auction of memorabilia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collection of Andy Capp cartoon strip memorabilia has raised about £4,000 at auction in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cartoon strip character was created by Hartlepool-born Reg Smythe who died in 1998.
He personally drew and inked every picture for the 18,000 Andy Capp cartoons he produced over four decades.
The most valuable items sold from the 13 lots was Lot 140, a collection of cartoons that fetched £1,300, according to Tennants in Leyburn.
Feature: The mirth and misogyny of Andy Capp
Lots up for sale included bronze statues and plastic figures of Andy Capp along with books and cartoons.
As well as collectors in the room there was also interest from bidders over the internet, including buyers from America.
Smythe was commissioned to create a cartoon for the Daily Mirror's Manchester edition in 1957.
Andy Capp's image, flat cap pulled down over his eyes, was used for commercial endorsements and to sell Post Office Savings Bonds.
It inspired a TV series and West End musical in the 1980s.
After Smythe's death the Daily Mirror continued to publish the cartoon, which is now produced by a team of three artists.
