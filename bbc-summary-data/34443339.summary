Organ donation law changes finalised in Welsh assembly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New organ donation rules which presume consent have been finalised by AMs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A system of presumed consent will take effect on 1 December, where people will have to opt-out if they do not want their organs used after death.
Living donors who lack the mental capacity to express a view could also be deemed to consent to donation by experts acting in their best interests.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the "fundamental change" gave hope to over 200 people in Wales needing new organs.
Under the new law, people are invited to register their wish to donate their organs or not, with the assumption that they consent to donation if they do not register a view.
It has been described as a "soft opt-out" system, where family and friends will be consulted about the dead person's view on organ donation but do not have a veto.
A TV campaign and touring roadshow have been raising awareness of the changing rules.
In September, the Welsh government revealed more than 109,000 people joined the organ donation register between 2010-11 and 2014-15 - an increase from 30% to 34% of the Welsh population.
