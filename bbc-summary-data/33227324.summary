NHS Borders staff infection response 'lost in transit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Information watchdogs have been told an NHS Borders response to a request for details of its staff infection policy was probably "lost in transit".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Jonathan Chappell did not receive a reply to his Freedom of Information request within required timescales.
The Scottish Information Commissioner was told the health board had now provided its response.
NHS Borders was found to have failed to reply within required timescales but it was ruled no further action was needed.
Dr Chappell wrote to the health board in late December last year for information about policies and procedures to deal with the protection of staff and patients if NHS workers were diagnosed as suffering from an infection.
He received acknowledgement of his request by mid-January but did not get the information requested.
The doctor wrote to NHS Borders in March requiring a review of its failure to respond and contacted the commissioner a month later.
"In its submissions to the commissioner, NHS Borders explained that (during the investigation) it had recovered the retained file copy of the letter to Dr Chappell dated 31 March 2015," the commissioner's report stated.
"It assumed the letter had been posted at that time, but was unable to evidence this for the commissioner."
The commissioner found that meant the only possible conclusion was that the required timescales to reply had not been met.
