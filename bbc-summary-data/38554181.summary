The Met Office said it could lead to "very poor travel conditions" in some parts of the country.
A yellow "be aware" warning is in place from 18:00 on Wednesday until 12:00 on Thursday.
A further alert has also been issued of potential snowfalls throughout Scotland from Thursday into Friday.
The first warning said wind gusts of up to 55mph were expected in exposed coastal areas with up to 5cm (2in) of snow possible and up to 20cm (8in) on higher ground.
The Met Office said lightning could accompany the heaviest showers, with potential disruption to power supplies as a result.
The second warning, valid from 12:00 on Thursday to 12:00 on Friday, could see further accumulations of snow.
