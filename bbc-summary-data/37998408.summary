Seven celebrities had to pull out of the last series of the Channel 4 winter sports show after injuring themselves.
Channel 4 said there had been a thorough review of safety standards.
Former England rugby captain Jason Robinson and footballer Robbie Fowler are taking part in the new series.
Model and businesswoman Caprice is also thought to have signed up.
The show sees celebrities compete at winter sports including ski-jumping, bobsleigh and speed skating.
The last series made headlines after a number of celebrities suffered injuries.
Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle had to undergo surgery on her neck after a fall while training for the show, which prompted the first review into safety procedures on the show.
Channel 4 said at the time that events were "no more difficult" than in previous series and all competitors had "undertaken a rigorous training programme to prepare them for the show".
A second review of safety was undertaken at the beginning of February.
Holby City actress Tina Hobley has said she has struggled to "drive, dress [and] wash my hair" following  an accident on the show.
Hobley broke her arm in two places and injured her knee and shoulder in a fall.
She told Hello Magazine her injuries "have had a huge impact" on her life and family.
The Jump: Series three's injured celebrities
Earlier this year former Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding told how she was still "struggling" with her knee after suffering a ruptured ligament while taking part in the show.
She said she was "in constant pain" with a knee injury, adding that such pain "can take a massive toll on your mental as well as physical wellbeing".
Stars that were drafted in to take part in the last series after other celebrities pulled out were also injured.
They included ex-EastEnders actor Joe Swash who chipped a bone in his shoulder and former England rugby player Ben Cohen, who lost two teeth and needed 20 stitches.
The series will be filmed in Austria again and will be broadcast over six weeks in the new year.
Davina McCall will return as presenter.
