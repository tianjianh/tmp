[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of an Irish student who was murdered in Glasgow has collected a posthumous degree from her university.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karen Buckley, 24, was studying occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University when she was killed by Alexander Pacteau last year.
Pacteau, 21, was ordered to serve at least 23 years in prison after admitting her murder.
Ms Buckley's degree was accepted by her father John during a ceremony in Glasgow.
A spokeswoman for Glasgow Caledonian University said: "During Glasgow Caledonian University's winter graduation ceremonies, Karen Buckley was awarded a posthumous master of science in occupational therapy.
"Her family have asked that her achievements can be celebrated privately."
Pacteau pleaded guilty to murdering Ms Buckley in the early hours of Sunday 12 April 2015
Ms Buckley, who was 24 and from Cork in Ireland, had moved to Glasgow in February that year to study at Glasgow Caledonian University.
On the night she was murdered, Ms Buckley had been to a nightclub in Glasgow's west end with friends.
In the early hours of Sunday morning she told them she was going to the toilet but did not return or collect her jacket.
Pacteau was seen on CCTV images talking to her before they walked off to his car, which he drove to nearby Kelvin Way.
The car was parked on the street for 12 minutes, during which time Pacteau attacked and murdered her by grabbing her neck and delivering 12 or 13 blows with the spanner.
Pacteau's silver Ford Focus was seen on CCTV leaving the area and heading towards Dawsholm Park, where the following morning a member of the public found Ms Buckley's handbag near a bin.
Four days after she was reported missing, the student's body was found inside a barrel that Pacteau had stored at High Craigton Farm, near Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire.
Pacteau later pleaded guilty to Ms Buckley's murder as police built an overwhelming case against him.
