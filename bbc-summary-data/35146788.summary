Lizzie Simmonds, who set a British record in the 100m backstroke on the opening night, took gold in the 200m in a season's best 2:00.91, just outside her own British record.
Proud, 21, of the Plymouth Leander team, broke Mark Foster's 14-year-old short-course 50m freestyle British record on the opening day, clocked 46.69 in the 100m freestyle and on Sunday added the 50m butterfly with a time of 22.39 seconds.
Willmott, 22 - who also won gold in the 200m IM and 400m freestyle, plus silver in the 200m butterfly - captured the 400m title in 4:28.26, an impressive six seconds ahead of the rest of the field.

Anna Hopkin of Bath University lowered the personal best time she posted in the morning heats to win 50m freestyle gold in 24.44.

Calum Tait finished more than a body length ahead of the next placed swimmer in the men's 200m breaststroke, posting a personal best 2:05.42.
The women's 200m freestyle final went down to the final touch but it was Loughborough University's Sophie Smith who touched first to take gold in 1:56.03, only 0.02 seconds outside her lifetime best.
In the men's 200m freestyle final, Loughborough University's Adam Barrett won in a season's best 1:43.72.
