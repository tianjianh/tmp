Campese, 31, has been out since June after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament.
"He's out in Australia at the moment and is getting some very good treatment," Chester told BBC Radio Humberside.
"He's ahead of schedule and we're confident that he will be right for game one."
Fellow Robins half-back Albert Kelly also missed the closing stages of the season with a knee injury.
The 24-year-old scored 15 tries in 20 Super League appearances in 2015 and Chester believes the team's chances will be boosted by having the duo available more regularly.
"His knee's fine and he's fit and raring to go," Chester said.
"We just need to make sure that those two guys are out there on the field at the same time next year because we are a better team when they are playing well."
He added: "Albert's a player I'd like to see here long-term. We've got to make him as happy as possible and I'm confident if we do that then he'll be here for a long time."
