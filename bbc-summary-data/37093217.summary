Fleming, who has scored three tries in 12 appearance since making his debut in 2015, has agreed to extend his contract until the end of the 2017 season.

Knowles joined St Helens from Barrow Island as a 15-year-old and head coach Keiron Cunningham said: "Morgan's transition from academy player to professional has been superb and is down to his dedication both on and off the field.
"This contract rewards that hard work and what impresses me about Morgan is he isn't the finished article and wants to continue to learn and develop."
