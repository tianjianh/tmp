[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company is integrating with Friends Life, which it took over in January, and said it wanted to focus its operations on "core locations".
Offices in Salford, Stretford and Salisbury will be shut and staffing reduced in its Exeter, Manchester and Dorking offices.
A company spokesman said it was too early to say how many jobs would go from these six sites.
The Salford, Salisbury and Stretford offices - where close to a thousand people are employed in total - will close within the next 18 months.
Although there will be staff cuts in Dorking it will remain a "specialist site for our corporate pensions business".
"Any role reductions which may occur as a result of Aviva's integration with Friends Life will form part of the potential reduction of 1,500 roles we announced in January 2015," said a company statement.
It added: "We appreciate this is disappointing and difficult news for some of our employees and we are helping our people through this process, providing a range of support and advice, and consulting with employee representative bodies about these changes."
The firm said its core UK locations would be Bristol, Norwich, Perth, Sheffield and York supported by a number of specialist and trading sites across the UK with its group headquarters remaining in London.
