Vale took the lead on the hour when Sam Foley volleyed in to score for the first time in four months after keeper Joel Coleman had spilled a free-kick.
Matt Palmer and Curtis Main went close for Oldham before Anthony Gerrard was fouled by Richard Duffy in the area.
Latics captain Kelly's spot kick was pushed on to the post, but he turned home the rebound to secure a point.
Oldham remain in the League One relegation places, three points from safety, while Rob Page' Vale move to within three points of the play-off pack.
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"The players have got the belief that they can win games and get us the points we need to stay in the division.
"It's not about performances, it's about getting points to enable us to stay in the league.
"It's a home game and I expected three points, but Port Vale have come and done a good job on us."
Port Vale manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Stoke:
"I have looked at the penalty again and it is extremely harsh. There is contact. Duffs does what you ask your defenders to do, which is have contact with them.
"Their lad pushes Duffs over, then falls over him. So, it was harsh. But it's one of those things. You have to get on with it and I was pleased with the performance.
"Oldham have had a terrific couple of results and are unbeaten in seven so, coming here on a pitch like that, we knew we were in for a tough night."
