The Cumbrians are three points off the play-offs after Ibehre headed in Alexander McQueen's lofted cross to break the deadlock in the second half.
Boro's Bryon Harrison had been denied early on by goalkeeper Mark Gillespie and Dean Parrett struck the crossbar.
Ryan Hedges should have earned them a point, but skewed his shot wide.
Stevenage caretaker manager Darren Sarll told BBC Three Counties Radio:
"I thought for 20 minutes in the second half we seemed to struggle to replicate the good work we did in the the first half.
"It was great first half, we came in very happy at half-time. I'm very disappointed at the same point that we haven't taken one of our numerous chances. Every win we attempt is going to be hard-earned and hard-fought.
"No one can say my players didn't give their all for the football club today. I was delighted with that, but I know that the list of improvements has got a little bit longer."
