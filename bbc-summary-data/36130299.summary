Boy claims other child killed toddler Liam Fee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young boy has claimed another boy was responsible for the death of a toddler, a murder trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The youngster made the statement during a recorded police interview the day after two-year-old Liam Fee was found dead at a house near Glenrothes on 22 March 2014.
The child said one of the accused, Nyomi Fee, had told him what happened.
The dead boy's mother Rachel Fee and her partner Nyomi deny murdering Liam and ill-treating two other boys.
One of these boys is the witness the jury have been hearing from while the other is the child they are accused of falsely blaming for Liam's death.
The jury have already been shown a video interview with that boy, who told police he had "strangled" Liam but that the toddler had been sitting up and watching television afterwards.
Rachel Fee, 31, and Nyomi Fee, 28, who are originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny a series of mistreatment and neglect charges against two other children, as well as the murder charge.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
