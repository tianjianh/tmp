Konta, ranked 13th in the world, converted her fourth match point to beat the Russian eighth seed 3-6 7-5 7-5 after three hours and seven minutes.
The 25-year-old from Eastbourne plays Germany's Angelique Kerber next.
Murray, the reigning Olympic champion, beat Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-3 6-1 and next faces Italy's Fabio Fognini.
The Wimbledon champion, 29, has now won 14 matches in a row since losing the French Open final in June.
"I played pretty well. I hit the ball well from the back of the court," said Murray. "I didn't make many unforced errors and it was a good match."
Tenth seed Konta, who fought back after losing the first set, said she was "lucky and privileged" to get a chance to play in the Olympics.
"If you keep it simple, that's when you'll see some of the best tennis," she said.

The draw for the mixed doubles is out and, as things stand, Jamie Murray and Konta will be the only British representatives.
They will play Americans Jack Sock and Bethanie Mattek-Sands in their opening match.
The pairing of Andy Murray and Heather Watson do not have a high enough combined doubles ranking to qualify, although they are the second alternates.
If two other teams withdraw before the end of the first round, Murray and Watson will get a spot in the draw.
"The plan was always that Jamie was going to play with Jo," said Andy Murray.
"Obviously Jamie is a way more experienced doubles player than me. And Jo is playing well too. So they will have the chance to win a medal."
Brothers Jamie and Andy were knocked out of the men's doubles on Monday.

There was a shock for defending women's singles champion Serena Williams, as she exited the Olympics after a 6-4 6-3 loss to Ukranian Elina Svitolina.
The number one seed was left in tears after the defeat but admitted that "the better player won".
Rafael Nadal, competing in his first Olympics since 2008, completed a 6-3 6-3 second-round victory over Italy's Andreas Seppi.
The Spaniard also advanced to the next round of the men's doubles with partner Marc Lopez, after they beat Austria's Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya 6-3 6-1.
Czech Petra Kvitova moved into the next round with a 4-6 6-4 6-4 win over Russian Ekaterina Makarova.
But Makrova and partner Elena Vesnina moved into the next round of the doubles with a win over Andreea Mitu and Raluca Olaru.
