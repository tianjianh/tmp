A nose-less cat who was struggling to find a new home has had to be put down after becoming "suddenly very seriously ill".

Dave was taken in by Bath Cats and Dogs Home after his elderly owner went into a care home.
The animal had to have part of his nose removed a few years ago due to a tumour.
The centre, which campaigned to find him a new home, said his death was "unrelated to his nose".
It added: "With great sadness, it was kindest to put him to sleep".
The home said Dave struggled to find a new owner because people could not "see past" his unusual face.
It launched a campaign to find him a new home and had been "overwhelmed" by offers.
A spokesman said: "Sadly our happiness was short-lived as Dave became suddenly and seriously ill a few days ago.
"We hoped for the best but tests showed that Dave was suffering from a serious underlying illness  - unrelated to his nose."
