The Sir Richard Hotham scheme for Bognor Regis, spread across three sites including the Regis Centre, was turned down by Arun District Council.
It is the latest chapter in a long-running saga to redevelop the area.
The council said it had responded to local people's wishes but critics said it was a wasted opportunity.
Councillors rejected the planning application because of concerns over the lack of affordable housing, the impact of extra traffic and the scheme's viability and design.
The Sir Richard Hotham Project said the company was disappointed and surprised and would take legal advice before deciding whether to appeal or to submit a modified planning application.
The Conservative-led council said in a statement it remained committed to creating new jobs in Bognor and increasing visitor numbers.
Lib Dem councillor Francis Oppler said the redevelopment had not moved forward in 10 years.
"We have no plan, no developer and we have had 10 years of wasted opportunities," he said.
