Amina Agboola, of Scott Drive, Peterborough, was kicked 6ft (1.8m) across a room by Dean Harris, 19, last November.
Harris admitted manslaughter but was convicted of murder at Cambridge Crown Court.
Amina's mother, Sarah Racqueman, 29, was cleared by a jury of causing or allowing her daughter's death.
The trial heard Amina was kicked in the stomach when alone with Harris who said she had repeatedly soiled herself.
Paramedics who responded to a 999 call made by Harris described Amina as looking "like a rag doll" when they arrived.
Initially Harris told them Amina had fallen off the toilet, Zoe Johnson, prosecuting, said.
But soiled nappies and clothing found at the house were "the trigger that unleashed Harris's anger towards Amina", she added.
Harris said he did not mean to cause Amina serious harm.
After the hearing Cambridgeshire Police released a confession letter, written by Harris. He describes how Amina had "become limp" after he kicked her and expressed remorse at his actions.
Ms Racqueman told the court a social worker had visited her before the incident and warned her that Harris had a history of domestic violence.
However, she said she gave Harris "the benefit of the doubt", adding: "I believe in second chances."
The court was told Amina's liver had been split in two by the kick and there was evidence of older injuries on her body including a recently broken arm, bruises to her face and skull, and bite marks on her cheek and forearm.
Det Ch Insp Jon Hutchinson, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: "His evil actions have resulted in the death of a young girl who had her whole life ahead of her.
"Harris used completely disproportionate violence against such a tiny child.
"There is never an excuse to hit a child and he should have had no doubt what the potential consequences were of using such force on a two-year-old."
Cambridgeshire County Council, whose social services had warned about Harris, said "a serious case review into this tragic case is currently being undertaken by the Local Safeguarding Children's Board to see if there are any lessons to be learned for agencies from the tragic death of Amina".
