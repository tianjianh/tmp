The 29-year-old Argentine, who has made 129 appearances for the Baggies since being signed by Steve Clarke in 2012, is now tied to The Hawthorns until the summer of 2018.
There is also a clause for a further 12-month option for Yacob, who was in the final year of his previous deal.
"Players like Claudio are vital. He is a great pro," said boss Tony Pulis.
"It wasn't a difficult decision because everyone working at the club have all made me feel very comfortable since I've been here," said Yacob, who has started all six of West Brom's Premier League games this season.
He is approaching the third anniversary of his only goal for the club against Arsenal in October 2013, having arrived as a free agent from Argentine Primera Division side Racing Club de Avellaneda.
The Baggies, who visit Sunderland on Saturday (15:00 BST kick-off), are 10th in the Premier League, having won two, drawn two and lost two this season.
