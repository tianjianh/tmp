[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 2-1 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A first-half brace from Bobby-Joe Taylor earned Maidstone a second win of the season as they beat Braintree 2-1 at home in the National League on Tuesday night.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a great start for the hosts as Taylor finished neatly, latching onto a pass from strike partner Ben Greenhalgh after just four minutes.
He grabbed his second on the half-hour mark, providing vital daylight between the sides and settling Maidstone down.
Greenhalgh came close to scoring in the second half but his shot sailed just over the bar before Braintree were reduced to 10 men after Jon Ashton received his marching orders with nine minutes remaining.
The visitors make a mark on the game in stoppage time when Joe Maybanks pulled a goal back but it was not enough for a point.
