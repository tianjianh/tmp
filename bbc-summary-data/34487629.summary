Michelle Thomson will not face parliamentary probe over property deals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Westminster's standards watchdog will not be investigating allegations surrounding property deals linked to the MP Michelle Thomson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A complaint had been made to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by former Liberal Democrat MP John Barrett.
But the commissioner's office said that the allegations related to before Ms Thomson became an MP.
It said it could not therefore investigate the claims.
Meanwhile, the Law Society of Scotland has confirmed that it submitted a report on solicitor Christopher Hales to the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which is now known as the National Crime Agency, in 2011.
A police inquiry is being carried out into Mr Hales, who was struck off over a series of property deals carried out on Ms Thomson's behalf.
Ms Thomson, who had been the SNP's business spokeswoman in the House of Commons, denies any wrongdoing or illegal activity and has offered to help police with their inquiries.
She has resigned the party whip until the investigation into the property deals is concluded.
Mr Barrett, who represented Ms Thomson's Edinburgh West constituency from 2001 to 2010, told BBC Scotland that he had emailed the standards commissioner when the allegations were first reported in the Sunday Times newspaper.
In a written response, the commissioner stated: "The allegations relate to purchases made in 2009/10.
"Ms Thomson first became subject to the House of Commons Code of Conduct in May 2015, when she became a member of parliament.
"I do not, therefore, think that the commissioner could investigate this matter."
Earlier this week, the Conservative backbencher Andrew Bridgen said he would be writing to the standards commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, asking her to look into the matter.
However, BBC Scotland understands that Mr Barrett's complaint is the only one to have been received by the commissioner so far.
The Law Society has come under scrutiny over the length of time taken to formally submit evidence on the case to the Crown Office.
Although concerns about potential criminal matters were brought to prosecutors in December 2014 and April 2015, they were not formally raised until July 2015.
The Law Society said it had a legal duty to report suspicious activity, and has now revealed that it submitted a "suspicious activity report" (SAR) to Soca in October 2011.
SARs are designed to alert law enforcement agencies to potential money laundering.
The UK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU) identifies the most sensitive SARs and sends them to the appropriate organisations for investigation. The remainder are made available to UK law enforcement bodies via a secure channel.
It followed the original Law Society inspection, which resulted in Mr Hales being suspended, prosecuted before the independent Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal and struck off as a solicitor in 2014.
The tribunal had concluded that Mr Hales "must have been aware that there was a possibility that he was facilitating mortgage fraud, whether or not this actually occurred".
In a statement, the Law Society said: "Until the existence of the police investigation came into the public domain, the Law Society considered it could not disclose the fact that a SAR had been submitted.
"Police Scotland has since confirmed that it has been instructed by the Crown Office to carry out an investigation into the property transactions involving Christopher Hales.
"Given this is now a matter of public record and after receiving independent legal advice, the Society is able to confirm the submission of a report to SOCA in 2011 and believes the disclosure of this fact to be in the public interest."
Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said the Law Society statement was an "astonishing development which raises a raft of new questions."
He added: "Both the first minister and the Lord Advocate have said in the Scottish Parliament that they knew nothing of this, yet here we see that the Law Society flagged this up to the police in 2011 - what has been happening for the last four years?"
Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said the revelations strengthened the case for an independent external inquiry into the Law Society's role in the case, and again called on the society to publish all papers on the matter.
Ms Thomson made no comment on the controversy surrounding her as she arrived to host her constituency surgery in Edinburgh on Friday morning.
She did not respond to a question about whether she would stand down from parliament.
And when asked if she had anything to say about the row over her business dealings, she said "I've got a surgery to run".
