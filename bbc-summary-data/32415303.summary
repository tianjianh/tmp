[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lib Dem candidate Stephen Gilbert caught speeding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lib Dem parliamentary candidate was caught speeding by a camera he admits he "secured the funding for".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Gilbert's solicitor pleaded guilty on his behalf to speeding in his Kia car at 40mph in a 30mph zone on the A390 at St Blazey, last August.
Mr Gilbert, 38, of Beach Road, Newquay, was fined £430, ordered to pay costs of £85 and given three penalty points.
A charge of failing to give information relating to the driver's identity was withdrawn at Bodmin Magistrates' Court.
Mr Gilbert is defending the St Austell and Newquay seat in Cornwall.
The politician tweeted that the speeding conviction was "ironic" as he had "secured the funding for the camera 15 years ago".
Commenting on a road safety report in November 2014, Mr Gilbert told the Cornish Guardian newspaper: "What's clear to me is that often the dangerous driving on our roads comes from local people believing that they know the area well."
Mr Gilbert, who did not appear in court, was elected in May 2010 with a majority of 1,312.
