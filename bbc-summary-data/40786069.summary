[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shamir Fenelon grabbed his second goal in as many games to put the Shots ahead after just five minutes, but Luke Young soon equalised with a well-taken free-kick.
Midfielder Bobby-Joe Taylor restored the home side's lead three minutes into the second half, with Shaun Okojie nodding in a third after 87 minutes.
Torquay, who had drawn 0-0 with nine-man Tranmere on Saturday, pulled a goal back with a stoppage-time header from Jon-Paul Pittman but it was not enough to deny Aldershot.
