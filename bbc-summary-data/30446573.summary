Beamish Museum appeals for 1950s homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in the north-east of England are being given the chance to have their house rebuilt at a museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beamish in County Durham is appealing for semi-detached houses built between 1950 and 59 to use as a design base to replicate at a new attraction.
The 1950s-style development will also include a cafe, shops, police house, cinema and recreation area.
Museum director Richard Evans said it was a "unique opportunity" for people's homes to become part of history.
The museum would like people to nominate their properties, preferably ones which were originally constructed as social housing, to be replicated at the town which is being added to the existing Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian areas.
Working with the community, the museum will ask people their stories and what they think should be in the houses.
The two houses will be replicated rather than rebuilt brick by brick like the properties in the older parts of the museum.
Mr Evans said it is "very much" about the community and "what they want" in the town.
He said: "We're extremely excited to be offering people this unique chance for their home to become part of history being recreated at Beamish.
"Our 1950s town will tell the stories of the North East's communities during an important decade of change."
The project, which has received a  Â£10.75m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, is expected to create up to 100 jobs.
