Oliver Hawkins scored a first-half hat-trick as Dagenham & Redbridge swept aside Wrexham in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker, who missed the 3-1 win at Woking last weekend because of a back injury, tapped in to open his account.
Poor defending allowed the 24-year-old to head home a corner midway through the half, before converting a penalty in added time after Hamza Bencherif had fouled Luke Guttridge.
Dagenham & Redbridge have now won four in a row in the National League.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills said: "[It was] very poor, the game was over at half-time.
"[We were] second best all over the park today and deserved what we got.
"They looked a lot sharper than us, we didn't win enough balls to get us playing. When we had the ball we gave it away, which is totally not what we are about.
"We have to overcome this very, very quickly."
