[SN]TITLE[SN]
Powys council leader Barry Thomas to stand down in May

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Powys council leader Barry Thomas is to quit the role in May and will not stand for re-election during the forthcoming local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He has held the role since 2014 and has been the ward councillor for Llanfihangel for more than 20 years.
Mr Thomas said he was "taking a complete break from local government".
He said he had enjoyed the roles although it had "not been an easy task" during a period of "unprecedented financial pressures".
Mr Thomas, part of a non-political group of councillors, had assumed the leader's role after the previous incumbent was ousted in a vote of no confidence.
