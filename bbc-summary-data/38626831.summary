[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southampton v Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Virgil van Dijk and Ryan Bertrand are both likely to return for Southampton after sitting out the midweek FA Cup win over Norwich.

Netherlands defender Van Dijk will have a new centre-back partner after the sale of Jose Fonte to West Ham.
Leicester's Leonardo Ulloa, who handed in a transfer request, has been ruled out with a thigh injury.
The Foxes are without Africa Cup of Nations trio Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani and Daniel Amartey.
John Roder: "It was goalless when these two sides met earlier this season, and another 0-0 draw on Sunday has to be a strong possibility.
"Southampton are struggling for goals at St Mary's in the Premier League this season, while Leicester have scored only eight on their travels.
"Leicester's away record this season is in stark contrast to their title-winning campaign. A draw this Sunday would be a good result given the fact they come into the weekend in the bottom six.
"Claude Puel may very well inherit the "Tinkerman" nickname from Claudio Ranieri, for the Saints manager has not yet selected an unchanged side this season."

Southampton manager Claude Puel: "It's two teams with difficulties in the Premier League, in the same situation. We want a good result and the points. It's important to have good concentration for this.
"They will want to counter-attack against us. We know this game.
"It's a physical game also and it's important to analyse them well, have good concentration and the right attitude, like the last three games."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "Our goal is to get 40 points as soon as possible. Now we have two away matches and we will try to do our best.
"Sooner or later we will start to win away."
Claude Puel's rotation policy is not working. Meanwhile, Leicester's form remains completely up and down.
The Foxes still have not won away from home, and do not look anything like the team they were last season. I do not see that changing here.
