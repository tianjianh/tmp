Nathan Blake joins Newport County board

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales striker Nathan Blake has been appointed to the board of his home-town club Newport County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The one-time Premier League player, 43, has been in talks with County's lottery winning chairman Les Scadding.
Since the return of ex-chairman Chris Blight, County have appointed three non-executive members to their board.
Blake is the fourth such appointment within a month. They have also named Jimmy Dack as manager until the end of the season.
Dack took over as a caretaker in the wake of Justin Edinburgh's departure to League One Gillingham.
The Newport hierarchy are trying to stop their slide down the League Two table.
One win in seven games has seen them drop out of the play-off places.
Blake will advise the County on football decisions, including appointing Edinburgh's permanent successor at Rodney Parade.
