Searches were carried out in Belfast, Tyrone and Fermanagh on Thursday.
The man was taken to Dungannon police station for questioning.
Det Ch Insp Ian Wilson said an investigation was launched "following a number of complaints from farmers about the management of their business affairs".
Mr Wilson said police are liaising with the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board and HM Revenue and Customs.
"The investigation is at an early stage. A substantial amount of documents will need to be examined and our enquiries will continue for some time," he added.
