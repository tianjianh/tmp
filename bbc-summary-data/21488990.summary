David Cameron features in a special charity single - a cover version medley of Blondie's One Way or Another and the Undertones' Teenage Kicks.
Mr Cameron said he "enjoyed" his cameo.
A government donation will cancel out the cost of VAT on the record. Comic Relief has raised Â£800m since 1985 to help alleviate poverty.
No 10 said the prime minister welcomed One Direction to Downing Street to film part of the official Red Nose Day music video at the end of last year and made a short appearance in the video.
A Downing Street spokeswoman added the government would cover the cost of VAT on sales of the single from the overseas development budget, making "a charitable donation that will be the equivalent of the VAT".
On Sunday, the prime minister tweeted a picture of himself with the band, and said: "Enjoyed my cameo in @onedirection's vid for @comicrelief charity single. Glad to help with the filming location!"
Former prime minister Tony Blair starred alongside comic Catherine Tate for the charity fundraiser in the last months of his premiership in 2007.
And Gordon Brown appeared in a comedy sketch with James Corden and boyband JLS in 2011 - after he was voted out of office in the 2010 general election.
Mr Cameron also made an appearance in that year's programme.
The Masterchef segment saw the prime minister make approving noises as "chefs" Miranda Hart, Ruby Wax and Claudia Winkleman served him a three-course meal.
Last year Mr Cameron participated in a running event - along with his wife and their two eldest children - to raise money for Sport Relief, whose funds go towards Comic Relief.
Mr Cameron did not appear in clips from the One Direction video shown during Let's Dance for Comic Relief, which was broadcast on Saturday.
However, ex-EastEnders actor Dean Gaffney took part in the the programme just weeks after being involved in a serious car crash.
The 35-year-old, who shot to fame playing Robbie Jackson in the BBC soap, was knocked unconscious in the accident when his car went into the central reservation of a road in Derbyshire.
Speaking after his performance alongside three other former soap opera stars, the actor said he felt it was important for him to take part.
"It is all for charity. Comic Relief is a great cause," he said.
In other developments related to the charity, it emerged that Shakespearean actor Simon Russell Beale will star in a string of comedy sketches on BBC Radio 3 about the lives of great composers every day in the week running up to Red Nose Day, on Friday 15 March.
The channel's controller, Roger Wright, said: "I am delighted that BBC Radio 3 is once again supporting Red Nose Day in 2013, with a wide variety of entertaining programmes.
"It's great to have such important figures as Simon Russell Beale again bringing their talent to the station for such a great cause."
