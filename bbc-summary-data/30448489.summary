Special guests Kaiser Chiefs will also perform at the festival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 30 July until 2 August.
Festival organiser Rob da Bank says Clean Bandit will "knock it out the castle with their string led electronic knees up", adding that techno act Underworld "will close the festival in spectacular fashion".
More acts will be announced in January.
Underworld say they're excited to be making their Camp Bestival debut.
"We'll be bringing a show for acid house veterans and festival first-timers alike, so see you there next summer."
Festival organisers say the theme for 2015's family-friendly event is Go Wild.
They'll be announcing a full schedule of events in the new year.
There will be an adaptation of Dr Seuss's The Cat In The Hat, Dick v Dom Go Wild In The Ring and a range of outdoor activities.
