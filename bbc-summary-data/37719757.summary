Blackburn Rovers boss Owen Coyle says he "would love to" buy on-loan Southampton striker Sam Gallagher.

The 21-year-old has scored five goals from nine Championship starts this season, including two against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
"I do believe in time he's going to be a bona fide Premier League player," Coyle told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"It's the likes of the Sam Gallaghers and Tommie Hobans that, as a manager, you'd be looking to invest in."
Gallagher made 18 top-flight appearances for Southampton in the 2013-14 campaign, 15 as a substitute, scoring in a victory over Norwich.
However, a serious knee injury halted his progress and he failed to score in 15 games on loan at MK Dons last season.
Asked if he would like to sign Gallagher permanently, Coyle said: "I'd love to - Tommy Hoban's another one I would love to.
"He's young and he's still got a lot to learn, but I try to speak to him each day to try and impart some experience that I've picked up over the years, some knowledge of playing in that area.
"He's willing to listen, he's willing to learn and it's showing."
