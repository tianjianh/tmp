The 35-year-old left The Stags on 14 November after two years in charge, saying it was "time for a change".
He takes over a Boston side currently 15th in the table, and his first game in charge will be against FC United of Manchester on 17 December.
"Adam was the outstanding candidate," club chairman David Newton told the Pilgrims website.
