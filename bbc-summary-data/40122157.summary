The Beggarwood practice "put patients at risk of harm", the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said.
CQC inspectors visited the Basingstoke surgery in February, and said two of GPs felt the practice was "clinically unsafe due to staff shortages".
The GPs are leaving this month, but operator Cedar Medical insists the surgery has "adequate staffing".
More on this and other stories from across the south of England.
The CQC said it was "worrying" standards had "declined" since a previous inspection in May last year found the surgery "required improvement".
It said patients' records were not kept up to date, some staff were not properly trained and the surgery team was "disengaged".
Ruth Rankine, Deputy Chief Inspector of General Practice, said: "While the majority of staff were viewed as caring, there seemed to be a lack of commitment from the leadership."
She said fire risk assessments had not been acted on and some staff did not know where emergency equipment was stored.
Patients were waiting up to four to six weeks for routine appointments, the report said.
A notice on the surgery website, which lists five GPs, said four of them were leaving between 1 and 9 June.
It said: "We are in the process of recruiting two full time equivalent GPs and two full time equivalent Advanced Nurse Practitioners."
Cedar Medical, part of the Integral Medical Holdings (IMH) group, said it was supporting Beggarwood after the surgery's funding was "reduced across the board".
IMH director Richard Power, said: "There is currently an adequate number of clinicians."
The NHS North Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Group said "taking all necessary steps" to ensure progress.
