The Grammy Award-winning singer will play the role of Broadway star Dorothy Brock.
The musical - which features the songs We're In The Money and Lullaby of Broadway - begins previews at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 20 March 2017.
42nd Street had its first run in the UK in the same theatre from 1984 to 1989.
Easton's career spans four decades and she has sold over 20 million records worldwide.
Her most famous songs include the James Bond theme For Your Eyes Only, 9 to 5, We've Got Tonight  (with Kenny Rogers) and U Got The Look (with Prince).
The new show, featuring a cast of more than 50, will be directed by its co-author Mark Bramble.
Emmerdale actor Tom Lister will play director Julian Marsh, while Clare Halse - who most recently appeared in Gypsy - will play starry-eyed chorus girl Peggy Sawyer.
