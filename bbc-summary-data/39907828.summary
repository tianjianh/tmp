Poole unveils revamped Sir Anthony Caro sculpture

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An abstract sculpture in Poole created by artist Sir Anthony Caro has re-opened following conservation work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
'Sea Music' was given to the town by the sculptor in 1991, but had suffered from salt corrosion from the sea.
The 11m (35ft) high steel sculpture, featuring three viewing platforms, aimed to "bring together the cascading waves and the sails of boats".
Poole Museum was awarded Â£44,600 in lottery funding to conserve the landmark on Poole Quay.
In accordance with Caro's wishes before he died in 2013 of a heart attack at the age of 89, the supporting structure of the viewing platforms has been painted silver.
The project has also seen an exhibition of his Concerto Series at Poole Museum.
