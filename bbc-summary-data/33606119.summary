Cats' scratching posts and countless toys were ruined at Cambridge's Blue Cross centre during Thursday's storm.
More than 100 packages have been delivered to replace what was lost and a fundraising website has received Â£10,000 in donations.
Alan Maskell, from the centre, said staff were overwhelmed by the kindness.
A delivery van containing 107 parcels of toys arrived on Monday morning and many other people came in off the street to donate gifts.
The rehoming centre started a Just Giving page with the aim of raising Â£1,500 but by Tuesday morning it had raised more than Â£10,000.
Mr Maskell said: "The public response has been terrific.
"Local pet shops have said they've never known so many scratch posts to be sold in a weekend.
"We're extremely grateful to all those people - it's been overwhelming.
"Staff are very emotional about the sheer weight of support and kindness coming our way."
