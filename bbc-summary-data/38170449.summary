James Helu crossed to give Edinburgh the lead but Dafydd Howells and Dan Baker both scored to put Ospreys ahead.
There was controversy as Edinburgh's Damian Hoyland clattered into Dan Evans in the lead up to Blair Kinghorn's try.
Ma'afu Fia and Keelan Giles, with his ninth try in six games, replied for the hosts before Viliame Mata's late try.
It was Ospreys' second Scottish scalp in a week as they won 22-5 at Glasgow last weekend.
Ospreys move up to second in the Pro12 table, a point behind Munster after a late drop-goal gave the Irish province victory in Glasgow on Friday night.
Edinburgh remain 10th, with only Italian sides Zebre and Treviso below them.
The visitors started well as Helu touched down on his return from a hamstring injury to cancel out Sam Davies' early penalty, after they charged down an Ospreys kick.
But Howells raced over down the middle to put the hosts back into the lead, and Baker latched on to a loose ball from a scrum close to the goal-line to extend the Ospreys' advantage.
At the age of 23, Davies became the fourth-highest ever points-scorer for Ospreys - behind Dan Biggar, James Hook and Gavin Henson - with the conversion but boos rang around the Liberty Stadium just a few minutes later.
Kinghorn's try for Edinburgh was allowed to stand when referee Dudley Phillips and television match official Kevin Beggs decided Hoyland did not deliberately collide with Evans as they competed to catch a high ball.
The hosts soon added a third try as prop Ma'afu Fia drove over just before the break.
Ospreys welcomed back flanker Justin Tipuric and captain Alun Wyn Jones from Wales duty and the latter teed up Giles to continue his fine try-scoring form as the hosts pulled away.
A frustrating night for Edinburgh continued when Grant Gilchrist was sent to the bin for an offence in the ruck, before they had Allan Dell sin-binned for kicking out in the scrum just as they had 15 men back on the field, and Mata's try was little consolation.
Ospreys coach Steve Tandy on Blair Kinghorn's try being allowed:
"I think it's borderline ridiculous, when you see this game we knew Edinburgh wouldn't be the only frustrating factor, when you get a decision like that, it's pretty laughable.
"I shouldn't think I'll have to put in a report, I've spoken to a few people and I'm struggling to find anyone who says that's a try.
"It's pleasing, the fact we've got five points at home again but there was a bit of frustration in the changing room we left a few opportunities and conceded a few sloppy tries.
"Overall, the feeling is pleasing after how quickly we've come back together and the energy the national boys have brought to the group is excellent."
Edinburgh coach Duncan Hodge told BBC Wales Sport:
"We were second best for a fair bit of the game, we had to make a lot of tackles on the back of ill-discipline, we did okay to score three tries but the better team won.
"The scrum and line-out told though we got a bit back at the end with a few drives, but the pressure definitely told upfront, and losing Chris Dean [with a leg injury] after two minutes isn't a great start either.
"Two defeats in Wales [in six days], that's tough and we need to regroup.
"We've got Europe, Stade Francais will be a different challenge and one we need to get up for, and in the PRO12 we play Glasgow in three games time so that'll be huge."
