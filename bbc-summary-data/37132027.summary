Dave Rennie has agreed a two-year deal to take over from Gregor Townsend as Glasgow Warriors' head coach next summer, Scottish Rugby has announced.

Rennie, 52, will complete his contract as coach of Super Rugby outfit The Chiefs in Hamilton, New Zealand, before moving to Scotstoun.
Townsend is replacing Vern Cotter as Scotland head coach.
Rennie said he "couldn't turn down" the "opportunity to work with such exciting players at a club with big ambitions".
The former Wellington centre added: "It's no secret I have been interested in coaching abroad and this chance fits the bill. I am very motivated to continue the success (at Glasgow) and build the club."
Rennie joined The Chiefs in 2012 and won two Super Rugby titles in his first two seasons.
The New Zealander started his coaching career in 1999 at Wellington, where the team won their first NPC title in 14 years in his opening season as head coach in 2000.
He also coached Manawatu in the ITM Cup between 2006 and 2011 and also in that time won three consecutive Junior World Championships in charge of the New Zealand U20 side.
Scottish Rugby's chief executive Mark Dodson said: "It is a clear indication of the progress Scottish Rugby and Glasgow Warriors are making that we can attract a coach of Dave's experience to Scotland to work with our players.
"Gregor has developed a great winning culture at Glasgow Warriors and I'm very confident Dave will be able to build on that solid foundation to bring more success to the club."
