Ambulance questions at Jasmine Lapsley inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Questions about ambulance response times and medical treatment will be raised at a full inquest into the death of a six-year-old girl who apparently choked on a grape.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jasmine Lapsley, of Liverpool, died last August while on a family holiday at Morfa Nefyn, Gwynedd.
At a pre-inquest hearing at Caernarfon, coroner Nicola Jones said: "It will be a lengthy and complex inquest."
She promised there would be a full investigation.
She told Jasmine's parents: "Perhaps recommendations will be made for the future, depending on the outcome."
There would doubtless be criticisms "but we don't deal in blame," she added.
Paramedic experts, consultants and leading medical figures will be among the witnesses at the full inquest and there may be a jury.
Jasmine was flown 20 miles to hospital in Bangor by an RAF helicopter and at the time the Welsh Ambulance Trust held an investigation into the ambulance response.
