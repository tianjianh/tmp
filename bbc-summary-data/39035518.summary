[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 2-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Vassell struck in injury time to snatch a point for Blackpool as they came from two goals down to draw at home to Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were ahead in the 13th minute through League Two's top scorer, John Akinde, who tapped in his 21st of the season after Curtis Weston's deflected effort came back off a post.
Blackpool, who have not won at home since November, had a chance to equalise after 26 minutes as a well-worked move released Colin Daniel inside the area, but his effort flashed past the far post.
Barnet doubled their lead two minutes after the break as Charlie Clough rose highest from Ruben Bover's corner to bullet a header past Dean Lyness from 10 yards.
But Blackpool gave themselves hope after 59 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso picked up a loose ball and stroked it home from 12 yards.
And they snatched the point in the first minute of stoppage time as Vassell forced the ball over the line from a yard out after Clark Robertson's header came back off a post from a corner.
