Lee Selby says he would like to fight Abner Mares after the Welshman's IBF featherweight world title defence against Jonathan Victor Barros was called off.

Barros' failed medical test forced the abandonment on Friday.
Three-time champion Mares, who holds the regular WBA title, as opposed to Leo Santa Cruz's super belt, is also keen on the fight.
"That's a fight I would take straight away," said Selby.
"He's a big star in America so a fight between me and him, wherever it took place, over here or back in the UK, it would do massive numbers."
Negotiations for the fight could be relatively straightforward, as both fighters are advised by American promoter Al Haymon.
The cancellation of the Barros bout cost Selby, 29, a first outing in Las Vegas.
Selby admitted he might have to arrange another fight before he can set up a meeting with former super WBA champion Carl Frampton, who is eager to face the Welshman in Belfast.
Selby would like to defend his crown in Cardiff, and Mexican-American Mares would be happy to take on the man from Barry in his homeland.
"I'll fight anyone anywhere," Mares told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'll go to his country and fight him. I've got no problem with that because that's the type of fighter I am."
Mares, 31, met 29-year-old Selby at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday, with both fighters present as Northern Ireland's Frampton lost to Leo Santa Cruz on points.
"He [Selby] is a well-known fighter, obviously more in his country," added Mares.
"I'm a respectable, well-known fighter myself being a four-time world champion and holding a world title.
"We can unify world titles and make it interesting. I have no problems packing my bags and flying over there to his hometown because I know of his potential.
"I know the type of fighter he is and it will make it a good fight so I'm with it."
