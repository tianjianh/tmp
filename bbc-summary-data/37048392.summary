A map showing the modern day location of hundreds of thousands of historic images of London has been created.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Visitors to The London Picture Archive can search any address in the capital and find photos, maps, prints and paintings of how the area once looked.
It took two years to digitise and find the location of the pictures, which are from between 1450 and the present day.
The map has been made from the collections of the London Metropolitan Archives and Guildhall Art Gallery.
Images include well known sites in the capital such as Covent Garden and Tower Bridge, as well as less prominent sections of outer London.
