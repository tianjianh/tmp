Lifelong Worcestershire fan King, 66, who is to take over from former wicketkeeper John Elliott in 2015, is proud that his year in office will coincide with their 150th anniversary.
"It is a great honour to be asked to serve," said King.
"With the 150th anniversary next year, there is much to celebrate."
He added: "And the future is even brighter. My youth was spent at New Road watching the first Worcestershire side to win the County Championship exactly 50 years ago. And today's team of talented young players, and the redevelopment and transformation of the facilities at New Road, promise exciting times ahead."
"It is a wonderful decision," said Elliott, who bows out, having also previously spent eight years as the county's chairman. "He is a very passionate supporter of Worcestershire. He has a lot to offer. Already he's on the phone and emailing two or three times a week.
"I've been to his office for lunch twice and he has got a cricket ball there on the desk from when he got five wickets playing for the Bank and an Aston Villa football sign on the other side.
"He's passionate about Worcestershire and Villa. He's followed the county for a long time and he loves meeting and talking about former players like Roy Booth, Norman Gifford and the rest."
King's appointment follows the county's change of chairman, Stephen Taylor, 54,  having taken over from Percy Price, who stands down following the end of his maximum eight-year term.
The former Great Britain hockey international will have ex-Worcestershire and England opening batsman Tim Curtis, now director of sport at the city's Royal Grammar School, as his vice-chairman.
