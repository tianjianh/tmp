Eight fire appliances from counties Tyrone and Londonderry were sent to tackle the blaze at Stroanback in the Dunnyboe area of Strabane on Thursday.
Randy McComb, of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, said crews "worked tirelessly" against the fire.
"Tackling gorse fires undoubtedly puts extra strain on resources, in terms of firefighters and equipment," he added.
The cause of the fire is still being investigated, but Mr McComb said: "I would appeal to everyone to be vigilant and to report any suspicious behaviour or fires immediately.
"As well as the impact on [fire service] resources, gorse fire causes environmental damage to wildlife and the natural habitat."
