The former Doctor Who star will be joined in Stratford-upon-Avon by Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen.
"It's a variety bill, and the plays are a huge part of that," Tennant said. "We've got some of the biggest classical actors around."
Shakespeare Live! will be broadcast on BBC Two on 23 April.
Tennant, who played an acclaimed Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2008, is currently starring in the RSC's Richard II at London's Barbican.
Unveiling details of the live broadcast at the launch the BBC's Shakespeare Festival on Thursday, Tennant said: "We have opera, we have ballet, we have hip-hop - all celebrating Shakespeare and what he's done for our cultural heritage."
The live tribute show at the RSC theatre in Stratford coincides with Shakespeare's birthday weekend.
It will also feature Joseph Fiennes - who played the lead in the film Shakespeare in Love - the English National Opera, Birmingham Royal Ballet, and rapper Akala, founder of the Hip Hop Shakespeare Company.
The BBC Shakespeare Festival 2016 is billed as "the most far-reaching celebration of Shakespeare's work ever broadcast".   BBC director general Tony Hall said it aimed "to make Shakespeare irresistible to everybody".
Other festival highlights, some of them previously announced, include:
The festival sees the BBC in partnership with a number of arts organisations, such as the RSC.
Gregory Doran, the RSC's artistic director, said Shakespeare was still relevant and accessible after 400 years.
"Shakespeare is for everyone so we want as many people as possible to have a chance to experience his work this year.
"We are thrilled to collaborate with the BBC in a fantastic initiative to bring Shakespeare's legacy to audiences all over the UK, including work direct from the RSC's theatres in his home town."
Tennant said his first brush with live Shakespeare was seeing As You Like It in his school gym hall in the early 1980s.
"We all filed in and sat an watch this performance and I got blown away. I thought Touchstone was the coolest man I'd ever seen."
He added: "Shakespeare has been a huge part of my life, these characters and stories are catnip for actors."
