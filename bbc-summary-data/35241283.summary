In the best animation category, Anomalisa, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur, Minions and The Peanuts Movie received nominations.

This year British producer David Heyman - best known for the Harry Potter films, Gravity and Paddington - is among those being presented with special honours, alongside Grey's Anatomy and Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes.
The awards have a good record of predicting which film will go on to get Oscar nominations and win the Academy's best picture category.
Last year's winner Birdman went on to win the best picture Oscar.
This year's winners will be announced on 23 January at the Producer's Guild of America ceremony in Los Angeles.
