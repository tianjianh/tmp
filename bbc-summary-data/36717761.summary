Welsh Government launches taskforce to tackle valleys economy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taskforce to tackle "economic challenges" in the south Wales valleys has been set up by the Welsh government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lifelong learning minister Alun Davies told AMs the focus of the group would be employment and economic issues.
He said valleys communities were "dispirited and under-engaged" and it was time to listen and act on people's "real world circumstances".
Chairman Mr Davies said it would be "active and not a bureaucratic quango".
Plaid Cymru's Bethan Jenkins welcomed the move but said the outcomes of the taskforce had to be measured by an independent group and not the Welsh Government "otherwise it will be like marking your own work".
Conservative Mohammad Asghar said the chairman of the body should be independent of government and said communities should be properly consulted about its work.
Mr Davies said communities would be consulted.
