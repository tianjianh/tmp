'Scottish League Cup ambition for Celtic, not me', says Brendan Rodgers

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says winning the Scottish League Cup on Sunday would not give him any personal satisfaction.

If Celtic beat Aberdeen, it will be Rodgers' first trophy as a manager, but he stressed that he would not define his career in terms of silverware.
"My ambition is for Celtic, not me," he said.
"A lot of great coaches don't get the opportunity to win trophies, but it doesn't make them less good coaches."
Rodgers won a Championship play-off final with Swansea City, but so far no major silverware with former clubs Watford, Reading and Liverpool.
"When I started coaching, my aim in coaching was to improve players, to develop players and if you are fortunate enough and lucky enough as a coach to work with teams that allow you to win trophies then great," said the Northern Irishman.
"Lots of coaches, lots of managers never have that opportunity.
"Some do. They are blessed to be able to work with players that have the opportunity to do that, but it will never define me as a coach.
"It may others, but it doesn't me.
"My view has always been 'can I improve players, individually and as a team?' and of course the consequence of that is trophies and that is what we want to achieve.
"But, on a personal level, it doesn't affect me whatsoever.
"Hopefully, over the course of my career, people will respect my work with players and my behaviour off the field and that means more to me than a load of trophies."
Asked if his view on managerial success was unusual, Rodgers pointed to Lazio coach Marcelo Bielsa, who previously managed Argentina, Chile, Marseille and Athletic Bilbao, as someone he particularly admired.
"I worry for the club, the team, the players, I want them to be successful," he added.
"And, make no mistake, of course I want to win, but I don't lie in bed worrying about it, worrying what I have on my CV.
"There are some coaches I look at and respect all around the world, guys like Bielsa, who I have followed intently all my life.
"A brilliant coach, an innovator of players and teams and maybe he hasn't won a whole bagful of trophies over the course of his career.
"But he has had brilliant teams set up that I have always admired and that doesn't make him any worse or less a coach than anyone else."
