Guiseley secured their National League status after winning a seven-goal thriller against Torquay at Nethermoor.

The Lions' success came at the expense of Halifax, who drop into the National League North after managing just a 1-1 draw against Macclesfield.
Oli Johnson, Will Hatfield and Anthony Dudley all scored to give the hosts a 3-0 lead within the opening 30 minutes.
Nathan Blissett and Toby Ajala cut the lead but Dudley scored again before Shaun Harrad made it a nervy finale.
Halifax's failure to win means Guiseley stay up in their debut season in the National League, while Torquay finish three points off the relegation places after being 10 points adrift at the bottom of the table in February.
