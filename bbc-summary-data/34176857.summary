[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glan Clwyd Hospital and Denbigh Infirmary food hygiene improves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Denbighshire hospitals which had serious food safety standard failings uncovered by an inspection have now been given improved ratings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan had a two-star "improvement is necessary" rating in May in a report warning of major non-compliance with regulations.
Denbigh Infirmary's rating of one star was called "abysmal" by Clwyd West AM Darren Millar.
Both have now achieved four-star grades.
Control measures to combat clostridium difficile (C.diff) have also been stepped up at Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
Three deaths between April and June in north Wales were said to be directly attributable to the infection, while it played a part in two others.
The number of cases of C.diff per 100,000 people was 51 in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area, compared to 36 in Wales and 25 in England.
Tracey Cooper, the board's assistant director of nursing with responsibility for infection prevention, said in a report that the food-hygiene issue had been addressed immediately and a programme of unannounced kitchen inspections had started.
The board will discuss the report and C.diff and MRSA infection rates during a meeting on Tuesday.
