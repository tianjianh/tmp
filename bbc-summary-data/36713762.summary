An 86-year-old man accused of killing a woman who died when his car ploughed into a Kent coffee shop has made his first appearance in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lord, from Westerham, is charged with causing Valerie Deakin's death by dangerous driving in the Kent town on Christmas Eve.
Ms Deakin, 74, of Udimore, East Sussex, died when Mr Lord's Audi crashed into the town centre branch of Costa.
He was bailed to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 2 August.
Mr Lord had trouble hearing chairman of the bench Jackie Hamilton during his three-minute appearance at Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court.
Asked if he could hear proceedings, having gestured to family members in the public gallery, he said: "Not really."
Two men and two women were also taken to hospital after the crash. Another woman was treated for minor injuries.
