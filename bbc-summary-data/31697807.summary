[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The boss of Aer Lingus has written to his staff to reassure them about the airline's future and their terms of employment under a proposed takeover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways, has offered Â£1bn for the firm.
Unions have raised concerns about Aer Lingus jobs and working conditions.
But Aer Lingus chief executive Stephen Kavanagh said their firm would benefit from the deal and current employment terms and agreements would continue.
In a staff bulletin, Mr Kavanagh said the Irish airline would retain its brand, location and independence as company operating within IAG.
However, he said the deal would give Aer Lingus better access to global markets and support services.
Mr Kavanagh told staff that because of IAG's advantages of scale, Aer Lingus would benefit from the deal in terms of its costs and revenue.
He said the IAG offer was a vote of confidence in the Irish airline, which could continue to grow on a stand-alone basis if the takeover goes ahead.
