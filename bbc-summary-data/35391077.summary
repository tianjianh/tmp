Stephen David John McFarlane, from Glenville Park in Newtownabbey, appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday.
He was charged with attempting to kill a 26-year-old woman.
He was also accused of breaking into her home on the Ashgrove Road in Newtownabbey.
The court was told that Mr McFarlane launched "a frenzied knife attack" on the mother-of-two, allegedly inflicting a total of 27 stab wounds.
The woman remains in hospital, where her condition is described as stable.
Defence solicitor Matthew Higgins said he was not applying for bail and District Judge Bernie Kelly remanded McFarlane into custody to appear again on 19 February via video-link.
The alleged attack sparked a nationwide manhunt as police searched for Mr McFarlane.
The PSNI released his name and his car details as they sought to track him down.
Mr McFarlane is also charged with breaching a court imposed non-molestation order on 13 January.
He is further charged that on the following day he stole two sets of number plates, made off without paying for Â£40.01 of fuel and that on 15 January, he drove dangerously on the Doagh Road in Newtownabbey and failed to stop, remain or report an accident where damage was caused.
The hunt ended in a high speed pursuit, which stretched from the Doagh Road in Newtownabbey and culminated in Welland Street, a cul-de-sac close to the junction of the Newtownards and Holywood roads in east Belfast, where he was arrested.
