The funeral of a girl who died in a speedboat accident in Devon has taken place at Gloucester Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emily Gardner, 14, from Gloucester, was trapped under the vessel after her buoyancy aid snagged on part of the boat off Brixham earlier this month.
Family members and friends, including fellow pupils from Chosen Hill School, were among 750 people who attended the service.
Emily was on holiday with a friend's family at the time of the accident.
The song Angels by Robbie Williams was played while her coffin was carried into the cathedral. Snow Patrol's Chasing Cars was played on the way out.
Her parents Clive and Debbie and brother and sister Todd and Katie each released a white dove outside the cathedral at the end of the service.
The Reverend Susan Cooke, who conducted the service, said: "Emily was obviously a very fun loving and happy girl.
"All the people who came to pay tribute to her show how much she meant to everybody."
