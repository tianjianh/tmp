[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Blackburn Rovers sealed a valuable victory thanks to a first-half Sam Gallagher double against Nottingham Forest, who finished with 10 men.

Gallagher put them ahead early on when he coolly slotted home past Forest keeper Vladimir Stojkovic.
Gallagher doubled his tally before the break from close range after Corry Evans laid the ball to him.
Damien Perquis managed a late reply before Hildeberto Pereira was sent off for a second yellow card.
Stojkovic came up for a free-kick in the hopes of an equaliser, but Craig Conway pounced on the counter-attack and was brought down by Pereira who picked up a second booking.
The result means Blackburn lift themselves out of the Championship relegation places as they moved from 23rd to 21st.
Forest slip a place to 16th and have won just once in their past eight league matches.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "I've been an admirer of Gallagher for years. We had to work hard to get him here.
"He's not the finished article. He's willing to listen, learn, you see the pace he's got and he can score goals. He's not ready yet but I think in time he's going to be a very good player.
"We took one point from five games with all the turmoil at the start, (but) I think that's 10 points from the last six games.
"We're a decent team in the Championship so what we've got to do is show that level of consistency, which we have been doing."
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier: "We started very badly in the first half. For me we lost the game in the first half. I don't know why that's happened.
"We prepared very well and after Birmingham (3-1 win on Friday night) we had confidence. But it's a handicap for us if you play only 45 minutes of the 90.
"The second half was better and we are closer to a goal at the end, but it's not sufficient to play only one half."
