Mohammed Aziz, 50, was walking along Shobnall Street in Burton upon Trent in July when a silver Mondeo swerved across the road, mounted the pavement and hit him.
He remains in hospital in a coma almost a year on, police said.
Nadeem Akhtar, from Shobnall Street, was convicted at Stafford Crown Court and will be sentenced at a later date.
The 37-year-old was cleared of grievous bodily harm with intent.

A second man, Mohammed Zufeer, 27, of Horninglow Road North, Burton, was found guilty of assisting an offender.
Rehan Akhtar, 28, of Shobnall Street, was cleared of grievous bodily harm with intent.
Police said Mr Aziz was walking home alone on 20 July after visiting a local shop when he was struck down.
He suffered extensive head and facial injuries and remains in hospital in a critical condition.
The following day, the car was found by police in a pub car park covered with a sheet, its registration plates and windscreen missing.
Zufeer was the insured driver of the vehicle and police claimed he discarded a black bin bag behind a local takeaway.
Forensic checks revealed the bag contained clothing belonging to Nadeem which had fragments of glass from the Mondeo's windscreen in them.
Police said the incident stemmed from an ongoing dispute between the families which had previously involved numerous altercations, and erupted in disorder in the town.
"Akthar escalated the dispute to carry out completely an unacceptable act of violence - leaving a man fighting for his life and devastating an entire family. There is no doubt that Nadeem intended to kill Mr Aziz when he drove at him that night," Ch Insp Steve Maskrey said.
