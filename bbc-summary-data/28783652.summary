[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool 'highest' wind turbine scheme proposed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for what could be the highest wind turbines in England and Wales have been submitted in Hartlepool, Teesside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Permission is being sought for three single turbines over 200m (655ft) high at Graythorp Industrial Estate, Brenda Road West Industrial Estate and Tofts Road West.
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it believed these would be the highest in England and Wales.
Hartlepool Borough Council has recorded about 40 objections to the plans.
More than 300 consultation responses have been received from individuals, councils and other organisations.
The scheme developer is Hartlepool renewable energy company Seneca Global Energy Ltd.
Ward Hadaway solicitor Mark Whitehead, who is acting for the company, said single, taller turbines could generate the same volume of energy as three or four typical turbines used in other schemes.
"The increase in wind speeds at height allow the volume of renewable energy generation from each turbine to be maximised, whilst having the benefit of reducing the number of turbines used," he said.
"This is intended to deliver high levels of renewable power whilst minimising the visual impact on the surrounding area."
Of those replying to the consultation to date, just over one in 10 object on grounds such as reduction of property value, obstruction of view and effect on wildlife.
Further discussions are taking place about the location of turbines planned for Tofts Road West and Graythorp Industrial Estate.
The Ramblers Association and Network Rail pointed out their current proposed site left them within "topple distance" of the nearby railway line and buildings.
The application for three turbines with a maximum tip height - measured from the ground to the top of a turbine blade pointing upwards - of 206m (677ft) is due to be considered next year.
By comparison, turbines at Northumberland wind farms such as Lynemouth and Middlemoor are about 120-125m (about 400ft) high.
