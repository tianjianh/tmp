[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton Athletic were relegated from the Championship after they played out a goalless draw away at bottom club Bolton Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jose Riga's side needed to win to avoid the drop after four years in the second tier, but they failed to score in a tepid encounter at the Macron Stadium.
Bolton goalkeeper Ben Amos saved Simon Makienok's shot in a quiet first half.
The hosts almost stole three points when Oscar Threlkeld crossed for Darren Pratley, who failed to connect.
The result means Charlton will return to League One for the first time since 2012, when they set a then-record points total of 101 points on the way to the third-tier title.
After a ninth-placed finish in their first season back in the Championship, missing out on the play-off places by just three points, the Addicks have had a tough time on and off the pitch since.
Businessman Roland Duchatelet completed a takeover of the south-east London club in January 2014 but the Belgian, along with chief executive Katrien Meire, have been the subject of a number of protests from Charlton fans this season.
Supporters threw beach balls on to the pitch and blew whistles during their 2-0 win against Middlesbrough on 13 March and threw stress balls on the pitch in their 2-1 victory against Birmingham City on 2 April.
Charlton head coach Jose Riga told BBC Radio London:

"We were not at the level that we had to be today. Today, you feel the atmosphere, you feel it was very heavy for us.
"The situation at the club psychologically, certainly we were missing what we normally need in this kind of game.
"After that, we were missing almost everything on the pitch. Accuracy was not there, taking the right option, a lot of things.
"But of course, it's not today that things don't happen, it's earlier in the season and not just this game against Bolton."
