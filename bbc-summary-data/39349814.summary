Mike Flynn: Newport County boss says League Two survival 'not impossible'

Newport County boss Mike Flynn says achieving survival in League Two is "not impossible" after their 1-1 draw against Luton Town on Tuesday.

The Exiles were 11 points adrift at the bottom of the EFL when Flynn replaced Graham Westley on 9 March.
Flynn's side have taken seven points from his first four matches in charge and are now six points from safety.
"We're two wins behind them [Cheltenham Town] and it could come down to goal difference," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"It's not impossible [to stay up] but it's some mountain to climb. We've got some tough games coming up. I'm confident and believe in the players.
"The fight they are showing and the chances they are creating now is very encouraging. Cut out the silly mistakes and we're going to win a few games."
Newport came from behind to seal a point against Luton after conceding an early penalty, but were reduced to 10 men when Mark O'Brien received two yellow cards.
The Exiles travel to promotion-chasing Portsmouth on Saturday and will hope to record a third win in five league games.
"I can understand why Mark got the second booking but the boys actually recovered really well so it's a bit disappointing he's out for Saturday," Flynn said.
"There's competition for places, we've taken seven out of 12 points. Would I have taken that before I came in? I probably would.
"It closes the gap to two games. Let's hope it puts the pressure on the other teams and they start feeling it.
"We'll never stop fighting as long as I'm here, that's for sure."
