Former Celtic and Everton defender Stubbs took over from Terry Butcher last summer and led Hibs to second place in last season's Championship.
However, the Easter Road side missed out on promotion via the play-offs.
"Supporters would agree that they have seen a lot of positive changes over the past year, and I know there is a lot more to come," head coach Stubbs said.
John Doolan and Andy Holden will continue to assist Stubbs in what he describes as "the work in progress".
"I think most supporters would agree that whatever disappointments they have suffered in recent seasons are behind us. We are on the right track now, we're trying to play a winning and exciting brand of football that they want to see and be part of," he added.
"We made decent progress last year, this season we all know we need to get promoted.
"This is football, so there will be setbacks along the way. It's how we react to those setbacks that will eventually determine how successful we are. If we buckle and fight amongst ourselves we will lose. If we stick together and show our collective commitment, we will win. I'm confident that we can win."
Chief Executive Leeann Dempster said: "This is a tremendous demonstration of our ambition at this club. We have a really talented management team, and their desire to stick with us shows that they understand we are determined to get this club back to the top.
"Supporters wanted to see that commitment, and Alan, John and Taff [Andy Holden] have all shown their own determination to restore this club to the upper end of Scottish football, where it belongs."
