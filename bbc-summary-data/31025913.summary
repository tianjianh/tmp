[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway motorbike sidecar tour licence bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first ever application has been made for a private hire licence to run motorbike and sidecar tours in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Jamieson has offered the service free to holiday cottage residents on his Kirkpatrick Durham farm.
However, he says it has proved so popular that he would now like to run it as a "side business".
In order to do so, he would need to get approval from Dumfries and Galloway Council's licensing panel.
It is the first time the authority has dealt with an application of its kind.
In his application, Mr Jamieson seeks a licence for himself and one other driver.
He said he planned to offer trips of between one and four hours throughout the Stewartry area which would only take place in dry weather during daylight hours.
He also stressed that, although not legally required, helmets would be supplied to all passengers.
Police have been consulted on the plans and have requested that seat belts and guard rails should be fitted to the sidecars involved.
That suggestion has been opposed by Mr Jamieson as he says they are exempt from seat belt legislation and could actually cause worse injuries in the event of an accident.
The licensing panel will meet to decide the application on Tuesday.
