Select Property Group plans to create 441 self-contained studios at the 2.9-acre site located next to the University of Glasgow.
The total value of the completed development project will be Â£67m.
The site will be developed, let and managed under Select Property Group's Vita Student brand.
Select's chief executive, Mark Stott, said the site purchase was a major milestone for the business.
He added: "Glasgow is Scotland's largest city and houses six universities which attract an international market of more than 80,000 students as one of Europe's most popular places to study.
"The redevelopment of the city's west end presents an outstanding opportunity for us to deliver a legacy of unique and inspirational living environments for the students of Glasgow."
Work on the site is scheduled to start later this month.
