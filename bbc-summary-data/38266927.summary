[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A friend of an 82-year-old murder victim has told how the pensioner could not understand why her bank account was overdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Margaret Dow, 81, said Mary Logie was "very upset" about having so little money.
Mrs Dow was giving evidence at the trial of Sandra Weir, who denies murdering Mrs Logie and stealing thousands of pounds from her.
She said: "Over the last year, she was starting to say she was a bit short."
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Mrs Logie's finances became so strained that she had to cut back on doing things she enjoyed such as her weekly visits to the hairdresser.
Giving evidence on the fifth day of the trial of Sandra Weir, Mrs Dow said: "She told me she got a letter from the bank saying something about an overdraft.
"She was very upset - she didn't understand why because she never went to what she called the hole in the wall."
When prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice QC asked Mrs Dow whether her friend had to cut back on doing nice things which Mrs Logie regarded as being important, Mrs Dow replied: "Yes."
She added: "She stopped going to the hairdresser every week.
"She had a manicure and she had to cut back on that as well."
Mrs Weir, of Leven, Fife, denies murdering her neighbour Mrs Logie and seven other charges.
Mrs Dow told the court that she was a long-standing friend of Mrs Logie.
She said: "She was like a sister."
She told Mr Prentice that Mrs Logie was a very independent and dependable person.
Mr Prentice asked Mrs Dow what her friend was like with money.
She said: "She was alright with money. She was like most people - she had to watch. We both had to watch the pennies.
"Over the last year, she was starting to say she was a little bit short.
"She would say to me 'I don't know if I'm going to manage to get my hair done this week. I might leave it until next week.' That wasn't like her.
Mr Prentice also asked Mrs Dow to describe a ring which belonged to Mrs Logie.
Mrs Dow told him it was an onyx pinky ring.
She said Mrs Logie, who was known to friends as Rae, was pleased with it and wore it often.
Mr Prentice asked: "Have you any idea why that ring might have been in a pawnbrokers-type shop?"
Mrs Dow replied: "None whatsoever."
Mr Prentice then asked: "Did Rae ever say she wanted to pawn her ring?"
Mrs Dow replied: "No."
Mrs Weir is accused of killing the pensioner by repeatedly striking her on the head and body with a rolling pin or similar instrument at Mrs Logie's home on 5 January this year.
She also faces charges including attempting to defeat the ends of justice and stealing unknown quantities of money, two rings and Mrs Logie's bank card or cards.
Prosecutors allege she used Mrs Logie's bank card to steal Â£4,460 at cash machines between December 2014 and 4 January this year.
Mrs Weir's lawyer, Murray Macara QC, has lodged a special defence of alibi in relation to the murder charge.
The trial before judge Michael O'Grady QC continues.
