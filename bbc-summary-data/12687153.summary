[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welshpool flood defence scheme's summer start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£650,000 scheme to reduce the risk of flooding in Welshpool is expected to start this summer, says Powys council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority said the town centre had a long history of flooding, with 148 properties thought to be under threat.
Problems are caused by blocked culverts and high flows in the town's Lledan brook, the council said.
The scheme will receive funding from Powys council, the Welsh Assembly Government and the European Union.
Powys council said: "The scheme aims to increase the standard of flood defences on the Lledan brook and adjoining water courses, as well as carrying out a number of flood defence improvements on the Montgomery Canal."
Plans for the project went on display for one day at Welshpool town hall on Tuesday.
