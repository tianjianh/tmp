Captain Eve Watson had given the Reds the lead as early as the third minute and her side never looked back.
She went on to complete her hat-trick, with Holly Muirhead and 16-year-old Natasha Keen also netting for the hosts.
The nine-goal winning margin beat the previous biggest, an 8-0 win in 2010.
The game was the first Muratti in charge for Guernsey boss Jordy Gallienne, who took over in January, and he watched his side slip behind in the opening stages when Watson slotted in after good work from Andrade and Keen.
Marta Ascensao hit the crossbar from long range before Andrade got her first, slamming the ball into the roof of the net.
Watson, just a day after watching her brother net the only goal in the men's Muratti, made it 3-0 at the break.
Andrade grabbed her second despite Joelle Pengelley's efforts on the line and then Keen, on her Muratti debut, capitalised on substitute goalkeeper Alice Davis' fumble to make it 5-0.
Player of the match Andrade beat the offside trap to complete her hat-trick before Watson got her third soon after from close range.
Muirhead slotted home with 20 minutes to go and Guernsey would have feared a double-figure scoreline.
To their credit though, they had perhaps their best spell, preventing the Reds from getting their ninth until the fifth minute of stoppage time, when Andrade kept her composure when through one-on-one with the goalkeeper.
Jersey captain Eve Watson:
"Our aim was to come out and pressure them more, get the ball and just attack as much as we could.
"Playing at home and with it being the Muratti record that's even more special.
"I've scored a hat-trick and I'm proud of that, but I'm just more proud of all the girls and what they've put in today."
Guernsey manager Jordy Gallienne:
"Had we got the first goal we felt that we could apply some pressure and could compete, but once that first one went in the floodgates started to open.
"It's frustrating because you can see that they [the Guernsey players] can compete, but they just didn't show up.
"We were chasing the ball a lot, our ball retention was really poor, and when you find yourself defending for long periods you're always going to concede goals."
