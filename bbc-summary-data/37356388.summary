The Bluebirds dropped to 21st in the Championship and have won once in their opening seven matches.
It is Cardiff's worst start to a season in 12 years after what Trollope agreed was the team's poorest display so far.
"Apologies to the supporters, they have travelled a long way and seen a performance that was unacceptable," he said.
"I'm not going to stand here and give any excuses.
"We can stand here and talk about systems and ways of playing but there are some basic requirements in football to do well and win games and those were lacking.
"We were probably worthy of a goal in that second period but I'm not kidding myself, the game was done."
Trollope was appointed at the end of last season, taking over from Russell Slade who guided the team to eighth in the table.
But they have not won since the 2-1 victory over Blackburn on 17 August, with their only other points coming from draws at Birmingham and Fulham.
Cardiff face Leeds at home on Saturday following their 2-1 win over Blackburn on Tuesday.
"We've got a lot of work to do before Saturday," admitted Trollope.
"We're of course concerned. We didn't deserve to be going home with anything tonight.
"There's pressure on every manager every game and on every coach.
"The pressure is always there and everyone knows the situation and I believe in how I work and I believe in the group of players."
