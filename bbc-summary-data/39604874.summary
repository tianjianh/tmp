[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-3 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Sharp scored twice as League One champions Sheffield United recorded their sixth successive league victory with a comfortable win over MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharp's goals in the second half came after strike partner Leon Clarke had put the visitors ahead before the break, and it was a lead that never looked like being challenged by the mid-table Dons.
Backed by over 7,000 travelling fans, United started on the front foot and should have taken the lead through Sharp inside nine minutes, but his effort smacked against the post following good work from Chris Basham.
Chris Wilder's team went ahead on the stroke of half-time, though, as Clarke rose highest to head home from John Fleck's inviting corner.
And Sharp added a brace for the Blades in the second half after confusion in the Dons defence twice saw the forward race through on goal before firing home.
