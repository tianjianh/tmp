Dumbarton battled their way to a precious point in their battle against relegation in a goals drought at the Rock against Raith Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers, chasing a play-off spot, will see this as a chance lost.
But they found the home side in fighting spirit and capable of producing some good football on a greasy surface.
In fact, it could have been worse for the Kirkcaldy side as Robert Thomson missed some chance in the first half.
A long kick out from his goalie, Alan Martin, was miss-timed by Jean-Yves M'Voto, the Rovers centre half, and Thomson was clean through one-on-one with the goalkeeper.
But somehow, having all but rounded him, he allowed Kevin Cuthbert to get a flailing hand on the ball to touch it round the post.
Ryan Stevenson was the pick of a gathering of former Hearts players on view alongside his Sons' team-mate, Darren Barr, and opponents Kevin McHattie and Rudi Skacel - to say nothing of Rovers manager Gary Locke.
He controlled things with great style in the middle of the park and engineered a performance that brought the point - and a series of second-half opportunities none of which his team-mates could convert.
Dumbarton were, however, actually worth more than the draw.
Dumbarton manager Steven Aitken: "We were the better team and we should have won it.
"At the start of the season, we were written off as the whipping boys and that was hurtful.
"But we have good players here. Ryan Stevenson showed why we worked so hard to get him."
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "I thought a draw was a fair result. Both teams had chances and Dumbarton will be hard to beat for most teams here.
"The quality of the football was good on a difficult surface."
