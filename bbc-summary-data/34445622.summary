Manchester's Victoria railway station has officially reopened following a £44m upgrade.

The modernisation project included a new £20m roof and restoration of the station's period features.
Run by Network Rail, the project included a tram stop with four new platforms and three new tracks that reopened in February.
It comes after Victoria was labelled Britain's "worst station" in a 2009 Department for Transport report.
Unveiling a plaque, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the redevelopment was a "remarkable project".
The roof had leaked since 1996 when it was damaged by an IRA bomb which exploded in the city centre.
Mr McLoughlin said: "It's fantastic to see Manchester Victoria once again a station fit for the city. It's now a symbol of opportunity, not neglect."
Victoria station first opened in January 1844. Some six million passengers use the station each year.
Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: "For far too long people travelling in and out of Manchester Victoria had to make do with a tired and dark station."
