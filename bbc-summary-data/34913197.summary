John Concannon, 71, has dementia and hearing difficulties and went missing on Tuesday 10 November.
He was last seen getting off a bus in the Lenamore Road area of Derry.
His brother,  Michael, said the family "are worried sick", adding:  "We have been searching Derry and Donegal and no joy."
Family and friends have been helping the police and search and rescue teams on a daily basis.
"CCTV footage showed that he was in the Lenamore area last week but we have been asking everyone and looking the area," he said.
"My mother was born in Burt in Donegal. John always lived in Derry but with him having dementia he has regressed to that time period.
"We have also been searching parts of Burnfoot in Donegal too and a nearby school has CCTV that we are checking out.
"If anyone has any information then we really want them to contact the police.
"The public have been great in helping us search for him."
John is described as being 5ft 6in tall, of medium build and with grey hair.
He was wearing a black and grey beanie hat, a black coat, checked shirt and navy trousers.
