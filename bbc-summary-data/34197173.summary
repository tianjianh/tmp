An optometrist who claimed laser eye surgery was "mandatory" for RAF pilots has been suspended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Margetts made the claim to an undercover BBC reporter at a Bristol branch of Optical Express.
The firm said "patient care is our utmost priority" and said Mr Margetts had been suspended while disciplinary proceedings took place.
Mr Margetts told the BBC earlier he had not been asked to make the claim by Optical Express.
During the undercover filming, for the BBC programme Inside Out, broadcast on Monday, Mr Margetts claimed fighter pilots were required to have laser eye surgery. The RAF said Mr Margetts' claim was not true.
When asked if the procedure was "100% safe", he replied, "oh yeah".
He told the BBC he must have "mis-heard" the question about whether the treatment was 100% safe. He added that he always explained the potential risks of the procedure.
An Optical Express spokesman said: "All of our clinicians are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are communicating in clear and simple language that patients understand and that they are fully explaining the potential risks, benefits and range of outcomes of eye surgery.
"The statements broadcast by Inside Out West are entirely against our practices and are contrary to all of the guidance provided to our teams."
He added Mr Margetts had been working for the company since November 2014 and had been "regularly appraised", with the "most recent review of his clinical work" taking place last month.
He said: "None of these statements were made in the supervised patient consultations he carried out."
