[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 0-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Rodman's early goal continued Shrewsbury's 100% start to the League One season as they beat AFC Wimbledon in an intense physical encounter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rodman found himself on the end of Shaun Whalley's cross in the sixth minute, heading the ball past George Long and into the bottom-right corner.
Wimbledon looked livelier in the second half and their best chance of an equaliser came from a Dean Parrett free-kick in the 56th minute but his effort sailed over.
Fatigue from Tuesday's 120-minute outing against Brentford in the EFL Cup showed as the home side struggled to find momentum in attack, failing to add to the point earned against Scunthorpe last weekend.
Paul Hurst's side dominated possession early on, with Rodman and Whalley frequently firing the ball at Long, who coped with the barrage well.
Shrewsbury's attack was just as punishing in the second half and Carlton Morris looked to extend their lead but his attempt was halted by on-loan Sheffield United keeper Long.
