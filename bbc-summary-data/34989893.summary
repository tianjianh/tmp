The alleged leader of an organised crime group that smuggled about 100 migrants a day into the European Union has been arrested in Liverpool.

A total of 22 other suspects, mainly of Syrian and Greek origin, were also held in Austria, Greece and Sweden.
The group, which has been active since 2013, earned an estimated total of nearly Â£7.1m (10 million euros), Europol said.
Members are believed to have smuggled mainly Syrian migrants from Turkey.
The alleged leader, who has lived in different European countries, was arrested by the National Crime Agency at a Liverpool address.
The suspects are believed to have set up headquarters in Greece, where migrants - either in Turkey or on their way to Greece - would contact them for assistance with their journeys to northern Europe.
The migrants would pay by cash or money-transfer for services including transport, housing and forged travel documents, Europol said.
The transport, which usually took them via the Balkans, was usually carried out by Greek nationals co-ordinated by an Albanian national, who worked with the alleged group leader, Europol said.
The agency added that the criminal group, which also included people of Palestinian origin, had now been "dismantled" after the simultaneous arrests across Europe.
