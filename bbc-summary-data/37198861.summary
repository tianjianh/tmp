Outlander follows the story of Claire Randall, a World War Two nurse who is mysteriously swept back in time from the 1940s to the 18th Century Scotland.
The TV show is adapted from books written by US author Diana Gabaldon.
The battle scenes have been filmed in a field at Greengairs. Culloden, near Inverness, is classed as a war grave.
A Jacobite force led by Bonnie Prince Charlie was defeated by a government army in the battle on 16 April 1746.
Season two of Outlander was shown in the UK on Amazon Prime earlier this year.
The new scenes shot at Greengairs feature the character Jamie Fraser, who is played by actor Sam Heughan.
The third series is expected to start the action in Scotland before switching to the Caribbean and North America.
Locations for the show include Newtonmore's Highland Folk Museum and Doune Castle near Stirling.
The folk museum holds an annual Outlander Day to celebrate the use of its reconstruction of a 1700s township for scenes.
