Emergency department patients are facing "significant" waits at north Wales' three district hospitals due to demand, health bosses have said.

They called on people to consider whether emergency care was necessary due to pressure on Wrexham Maelor Hospital, Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan and Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.
The issue has also led to ambulances being delayed, bosses said.
Other Welsh hospitals have reported increased pressures this month.
A Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board spokesperson said: "We are doing all we can to maintain timely care for our patients but this is becoming increasingly more difficult at the present time."
Morriston Hospital in Swansea said it had seen an "exceptional spike" in the proportion of very sick older people and fewer patients had been sent home.
Aneurin Bevan and Cwm Taf health boards in south Wales both appealed to people only to come to their emergency units if absolutely necessary, citing high demand on services.
