The Royal Shakespeare Company has staged a new type of drama with hundreds of emergency services workers involved in an exercise at the famous theatre complex in Stratford-upon-Avon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Planned for three months, Exercise Titus tested the response to a mock firearms incident at the RSC in Shakespeare's home town.
It was "not in response to any threat," police said.
The operation was contained within the grounds of the RSC.
RSC executive director Catherine Mallyon said: "We are continuously updating our own major incident plan and we train our staff to deal with a whole range of possible events from the impact of severe weather to technology failures.
"Having the chance to take part in this multi-agency exercise allows us to observe and ask questions about the appropriate management of serious incidents, which will help us with our own future planning."
Staff and officers from Warwickshire fire service, the Warwickshire and West Mercia police forces and West Midlands Ambulance Service took part.
