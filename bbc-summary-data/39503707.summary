Lloyds names locations for 100 branch closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lloyds Bank has announced the locations of 100 branches that it plans to close between July and October.

They are among a programme of 400 branch closures already announced in principle.
Some 54 Lloyds branches will be affected, alongside 24 Bank of Scotland and 22 Halifax branches.
There will also be a net reduction of 325 staff, who were told about the plan on Wednesday morning.
They are among the 9,000 staff whose job cuts were also previously announced.
Lloyds said the closures were the result of fewer branch transactions.
"Our branches will continue to play a vital role in our multi-channel approach to meeting the full range of customer needs, and we expect to continue to have the biggest branch network in the UK," a Lloyds spokesperson said.
Last month RBS and NatWest announced the closure of 158 branches across the UK, and in January HSBC announced a further 62 closures.
The trade union Unite, which represents many bank workers, called for an end to the process.
"The continuous stream of branch closures announced by the UK's retail bank branches appears to show no signs of ending, " said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer.
"The loss of a further 100 local banks will be painful for high streets across the country to absorb."
Last week Lloyds revealed plans to shrink hundreds of branches in size, while opening several new flagship centres.
It will be left with 1,950 branches by the end of the year - still the largest network of any UK high street bank.
The full list of the branches to close are:
Beauly, Beith, Bonar Bridge, Coldstream, Dalbeattie, Dalry (Kirkcudbright), Dornoch, Edinburgh Goldenacre, Edinburgh North Morningside, Fortrose, Gatehouse, Glasgow 235 Sauchiehall Street, Gorebridge, Gullane, Helmsdale, Kingussie, Lairg, Lauder, Newtown St Boswells, Port William, Stewarton, West Linton, Wigtown and Wooler.
