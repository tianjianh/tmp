The 42-year-old had been in charge at Gigg Lane for almost three years and led the Shakers to promotion from League Two in 2015.
But Flitcroft's side, beaten 5-0 in the FA Cup first-round replay at AFC Wimbledon in his last match on Tuesday, had lost seven league games in a row.
Assistant boss Ben Futcher has also left, with Bury 16th in the third tier.
Following Tuesday's heavy defeat at fellow League One side AFC Wimbledon, former Shakers midfielder Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester that he would work hard to try and turn the club's fortunes around.
"I'm hurting, the fans are hurting and I understand that," he said. "That hurt makes me ever more determined to put it right for them."

Flitcroft succeeded Kevin Blackwell as Bury manager in December 2013, having been sacked as Barnsley boss less than a fortnight earlier.
He led the Shakers from the bottom of League Two to a mid-table finish in his first season in charge, before guiding them to third place and promotion in the following campaign.
Bury ended last season in 16th place in League One and Flitcroft was named the division's manager of the month in September this season.
Flitcroft becomes the second manager in League One to leave this week, after Charlton parted company with Russell Slade on Monday.
Bury said they would make a further statement on Thursday.
