Engineers aim for Queensferry Crossing end of year deadline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queensferry Crossing engineers are using every available break in the weather to ensure the bridge can be completed by the end of this year.

The project directors insist confidence remains high the deadline will be met.
Plans are already under way for a series of events which will give the public access to the Â£1.4bn crossing before it opens to traffic.
The crossing was ordered by ministers because of cable corrosion on the main suspension of the Forth Road Bridge.
About 1,300 workers are now employed on the project which is scheduled to be completed by December 2016.
Michael Martin, project director for the construction joint venture, said: "I believe we can get traffic over the bridge by the end of the year. It's not a guarantee as it will depend on the weather but I believe it is possible.
"I believe I've got a team of people here who are capable of doing that and who are committed to achieving that if it is possible.
"We programme optimistically and then we face the conditions that arrive.
"When we simply can't do anything we have to accept it's not possible but we don't accept that willingly."
David Climie, the project director for Transport Scotland, said: "We are on target for the end of 2016 to have traffic on the new crossing providing we get average weather."
