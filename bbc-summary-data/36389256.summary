Thousands of bikers will complete a lap of the Isle of Man TT course later in memory of all racers who have lost their lives to the sport.

The Simon Andrews Legacy Lap was set up in 2014 following the Worcestershire TT star's death at the North West 200.
Simon's sister Claire Jupp said this year would have "added poignancy" after the deaths of rising stars Billy Redmayne and Malachi Mitchell Thomas.
On Saturday, a further two competitors were killed on the event's opening day.
Sidecar driver Dwight Beare, 27, crashed near the Rhencullen section of the Mountain Course while Paul Shoesmith, 50, from Cheshire, died in a crash on Sulby Straight during solo practice.
Last year more than 5,000 riders took part in the tribute lap.
Manx soldier Mr Redmayne, 25, died in April after sustaining serious head injuries during a crash at the Oliver's Mount Spring Cup in Scarborough.
Mitchell Thomas, 20, from Chorley in Lancashire, died earlier this month after crashing during the Supertwins race at the NW200 in Northern Ireland.
Both men had been hoping to make their debuts at this year's TT festival.
Ms Jupp said: "It is very important that fallen racers are not forgotten. Last year the procession stretched back for 15 miles, which shows the respect that exists."
The "legacy lap", which will have a full police escort, will set off from the TT grandstand at 10:00 BST.
