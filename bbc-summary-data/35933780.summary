Eastleigh's Paul Reid says playing through the pain barrier is part of his job as club captain, after breaking his nose for the 11th time.

The 34-year-old ex-Barnsley defender sustained his latest break during the 1-0 win over Torquay on Easter Monday.
"I've had three operations on it but I think I'll leave the fourth one until I hang up my boots, because I'm likely to do it again," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"I'll have to start wearing a crash helmet."
He added: "You cannot be leading the lads sat on the touchline. I see it as part of a centre-back's job and as part of my job as captain."
Reid, who began his career with Carlisle and has also had spells at Northampton, Colchester and Scunthorpe, has made 22 appearances for Eastleigh this term.
The Spitfires are unbeaten in their last five matches and sit two points outside the National League play-off places, having won just once in the 10 league games prior to their recent upturn.
"It was well documented that we went on a bit of a poor run. We could not buy a win at one point but our form has turned at the right time," said Reid.
