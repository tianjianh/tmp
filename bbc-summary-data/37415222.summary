[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham City 2-2 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham twice came from behind to claim a point against Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Preston led as Alex Baptiste poked home a corner at the far post but Blues were soon level through defender Ryan Shotton's powerful header.
However the visitors reclaimed the lead within five minutes courtesy of Daniel Johnson's well struck free-kick.
Birmingham struck the crossbar through David Cotterill before Che Adams found a right-foot volleyed finish from Jonathan Grounds' cross to equalise.
The draw stretches Birmingham's unbeaten run to six league games and keeps them inside the top six on goal difference, but Gary Rowett's side almost fell to a second home defeat of the campaign late on.
Callum Robinson fired in a shot from substitute Aiden McGeady's throughball which forced Adam Legzdins into a smart save.
Robinson was twice denied by the Birmingham goalkeeper in the closing 10 minutes as Preston pushed for just a second away win of the season.
Legzdins was also on hand to palm a powerful Greg Cunningham shot over the crossbar just after half-time.
