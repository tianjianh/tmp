Squash seeks answers to continued Olympic exclusion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The World Squash Federation will seek answers from the International Olympic Committee over the sport's continued exclusion from the Olympic Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Squash, bowling and wushu failed to make the list of new sports recommended for the 2020 games in Tokyo.
WSF President Narayana Ramachandran said: "We presented a strong case, and find this difficult to understand."
Skateboarding, surfing, sport climbing, baseball/softball and karate discover next August if they will be included.
He added: "We confirmed the low cost and highlighted domestic medal potential via two top world juniors from Japan.
"We even offered to provide the two all-glass show courts at no cost to the hosts and for them to remain in Japan as a legacy of the Games."
