Lee McCulloch has revealed that his former boss Lee Clark has advised him to succeed him as Kilmarnock manager.

Clark joined English League One Bury on Wednesday and the Killie board has since placed McCulloch in charge of the first team until the end of the season.
"He said 'go and grab your opportunity, you're good enough'," McCulloch, 38, told BBC Scotland.
"He's said some very nice things about me and told the board I should get the job, but we shall see."
McCulloch plans to meet the board in the next few days to discuss a permanent appointment.
However, he insists no decision will be made until after Sunday's league game at home to Aberdeen.
"Everything has happened so quickly so I've not had a chance to talk with the board," he said.
"It's a great club with a great stadium and catchment area. The youth academy policy is brilliant. The positives outweigh the negatives at this club by a country mile.
"When players come to the latter part of their career, they think I want get into coaching and because they've worked with a variety of managers they think I want to be a manager.
"It doesn't scare me but I need to think about it.
"I don't think you'll ever know if you are ready. I've been doing it for a year and a half. I've got all of my coaching badges. I've done a media course. I've been abroad to see how managers there work and I want to get better every day.
"People will say I'm ready but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating."
The former Scotland midfielder, who will be assisted by Peter Leven, was in temporary charge of Kilmarnock a year ago when Gary Locke resigned, only to make way for Clark.
Kilmarnock director John Kiltie told BBC Scotland on Wednesday that he felt McCulloch "had done very well in the role" in that spell and so had "no reason to doubt his ability to take us forward until the end of the season".
"Perhaps Lee might be interested in taking the job on a full-time basis should he be given the opportunity and should he in fact apply for the job," said Kiltie.
