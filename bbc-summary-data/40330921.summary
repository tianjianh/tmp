Fosu, 21, has agreed a two-year deal and is the Addicks' third signing of the summer, after Bradford City duo Mark Marshall and Billy Clarke.
He scored five goals in 33 League Two appearances last season while on loan at League Two club Colchester.
"When I heard [Charlton manager] Karl [Robinson] was in for me, it made the decision for me," said Fosu.
"He's worked with a lot of young players so hopefully I can produce for him," he told the club website.
Robinson added: "He's one that excites fans, his feet are phenomenal and hopefully we'll be seeing flashes of that next season."
