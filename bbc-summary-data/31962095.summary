[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 4m (13ft) bronze sculpture will be situated beside the River Thames at Runnymede and will be unveiled on 14 June.
It shows the Queen in full Garter Robes and has been inspired by the 1954 and 1969 portraits by Pietro Annigoni.
It has been gifted by Runnymede Magna Carta Legacy, a charity reported to have raised more than Â£300,000.
The unveiling of the statue, which will be located within Runnymede Pleasure Ground, coincides with the Thames River Pageant.
Runnymede Borough Council has invited members of the public to comment on the proposed statue, and the landscaping of the garden surrounding it, by 27 March.
