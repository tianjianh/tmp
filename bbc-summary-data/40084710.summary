Twenty-two people died in the explosion at the end of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May.
Chris Parker, 33, said he comforted a seriously-injured eight-year-old girl and a woman who died in his arms.
Jessica Parker, of Sprowston, met her son at the weekend for the first time in five years. She did not know he was homeless until seeing him on TV.
Speaking about their meeting, Ms Parker said: "It was heart wrenching, absolutely heart wrenching to know that he actually still wanted his mum.
"He told me very matter-of-factly what he did and said, 'Mum, I've just done what anybody else would do'.
"I said, 'I don't think so Chris, I think you did something really wonderful and you need to remember that'.
"He's going to be alright, I know he is."
Mr Parker had been begging in the arena foyer when the bomb went off.
He comforted a seriously injured little girl and helped a woman in her 60s who was badly hurt.
He told the media last Tuesday: "She passed away in my arms.  I haven't stopped crying."
A fundraising page set up to help Mr Parker has raised more than Â£50,000.
Ms Parker plans to visit her son again this weekend.
