Margaret Gibson has been recognised for spending more than 20 years mentoring young people across Scotland.
She is among 10 Scottish winners of a Queen's Award for Enterprise this year.
They include Cumbernauld-based raincoat manufacturer Mackintosh Ltd and Edinburgh travel firm Rabbie's Trail Burners.
Enterprise support professional Ms Gibson is a voluntary mentor with Young Enterprise Scotland and business incubator Entrepreneurial Spark.
She spent more than 20 years with the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust, rising to deputy chief executive.
Dundee-based Ms Gibson said: "I am delighted to receive this award - I feel it is not really for me but for all of the young entrepreneurs I have worked with.
"One of the things that I feel most strongly about is the need for young entrepreneurs to make links and connections with people.
"That way, rather than trying to make it on your own, you're part of a big family of people."
Another recipient of the enterprise promotion award is Nelson Gray, who is based in Roslin, Midlothian.
He has been recognised for directly providing numerous start-up and early stage entrepreneurs with funding, support and mentoring.
The other eight awards have gone to companies for achieving outstanding overseas sales growth.
They include Mackintosh Ltd, which manufactures traditional raincoats from its two factories in Cumbernauld and Nelson, Lancashire.
The company sells through distributors in the US and Japan, and via agents in Europe. It also has flagship stores in London and Tokyo.
Another winner is Rabbie's Trail Burners, which provides scheduled mini-coach tours, holiday packages and other travel services for international consumers and trade.
The award panel noted that its passenger numbers on scheduled tours in 2013 reached 61,065 - an increase of 36% from 2011.
With 90% of its clients based overseas, Rabbie's sells through its multi-lingual website, tour operators and local agents overseas.
Other international trade winners include Motherwell-based Consarc Engineering Ltd, which designs, manufactures and installs atmosphere furnaces, and Aberdeenshire-based Aubin Ltd, a supplier of chemical solutions for the oil and gas sector.
