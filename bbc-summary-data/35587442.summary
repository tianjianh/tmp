The 35-year-old loose-head made his debut for the region in 2004, and has played 164 times for the the Blues.
In addition to his 121 Wales caps, Jenkins has played five Tests for the British and Irish Lions.
"We are very pleased that Gethin has signed to extend his career at Cardiff Blues," said head coach Danny Wilson.
"Gethin is a vastly experienced prop who demands the highest standards from himself and those around him.
"[He] will also be the ideal role model and mentor for the talented young players within our squad and those coming through our system."
Jenkins made his international debut in 2002 and played in the sides that claimed the Six Nations Grand Slam titles in 2005, 2008 and 2012.
His latest Wales appearance came in the 27-23 win over Scotland on Saturday, 13 February when he was a second-half substitute.
Jenkins started his career at Pontypridd before joining the Celtic Warriors when regional rugby was introduced in 2003 and then the Blues following the Warriors' demise.
He has been at the Arms Park ever since, apart from one season in Toulon in 2012-13, when he played in and won the Heineken Cup final.
