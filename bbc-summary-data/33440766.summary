Greek debt crisis: Fear and loathing in Europe media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is a sense of urgency and exasperation in the European press as Greece prepares its new proposals.

Germany's Die Welt says Europe "waits in vain for a reform list from Athens", while France's Le Figaro writes that Greek PM Alexis Tsipras "plays with the nerves of the Europeans".
Many papers worry about the impact of the Greek crisis on the rest of Europe.
A headline in Greece's Kathimerini daily asks "Euro or Drachma on Sunday?" - the day when European leaders meet for an emergency summit on the proposals.
The Greek papers are aware of the seriousness of the new deadline. "This time, yes, it's an ultimatum. And in a form that leaves no doubt," writes the centrist Greek daily Ethnos.
"Within a few days we should decide what we want. And there are two prospects: either move to a new programme or forget the country's European course. It is up to us to choose what we prefer. And ultimately, at what cost."
Ethnos says this is the most difficult position that a Greek leader has found himself in since the end of military rule in the country in 1974.
"Now is the prime minister's hour. And this time it's not a figure of speech," the paper says.
Italy's La Repubblica highlights the European Union's "tough position" on Greece, saying that "For the first time, European governments appear united."
But many commentators argue that this position has not been tough enough.
"Merkel offers Greece a new package worth billions - after all," complains the German tabloid Bild, referring to the German chancellor's comments that leaders were discussing a third aid programme.
"Instead of signalling the end of this fool's game, Merkel, Francois Hollande and their colleagues seem to be likely to agree to another delay for Greece," writes France's Le Figaro.
Michael Stuermer in Die Welt is equally angry.
"They [Greece] want to have their cake and eat it - in other words, to consume the transfer funds of the EU but not to obey the small print patiently demanded by the creditors," writes Stuermer.
"Greece cannot be allowed to get away with this," says the paper.
Die Welt also worries that Greece's "high-stake games" could "spread to others".
But Spain's El Pais downplays this perceived threat.
"Some will say that if Greece manages to get more flexibility, then Spain, Portugal and even Italy may also want 'concessions'. But Greece is a unique case. The situation of the others is much more stable, they cannot hope for a debt pardon or an end to austerity."
It suggests that "all efforts should focus on reaching an agreement".
Some commentators are also concerned about Russia's growing influence following a possible Grexit.
"Vladimir Putin's Russia has absolutely no means to save Greece and the crisis is not good news for the Russian economy. But Russia can still capitalise on its nuisance value," says an editorial in France's Les Echos.
