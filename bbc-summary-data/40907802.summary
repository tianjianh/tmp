Ipswich Town 2-0 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town made it four wins from four games in the Championship with victory over Brentford at Portman Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martyn Waghorn gave Ipswich the lead against the run of play when he swept the ball past keeper Daniel Bentley.
Bartosz Bialkowski made two good saves before Nico Yennaris hit the bar and Florian Jozefzoon missed a free header as Brentford went close to equalising.
But Joe Garner doubled Town's lead with a powerful header from a corner to help Mick McCarthy's side clinch the win.
Ipswich had failed to win any of their past five Championship matches against Brentford, but goals from summer signings Waghorn and Garner saw them extend their 100% start to the season.
Waghorn has hit the ground running since joining from Rangers earlier this month and scored his fourth goal of the campaign, following good work from David McGoldrick.
Brentford had their chances, with Kamohelo Mokotjo and Ollie Watkins going close, but Garner's header, which was confirmed by goalline technology, ensured Ipswich kept pace with Cardiff City at the top of the Championship.
Former Rangers strike duo Waghorn and Garner have now scored a combined seven goals in just seven Championship appearances between them.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"It was a thoroughly professional performance against a very good side. Everyone put in a shift and I could praise everybody for their performance.
"Bart (Bialkowski) made the saves when needed and it was just a whole team performance.
"Last season we didn't look like scoring at all and we do this year. It's lovely for the lads, for me and the supporters to see goals go in. They are a threat and it's great to see."
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"That's certainly the word I'd use at the moment, frustration. We made one mistake in the first half and they score. We should have been out of sight in the first half, we were excellent.
"We created a number of chances and didn't take them. I believe if we score when we're on top then we win the game comfortably.
"We have to keep believing in what we're doing. I'm optimistic, but I'm cautious that we're losing games which we shouldn't lose."
