[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland rowers Joel Cassells and Rebecca Shorten have won silver medals at World Cup II in Poznan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cassells and Sam Scrimgeour took silver for Great Britain in the lightweight men's pair while Shorten was second as part of the women's eight boat.
Irish pair Mark O'Donovan and Shane O'Driscoll won the lightweight pair and Paul and Gary O'Donovan won silver in the lightweight men's double sculls.
Peter Chambers and Holly Nixon both missed the World Cup regatta.
Chambers was ill while sickness also affected the GB women's quadruple sculls team, ruling Nixon out of action.
Cassells and Shorten's boats had to be content with fourth-place finishes at the recent European Championships.
