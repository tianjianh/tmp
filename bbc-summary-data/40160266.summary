Tripp was born in Canada but represented Germany, where he coached Eispiraten Crimmitschau before agreeing a deal with the Glasgow outfit.
And he has ambitious plans to make improvements to his pool of players.
"I've had a lot of conversations with friends and people I know - I've got a big list, but there are still plenty of players out there," Tripp said.
"I've got an idea of who I want but whether I can get them or not will be the story at the end. You can't always get what you want, but if we can, then it's a bonus."
Tripp, 40, spent 12 years in Germany and is excited by what awaits him in Glasgow.
"Braehead wanted someone young with good hockey knowledge and I was looking for another challenge," he said.
"I had some opportunities in Germany as well, but when this one came up, it was one I wanted to jump on and take advantage of."
