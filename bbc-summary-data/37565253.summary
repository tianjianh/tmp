The recording was broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today as part of the annual nationwide poetry celebration.
This year's theme is Messages, and the public are being encouraged to "say it with a poem".
The Royal Mail will also use a special postmark on millions of items on Thursday.
In addition, 40 BBC local radio stations have engaged 40 poets to celebrate England's best-loved local landmarks in verse.
"A poem can reach places that prose just can't," National Poetry Day director Susannah Herbert said.
"That's why we're inviting all with anything important to say today to say it with a poem. It can be new or old, utterly original or a familiar favourite.
"It can be deep and dark, funny or memorable. By enjoying, discovering or sharing a poem - words that draw attention to themselves - you change the nature of the national conversation."
Other poetry events around the UK include:
Later on Thursday, The Poetry Society will announce the top 15 winners and 85 commended poets of the Foyle Young Poets of the Year Award 2016 at London's Festival Hall.
