They were described as "virtual incendiary" devices which were a danger to people, farm animals, wildlife and property.
After agreeing the ban, the council's cabinet expressed a desire for lanterns to be banned across Wales.
Powys is the 14th Welsh local authority to ban their use on its property.
Cabinet member for environment and sustainability John Powell said there is "widespread concern" about the impact of Chinese lanterns.
"They are a virtual incendiary device consisting of a candle or a fuel cell filled with paraffin wax suspended inside a frame, capable of reaching heights of 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) and drifting for miles," he said.
Mr Powell added they are a fire hazard.
