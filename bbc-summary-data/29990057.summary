[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bishop of Gloucester's farewell service cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A special service to mark the Bishop of Gloucester's retirement has been cancelled due to a continuing internal Church investigation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rt Rev Michael Perham was told by police last month he faces no action over two claims of indecent assault.
The Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rt Rev Martyn Snow, said of the cancellation: "I know this will be the cause of huge frustration and deep disappointment."
Bishop Perham is due to retire officially on 21 November.
Since the allegations were made, the Bishop of Gloucester stepped back from his duties and they were handed to the Bishop of Tewkesbury.
Bishop Snow said: "Church House, Westminster has confirmed to me the process is still ongoing and there is no formal timetable for this process as it must be completed with fairness to all.
"The diocese must therefore await the conclusion of that process."
Bishop Perham was questioned in August over allegations of historical sex offences dating back more than 30 years.
The special service had been planned for 8 November.
