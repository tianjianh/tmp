Two alleged members of the Islamic State cell that carried out attacks on Paris in November have been extradited to France and reportedly charged with terrorism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men were arrested in December in Austria.
Algerian Adel Haddadi, 29 and Pakistani, Mohamad Usman Gani, 35 were arrested at a migrant centre.
Investigators believe they travelled with the Paris attackers to Greece and were possible co-conspirators.
The attacks in Paris on 13 November last year were the worst in French history.
Gunmen and suicide bombers hit Bataclan concert hall, the national football stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously, leaving 130 people dead and hundreds wounded.

Mr Haddadi and Mr Gani travelled to Greece on a refugee boat but were detained for allegedly having falsified Syrian passports.
They were then released and travelled to Salzburg where they were arrested after a tip-off from French police.
According to AFP, Mr Haddadi told police he wanted to go to France to "carry out a mission".
Mr Gani is thought to be a bomb maker for Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba.
