Celeb Big Bro: The ins and outs so far

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What a week it's been in the Celebrity Big Brother house.

Two housemates have been removed, another has walked and only one has been evicted as a result of the public vote.
There's also been a surprise late entrance from former glamour model Katie Price.
Newsbeat's been taking a look back at the ins and outs of an explosive first week.
Thirty-four-year-old actor Jeremy Jackson made his name in Baywatch in the mid 1990s.
He was asked to leave the Big Brother house after he opened another contestant's dressing gown without her consent.
Chloe Goodman said he had exposed her breasts in the toilet. She had gone to help him after he had started being sick after an evening of drinking.
He was given a police caution for common assault.
He says he's apologised to her and her family.
The Coronation Street star was removed from the house for "offensive behaviour" after Ofcom received complaints about "racist and sexual language".
The 71-year-old had been formally warned about the words he used during conversations with R&B singer Alexander O'Neal.
He was also told off for directing unacceptable and sexually suggestive comments towards the female housemates.
Chloe was the first housemate to actually be evicted by the public.
The former Page 3 girl was at the centre of the incident which resulted in Jeremy Jackson's exit.
In her post eviction interview the 21-year-old said she was happy she no longer had to live with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton.
She described her overall experience as "intense and dramatic".
The 36-year-old joined the house on Friday night, minutes after Chloe had been evicted.
The model admitted she was nervous to be joining a group of housemates who had spent the week arguing.
When asked why she signed up Katie said: "There is always a price for Pricey and the price was right".
There has been speculation in newspapers that Katie Price's entrance will cause drama in the house as she's rumoured to have had disagreements with some of the other housemates in the past.
But so far, no fireworks.
The American soul singer walked out of the house a day after being given a formal warning by producers for using homophobic language.
It happened in a row with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton.
In a message to the remaining housemates the 61-year-old said:
"To all my housemates, I've had a great experience with you guys and I have mad love for almost all of you.
"I want you guys not to be sad that I'm leaving and to not let my departure interrupt your experience."
