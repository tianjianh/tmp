The bus driver from Northern Ireland killed in a coach crash in Belgium on Sunday was James 'Geordie' Chance.

He worked for Richmond Coaches Ltd in Lisburn, County Antrim, and was originally from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.
The coach was carrying children from a school in Essex when it hit a motorway bridge and overturned. The company said Mr Chance was not driving at the time.
His co-driver Stephen Cardwell, also from Northern Ireland, is in hospital but has not been critically injured.
Mr Chance was in his mid-50s, as is Mr Cardwell.
The bus overturned on the A18 (E40) at Middelkerke, West Flanders at 09:45 local time (08:45 BST).
Eyewitnesses said it crashed into a motorway bridge pillar.
Two schoolboys who were hospitalised are expected to return to Essex on Monday.
Several pupils travelled back to the UK late on Sunday night on a coach arranged by the school.
The directors of the coach company are travelling to Belgium to see Mr Cardwell and to help authorities investigate the crash.
Mr Caldwell could return home later this week.
In a statement, Brendan McKenna, the director of Richmond Coaches, said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families that have been affected by this tragic accident."
Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said Mr Chance was a popular and hard-working man.
"I would have known some of the Chance family in Lisburn, and although I didn't known Geordie myself he was a very popular figure by all accounts, a hard-working family man," he said.
"For his wife Lynn and the family to receive this news yesterday morning I can only imagine is absolutely devastating."
Lisburn councillor Patrick Catney, who knows the family of the company owners, said: "This is so sad, it's so tragic.
"This company is very long-established and has a great safety record - they only operate top-of-the-line luxury coaches."
