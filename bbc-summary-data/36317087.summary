The 21-year-old has scored 99 goals in two season with the Combined Counties Football League side, who play in the ninth tier.
Nadesan had trials at Millwall and Norwich this season and worked at McDonald's for his main income aside from playing part-time football.
"I'm buzzing. After all the speculation I'm so happy I've finally signed the contract," he told the club website.
"Jamie Vardy is an inspiration with what he's done, people are trying to compare me to him but I don't want to put that pressure on myself - I'd rather be the first Ashley Nadesan."
