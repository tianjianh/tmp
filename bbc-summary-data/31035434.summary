Coventry lollipop man, 82, injured by robber who took his sign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 82-year-old lollipop man has been injured and left too traumatised to return to work by a robber who pushed him to the ground and stole his sign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim, who has been in the job 14 years, was helping children cross Humber Avenue in Coventry.
When he refused to give up his stick he was dragged across the road. The pensioner has been left "devastated" by the assault.
Police said a passer-by later confronted a man to retrieve the sign.
Det Insp Gareth Mason said: "Following the robbery a passer-by spotted a blue Vauxhall Vectra car driving away and stopping in a nearby street, where three men got out, one of whom was carrying the lollipop stick.
"He bravely confronted them and was able to get the stick back for the lollipop man."
Head teacher of Gosford Park Primary School, Leah Baddeley, said: "The lollipop man is such an asset to our community and ensures many children get to school safely.
"Our pupils and staff wish him a speedy recovery."
"I walk that way sometimes and he's so kind," said one pupil. "I just don't understand why he had to get victimised. It's just pathetic, in my opinion."
"That gentleman is out there in all weathers and it's a horrendous thing to have happened to him," added Jenny Dosanjh, a sub-postmistress who supplied the police with CCTV footage of the incident.
"The children were very upset."
Det Insp Mason called the attack "a senseless offence against an elderly man, who was carrying out a public duty."
