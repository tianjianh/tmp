Colourful streams of light were seen in Rhondda Cynon Taff, Ceredigion, and the Brecon Beacons in Powys.
BBC Wales weather presenter Rhian Haf said the lights are created by electrical currents that flow through the top of the earth's atmosphere.
In the UK, strong bursts of solar activity are needed for them to be visible, making June a good time.
