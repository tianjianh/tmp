A record number of police officers will patrol New York's annual Thanksgiving Day parade on Thursday, with 3.5 million people expected to attend.

The city's signature parade will be held under tight security following the attacks in Paris on 13 November.
But officials have urged residents and tourists to attend, saying there are no credible threats.
Around 50 million people worldwide are expected to watch the televised event, now in its 89th year.
"I encourage people to come out. This is a way to push back on events around the world that are meant to intimidate," Police Commissioner William Bratton told a press conference.
But the New York Police Department is ramping up security by having around 200 officers from a new counter-terrorism unit on patrol, officials said.
The city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, said the police department had been "fine-tuning" its response to a possible terrorist attack - but told people not to give in to "psychological warfare".
"I think people are coming here from all over the city, all over the metropolitan region, all over the country to be a part of this parade," he said.
"We cannot let the terrorists succeed at psychological warfare. They're doing what they do to try and create fear, to try and change us."
