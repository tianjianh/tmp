Community unbowed by Beeston bombers 10 years on from 7/7

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten years ago the Leeds suburb of Beeston found itself blinded by the media spotlight in the wake of the devastating 7/7 bombings.

It was the home of two of the four men who carried out the attacks in London, which killed 52 people and injured hundreds more.
Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, and Shehzad Tanweer, 22, grew up in Beeston, while Hasib Mir Hussain, 19, lived in nearby Holbeck. The fourth bomber, Germaine Lindsay, came from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.
As details of where they came from emerged, an international media frenzy descended on the area and journalists placed it under intense scrutiny in the following days and weeks.
As the dust settled on the story, there was a fear Beeston's reputation would suffer irreparably and forever be tainted by the terror attacks.
But behind the negativity - then and a decade on - is a community that has been working to better itself.
In the wake of the London bombings, the world's media descended on Beeston. There were satellite trucks on every street corner. They blamed our community for the atrocity.
Journalists, at least some of them, seemed to have written their story on the train up from London leaving a few gaps for names, dates and street names. They didn't try to find out about our community, they'd already made up their minds and found evidence to back up their version of the story.
People in Beeston stood together. We held a vigil on Tempest Road, there was a trip to London to lay a wreath at Kings Cross and a peace march into Leeds city centre. We redoubled our efforts to work together across faith and ethnic lines. That spirit is exemplified on Beeston Festival day each June when thousands fill the local park to share music, food, and sport.
Beeston is a busy, active place.
There is an annual festival, the Asha Neighbourhood Project, a voluntary centre for women and their families and the Faith Together in Leeds 11 project, a partnership between Christian churches and Muslim organisations.
In addition, there are youth clubs, a hiking group, music in the park events and neighbours who look out for each other.
Community worker Ed Carlisle said: "I see a lot of small scale, grass root acts of kindness.
"My street, for example, is a terraced cul-de-sac off Tempest Road with different ethnicities and there's a real inter-dependence.
"We have an elderly couple who get a lot of support and recently there was another man who fell on hard times. We pulled together to get him a house and get it decorated. That kind of thing is really special."
At the geographical heart is the Hamara Centre, which has grown from humble beginnings into a large ethnic minority voluntary organisation.
Hamara stands out as a beacon within the Asian voluntary sector and its success has inspired other organisations.
Its chief executive Hanif Malik said: "We were fearful 7/7 could impact negatively on community relations but in fact the very opposite happened.
"There were lots of initiatives undertaken by us all to ensure levels of cohesion remained strong and I'm glad to say that's continued."
However, community leaders admit Beeston is not without its problems.
It has the same issues as any low-income, inner-city area.
Mr Carlisle, who grew up in Kent but has lived in Beeston since 2002, said: "There are problems and conflicts, but that happens anywhere.
"People aren't overly wealthy so they can't buy their independence from one another. The streets are tightly packed together, so that tends to lead to greater reliance on neighbours.
"There are people who say they can't wait to get out of Beeston, but for every one of them is another who says they've been here for years and never want to leave.
"Personally it's the friendliest place I've ever lived. So many residents are proud to call it home and that is priceless."
