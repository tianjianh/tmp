[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 2-2 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kieran Agard made a sensational start to his MK Dons career as he netted a first-half brace to salvage a 2-2 draw against Millwall in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old forward, who arrived at the Dons on Thursday for a club record transfer fee from Bristol City, cancelled out the Lions' early two-goal advantage, with two well-taken goals and left the field as a second-half substitute to a standing ovation.
But it was Neil Harris's side that made their early first-half pressure pay, as they struck twice in quick succession to go two in front - first through Tony Craig on 24 minutes, before David Worrall smashed the visitors into what appeared to be a comfortable lead three minutes later.
But Agard's first reply came just a minute later, as the Lions defence failed to clear their lines and the Dons forward's left-footed strike from the edge of the box found the bottom corner.
And the home fans did not have long to wait to cheer Agard's second, which was a well-taken headed lob over Millwall goalkeeper Jordan Archer in a one-on-one just past the half hour.
