The 25-year-old left the field in the second half after prolonged treatment.
Scarlets were more hopeful about full-back Liam Williams who came off after 13 minutes, having rolled his ankle.
He left Allianz Park in a surgical support boot but Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac was hopeful he would be able to join up with the Wales camp this week.
Williams' injury was not connected to the ankle problems he has suffered previously.
Speaking to BBC Wales Sport about the pair, Pivac said, "Hopefully they won't be too serious. We'll know more tomorrow.
"Hopefully Liam will be alright, he feels good himself. He's in a moon boot at the moment just to give himself the best opportunity to recover and get into that Welsh camp.
"Jake's a bit sore at the moment, he's got a rib injury and we'll get that checked out."
Centre Scott Williams should also be fit for Wales duty despite being a late withdrawal from the Scarlets side with an ankle injury suffered against Sale.
"There's a bit of swelling there and it didn't quite recover in time. Another couple of days and he would have made it but it wasn't to be but he'll be fine for the Wales camp next week," he added.
