Skipper Stafanie Taylor (40) anchored the Windies' innings of 103-8 in Chennai, but lacked support as left-arm spinner Anam Amin took 4-16.
Captain Sana Mir nearly saw Pakistan home but fell in the final over.
There was also concern for Pakistan opener Javeria Khan, who was hit on the head by a Shamilia Connell bouncer and was taken off on a stretcher.
Wisden India journalist Himanish Bhattacharjee later tweeted that Javeria had been taken to hospital for a precautionary CT scan, but was "OK".
England face Bangladesh in their first game on Thursday, also in Group B.
