Walsall winger Kieron Morris has signed an extended Saddlers contract, tying him to the club until 2019.

Hereford-born Morris, 22, only signed a two-year deal in May but his existing contract is now extended by a year.
"You could see his potential. Now he's started to believe it himself," Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC Sport.
"Some players get discarded too quickly and Kieron could easily have been one. But this club gives players like him more time and he's worked hard for it."
Whitney added: "He's one of my main players now, he's on the teamsheet."
"This club is amazing for bringing youngsters through," said Morris. "You only have to look at some of the names who have passed through the door in the last five, 10, 15 years. It's a place where you will get your chance and it's up to you then to take it."
Morris has taken his chance this season following the summer departure of many of the first-team regulars that took Walsall to the League One play-offs.
After scoring in successive matches against Charlton, Bury and Grimsby Town in August, he also netted in Saturday's 3-2 win over Shrewsbury.
It was part of an unbeaten four-game run which has seen Walsall pick up seven points out of a possible nine in League One, climbing to within four points of the play-off zone, as well as reaching the next round of the  EFL Trophy.
"We're starting to click now as a team," he said. "It's one defeat in eight for us so we have to keep this run going and try to get up the table."
