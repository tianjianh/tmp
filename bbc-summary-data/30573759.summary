[SN]TITLE[SN]
The Apprentice contestants' biggest fails of series 10

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
OK, so Mark Wright has been named Lord Sugar's new business partner but we all know that the best thing about The Apprentice isn't the people who succeed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No, we all watch the show to see the mess-ups, the catastrophes, the all-out disasters.
After all, there's nothing more rewarding than thinking, "I could have definitely done better than THAT!"
So let's count down some of the best (worst) moments from the last series.
The hypnotherapist made a solid impression in the first week of the competition when she told her team of female contestants that they had to wear make-up and short skirts to help them stand out.
She was met with blank stares as competitors and viewers alike wondered if she had come straight out of the 1950s.
Another contestant to blaze a trail for feminism was Daniel Lassman, who created questions for his team's board game that included: "Men think women should... a) iron, b) smile more or c) always be happy."
As one game reviewer on the show said: "The game itself feels pretty sexist to me."
It's hard to pick which bit of the coach tours was the worst, but we're plumping for Sanjay getting his group lost.
But we must also mention the sing-song organised by James, and those awful-looking lunches.
Note to self: Never, ever try to outsmart Lord Sugar.
Felipe Alviar-Baquero came unstuck when his paper skeleton replica didn't quite cut the mustard in the purchasing challenge - and yet again, Daniel managed to escape being sacked.
Because HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You're about to walk into the biggest job interview of your life. And oh yeah, it's being filmed for prime time television.
So for your presentation you bring in some illustrations and logos - but absolutely no figures... Soloman - you're fired.
There's nothing like watching a smug so-and-so getting his comeuppance - and so it was hard not to rub your hands with glee when Mark Wright spluttered his way through a big pitch to the supermarkets.
"Cough-hello-cough-cough-cough-trifle-cough-yum-cough-cough-pudding-cough."
