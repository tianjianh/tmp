England v Scotland: Charlie Adam says Gordon Strachan 'not picking best players'

Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam believes his "face does not fit" in the Scotland squad - and thinks manager Gordon Strachan is not picking the best players available to him.

Adam, 30, has played seven times for Stoke this season but has not featured for his country since June 2015.
"He will probably say I've not played enough games but I disagree," Adam told BBC Radio 5 live's Monday Night Club.
"I'm not saying he should call me, but I feel I could add something."
Adam made the most recent of his 26 appearances for Scotland in a 1-0 friendly victory over Qatar.
He is again missing for Friday's World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley.
Strachan's squad includes 11 recognised midfielders, four of whom play in the Premier League.
Adam said: "He has given people an opportunity that have not played at their club for a number of months.
"We are not blessed with 50-60 top players. Obviously my face does not fit at the moment."
Stoke boss Mark Hughes said at the weekend that the former Liverpool and Blackpool player is "in good physical shape".
Adam said there was "no communication" with those left out, though former Scotland defender Gary Gillespie told the Monday Night Club that Strachan was under "no obligation" to make contact.
Strachan's side are fourth in their World Cup qualifying group after three games, behind England, Lithuania and Slovenia.
"There is pressure on him as we haven't started the campaign well," added Adam.
"I hope he stays because he is a good manager. He is the best man but I don't think he is picking the best players he has available."
Adam believes Aston Villa's Alan Hutton - who has made himself unavailable - is "the best right back we've got" and also feels Stoke's Phil Bardsley should be selected.
Meanwhile, former captain Barry Ferguson said new tennis world number one Andy Murray should be invited to the pre-match team meeting.
