Campaigners say a leaked document posted on Facebook suggests 24-hour cover could fall to just 12 hours at the Haverfordwest hospital.
However, Hywel Dda University Health Board has denied the claim.
Medical director Dr Sue Fish said: "The Emergency and Urgent Care Centre at Withybush remains open 24-hours a day."
She added: "Following a successful meeting held today with senior clinicians and managers, we have identified support to maintain this service in the weeks to come.
"It will give us the time to build in a long-term solution.
"We acknowledge the significant recruitment challenges that we, along with other NHS organisations face, and we have agreed a range of actions that will support the hospital.
"The document referred to is the viewpoint of a single consultant at one point in time and represents no decision by the University Health Board."
The leaked letter was put on the Save Withybush Hospital site on Facebook.
Its campaigners have been fighting cuts to services at the hospital, including the decision to move overnight children's services to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen in October.
