In 2010 police investigated 60 rapes. By 2014, the latest figures available, the number had reached 124.
Neil Henderson, CEO of sexual abuse charity Safeline, said victims were "starting to believe" in the authorities which had given them "the confidence to come forward".
Home Office statistics showed recorded male rape increased 87% nationally.
The West Midlands figures were revealed after a Freedom of Information request.
The force's figures also showed recorded sexual abuse on males increased by 45% over the same time period.
The charity Safeline has said it has seen a 30% increase in men coming forward in the past year.
"These historic cases of abuse that are being mentioned in the media are triggering a lot of people's feelings that they now want to resolve," Mr Henderson said.
Between 2009 and 2014 numbers of recorded male rape rose from 1,172 to 2,197 nationally, Home Office statistics showed.
Duncan Craig, CEO of help group Survivors Manchester, said the majority of sexual assaults and rapes were "by someone that the victim will know".
Mr Craig, a rape survivor, said being abused had a "profound impact" on him.
"I had issues with alcohol and drug use for a while; anything that stopped me from remembering."
The Home Office statistics also revealed a 35% rise in recorded female rape between 2009 and 2014.
Det Ch Insp Tom Chisholm, from West Midlands Police, said: "I don't believe this means more offences are being committed, rather that victims are speaking out against offenders in confidence they will be listened to."
