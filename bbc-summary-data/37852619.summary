[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Nicholas, who died last year aged 106, brought Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia to the UK.
The Winton family decided to sell his estate including his house in Maidenhead, which is now on the market.
Some of the items, including a bible given to Sir Nicholas by his father, fetched sums of up to £1,600.
In 1939, Sir Nicholas organised the rescue of 669 Jewish children destined for Nazi concentration camps, arranging for trains to carry them out of German-occupied Prague to the sanctuary of the UK.
A birthday message written to Sir Nicholas by the Queen for his 105th sold for £300.
And a Napoleon III writing desk made in Paris and bought by Sir Nicholas for his wife, Grete, also sold for £1,000.
His son Nick Winton said the auction was "very emotional".
"It was sad to think I was seeing those things for the last time," he said.
The auction was held at the Swan Auction House in Tetsworth, Oxfordshire on Thursday.
