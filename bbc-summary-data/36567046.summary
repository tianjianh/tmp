The incident happened during a security alert at Lisnafin Park in Strabane on Friday night.
A car was seized and a suspected gun was recovered during the alert.
A 44-year-old was arrested on suspicion of endangering the safety of an aircraft when a laser was pointed at the helicopter.
"The crew of the helicopter were able to direct officers on the ground to a house where the suspect was arrested," Ch Insp Alan Hutton of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said.
"Following a search of the property a bag of lasers was recovered."
The man has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin tweeted that the laser attack was "a disgraceful act endangering many lives".
Residents spent the night out of their homes and the security alert ended at about 08:25 BST on Saturday.
