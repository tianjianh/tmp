Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has used the Disney film Frozen to defend a tweet condemned as anti-Semitic.

Mr Trump posted an image of a book for the film displaying a six-pointed star.
Critics say his recent tweet targeting Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton featured the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism.
The star included text that read, "Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!" and was placed over Mrs Clinton and a pile of cash.
The Mic website reported the image had first appeared on a message board known for anti-Semitism and white supremacy.
Mr Trump initially deleted the tweet on Saturday before tweeting a similar image in which the star was replaced with a circle.
He again took to Twitter on Wednesday to point out a similar image on the children's book.
"Where is the outrage for the Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media!" he wrote.
Mrs Clinton's campaign quickly responded, retweeting his post with a reference to a popular song from the movie.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump defended himself at a Cincinnati rally against claims that he was anti-Semitic, saying his staff should not have deleted the tweet.
"I would have rather defended it," he said.
Mr Trump railed against "the dishonest media" for stirring controversy over the image and claimed it was not offensive toward Jewish people.
The Star of David is featured on the Israeli flag. It was also used by the Nazis to identify Jews.
Mr Trump has previously come under fire for reposting comments made by supremacist groups on social media.
He was also criticised earlier this year for failing to immediately disavow David Duke, a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, after receiving his endorsement.
