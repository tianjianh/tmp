[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Didier Deschamps's team will take on Cameroon on 30 May in the French city of Nantes.
Cameroon will be preparing for a trip to play Mauritania in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier the following weekend.
The Indomitable Lions are currently top of Group M having won both their qualifiers so far.
Before June's game against Mauritania the Cameroonians have home and away games against South Africa in March.
The Indomitable Lions are still without a permanent coach as Alexandre Belinga continues as the interim boss.
"As long as a coach is not appointed, Belinga would continue to assume the position," the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot) president Tombi A Roko Sidiki said.
"The process is still on. Recruiting a coach is not easy."
