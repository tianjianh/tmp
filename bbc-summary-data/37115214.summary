Police were called to Cairngorm Drive at about 15:.15 on Monday after the schoolboy was hit by a green Kawasaki motorbike.
The child was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
Jake Henry, 18, appeared in private at the city's sheriff court on Wednesday in connection with the incident.
He is alleged to have caused serious injury by driving dangerously, without insurance and without a licence.
He is also accused of failing to report an accident to the police and failing to identify himself to officers as the driver of a vehicle.
The teenager also faces a charge of acting in a threatening and abusive manner.
Mr Henry, of Aberdeen, made no plea and no declaration and his case was continued for further examination.
He was released on bail pending a further court appearance.
