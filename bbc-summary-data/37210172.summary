Thomas Pieters finished with three successive birdies to win the Made in Denmark title and lift his hopes of Ryder Cup selection.

The Belgian beat Wales' Bradley Dredge by one shot at Himmerland for his third European Tour title in 12 months.
Pieters, 24, is considered a contender for one of Europe's three Ryder Cup wild card places, to be announced by captain Darren Clarke on 30 August.
Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer are tipped to secure two of Clarke's picks.
Pieters, who missed out narrowly on automatic selection for the Europe team, was fourth in the Olympics and second in the defence of his Czech Masters title last week to force his name into contention, with nine of Clarke's team confirmed.
"He has got plenty of good players to pick from, so if he doesn't pick me, then so be it and I'll work my butt off to get there in the next one," said Pieters.
"But I've done all I can now and I'm just really pleased with this win to be honest."
The final round in Denmark was delayed by four hours because of bad weather.
