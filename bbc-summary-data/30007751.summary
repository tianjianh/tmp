A driver will be questioned by police after a bus carrying 53 pupils overturned in Hereford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty-six children were taken to hospital following the crash in Holme Lacy Road at 08:20 GMT on Monday.
West Mercia Police confirmed they had identified another "vehicle" which may have been travelling in the opposite direction at the time.
A spokesman said the driver of the vehicle would be interviewed on Wednesday. No-one has been arrested.
The pupils had been travelling to Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat School and St Mary's Roman Catholic School at the time of the crash.
On the Bluecoat School website, head teacher Sara Catlow-Hawkins said the coach had been "forced to veer off the road." The children were badly shaken and a number suffered cuts and bruises, she added.
The driver of the bus was treated in intensive care at Hereford County Hospital.
