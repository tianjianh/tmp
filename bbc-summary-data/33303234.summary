Joni Mitchell is still unable to speak after being found unconscious in her home in March, according to her friend David Crosby.

Crosby said the singer-songwriter had suffered a brain aneurysm and faced a long struggle.
"She is home, she is in care, she is recovering," he told Huffington Post. "How much she's going to come back, and when, I don't know."
There has been no official confirmation of Mitchell's condition.
The 71-year-old was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home on 31 March and taken to hospital.
A statement released on her website several days later said the singer was "resting comfortably" and continued to "improve and get stronger each day".
Her representatives later denied Mitchell was in a coma, saying "she's alert, and she has her full senses".
"She took a terrible hit," said Crosby on Saturday. "She had an aneurysm, and nobody found her for a while. And she's going to have to struggle back from it the way you struggle back from a traumatic brain injury.
"To my knowledge, she is not speaking yet."
Crosby and Mitchell dated in 1967, when he was still a member of the Byrds. They have remained close friends ever since.
"She's a tough girl and very smart," he said. "I love her. She's probably the best of us â€” probably the greatest living singer-songwriter.
"[But] I think we're all holding our breath and thinking of goodbye, you know? And hoping it's gonna turn out ok."
