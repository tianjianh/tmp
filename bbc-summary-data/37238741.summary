[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Mason, 67, brandished a six-inch blade when he was challenged stealing alcohol and a deep-fat fryer from Morrisons in Penrith in May.
Carlisle Crown Court heard that Mason, of Sunderland, had 266 convictions dating back five decades.
He admitted possessing a bladed weapon and using threatening behaviour. He was jailed for 16 months.
Prosecuting, Francis McEntee said Mason became agitated when a store detective mentioned calling police and pointed a knife at him.
The hearing was told that Mason, of Hylton Road, had a history of mental health problems.
Sentencing him, Judge Peter Davies said: "You have an appalling record. You should have left your previous convictions long behind you."
