Hosting a stage of a team cycling race brought £300,000 to a Ceredigion town, according to a report.

Aberystwyth held a stage of the Pearl Izumi UK Tour Series to launch the AberCycleFest in May.
A Ceredigion council report said 5,000 visitors spent £299,555 on food and drink, travel, shopping, merchandise and accommodation.
On Tuesday, the council's cabinet will meet to discuss whether it will spend £66,000 to host the 2017 event.
The authority hopes the £60,000 cost can be mitigated by getting cash from businesses and other public bodies. In 2016, it raised £25,000 towards this cost.
An additional £6,000 will be spent to cover road closures and equipment hire.
