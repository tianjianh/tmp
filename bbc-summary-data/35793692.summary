Newcastle University has been awarded £4.6m to develop a drug to combat a rare life-limiting condition.

The European Commission money will be used for a clinical trial of a new treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
The genetic muscle wasting disease affects approximately 50,000 boys worldwide.
Rebecca Daniel, from Bishop Auckland, said the trial was a "ray of hope" for her five-year-old son Ryan Bennett.
"Any bit of research that is going to improve the prognosis of the condition is potentially going to affect Ryan," Ms Daniel said.
"That's our little ray of hope, that he's young enough and it's a slow enough progressing condition that this research going on is going to benefit us and benefit Ryan in the long run."
It is believed the new anti-inflammatory drug, vamorolone, will improve muscle strength without the mood swings, stunted growth and weight gain resulting from steroid treatments.
Trial principal investigator Dr Michela Guglieri said the side-effects of current drugs "often blunt the benefits".
"We know that steroids improve the muscle strength, prolong the life and improve the quality of life but at the same time there are several side effects which limit the use of steroid," she said.
"This drug aims to maintain the benefit of the corticosteroid that we use routinely but remove the side effects."
