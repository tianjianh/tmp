[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bishop of Gloucester 'was sent rotten food' over housing plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Bishop of Gloucester said she has received hate mail over plans for the Gloucester Diocese to sell off land in a Cotswold village for housing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campaigners in Willersey near Chipping Campden claim the diocese has failed to keep them informed about the proposals.
The Right Reverend Rachel Treweek said she had been sent rotten food and "not particularly pleasant" emails.
She denied the diocese had "covered up" its plans to sell 35 acres of land for development.
Bishop Treweek attended a public meeting about the plans on Tuesday evening.
Angry campaigners claim the proposals could eventually lead to 450 new houses being built, which would more than double the size of the village.
Resident Phillip Ord said: "The bishop won't come clean and say who is going to take the final decision... I'm not very optimistic about it."
Bishop Treweek said it was "quite unusual" for a bishop to turn up to such a public meeting but she "felt it was important" for people to realise she was being "transparent and honest".
She said it was "incredibly sad and very disappointing" that the diocese had been accused of a cover up.
"Things have not been good in the communication process but to suggest anyone's been underhand or I'm not coming clean is just untrue," she said.
She said she had received "a couple of parcels of food with anonymous notes attached which might have been well intended", but had gone rotten by the time they arrived.
She added that no deal had yet been signed with a developer and she did not want to "overhouse" the village.
"I will take away everything I have heard and feed it back to the board of finance, and we will come to a conclusion about where we go next," she said.
