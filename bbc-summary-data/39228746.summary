A disaster fund set up following the first World War Two civilian deaths on the British mainland is finally going to be spent, it has emerged.

The money was collected after a German Heinkel aircraft crashed in Victoria Road, Clacton, on 30 April, 1940.
The fund continued to help residents affected by enemy raids, but was banked and forgotten about following the war.
Tendring District Council has now decided to use the remaining £1,700 on improvements to a memorial site.
The original fund was established by the Rev HG Redgrave, then chairman of Clacton Urban District Council (CUDC), when the German bomber crashed, causing "severe damage and considerable distress".
The council will add £10,000 to the existing fund and intends to improve the landscaping around the memorial bench and plaque.

The original fund was administered by a number of CUDC officials and continued to be used throughout the war to help anyone affected by air activity.
After 1946, it was deposited into a Post Office Savings Bank Account, where it remains to this day.
The amount of £243, 13 shillings and six pence held in the account in 1950 is now worth around £1,700.
The account documents were discovered in Clacton Town Hall during an office move four years ago.
Michael Talbot, the council's cabinet member for environment, said: "It is our aim to have something ready for the 77th anniversary of the Heinkel coming down on 30 April, although we may have to add the memorial stone at a later date.
"We are also keen to trace anyone whose family had any connections with the event, so that we can invite them along to the ceremony and they can be part of this special occasion."
