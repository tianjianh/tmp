Health warnings were also issued to young children, the elderly and those with serious illnesses who are encouraged to stay in the shade, wear loose clothing and drink plenty of water.
Vicky Barber, from the British Lung Foundation Helpline, said: "During hot weather, the air we breathe has lower moisture levels than usual, which can have a drying effect on our airways.
"As a result, people with respiratory conditions such as COPD or severe asthma may find it harder to breathe, feel more tired, or find their lungs feeling heavy or tight."
Dr Angie Bone, head of extreme events at Public Health England, said: "Employers should ensure indoor areas are kept cool and consider allowing these individuals to travel to or from their place of work during cooler, or less busy times of the day.
"For those working or exercising outdoors, strenuous physical exertion during the hottest part of the day should be kept to a minimum."
