Derek Serpell-Morris, also known as DJ Derek, is believed to have boarded a number five bus, close to The Centre, at 23:14 BST on 10 July.
Detectives believe Mr Morris got off the bus at the junction of Brook Road and Sussex Place, before walking along City Road heading towards Albert Place.
On Thursday more than 70 people helped police in the search for Mr Morris.
An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman appealed for anyone who was a passenger on the bus, or was in the City Road area at the time to contact the force.
In CCTV released on Friday, Mr Morris can be seen at the bar at the Commercial Rooms at 21:25, which he left at 23:11.
He is then seen crossing the road from Rupert Street to Lewins Mead, close to The Centre, where officers believe he boarded the bus.
DJ Derek is known to thousands of people and has played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
Earlier this week police confirmed his bank account had not been used since the beginning of July, and that he did not have a current passport and had "definitely not gone abroad".
The former accountant, a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978, has played across the UK and appeared at the Big Chill.
He also released his own compilation album, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
