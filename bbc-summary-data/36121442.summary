[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The centenary of the day the Easter Rising started in the Republic of Ireland has been marked on Sunday by a remembrance service and wreath-laying ceremony in Dublin.

The rebellion, an attempt to overthrow British rule in Ireland, began on 24 April 1916.
President Michael D Higgins laid a wreath where 14 executed leaders of the Rising are buried at Arbour Hill.
Relatives of the 16 leaders executed after the Rising attended the event.
Before the wreath-laying, a remembrance service was led by the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Eamon Martin, and Diarmuid Martin, the archbishop of Dublin.
Archbishop Diarmuid Martin spoke of commemoration as not just looking to the past, but a commitment to put in place those ideals expressed in the Proclamation.
A number of flag-raising ceremonies are taking place in various locations in the Republic of Ireland on Sunday including Fingal, Longford, Louth, Roscommon, Waterford and Sligo.
Several parades have been held in Belfast in Northern Ireland to commemorate the centenary of the Rising.
A protest was held by loyalists at a flashpoint at Royal Avenue, but the parade passed off peacefully. The main parade made its way to Milltown cemetery.
The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland.
More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting.
Last month, hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin where a parade marked the culmination of a series of centenary commemorations organised by the Irish government.
The military parade was the largest ever staged in the Republic of Ireland.
