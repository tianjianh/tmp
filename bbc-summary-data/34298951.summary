British Transport Police (BTP) said he suffered head and leg injuries when he fell into the path of an oncoming train at about 23:00 BST on Friday.
It happened as thousands of fans left the nearby Twickenham Stadium after England's victory over Fiji in the first World Cup game.
The man is not thought to be critically ill, London Ambulance said.
The station in south-west London was evacuated while the man was treated. London Ambulance said he was later taken to St George's Hospital, in south-west London.
The train had been slowing down at the time he was hit, British Transport Police said.
"At this stage it is unclear exactly how the man came to fall on to the tracks and officers are working to determine the full circumstances," a spokesman said.
South West Trains said services between Twickenham and London Waterloo were suspended while the man was treated but later resumed.
A spokeswoman said: "Our immediate thoughts are for the welfare of the person involved."
