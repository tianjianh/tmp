The 23-year-old was awarded the Golden Boot for the second successive season, after scoring 29 goals Premier League goals during the 2016-17 campaign.
And now he has set his sights on improving on the international stage.
"I want to be classed in that [world-class] bracket, but I know I'm not there yet," said Kane, before England's World Cup qualifier with Scotland.
Kane made his league debut for Tottenham in 2012 and has made 130 appearances, scoring 78 goals.
The London-born forward made an immediate impact on his international debut, scoring 79 seconds into his debut in March 2015.
He has now netted five times in 17 appearances for his country.
"Part of it is proving it on the international stage. I think at club level I've had a good few seasons, but now it's about taking that next step, international football in the big games, in the big moments.
"I'm working harder than ever to try and achieve that.
"I'm 23 now. Hopefully I've got a quite few more years left and I can learn and get better and really push forward."
Real Madrid and Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo is the current holder of Fifa's best player award and the Ballon d'Or, and Kane admits he looks up to the former Manchester United player.
"Ronaldo's a great role model, a fantastic player," said Kane.
"Who wouldn't want to win that big gold trophy? It's definitely something I aspire to do. Doing that, you have to win the big tournaments, for club and country.
"Ronaldo won the Euros and the Champions League and that's part of the reason why most of the time he wins it. Lionel Messi's is a similar situation.
"To do that, it isn't just individual, I think it's part of a team thing as well, winning team trophies."
