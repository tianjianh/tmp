The attack happened on the Cullingtree Road at about 06:00 GMT on Sunday morning.
The man was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where he underwent surgery.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Mary McConville said there was a need to address knife crime in the city.
"The young man has suffered knife wounds leaving him in a serious condition and his family traumatised," she said.
"More needs to be done to deal with the growing knife crime in our society and I am calling on young people not to be drawn into carrying knives."
SDLP MLA Alex Attwood described the attack as "shocking and appalling".
"There is growing concern about the rise in knife crime attacks in Belfast," he added.
"Any level of knife crime is unacceptable, and more needs to be done to deal with knife crime in our society."
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.
