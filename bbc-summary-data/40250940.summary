Yennaris has made 93 appearances for the Bees since signing from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee in 2014.
The 24-year-old's previous contract was due to expire at the end of the 2018-19 season.
"He is continuing to improve in all aspects of his game and is becoming an accomplished goalscoring midfielder," manager Dean Smith said.
