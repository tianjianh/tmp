Fish farming company Marine Harvest has submitted a planning application with Highland Council for an £80m fish feed factory on Skye.

The development on the site of an old quarry at Kyleakin could create 55 full-time permanent jobs.
The plant will produce food for the firm's Scottish fish farms as well as those in Norway, Ireland and the Faroe Islands.
Marine Harvest hopes the new plant will be up and running by 2018.
