[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 1-0 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Green's 64th-minute penalty gave 10-man Mansfield an unlikely 1-0 victory over in-form visitors Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stags were a man down for 81 minutes after Danny Rose's early dismissal but won the game from the spot.
Town goalkeeper Artur Krysiak parried a Green shot but was beaten to the rebound by Mitch Rose and brought him down, Green sending him the wrong way with his spot-kick.
Mansfield had started brightly and Chris Clements saw a low shot deflect just wide after three minutes.
But the complexion of the evening changed after just nine minutes when Danny Rose went in two-footed on Otis Khan near the halfway line and out came the red card.
Despite that, Mansfield had the best of the first half and Green hooked a chance over from close range on 13 minutes while Mitch Rose somehow headed over from eight yards from a fine Rhys Bennett cross from the right.
Clements sent another powerful shot into Krysiak's midriff.
Despite some good possession, all the Glovers could muster was two long-range efforts that proved easy for Brian Jensen.
The 10 men took the game to Yeovil after the break, Mitch Rose volleying a long Mal Benning cross wide at the far post, then Adam Chapman forcing the keeper into a save with a swerving shot after robbing Khan before Green's match-winning breakthrough.
