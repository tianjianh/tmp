[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sammy Lee Samuels, 27, from Caego, Wrexham admitted wounding James Williams with intent, leaving him with "permanent disfigurement".
Mold Crown Court heard how Mr Williams had "extremely unsightly" injuries after the attack in the New Broughton area of Wrexham on 1 September, 2016.
Myles Wilson, defending, said Samuels had acted "in a moment of madness".
The court heard how Mr Williams was set upon by the defendant as he walked home in the early hours of the morning.
Prosecutor David Mainstone said that after a struggle, Samuels latched on to Mr Williams' left ear with his teeth.
"He had to endure the horrible experience and pain of part of his ear being torn from his head," said Mr Mainstone.
Judge David Hale told Samuels as he sentenced him: "You caused really unpleasant injuries by biting off part of his ear.
"It is, and I am sure he feels it more than it appears, extremely unsightly. He will be conscious of that for the rest of his life."
After the case, North Wales Police Det Con Donna Rigney said: "The incident has left the victim with a permanent disfigurement to his ear and we believe the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence."
