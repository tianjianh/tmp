On Tuesday 20 January, the BBC marked the 750th anniversary of the first elected parliament at Westminster and 800 years since the signing of Magna Carta with Democracy Day - a day of live events, discussions and debate, thrown into sharp relief recently by the Paris shootings, Hong Kong protests and Scottish Referendum.
As part of this we hosted two conversations on our multilingual @viabbc account on Twitter with prominent speakers Anas Altikriti and Marta Lagos.
Between 1200-1300 GMT
Anas Altikriti is chairman of the Muslim Association of Britain and president of the Cordoba Foundation, a think tank focusing on Islamic issues.
He answered your questions around the topic of 'Has democracy failed the Arab world?'.
The British Islamist intellectual and lobbyist for the Muslim Brotherhood will be in the BBC's London office and will take questions from all over the world.
