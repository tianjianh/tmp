The 21-year-old joined the Hatters in May 2015 and was their top scorer last season with 16 goals in 44 matches.
Former Ipswich trainee Marriott had six loans away from Portman Road before joining Luton on a full-time basis.
"I've never been looking to leave because I'm settled at Luton Town and the club is heading in the right direction," he told the club website.
