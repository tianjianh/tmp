A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a carer who was found dead in London's Hyde Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hani Khalaf, 21, of no fixed address, appeared before magistrates in Wimbledon earlier.
Jairo Medina, 62, a professional carer from Chelsea, was found near Speakers' Corner on the morning of 12 August by a member of the public.
A post-mortem examination did not find a cause of death, but showed that he had been assaulted, police said.
Mr Khalaf was unshaven and wore a grey prison-issue tracksuit when he appeared at the magistrates' court, speaking through an interpreter to confirm his name and date of birth.
He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.
