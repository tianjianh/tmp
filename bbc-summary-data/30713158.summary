What are your rights when your haircut goes wrong?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are few things that threaten to bring you out in a cold sweat quite like a shaky-handed hairdresser.

Their fingers have the power to destroy your social calendar for weeks to come, at least.
And yet at the moment hairdressers in the UK aren't required to have any qualifications.
That may change as MPs debate whether the industry needs greater regulation. But for now, what are your rights if your stylist gets it wrong?
If you look like you've lost a fight with a New Zealand sheep shearer at the end of your chop, you can refuse to pay.
Hairdressers provide a service and in law are governed by the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.
This means they have to carry out their job to a good standard.
So, if you've gone in asking for a Kim Kardashian-style cut and come out looking more like Kim Jong-un, you're entitled to keep your money in your pocket.
But be warned, if the salon thinks your review of their handiwork has more holes in it than your head then they could take you to court to claim what they think they're owed.
If you do find yourself in a stand-off akin to a Clint Eastwood western another option is to pay under protest.
This means you pay for the haircut, with the intention of claiming the money back later.
Make sure though that if you go down this route the hairdresser is aware you're paying in protest. It's best to have a witness, or even better, get it in writing.
What's that old saying? "If at first you don't succeed, try, try and try again."
Even if it looks like they've used a lawn mower to cut your hair, you should first give your hairdresser another shot at getting it right.
As counterintuitive as this may sound if you take them to court you'll need to show you've been reasonable.
By all means ask the salon for a discount as a goodwill gesture, but this should be your first port of call.
Should your hairdresser agree to give it another go, you should tell them in writing that you reserve the right to get someone else to do the work if it still hasn't been done to a reasonable standard.
And keep a copy of the letter.
If the hairdresser can't or won't put things right, then it's time to try another salon.
You might be able to claim compensation from the first hatchet job if this leaves you out of pocket.
As a nation we're not known for our bluntness.
We'd often much rather smile sweetly and save the river of tears until we get home.
But in this instance it pays to be brave and upfront.
If you give the impression you're happy with your haircut, then you'll haveaffirmed the contract.
Once this is done, you'll lose the right to withhold payment and can only sue in court for damages.
To avoid affirming the contract you must shout if you notice things taking a turn for the worse.
By letting them continue you're seen as accepting what's going on up top.
Whatever you decide to do, if you want any money back, you're going to need evidence.
So although you might not feel like it, it's time to take a selfie. And then another.
Taking pictures of your new do and writing down the date and time of the cut will help you further down the line, whatever you decide to do.
It's worth remembering that although many stylists have undergone training, you don't have to have any qualifications to start your own hairdressing business.
The Hairdressing Council says 7,000 hairdressers are signed up to its voluntary register.
That's out of around 250,000 people who work in the UK's hairdressing industry.
