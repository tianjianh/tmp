Another person has been diagnosed with E. coli in an outbreak linked with venison, Health Protection Scotland has said.

All 11 of those now affected by the same strain of E. coli O157 had consumed venison which was purchased raw and cooked at home before falling ill.
Health watchdogs have linked the outbreak to Dundee firm Highland Game.
None of the 11 patients are in hospital.
Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in health protection and clinical director at HPS, said: "It can take up to 14 days for someone to display symptoms following consumption of contaminated food products.
"It's not unusual for some cases to be identified after control measures have been taken.
"The important thing to note is that this additional case consumed products from the same time frame as all previous cases."
A spokeswoman for Highland Game previously said a full inspection of the Dundee premises had been undertaken following the "very rare incident", and said there was "no substantiated evidence to support the actual source of the outbreak".
