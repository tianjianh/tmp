Politicians 'get dragged in to defend NHS services that do not deliver'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Local politicians often get "dragged in" to stand up for NHS services that do not "really deliver", Wales' health minister has said.

Vaughan Gething told BBC Wales that the NHS will have to confront "difficult challenges" within the first part of the assembly term.
Mr Gething said there were "big gains" to be made in quality, and that service change was not just about money.
An extra £240m was announced for the NHS in the Welsh budget last month.
Total Welsh Government spending is to rise by 2.7% to £14.95bn in 2017/18.
Ministers have faced opposition in previous years over proposals to change some NHS services - such as over the moving of maternity care from Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.
On Wednesday, Mr Gething told The Wales Report on BBC One: "Local politicians often get dragged in to try to stand up for a service model that doesn't really deliver the sort of efficiency and quality that all of our citizens should be entitled to expect.
"That level of innovation and reform has to be delivered otherwise we don't get to the point we can make those really difficult choices, if we ever have to, about money driving different choices in health care.
"But we're not there yet."
When asked if "difficult, tough choices" would have to be made soon, Mr Gething said: "I'd prefer it to happen within this term."
He said he had been "really clear" with the health service about his expectations that "some of those difficult challenges are confronted and dealt within the first part of this term".
"That requires a conversation within and between clinicians and a conversation with the public about why services will change," he said.
"Because there's a really big gain to be made there, its not just about money. There's really big gains there in quality, outcomes and patient experience."
He said part of the challenge is "how we understand, in a hospital setting, does every hospital need to do what it does at the moment?"
"This is difficult for the public," he said. "Because often when we talk about moving services around, when a health board proposes, either on its own or with another health board partners to change the pattern of services, people instantly think this is about money, even if it is really about quality."
Mr Gething warned that discussions would have to be had over the "limits of the health service" if there was no change in position from the UK government on public finances.
"If we don't see a broader investment... then we could end up in a position where we have to have an incredibly difficult conversation about the limits of the health service and money being the driver, not simply about how we make best use of money", he said.
