Opener Vusi Sibanda set the Test side on the way with 59 from 46 balls, while Elton Chigumbura hit three late sixes to help them post 158-8 from 20 overs.
Hong Kong's hopes rested with former Warwickshire batsman Jamie Atkinson.

Despite having 44-year-old ex-Australia batsman Ryan Campbell making his debut, Hong Kong had struggled to keep up with the required run rate before Atkinson hit two sixes.
One team from Group B, which also includes Scotland and Afghanistan who meet later on Tuesday, will qualify for the Super 10 stage when the eight major teams enter the competition.
