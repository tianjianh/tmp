Women's World Cup: Hope Powell could move on after exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hope Powell says she is considering quitting as coach after England's World Cup quarter-final defeat by France.

England lost 4-3 on penalties in Leverkusen following a 1-1 draw after extra-time.
Powell, who has been in charge for 13 years, said it might be time for her to take a developmental role within the Football Association.
"Within the FA we are looking at something, hopefully that will come to fruition," she said.
The 44-year-old added: "The most important thing is I want to be involved in women's football, preferably in England."
Asked if she would consider some kind of overseer role, she  said: "If an opportunity presented itself, yeah, undoubtedly."
The London coach has already had a big hand in developing the women's game in England, and oversees England's youth teams.
She also played a big part in helping set up the Women's Super League, which began in April.
England also went out at the quarter-finals stage in 2007 and having previously admitted she had been the boss for a "long time", the timing could be right for Powell to step aside.
"The squad and the girls coming through have a lot of talent and there is more to come," said Powell.
"We proved it [against France] and showed great character and that we can compete with best in world, so we just want that to continue."
England were just two minutes away from securing victory in normal time after Jill Scott gave them a lead against the run of play on 59 minutes.
But France's Elise Bussaglia equalised after 88 minutes to make it 1-1 and send the tie to extra-time, before substitute Claire Rafferty and Faye White missed spot-kicks to send England home.
The manner of the defeat was all too familiar for the English, and was hard on them after they had showed superb resilience to push Bruno Bini's team all the way

White, 33, was in tears at the end of the game, having struggled with a knee injury coming into the World Cup, and it is likely to be her final major tournament appearance.
Powell said: "Faye was upset. I said to her she has had a magnificent career. She has dealt with adversity tremendously.
"She's has loads of injuries and was injured before she got here, in terms of whether she would be selected or not.
"She's a magnificent leader and it showed real character today that she was brave enough to step up and take a penalty, so I have nothing but admiration for her.
"Faye said 'right if no-one else wants to do it I will do it' and I'm proud of the fact she had guts and nerve to try and get England to a semi-final."
Given Powell's vast experience, there appears few obvious candidates of similar calibre. She was the first women to obtain a Uefa Pro Licence.
Mo Marley, who currently coaches the England under-19s and Everton, could be one option, although the FA might also consider a male coach.
