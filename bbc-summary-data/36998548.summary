The 47-year-old Briton led with a dressage score of 37.0 penalties after the opening day in Rio.
Fox-Pitt suffered a head trauma in a cross-country fall last October and only returned to action in April.
"I've had an interesting last few months," he said.
Why not come along, meet and ride Henry the mechanical horse at some of the Official Team GB fan parks during the Rio Olympics?
"I've been very lucky - I'm lucky to be here. It was very special riding into the arena today. This is my fifth Olympics - they've all been useless! It would be great if this one went well."
Britain lie third behind Germany and Australia in the team competition.
There is a second day of dressage on Sunday, with cross country on Monday and team and individual medals decided by the show jumping on Tuesday.
