Paul Trollope: Cardiff City will come back stronger, says head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Head coach Paul Trollope has accepted responsibility for Cardiff City's poor form following their 2-0 defeat at Burton Albion.

Bluebirds' defeat was their sixth loss in seven games and leaves them second-from-bottom in the Championship.
But Trollope remains defiant and insists he can salvage Cardiff's season.
"We'll come back stronger after the international break and determined to turn things around," he said.
"It's a results business and we're at the wrong end of the league and it's certainly not the start any of us wanted.
"I'm fully aware the run's not good enough and it's my responsibility."
Trollope, who succeeded Russell Slade in May 2016, has come under increasing pressure following a poor start to the season.
Cardiff have won only two of their 11 league games and suffered their seventh defeat of the season away to Burton Albion.
Jackson Irvine gave the home side an early lead and although Cardiff had several chances to equalise, Lucas Akins's header sealed victory for Nigel Clough's side.
"We weren't good enough at both ends of the pitch," Trollope added.
"At times it doesn't really matter what goes on between the boxes. Games are won and lost in the penalty areas and today they went against us.
"We'll look carefully and work very hard on all the processes of our attacking and defending play and we need to act upon that.
"We've also spoken at length within the bad run we've had about showing that fighting spirit and desire to defend the goal.
"It's a frustrating time but only hard work and togetherness is going to get us out of it and we're confident of doing it."
Cardiff's first game following the international break will be at home to Bristol City on Friday, 14 October.
