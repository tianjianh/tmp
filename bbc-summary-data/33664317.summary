Mhairi Black criticises Westminster's 'silly traditions'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Westminster must decide whether it is a museum or a functional parliament, according to the UK's youngest MP.

Mhairi Black, aged 20, was elected as MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South in May amid a wave of SNP dominance in Scotland.
Her maiden speech in the House of Commons became a viral hit, racking up millions of views.
In an interview with The Times magazine she said she was still getting used to some of the intricacies of Westminster.
On the issue of the no clapping rule in the House of Commons she said: "So you're not allowed to clap like an ordinary person, but you're allowed to bray like a donkey?
"I mean, see PMQs, especially the Conservative side, they've got this weird noise they do. It actually sounds like a drunken mob."
The SNP MP said Westminster had to choose between being a museum or a functional parliament because it is "constantly swinging between the two, and quite often they are at odds".
She said challenges by her party to established parliamentary convention often came about by accident rather than a deliberate attempt to rebel.
"It's the same with a lot of these silly traditions. Quite often, we challenge them because we're oblivious to them, because they're so ridiculous. Any normal person would be like 'What?'"
She also suggested the tradition of having to vote in person, rather than electronically, was outdated.
"Are we genuinely saying that the Underground can log millions of travellers, day in, day out, without a problem, and 650 of us can't hit a button?
"It's just stupid. A couple of Mondays ago, I didn't get home until half past midnight because we were voting. How is anybody with a family supposed to work those hours?"
Ms Black admitted the moments she hates most at Westminster are those in the chamber, where "you just hear folk talking so much guff".
She also spoke about the issue of Scottish independence, saying Scotland was giving the British parliament once last chance with its referendum result last September.
She said: "I'd have another referendum tomorrow, but it's not up to me. It's up to the people of Scotland, and I think people are finding their feet and they're finding their confidence."
