A 24-year-old man was arrested by detectives on suspicion of Syria-related offences at Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, on Monday.
The woman, 20, was arrested at an address in west London.
The pair, both from Birmingham, were held on suspicion of engaging in conduct in preparation for travelling to Syria.
West Midlands Police said the pair were "bailed with strict conditions until a later date while inquiries take place".
"The arrests were part of an ongoing investigation and intelligence-led; there was no immediate threat to public safety," the force added.
