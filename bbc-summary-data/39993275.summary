Parties 'were close to Brexit agreement', says Foster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The DUP leader is expected to say Stormont parties were very close to agreeing on the kind of Brexit they wanted, before talks paused last month.

Arlene Foster will make her remarks to a Eurosceptic thinktank in London.
Mrs Foster will say she is optimistic the parties can pick up where they left off, once the election dust settles.
The former first minister will tell the Bruges Group she is prepared to be flexible about the terms of any Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.
She is also is expected to attack Jeremy Corbyn for refusing to single out the IRA for condemnation when pressed over his past campaigning activities.
The Labour leader said "all bombing is wrong", as he was repeatedly asked to condemn the IRA alone for its role in the Troubles.
Mrs Foster denounced those comments as "beyond the political pale".
The talks aimed at restoring the power-sharing executive were put on hold on 27 April until the general election is over.

Secretary of State James Brokenshire extended the talks deadline until 29 June.
At the time he said some progress had been made, but that there were still a number of outstanding issues.
The political deadlock came after a snap Northern Ireland Assembly election on 2 March brought an end to Stormont's unionist majority and the Democrat Unionist Party's lead over Sinn Féin was cut from 10 seats to one.
The late Martin McGuinness quit as deputy first minister in January in protest against the DUP's handling of a botched green energy scheme.
Sinn Féin has said it will not share power with Mrs Foster as first minister until the conclusion of a public inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.
