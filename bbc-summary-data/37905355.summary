His first goal came in the 14th minute when he touched home Joe Rafferty's delivery from close range.
Davies should have had a second within minutes when he met Reuben Noble-Lazarus' centre only to volley over the top with Lee Worgan's goal at his mercy.
But the former Bradford striker had his second of the night in the 22nd minute when Dale were awarded a spot kick, Bobby-Joe Taylor having been penalised for a tug on Joe Bunney's shirt as the left-back raced to the byline.
Davies calmly stroked the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of Worgan's goal with the keeper diving in the opposite direction.
Maidstone enjoyed a brief spell of pressure early in the second half but never really threatened Conrad Logan in the Dale goal.
The home side were denied a third with Worgan pulling off saves to deny Joe Thompson, Noble-Lazarus and Callum Camps.
Rochdale now face a trip to Carlisle in the second round.
