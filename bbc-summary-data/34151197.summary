Salon Privé has relocated from London to Blenheim Palace for its 10th anniversary, and the three-day event culminates with a "public day" on Saturday.
Co-founder David Bagley described the cars on display as "amazing".
They include the Aston Martin DB10, only 10 of which were made, soon to be seen in James Bond movie Spectre.
However, 007's car can only be seen by premium ticket holders.
Mr Bagley said: "It's the first time we've had a public day.
"For me it's a real opportunity for dads and their lads. All kids love cars.
"The cars we bring here, half of them will have never been seen before. There's going to be a lot of noise, a lot of atmosphere."
There are supercar and hypercar models on show by Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Pagani, McLaren, Zenvo, some of which are worth in excess of £1.5m.
The top tier hypercar category is one increasingly used by car aficionados, and refers to the most expensive and highest-performing supercars.
The event is usually targeted at private buyers, collectors and enthusiasts, but "outgrew" its original locations in Hurlingham and Syon Park.
Mr Bagley added: "As beautiful as they were, Blenheim now offers us an opportunity to create a lovely private event on the south lawn and a public event on the Great Court."
The public part of the show will include a grand parade of more than 60 supercars from 1975 to the present day.
Jamie Spencer-Churchill, the 12th Duke of Marlborough, said it was an honour for the palace to be involved.
"My wife, and son The Marquess of Blandford, and I are personally looking forward to the event as big motor enthusiasts," he added.
