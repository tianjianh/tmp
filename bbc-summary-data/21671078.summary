[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ilkeston station: Derbyshire County Council agrees funds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new railway station could be built in a Derbyshire town after the county council agreed to put up funds for the £6.5m project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ilkeston has not had a station for 46 years and is one of the largest towns in the UK without one.
Derbyshire County Council is set to spend £754,000 on the stop.
The majority of the money needed would come from the government which announced £20m funding for new stations in July.
The authority said the station would reduce congestion on roads to Nottingham and support economic growth.
When the new stations fund was announced, Transport Secretary Justine Greening said it had been directly inspired by Ilkeston.
It is thought services from the railway station would include hourly trains to Nottingham, Chesterfield and Sheffield.
