[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial to three Scottish soldiers who were murdered by the IRA has been damaged in what police have called a hate crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A glass jar containing brown paint was smashed over the monument at White Brae, Ligoniel, on the outskirts of north Belfast.
The damage was discovered at 12:30 BST on Sunday 3 May.
The monument has been repeatedly targeted and damaged since it was put up five years ago.
It is a tribute to teenage brothers John and Joseph McCaig, and their colleague Dougald McCaughey.
The off-duty fusiliers were shot dead at the site by the IRA in March 1971.
The memorial was built using funds raised by the Royal British Legion.
Police have appealed to anyone with information about the attack to contact them.
