Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said the top two floors of the high rise block in Gorton were well alight when it arrived at the scene on Sunday evening.
The fire quickly spread through the timber framed building, it said, and nearby homes were evacuated and roads closed.
GMFRS said no-one was hurt and was investigating the cause of the fire.
Five fire engines attended the blaze at its height.
Incident commander Ben Levy said the fire service received more than 40 calls about the blaze.
"The fire involved a large timber frame building and upon arrival our crews found the top two floors well alight.
"Given the fact it's timber framed and open to the elements the fire spread quite quickly."
