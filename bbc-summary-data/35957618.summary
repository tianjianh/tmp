The footage shows about 15 Barnsley fans in flat caps sitting on the floor of Wembley Way, London, pretending to row a boat ahead of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final on Sunday.
Chris Basiurski, who filmed the clip, said the fans had been in high spirits
Barnsley came back from 0-1 down to win the game 3-2.
Mr Basiurski, a Manchester United fan, said he had gone to the game with two friends from Barnsley.
"I've been to Wembley a few times but my friends had not so I was giving them the full experience and having a drink on Wembley Way," he said.
"These guys had clearly been there for a while and were in high spirits.
"There was a lot of banter between both sets of fans but then one of the Barnsley fans started singing loudly 'You only sing when you're rowing'.
"People started joining in and it just snowballed from there. Within a few minutes an entire row of them were sat on the ground with their flat caps and cans of lager.
"It was one of the funniest build-ups to a match I've seen in a long time."
