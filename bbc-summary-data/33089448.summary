Former Dundee United defender Dods, 40, replaces Ray McKinnon, who moved to Raith Rovers last month.
Scottish League One Brechin is Dods' first managerial charge, having played with Forfar Athletic over the past two seasons.
"I have experienced what Brechin City has to offer in our battles over the past two seasons," he told Brechin's website.
"I greatly look forward to meeting and working with the players who have already demonstrated their commitment to the club as we look to build a squad for the new season.
"I am clear on our objectives as we look to be challenging amongst the best of the part-time teams in Scotland. I thank the club for showing faith in me as a young manager and I look to repay that faith through hard work and endeavour."
Chairman Ken Ferguson added: "There is much work to be done in building a squad for the new season, however we have good players already signed up and we are confident Darren has the contacts in the game to create a team capable of competing in this highly competitive league."
Last season, Brechin qualified for the Scottish Championship play-offs but were beaten over two legs by Alloa Athletic in the semi-finals.
