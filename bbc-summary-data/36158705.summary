A Met Office yellow "be aware" warning was in force as a depression moved westwards across central and southern Scotland on Thursday.
Up to 2.5in (6cm) of snow could fall, mainly in areas above 330ft (100m) with up to 4in (10cm) on higher ground.
Heavier snow is forecast in eastern Scotland overnight into Friday, extending into northern England.
Up to 6in (15cm) could fall on higher ground in Scotland, while an area including north west England, Yorkshire and East Midlands could experience lighter snowfalls.
Lower than average temperatures for late April saw minus 5.6C recorded at Kinbrace in Sutherland in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The fresh snowfall has prompted the Mountaineering Council of Scotland to warn walkers and climbers to be aware of the potential for avalanches.
The Met Office chief forecaster said: "A depression moving into the area is encountering cold air, bringing snow even to low levels at times."
The forecasting service said it was harder to predict how far east or southwards the snow would progress, or give an accurate indication of how it would affect lower levels.
"There are differences between models in the position which brings uncertainty about location, with latest indications that it is likely to be further south than previously expected," the forecaster said.
"In addition, there are uncertainties about the lowest level to which snow will fall, which could be 100m either side of heights quoted in the warning. "
