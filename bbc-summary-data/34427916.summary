[SN]TITLE[SN]
Van driver jailed for Alan Cronin cyclist death crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A van driver has been jailed for 12 months for killing a triathlon coach who was riding his bike in Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damian Niepieklo, 22, only arrived in the UK the day before he hit Alan Cronin and had been making deliveries in Birmingham and south Wales.
Mr Cronin, 60, from Chester, was killed instantly on 11 June on the A483.
Niepieklo, from Poland, was jailed after admitting causing death by careless driving and banned from driving in the UK for two years.
Mold Crown Court heard Mr Cronin, a coach for the Chester Triathlon Club, was riding a brightly-coloured bike, wearing bright clothing and had been seen by other drivers.
Niepieklo stopped briefly and then drove off, leaving Mr Cronin, of Guilden Sutton, in the road.
Speaking through an interpreter, Niepieklo told the judge he was really sorry and could only imagine what Mr Cronin's family was going through.
Judge Rhys Rowlands said: "But in my judgement, and in that of all right thinking people, to drive away from an accident such as this after you had just hit a cyclist is a pretty dreadful thing for you to have done."
