Identity 2016: How are you changing?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year the BBC is examining the concept of "identity".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We would like you to take part, using your videos, photos, drawings and animations to show how your identity is changing.
We will showcase some of your submissions across the BBC, and you can get involved in the global conversation by using #BBCIdentity.
Do you define yourself by where you come from? Or does technology make you feel connected to people outside of your immediate environment? In this changing world how is your identity changing?
You can submit your vision of identity from 14 March to 18 April 2016.
We would also like to know your name, age, nationality and contact details, including phone number and Skype account if you have one.
Please read our terms and conditions.
As people become increasingly connected and more mobile, the BBC is exploring how identities are changing.
Learn more about the BBC's Identity season or join the discussion on Twitter using the hashtag #BBCIdentity.
