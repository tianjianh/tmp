[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two Lancasters fly together for the last time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crowds gathered to bid farewell to the Canadian Lancaster plane which has been touring the UK over the summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Vera" joined the only other airworthy Lancaster, operated by the RAF, for a series of events and is now flying home via Iceland and Greenland.
Taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, the two bombers were joined by Spitfires and Hurricanes.
Vera still has a UK engine after one of its own developed a fault and an appeal has been launched to fund repairs.
The aircraft passed over RAF Cranwell, RAF Waddington, Lincoln Cathedral and RAF Scampton, before leaving the area.
It is estimated each of the Lancasters has flown about 6,000 miles attending dozens of shows and events.
These included a flypast of the Derwent dams where the Dambusters practised.
