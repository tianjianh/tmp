They appear to show a huge burning meteor flying through the night sky.
The green fireball is seen falling from the sky and burning up, until it disappears.
It was seen by lots of people across the capital city Bangkok and other areas.
The Thai Astronomical Society believe it could be a "fireball" because of it's brightness.
