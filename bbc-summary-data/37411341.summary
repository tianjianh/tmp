[SN]TITLE[SN]
Germany's fight against extremism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The arrests this month of three Syrians at refugee centres in Germany came amid public nervousness about the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in the country. So how are authorities in one city - Bremen - coping with the situation?

One told me he had dared passage from Turkey by boat, then walked 2,000 miles, another how a bomb had destroyed her car, her house. Many worried about the family they had left behind.
The performers of the Syrian Expat Philharmonic Orchestra all have different stories about why they left Syria.
Some had been in Europe for years pursuing musical careers, one arrived just two weeks ago.
Together they produce music that is sincere, passionate and beautiful, and a reminder of how migration can enrich Europe.
But the influx of people, is also placing new demands on German law enforcement.
I visited Bremen, where the orchestra was founded, to see how the city, and the state, deals with the threat of terrorism, amid what some call "the refugee crisis".
But while some in Germany worry about terrorism from Syria, what first drew me to Bremen was a German national who had tried to export it.
In February, I reported on one infamous "Bremer", as the locals are called - a former member of the so-called Islamic State, and one time British resident, Harry Sarfo.
While still in "investigative custody", Sarfo had written to me in response to questions I had sent.
Over eight pages, he told me how much he regretted joining IS in Syria and warned that the organisation was planning attacks in Britain and Germany - attacks he said he had twice been asked to carry out by IS's secret service.
In the summer of 2015, Harry Sarfo was arrested at Bremen Airport after spending months with Islamic State.
The German, of Ghanaian heritage, who converted to Islam while living in the UK, had appeared in, and helped to make, an IS propaganda video.
At the time we made contact in February 2016, Sarfo had not yet been convicted of a terror related crime; he is now serving three years in prison.
There were some evident mistakes in Sarfo's letter.
Experts suggested he was a "foot soldier " with an imperfect grasp of IS operations, but in subsequent media interviews he has stuck to his story - and his testimony is one the very few we have from a returned, and seemingly repentant, European jihadists.
In a non-descript office attached to Bremen airport, Dierk Schittkowski, chief of Intelligence of the local Domestic Intelligence Service, told me his warnings were "a danger we take very seriously".
Well they might - in the past few days, three suspected IS operatives were arrested at refugee shelters in the states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein.
Press reports described them as asylum seekers.
Daniel Heinke, Bremen's chief of detectives, admits resources are stretched.
But the threat so far of IS supporters smuggling themselves into Bremen under cover of the flows of refugees has failed to materialise.
One police officer, who did not wish to be named for security reasons, told me they had received a number of tip-offs about individuals who had arrived from Syria as refugees, but not a single one had turned out to be a genuine threat.
But that still leaves a threat from those who may be radicalised within Germany.
Mr Heinke told me that 26 adults and juveniles had left from the state of Bremen to join IS.
Five had died in Syria, but six had, like Harry Sarfo, returned.
He worried that as IS faced military reversals, some of its fighters might seek to continue the conflict in Germany.
"When the situation should arise that Islamic State really collapses, we have to face the threat that many of its fighters may return to Europe," he said.
"We are preparing for this."
Youngsters targeted
Bremen has about 440 Islamists, intelligence officials say - a high number relative to its size -  and there is a fear some may be seeking to radicalise recently arrived refugees.
"This is possible, we can't rule it out," I was told by the unnamed officer at police headquarters, who stressed it was still a potential threat.
