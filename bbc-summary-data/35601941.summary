The 28-year-old Irishman was withdrawn during the first half of Monday's 3-1 defeat at his former club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
An influential player for the Dons, Hayes has scored five goals in 32 appearances this season.
Monday's loss in the Highlands leaves Aberdeen three points behind Premiership leaders Celtic.
"As anticipated, Jonny has a tear on his hamstring and the scan shows that he will he out for be for three weeks," said manager Derek McInnes.
"I don't think we'll get him back before then.
"We've lost important players at different stages of the season and it represents an opportunity for someone else.
"We know the importance of Jonny but we can't get too down about it."
