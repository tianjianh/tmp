Snapshots from the 1940s show crews saving lives during World War Two, assisting at road accidents and even taking a well-deserved tea break.
London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said there was "great affection and trust" in the brigade.
The first known record of a fire station in London was in Soho in 1699.
It was run by an insurance firm at "Tom's Coffee House" in St Martin's Lane.
Back then, firemen would leave a house to burn unless it bore a plate showing the owners were insured, the brigade said.
But after a blaze at a warehouse in Tooley Street in Southwark destroyed buildings a quarter of a mile away and killed their superintendent, the insurance companies asked the government to take over and The Metropolitan Fire Brigade was formed in 1866.
London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: "Londoners have a great affection and trust in the brigade and that is down to the huge professionalism of firefighters past and present."
Sixty-five drop-in open days are being held over the course of the year at fire stations all over London to mark the anniversary.
