Lewis Hamilton took a dominant victory in a hectic British Grand Prix to cut team-mate Nico Rosberg's championship lead to one point.

Hamilton led every lap of a race that started under the safety car in wet conditions but dried, to take his fourth career win at Silverstone.
Rosberg in the other Mercedes was left to battle back to second past the Red Bull of the impressive Max Verstappen.
But Rosberg was demoted to third after an illegal radio transmission.
With five laps to go, Rosberg hit a problem which required him to reset systems in the car and then avoid seventh gear - shifting straight from sixth to eighth.
He hung on in second place but lost it after race stewards handed him a 10-second penalty after the detail of the help Mercedes gave him over the radio, which transgressed limitations on the amount of help drivers can be given by teams.

Rosberg had said immediately after the race: "It was a very critical problem because I was stuck in seventh gear and about to stop on track."
Hamilton's win sent the 135,000 fans packed into the famous old track into paroxysms of joy as they cheered Hamilton's progress to the flag on the last lap.
The world champion went over to celebrate with the fans at Club corner after parking his car up at the end of the race before soaking up their cheers on the podium.
It was an intoxicating race, with action throughout the field, featuring wheel-to-wheel racing and a number of spins and off-track moments as drivers struggled on the tricky track surface.
"I am so grateful," said Hamilton. "We've got the best fans here, thank you so much. The good English weather came out. It was so tricky in those conditions. But that's what I love about this race - something always happens."

Hamilton drove impressively throughout on a track made treacherous by a heavy downpour about 15 minutes before the start.
The sun had come out before the race got under way, but the track was drenched and it was five laps before race director Charlie Whiting felt the conditions were safe enough to let the drivers off the leash.

This triggered a series of pit stops on successive laps as drivers swapped 'extreme' wet tyres for intermediates.
Hamilton pulled out three seconds on Rosberg in the first half-lap after the start as a bunch of midfield drivers pitted immediately and he, Rosberg and Verstappen then pitted after two laps.
The Dutchman closed on Rosberg, catching him by lap 15, and he passed him with a superb move around the outside of the daunting Becketts swerves on lap 16.
Verstappen held on to second despite making his pit stop for dry-weather 'slick' tyres a lap later than the Mercedes drivers, rejoining about five seconds ahead of Rosberg on lap 18.
Both Hamilton and Verstappen were among a series of drivers who fell prey to a wet patch on the entry to the fast Abbey corner but were able to continue without damage to their positions.
Rosberg inched closer and closer to Verstappen until he was on his tail by lap 30, with 22 still to go.
But it took the German another eight laps to get close enough on the exit of the Becketts swerves to close up on Hangar Straight and sweep past the Red Bull around the outside of the fast Stowe corner.
Verstappen, ultimately, recovered the place, after Rosberg was penalised.
Daniel Ricciardo made it a three-four for Red Bull but he was out-driven by another starring performance from Verstappen, while Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen had a wild race, losing control at Abbey three times but still managing to pass Force India's Sergio Perez for fifth place in the closing stages.
The Finn's team-mate Sebastian Vettel, who also spun at Abbey, was 10th, after being hit with a five-second penalty for forcing Williams' Felipe Massa off the track while overtaking him.
Jenson Button finished 12th for McLaren, one place ahead of team-mate Fernando Alonso, who was challenging Massa for ninth when he became one of many to fall victim to Abbey.
"Ever since 2007 I have felt the energy from the fans here, the best crowd in the world - the success speeds up that connection. Every time I made it through certain corners I could see the fans in the corner of my eye.
"In the closing laps, I could see them shouting. I am very honoured. It is a very humbling experience to be in this sport, particularly in a time of difficulty in the world and see so much love in the world.
"On this day, we come together and it is a beautiful thing."
