It's the semi-finals this weekend and Ore Oduba, Louise Redknapp, Danny Mac and Claudia Fragapane are all still in with a chance to win the glitterball trophy.
This year is also Len's last year on the show, after being on it for 12 years. He says he'll miss turning up on a Saturday and seeing his fellow judges the most.
Watch the video to see what score Len gave Jenny for her interview.
