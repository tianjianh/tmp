Green light for Hearts' Tynecastle stand in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to rebuild the main stand at Tynecastle football stadium have been approved by Edinburgh city council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About Â£11m will be spent on the upgrade at the Hearts ground. The current main stand was built in 1919.
The club hopes work will begin next month.
Hearts owner Ann Budge said last month that she hoped the work would be completed in September 2017. The new stand will increase the capacity to more than 7,200 from 4,720.
Ms Budge said the current stand was still useable but not up to the standards that fans expect.
The plans involve demolishing large sections of the existing main stand, and the ticket offices and shops.
