Sam Hart: Liverpool youngster joins Port Vale on a season-long loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have signed teenage defender Sam Hart on loan from Liverpool until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old left-back becomes the 15th signing to join Vale since the arrival of Bruno Ribeiro as manager of the League One club on 20 June.
He was a regular member of the Liverpool Under-21 side last season.
Vale's latest move comes following a solid start to the season, in which Ribeiro's men have lost once in four league games, conceding just one goal.
