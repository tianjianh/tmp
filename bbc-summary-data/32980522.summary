Benjamin Edge, 25, fell from a structure he was helping to dismantle in Ramsbottom on 10 December and later died from "catastrophic" head injuries.
Two men, aged 23 and 30 from Bury, have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.
A joint police and health and safety investigation continues into the circumstances surrounding the death.
The two men have also been arrested on conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, along with a 32-year-old man from Burnley, Lancashire, and man aged 35 from Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester Police said.
Paying tribute Mr Edge's family said he was "a loving, caring son, twin brother and family man.
"Ben was a much loved partner and father and will always remain a huge part of everyone's lives."
Det Sgt Lawrence Dixon said: "We are continuing to look into the circumstances that led up to Ben's death, so we can provide his family with the answers of exactly what happened on that day in December."
