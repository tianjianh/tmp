It comes after the Edinburgh club sent her one of their eye-catching primrose and pink away strips.
Louise gathered a bit of attention last month when she a wore pink, yellow and black dress - dubbed unkindly by some as "looking a bit like a Battenburg".
She tweeted: "I love this shirt. Battenburg dress move over thank you @JamTarts it is fantastic."
The Hearts top pays tribute to the racing colours of the 5th Earl of Rosebery, which have also been used by Scotland.
BBC Breakfast co-host Dan Walker was not left out, with the gift of a matching pink and yellow tie.
