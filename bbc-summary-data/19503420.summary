[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patience Tayo Awe is an independent candidate with a "passion for volunteering and serving the community".
An IT post-graduate, she has worked in various sectors and has also served as a charity trustee.
If elected, she wants the public to help set local policing priorities and give victims of crime a voice "with the hope of transforming painful memories into powerful motivators and sources of strength".
Patience Tayo Awe's election statement
UKIP candidate Barry Cooper graduated with a masters degree in history and currently works at his family-run luxury furniture business in London.
The 35-year-old admitted he has no professional experience within law enforcement but said expertise can be brought into a team and it is the ideas, common sense and willingness to reform he can bring to the table.
He promises to lobby against further budget cuts to the Thames Valley force and ensure funds are spent in the right places, with any cuts coming from "vanity projects" and the top down.
Barry Cooper's election statement
Geoff Howard is a Slough-based businessman, magistrate, school governor and former borough councillor of 13 years.
He wants to be the voice of the people and represent the interests of the community.
The Independent candidate hopes to make the role accountable to the public at a time where police forces are having to manage efficiency savings placed upon them by central government.
Geoff Howard's election statement
Prof John Howson, who is the Liberal Democrat candidate, has been a magistrate for 22 years as well as being a former government advisor, businessman and academic.
He has experienced crime as the victim of a classroom stabbing as a teacher, experienced four burglaries and been involved in two road accidents.
Prof Howson said he knows what it is like to be a victim of crime and believes too much crime is linked to addictions. He believes stopping reoffending is the key to keeping police budgets down.

As a barrister for 11 years, Tim Starkey has prosecuted and defended in hundreds of trials, including a number of high-profile human trafficking cases.
A previous Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, he left the party in protest at their "broken promises" and the government's "reckless programme of cuts".
His key policing priorities include putting victims first and fighting budget cuts. Mr Starkey also wants to stop police privatisation, create a more effective service and keep decision making local.
