Glasgow Warriors 33-25 Leinster: Gregor Townsend seeks improvement despite win

Despite a 33-25 win over Leinster, Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend insists his side must improve in defence.

Four tries from Tommy Seymour helped the Warriors to back-to-back bonus-point Pro12 victories.
But the hosts were trailing by 10 points early in the second half after several soft concessions.
"Defensively we just weren't in our zone today," Townsend told BBC Scotland.
"Normally we're a very good defensive team and in the first half we weren't.
"I was very proud with the reaction, second-half they didn't score a try and we went through set after set of putting in much better tackles and keeping our shape."
Seymour's four tries on Saturday added to the brace the winger scored in the opening round hammering of Connacht.
The first came from a beautiful pass from centre Sam Johnson, the second and third interceptions, and the fourth a thunderous set-piece burst.
"Six tries in two games is pretty good," said Townsend. "Tommy's in great physical shape.
"That (first) interception try gave us a lot of confidence that we can defend well, and not only can we defend well but we can score off our defence.
"I think every time he touched the ball after that he did something really positive for our team."
Seymour admitted beating both last season's finalists, with bonus points to boot, was a fantastic start to the Pro12 season.
But he insisted the Warriors will have to tighten up ahead of next week's trip to Cardiff Blues, who also remain unbeaten.
"It was pretty special," said Seymour of his prolific afternoon. "It's a huge win going forward.
"It's very early on in the season - we're obviously incredibly happy, and it's a huge momentum boost beating two quality opposition like that, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves.
"We had the harsh words at half-time and talked about the things we needed to correct, but that's the positive thing about us, we're harsh on ourselves, we're sensible when it comes to taking on the advice that we're giving each other.
"We're not panicking, we're not trying to force things - if you start trying to chase things that aren't coming naturally you often find yourselves on the end of the bigger margin.
"I hope I haven't run the well dry yet. I'm incredibly happy and thankful for the guys inside me having that ability to put those passes in and put me away."
