Rise in helpline calls over suspected child abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The NSPCC in Scotland has revealed a 19% rise in the number of calls to its helplines from adults worried about children being abused.

The NSPCC said the reasons were not clear, although greater awareness of sexual abuse, arising from historical cases, may be a cause.
It said this showed the Scottish legal system must become more sensitive.
It has called for a "bold approach" to reform the way child sex abuse cases are handled.
The figures were published as the NSPCC prepared to launch its third "How Safe are our Children?" report measuring the extent and nature of child abuse across the UK.
Scottish government figures showed that in 2013-14 there were 3,742 sexual offences against children including rape, sexual assault and grooming - a 10-year high.
The charity said that in the following year, 2014-15, the number of contacts to its helpline from adults in Scotland worried a child was being sexually abused rose by 19% from 341 to 407.
Almost half (203) were considered so serious they were immediately referred to the police or children's services.
The NSPCC said it was not clear why the number of offences had risen.
But it said more victims may have the courage to come forward following the reporting of historical cases and the police may also have improved their recording methods.
The charity praised the Scottish government for establishing an inquiry into historical abuse in children's institutions.
But Matt Forde, NSPCC Scotland's head of national services, said as more children spoke out, the Scottish legal system needed to develop a more sensitive and effective response to ensuring justice was served.
He said: "The nation has been horrified by the revelations of decades of horrendous child abuse. But while the Scottish government's inquiry is historical, child abuse is not.
"For too many children, our court system adds further trauma to their earlier experiences of abuse.  We need a bold approach to reform our legal system."
A  Scottish Courts Service report "Evidence and Procedure", published in March, agreed changes were necessary.
It said: "In recent decades the number of child and vulnerable witnesses being called to give evidence has increased dramatically.
"They have, however, been introduced into a system that was ill-equipped to accommodate them, with the result that there have been a series of adjustments to the law and practice that, at best, only partially address their needs."
The NSPCC said a Scandinavian system, called Barnehus, had helped free children from further suffering, allowing the therapeutic support they needed to begin more quickly.
In specialist centres, designed to be non-threatening and reassuring for victims, a team, including a criminal investigator and prosecutor, a health expert, a senior social worker, a judicial counsellor and forensic expert worked together to support the child.
The aim was to help victims through possible trauma and to make sense of official procedures to reduce long-term problems.
