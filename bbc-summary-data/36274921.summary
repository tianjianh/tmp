[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Truro councillor Lance Dyer published a tweet saying '"Holocaust hoax" suggesting that six million Jews weren't killed in the genocide.
Mr Dyer's membership of Mebyon Kernow, the Cornish nationalist party, has been suspended pending an investigation.
The party leadership said the views expressed on the website were "wholly repugnant".
The website claims the true number of Jews killed in concentration camps in the World War Two was just 271,000 - but six million is the usual figure cited.
Mr Dyer has now said he had been "very foolish" and that he wished he had taken more care to understand "the full significance of the false claims made on the website".
He said he hoped to "make amends in the coming week" and that he was not a Holocaust denier.
Shortly after posting the tweet he made attempts to justify his reasons for doing so to other Twitter users.
Jeremy Jacobsen, from Kehillat Kernow, Cornwall's Jewish community organisation, said: "It seems absurd to me that anyone should question something which has been so well-documented.
"What was his point in drawing attention to this?"
The Mayor of Truro, Rob Nolan, said Mr Dyer's remarks were "abhorrent in the extreme" and called for a full investigation by Truro City Council.
Mebyon Kernow's party leadership said the investigation into Mr Dyer's actions would begin in the next 48 hours.
