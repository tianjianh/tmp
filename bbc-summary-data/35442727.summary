[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother jailed for killing her young daughter has pleaded guilty to the murder of her baby son 13 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At Lewes Crown Court, Lesley Dunford, 37, admitted killing seven-month-old Harley who was found dead in his cot at the family home in Camber, East Sussex, in August 2003.
Dunford's three-year-old daughter Lucy was killed six months later.
Dunford, formerly of Windermere Close, Exeter, was jailed for seven years for Lucy's manslaughter in June 2012
Defending, Alan Kent QC said he met Dunford at Wandsworth Prison where he concluded she had a defence to the murder charge.
But after she arrived at Lewes Crown Court on Friday she told him she intended to plead guilty, the court heard.
Mr Kent said the reason she gave was that she did not want to travel to court every day of a trial.
"That to me is not a good reason for a defendant to plead guilty and therefore we are submitting that it is an equivocal one," he said.
The court had an adjournment for Dunford to speak to her counsel but she refused to come from her cell to the courtroom, Mr Kent added.
After Mr Justice Singh was told Dunford was aware of the consequences, the judge said: "The only thing I can do is accept the plea and adjourn the case for sentencing."
Prosecutor Philippa McAtasney QC did not open the case and said: "We take the view that the defendant, having been properly advised, fully understands the court process."
Sentencing was adjourned to 18 March pending psychiatric reports.
