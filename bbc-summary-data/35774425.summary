Dr Kevin Moore, the director of the National Football Museum, will lead a working group to look into potential location and funding opportunities.
The heritage exhibition does not have a permanent home, with the archive stored at Heritage Quay in Huddersfield.
"It is clear that there is a game-wide passion for heritage," Moore said.
"A national museum will bring to life the characters and events that have helped shaped this great sport over the last 120 years and before.
"We are looking at developing a high-quality museum that eclipses all other sports museums in the world, a facility that is immersive, interactive and educational and which contributes to the strategic objectives of the game."
A location for the museum could be announced in 2016, with funding, design and construction processes to follow.
Previously, former Great Britain, Dewsbury and Penrith Panthers hooker Mike Stephenson had established a museum at the birthplace of Northern Union, the George Hotel in Huddersfield.
However, the closure of the venue in 2013 brought an end to the permanent display.
