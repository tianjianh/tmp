It will welcome visitors to a new wing of the Ruskin Museum at Coniston, which is dedicated to Campbell and the Bluebird craft he died in.
Artist Graham Bell is donating the sculpture, which will be unveiled by Mr Campbell's daughter Gina in November.
Mr Campbell died when Bluebird crashed on Coniston Water in 1967.
A spokesman for the Ruskin Museum said: "Graham Ball approached the museum in 2008, as a life-long admirer of Donald Campbell, to ask whether the museum would like to accept the gift of a life-size statue of his hero.
"The offer was made with no obligation, though he asked for our help in sourcing suitable photos and other images to inform his work.
"One of the problems lay in finding images illustrating Campbell's left and right profiles, as most shots tended to be full or three-quarter face.
"Decisions had to be made about stance, expression, clothing and what, if anything, the figure should hold.
"The resultant sculpture, in bronze-patinated resin, will welcome visitors into The Bluebird Wing, the new extension where Bluebird K7 is to be displayed once the conservation rebuild has been completed."
Bluebird was recovered from the lake in 2001 and is currently being restored.
