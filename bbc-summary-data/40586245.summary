The win took Hampshire above Surrey to the top of the early South Group table, while Sussex have lost both of their games.
Hampshire had appeared on course for a much larger total when openers Vince and Rossouw brought up their century partnership in the 10th over, but some disciplined bowling by Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan kept Sussex in with a chance.
Wright, who scored 101 in Sunday's loss to Glamorgan, continued his good form with a 32-ball half-century to get Sussex's run chase off to a positive start.
However, leg-spinner Crane bowled with great control and the dismissal of New Zealand batsman Taylor - superbly stumped by wicketkeeper Lewis McManus - proved a critical moment.
