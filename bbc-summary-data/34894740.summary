[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rory Johnson, from Skipton, has not been seen since leaving the York Central Travel Lodge at 00:15 GMT on Friday.
The 29-year-old did not return to the hotel and failed to turn up to work on Friday.
North Yorkshire Police believed he might have "got into difficulty" while walking near the River Ouse.
Humberside Police Underwater Search Unit has been carrying an extensive search of the river near City Mills and Skeldergate Bridge.
Dave Benson, from the York Rescue Boat charity said they were assisting police.
He said: "If anyone did go in the water it's extremely dangerous, it's very cold, there's a fast flow and the water is currently higher than normal levels."
Mr Johnson was with friends at The Postern Gate pub at around 23:30 GMT and returned to the hotel on Piccadilly for a short time, before heading back out.
Anyone who saw him on Thursday evening or Friday morning is urged to call police. He is described as white, of slim build and has short, blonde hair.
