[SN]TITLE[SN]
Looking to buy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The £52m buy out of Cardiff Airport is an acquisition many people are aware of.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was, after all, the most high-profile purchase the Welsh government has ever undertaken.
But what many people won't be aware of are the figures showing that ministers have already spent more than £60m on a range of other sites for economic development purposes.
These are business parks, unused factories and office blocks.
I'm told there was never a designated strategy that was set out in a speech or a policy document.
Instead, it is something that has developed as a result of responding to a variety of opportunities that arose.
I think it is also a reflection of the views of Economy Minister Edwina Hart who is unapologetic in her opinion that there is nothing wrong with bringing certain things under state control.
And it is also a reflection of what she's told by her advisor on these matters, David Goldstone, a successful London-based property developer who originally hails from Swansea.
Edwina Hart's views on state intervention were recently on display when she spoke about her desire for the new Wales and Borders rail franchise, currently held by Arriva Trains Wales, to be run by a not-for-profit organisation that is part of the Welsh government.
In relation to her decisions on the wider property portfolio, there is some support from the private sector for her decisions.
To illustrate this let me share the views of Chris Sutton, who runs the Wales office of the property consultancy JLL about one of the acquisitions, the former Sogefi car parts factory in Llantrisant.
He gave me a sales pitch: it's opposite the world-famous Royal Mint, it's two miles from the M4 and five miles from a large potential labour force in the Rhondda valley.
The obvious question is why does it need to be bought using around £2m of taxpayers money when it is supposedly such an attractive prospect.
He says it could be bought privately but if it was, the site would be split up into smaller units, rather then kept intact which could, potentially, be the future location of a company headquarters if it's marketed in the right way.
The argument goes that only public money allows this to happen.
The Welsh Conservatives say the scale of this kind of spending can't be justified at a time of pressure on public services like health.
The leader, Andrew RT Davies, has repeatedly used the purchase of the airport as a stick to beat the first minister with when he complains about the financial settlement from Westminster.
Mr Davies' argument goes that things can't be that bad because the first minister managed to find £52m "under the mattress" to buy an airport.
Expect him to say similar things in relation to the business parks.
Two final and separate points: it's an obvious one but worth saying that at least buying up sites leaves ministers with assets which can give them a rental income or even a tidy profit if they can be sold on when the market improves.
And there is a specific issue in the centre of Cardiff about the acquisition of an office block for £15m that had already been built by a developer in the Capital Quarter and another site for £7m in nearby Callaghan Square.
The justification is to try to meet the widely accepted need for high quality office space in the capital.
Edwina Hart told me she is going to go ahead to fund the development of a new office block at Callaghan Square. It will cost an estimated £15m.
But unlike other parts of Wales, the centre of Cardiff is an area where the private sector is investing.
A number of commercial property agents and developers have told me off the record there are serious concerns about the use of taxpayers' money on this development as there are companies out there willing to take the risk.
Andrew RT Davies says the Welsh government in this instance is directly competing with the private sector.
But the economy minister isn't giving an inch. She doubts the readiness of the private sector to carry out this work and, as a result, is going to plough on with the first phase.
As with all of these sites, the proof will be in the pudding which in this case comes down to how many tenants will sign up in order to create jobs.
In other words, it's a numbers game.
