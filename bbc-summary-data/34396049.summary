A teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old student could face being struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A National College of Teaching and Leadership panel found Marc Richardson, 34, guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.
The panel heard CCTV footage showed the pair emerging from beneath a stage at Tottington High School, Bury, where he was head of drama.
The married teacher had been previously warned about his behaviour.
In 2012, he sent "inappropriate communications" to another student, whom he said was "too attractive to teach" and asked her to keep quiet. He was given a final written warning by the school in January 2013.
Richardson, who did not attend the hearing, admitted being alone with a student in a room under the stage outside teaching hours in 2014.
He resigned, was arrested and released without charge.
The panel heard he sent messages to the girl, engaging in sexual conversations.
Her mother said she had "niggling feelings" about the teacher when her daughter asked about the contraceptive pill.
Another witness said her friend told her she had "done everything" with her boyfriend, who she admitted was Richardson.
Mark Tweedle, panel chairman, said: "The panel considered it is plain that sexual conversations took place between Pupil B and Mr Richardson, and they contained explicit references to sexual acts between them."
He said Richardson's conduct fell "significantly short of the standards expected of the profession."
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said of the arrest in 2014: "A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a child and the sexual grooming of a child.
"A full investigation was conducted by the Greater Manchester Police public protection investigation unit and the man was released without charge."
