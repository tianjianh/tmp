Florence and the Machine have reclaimed the top of the official UK album chart after their Glastonbury appearance prompted a last-minute sales boost.

The band had been at number four in the midweek charts, as newcomers Wolf Alice outsold the competition with their debut, My Love Is Cool.
But in the end, Florence won the race by just 528 copies.
Their album, How Big How Blue How Beautiful, had previously debuted at number one last month.
Led by singer Florence Welch, the band were promoted to Glastonbury headliners two weeks ago when Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg.
Their Pyramid Stage set was rapturously received, with the Telegraph's Neil McCormick calling it "a real moment of rock communion" and "pop music of the very highest order".
Wolf Alice, a four-piece led by singer and guitarist Ellie Roswell, also played Glastonbury this weekend, playing a blistering set on the Park Stage.
Their record was the only new entry in the top five, with last week's number one - Drones by Muse - dropping to third place; and Taylor Swift's 1989 climbing to number four after a week of shows in the UK.
Ed Sheeran's X was at number five, racking up an impressive 53 consecutive weeks in the Top 10, while art-pop quartet Everything Everything earned their second Top 10 album with Get To Heaven landing at number seven.
In the singles chart, rapper Tinie Tempah scored his sixth number one with Not Letting Go, a duet with Jess Glynne.
The song, which the star says was inspired by a "romance I had last summer," is his first solo number one in five years, after his second album failed to reach the heights of his debut.
However, he has remained in the limelight with chart-topping verses on Rita Ora's RIP and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's Crazy Stupid Love.
Tinie Tempah's single dethroned Jason Derulo, whose single Want To Want Me had been number one for four weeks.
The US artist dropped to number three, behind Belgian dance producer Lost Frequencies, who rose 44 places to enter the chart at number 2, with Are You With Me.
Other new entries came from Flo Rida, James Bay, Duke Dumont and former X Factor contestants Stereo Kicks.
