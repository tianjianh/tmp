Fifty anthems for the African continent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
To mark the 50th anniversary of the African Union - formerly the Organisation of African Unity, BBC World Service listeners suggested the African songs that summed up the continent to them.

From the suggestions, the BBC's DJ Edu, who hosts a weekly African music show on BBC radio, compiled them into a special five-minute mix of 50 songs from 50 countries.
DJ Edu also picked the five songs that he personally felt represented Africa:
This is a very special song. If you play it anywhere in Africa, people know it.
For me, it was the song that introduced African music to the world  - you'd be on holiday in Jamaica and you'd hear it.
Also, 2Face Idibia is one of the most humble human beings on the planet.
His wedding in Dubai earlier this year was entirely funded by his fans - that's how much people admire him.
This is a really exciting new song from Ghana, a follow-up to the world-famous Azonto dance, which went viral (it was viewed more than 11 million times on YouTube).
What's also very exciting is the fact that Fuse ODG is a British musician of Ghanaian origin, and his track is being play-listed across the UK.
Eric Wainaina was in a boy-band in the 1990s called Five Alive, before he went on to have a solo career in World Music.
DJ Edu- Destination Africa
Daima means forever.
It almost became the national anthem in Kenya.
It summed up how young Kenyans feel about their country.
It was sung at presidential inaugurations.
It's got harmony, it's melodic.
People really love it and it has made Eric Wainaina a household name in Kenya.
Benin-born Angelique Kidjo is one of the most outstanding and successful female artists in Africa.
Agolo, which was nominated for a Grammy in 1994, is very traditional and yet modern.
If you're an African you can relate to it and if you're not, you can connect to it.
Ms Kidjo is truly an icon - ask any female artist in Africa and she will tell you she looks up to her.
Known as the "Princess of Africa", she is a true ambassador of South African and African music.
I remember hearing her music while growing up in Kenya - she is one of the first artists to cross boundaries with her music.
Yvonne Chaka Chaka has a unique voice and sound and inspires and uplifts young women and young Africans alike.
DJ Edu's 50-track mix was featured on the BBC World Service programme Newsday. You can see DJ Edu's entire playlist and share your comments on the BBC Africa Facebook page.
