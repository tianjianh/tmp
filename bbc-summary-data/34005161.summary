The other contestants to have been announced so far are; Peter Andre, Carol Kirkwood, Katie Derham, Georgia May Foote, Kellie Bright, Ainsley Harriott and Jeremy Vine. More are still to be announced.
Mr O'Donnell said that he is nervous, despite his many years in show-business.
"It's really happening," he said.
The singer said he is uncertain if he is up to the standard required.
"I can put a few steps together, but can I dance to the level I need to dance? Well, that's a whole other ball game."
Earlier this year, the Kincasslagh man decided to take a short break from touring.
"I told myself that I would only consider doing something if it was both different and exciting. Well, what could be more exciting than Strictly Come Dancing? I love to dance and boy am I looking forward to getting started and being the best that I can be," he added.
Daniel O'Donnell, who has sold more than 15m albums, first rose to fame in 1983 and has had considerable success in Ireland, the UK, the US and Australia.
Strictly Come Dancing returns to BBC One for its 13th series in September 2015.
