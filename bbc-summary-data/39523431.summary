[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 2-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two early goals were enough for Exeter to get their play-off push back on track with a 2-1 win over plucky Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grecians made a blistering start and were 2-0 up inside the first six minutes. The first came after great play by David Wheeler and Reuben Reid, who teed-up Jordan Moore-Taylor to rifle in a fourth-minute opener.
Then, as Barnet struggled to clear their lines, Jake Taylor poked the ball to Wheeler who managed to squeeze the ball past Jamie Stephens from barely two yards out.
Ruben Bover forced goalkeeper Christy Pym into a smart stop with a fierce free-kick and Simeon Akinola glanced a header wide as Barnet responded, while Harry Taylor was also foiled by Pym with a shot from distance.
Wheeler was off-target on the hour mark for Exeter before John Akinde reduced the arrears in the 69th minute when he smashed the ball into the back of the net from 10 yards.
As Barnet pressed for an equaliser, Pym saved well to deny Mauro Vilhete and Akinde headed a great chance over the crossbar in stoppage time.
