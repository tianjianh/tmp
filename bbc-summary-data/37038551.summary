The hashtag, #Olympics_Women_Don't_Represent_Us, opposing women's participation in the games in general, garnered over 100,000 tweets.
But an Egyptian beach volleyball team was also mocked and humiliated on Arab social media for wearing long-sleeved T-shirts and leggings.
While many came out in their defence, there seems to be a minority set on criticising women in sport regardless of how they act.
