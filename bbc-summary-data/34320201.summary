Bridge: Judicial review of decision that card game is not a sport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of funding body Sport England has defended its decision not to class the card game bridge as a sport, ahead of a judicial review into the ruling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Smith said Sport England's job was to "get the nation fitter".
The English Bridge Union says bridge is a "mind sport" and reclassifying it would increase opportunities to play.
The Royal Courts of Justice will not be asked to decide if bridge is a sport - only whether it was reasonable for Sport England to have ruled it was not.
Reclassifying it would have potential financial ramifications because bridge clubs would be eligible for grants from Sport England and the National Lottery.
The English Bridge Union (EBU) also says lack of recognition hinders its ability to take part in international competitions.
Granting permission for a judicial review in April, Judge Mr Justice Mostyn - who plays bridge - said: "You are doing more physical activity playing bridge, with all that dealing and playing, than in rifle shooting."
Lawyers representing the EBU say they will argue Sport England has acted unlawfully by "adopting a policy that prevents it recognising sports that it does not consider to be 'physical'".
What is a sport?
Along with well-known sporting activities like football, rugby and cricket, Sport England has some less obvious choices on its list, including:
The EBU says it has the definition of sport in the 2011 Charities Act on its side -  activities "which promote health involving physical or mental skill or exertion" - as well as the International Olympic Committee, which said in 1999 that bridge and chess should be considered "mind sports".
They are not currently part of the Olympic Games programme, but organisers of the 2020 summer Games in Tokyo have invited both chess and bridge to apply for inclusion, with the decision to be made next year.
Government body Sport England, taking its lead from the Council of Europe, defines a sport as an "activity aimed at improving physical fitness and well-being, forming social relations and gaining results in competition".
It has argued that bridge is no more of a sporting activity than "sitting at home, reading a book".
Phil Smith, director of Sport England, told BBC Radio 5 live the argument ultimately came down to money and his organisation must spend its "precious funding" on activities which improve physical health.
"It's Sport England's job to get the nation fitter," he said. "And although bridge is a fantastic pursuit, and we think it probably gives pleasure to a lot of people, it certainly isn't getting the nation any fitter."
Mr Smith said classifying bridge as a sport would also "open the door" to other pursuits like chess and Scrabble to "dilute" Sport England's budget.
But Heather Dhondy, a member of England's women's bridge team, said the card game "doesn't involve a great deal of physical activity", but players still had to be physically fit.
"We can be playing up to nine hours a day," she added.
Separately the EBU has also mounted a legal challenge to a decision by HM Revenue and Customs that bridge is not a sport and is not therefore exempt from VAT.
Bridge, or contract bridge, is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. It uses a standard 52-card deck and involves bets being made on the number of tricks each side will win.
