More than 100 jobs have been saved after a private equity firm acquired Arran Aromatics from administrators.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The luxury soap firm, which was founded on Arran in 1989, has six retail stores and generates sale of Â£6m per annum.
But it needed new investment and, in a deal put together in just a week, the company was put into administration and bought by the private equity firm Endless.
It is believed that 32 of the jobs to have been secured are based on Arran.
Endless has put the former head of Moulton Brown in charge of the business.
Arran Aromatics, which was set up by the Russell family 28 years ago, was recently rebranded "Arran, Sense of Scotland".
Andrew Russell, the son of the founders and brand director, said: "We are delighted to have received the investment from Endless, which has been delivered at a vital time for Arran.
"The investment in the brand over the past few years has positioned it well for growth across a wide range of geographies and this new investment will help us make this a reality.
"'Arran, Sense of Scotland' is poised to join the best-loved Scottish brands around the world and we are all very excited about the future."
Endless has previous experience of retail investments, in businesses including The Works stores, Bathstore and The West Cornwall Pasty Company.
Francesco Santinon, who led the investment for Endless, said: "We are delighted to be working with the Russell family to continue the progress of recent years of establishing Arran on a global stage and expect to be announcing more retail stores in the future.
"Due to the growing pains experienced over recent years, it became evident that Arran required further investment that has now been secured as has the future for its employees. Its manufacturing and retail operations will continue to operate as normal."
