[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eglwyswrw Primary School teacher banned for changing results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher who improved Pembrokeshire primary school pupils' test scores has been banned from teaching.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A disciplinary panel found Shan Harries' conduct at Eglwyswrw County Primary School was "unacceptable".
The 47-year-old changed Year 6 pupils' results for Welsh literacy. Schools inspector, Estyn, had set new targets for the subject and Ms Harries felt "under pressure" to meet them.
She has 28 days to appeal the decision.
Ms Harries can apply to be reinstated on the teaching register in two years.
Richard Parry Jones, the chairman of the Education Workforce Council, said Ms Harries had been deliberately dishonest.
"This was a very serious case in terms of its effect on learners and betrays confidence in the profession," he said.
During her fitness-to-practise hearing in Cardiff, the panel heard Estyn called for an improvement to the school's national test results in Welsh writing at key stage two, following an inspection in 2013.
A Pembrokeshire council investigation later found 11 test scores were subsequently altered and Ms Harries was suspended in June 2014, the panel heard.
She later admitted instructing a colleague to amend test results, but denied doing so dishonestly.
Esyllt Green, for Ms Harries, said the experienced head teacher, who had been in charge of about 100 pupils, had a good knowledge of those concerned and was, therefore, entitled to change the results.
But Cadi Dewi, representing the EWC, said Ms Harries had shown herself to be dishonest by initially denying she had instructed a colleague to make the changes.
The panel was told Ms Harries felt "under pressure" to hit the targets and changed grades, despite there being "no evidence" pupils had reached that level.
Ms Dewi said four members of staff recalled hearing Ms Harries express concern about the marks of some children.
Sandra Thomas, an administrator at the school, said Ms Harries told deputy head teacher Tim Davies she "didn't want the levels to be lower than the recommendations by Estyn".
