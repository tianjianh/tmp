An improvement notice is set to be served on the fire-hit Broadford Works site in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Firefighters were called out to a major blaze at the former textile mill last weekend. There have been several fires in recent years.
A site inspection will be carried out and the planning development management committee has agreed the way forward for pursuing the serving of notices.
Convener Ramsay Milne said: "We have concerns about health and safety."
He said there were also concerns about the "deterioration of the buildings on the site" and planning issues.
Mr Milne added: "We would like to see the site made as safe as possible."
There have been calls this week for owner Ian Suttie to progress development plans for the site more quickly, or even gift it to the city to allow development to go ahead.
Mr Suttie has been unavailable for comment.
