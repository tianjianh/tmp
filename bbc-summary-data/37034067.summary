A council has called on the makers of Pokemon Go to remove a stop on a popular island due to the number of real-life animals being disturbed.

North Tyneside Council said grey seals on St Mary's Island are becoming distressed by the number of visitors.
The island near Whitley Bay is currently a stop for players wanting to find characters called Seels.
Pokemon has been approached for comment.
A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said: "Our staff at the island are concerned that the number of people attracted by Pokemon were causing seals to haul back into the sea due to distress.
"This issue is something that we have been working with conservation groups to avoid and while we recognise that the current Pokemon Go phenomenon provided many people with a lot of pleasure and increased footfall to a number of venues, St Mary's Island is an area of natural beauty with significant wildlife.
"Our first priority must always be the safety and well-being of the seals on the island and, in this instance, we feel that other locations would be more appropriate for Pokestops."
