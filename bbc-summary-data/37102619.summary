The fall happened at the East Cliff side of West Bay, near Bridport, at about 19:40 BST.
Dorset Police initially said some people had suffered minor injuries but now said no-one is thought to have been be hurt.
No-one is believed to be trapped in the rubble, but a search is under way. A cordon is in place and the coast path is partially closed.
An infra-red helicopter search was carried out but due the warm temperature of the rocks it proved "inconclusive", a coastguard spokesman said.
Gem Gilbert, who photographed the landslip, said on Twitter: "Cute evening down the beach chilling, next thing you know part of the [cliff] had fallen down."
West Bay and Lyme Regis coastguard rescue teams, and the Lyme Regis RNLI inshore lifeboat are at the scene.
Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, and Devon and Somerset Urban Search and Rescue are also attending, the coastguard added.
Ch Insp Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: "Although at this stage it is not thought anyone has been trapped by the fall, I would appeal to the public that in the unlikely event that you are aware of someone who has not returned home from West Bay this evening, please report the details to the police urgently via 999.
"We would like to remind people that the cliffs remain unstable and it is possible further rock falls could occur.
"We urge the public to obey warning signs, not to stand near the edge of cliffs or stand directly underneath them.
"Landslides and rock falls can happen at any time and without warning."
The coast path is currently closed east of West Bay to Burton Bradstock.
A section of the cliff fell onto East Beach last month.
