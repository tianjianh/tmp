[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belgium's Hugo Broos is named as Cameroon's new coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameroon's Football Federation (Fecafoot) have appointed former Belgium international, Hugo Broos, as the Indomitable Lions' new head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Broos, 63, takes over from Volker Finke who was sacked in October.
Alexandre Belinga, the team's interim coach for the past three months, will remain as an assistant to the Belgian along with another former Belgian player, Sven Vandenbroeck.
Broos, who has coached extensively across Europe, was a surprise choice.
He was not on Fecafoot's shortlist of five, which included three Frenchmen, a Serbian and a Cameroonian.
Broos has vast experience as a manager, having won the Belgian Championship twice with Club Brugge and then again with Anderlecht. He has also enjoyed spells in Greece, Turkey and Algeria in recent years.
His first task with Cameroon will be to keep them top of their 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group M, when they face qualifiers - home and away - against South Africa next month.
He will also take charge of the Indomitable Lions when they take on France in a friendly in May.
