Police encourage public to submit 'dashcam' evidence

Reckless drivers in north Wales could be prosecuted through "dashcam" evidence sent in by the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Wales Police is encouraging members of the public to send in footage of poor driving.
Operation Snap has been launched in response to "ever-increasing submissions" of video and photographic evidence.
Officers said they "want to hear from people" after seeing some "very close passes".
Ch Insp Darren Wareing, from the force's roads policing unit, said: "If you have footage from a dash cam, your pedal cycle cam or any other source that you feel supports you as a witness to an alleged motoring offence, we want to hear from you.
"Over recent months we have received footage capturing motoring offences including careless and dangerous driving, people on mobile telephones and people being distracted whilst using their smart devices behind the wheel."
In north Wales, 252 motorists were issued with fines for careless driving between 2013 and 2015 for offences including reading maps at the wheel and lane hogging.
Police said cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders are also using cameras to record dangerous drivers.
Officers said they would review evidence submitted via an online form and take a decision on appropriate action.
Ch Insp Wareing added: "If people know there is a much bigger chance of being prosecuted and risk losing their licence then maybe, just maybe, they'll think twice about not making that call, not answering that text, not update their status or stick a 'like' to a dancing kitten whilst driving."
