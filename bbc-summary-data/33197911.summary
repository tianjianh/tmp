Pre-tournament outsiders Namibia defeated Mozambique 2-0 to win the southern African championship in South Africa.
The former national team midfielder will be replaced by ex-'Brave Warriors' goalkeeper Ronnie  Kanalelo, who has been assistant coach for two years.
"It's based on personal reasons and I don't wish to share them now," he said.
"We are shocked and extremely disappointed to inform the general football-loving public through you the media that coach Mannetti has relinquished his duties as Brave Warriors head coach with immediate effect," NFA secretary-general Barry Rukoro said.
"It's an open secret that Mannetti's contract was coming to an end after the Cosafa Cup and the association dully acted swiftly by offering him a new improved contract, which he declined."
Mannetti is the third coach to leave his side after the first round of qualifiers for the 2017 African Nations Cup after Young Chimodzi was axed by Malawi and Joao Chissano was sacked by Mozambique.
Namibia lost their qualification opener 1-0 in Niger.
Mannetti said he would continue to work with the national football  association, developing young footballers.
The first challenge for Kanalelo comes on Sunday when Namibia host Zambia  in a 2016 African Nations Championship qualifier for home-based stars.
