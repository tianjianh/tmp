[SN]TITLE[SN]
Theresa May Brexit speech: 12 key points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Here is Prime Minister Theresa May's summary of the 12 key points set out in her speech on plans for leaving the European Union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
1. Certainty: Whenever we can, we will provide it. And we can confirm today that the government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament.
2. Control of our own laws: We will bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain, because we will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control of our own laws.
3. Strengthen the union: We must strengthen the precious union between the four nations of the United Kingdom. We will work very carefully to ensure that - as powers are repatriated back to Britain - the right powers are returned to Westminster and the right powers are passed to the devolved administrations. We will make sure that no new barriers to living and doing business within our union are created.
4. Maintain the Common Travel Area with Ireland: We will work to deliver a practical solution that allows the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom's immigration system.
5. Control of immigration: The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. We will continue to attract the brightest and the best to work or study in Britain but there must be control.
6. Rights for EU nationals in Britain, and British nationals in the EU: We want to guarantee these rights as early as we can. We have told other EU leaders that we can offer EU nationals here this certainty, as long as this is reciprocated for British citizens in EU countries.
7. Protect workers' rights: As we translate the body of European law into our domestic regulations, we will ensure that workers' rights are fully protected and maintained.
8. Free trade with European markets: As a priority we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union. This agreement should allow for the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and EU member states. It cannot mean membership of the EU's single market. That would mean complying with European Court of Justice rulings, free movement and other EU rules and regulations without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are. And because we will no longer be members of the single market, we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the EU budget. If we contribute to some specific EU programmes that we wish to participate in, it will be for us to decide.
9. New trade agreements with other countries: It is time for Britain to become a global trading nation, striking trade agreements around the world. Through the Common Commercial Policy and the common external tariff, full Customs Union membership prevents us from doing this - but we do want to have a customs agreement with the EU and have an open mind on how we achieve this end.
10. The best place for science and innovation: We will continue to collaborate with our European partners on major science, research and technology initiatives.
11. Co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism: We want our future relationship with the EU to include practical arrangements on matters of law enforcement and intelligence.
12. A smooth, orderly Brexit: We want to have reached an agreement about our future partnership by the time the two year Article 50 process has concluded. From that point onwards, we expect a phased process of implementation. We will work to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge.
