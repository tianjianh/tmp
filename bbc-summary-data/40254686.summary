The position became vacant after Angus Robertson lost his seat in the general election.
Ian Blackford, Joanna Cherry, Tommy Sheppard and Drew Hendry have all confirmed their candidacy. They were all first elected in 2015.
The party said its new Westminster group leader would be announced on Wednesday evening.
The SNP won the general election in Scotland, despite losing 21 seats. They will start the new parliament with 35 MPs.
Mr Robertson lost his Moray constituency seat to the Conservatives' Douglas Ross after Thursday's vote.
