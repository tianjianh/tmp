West Yorkshire Police said the 28-year-old victim was seriously injured in the assault at around 21:35 BST on Friday in Alliance Street.
Four boys aged 14, 15 and two aged 16 have been arrested in the Armley and Bramley areas.
They were held on suspicion of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.
Police are treating the attack as racially motivated due to comments made at the time.
Ch Supt Paul Money of West Yorkshire Police met Polish Consul General, Lukasz Lutostanski, on Monday.
The force and consulate are raising awareness among the Polish community of how to report hate crimes and police patrols have been increased in the area.
Ch Supt Money said: "Given the understandable concern that this incident has caused among people in Leeds, particularly the local Polish community, and the wider focus there has been on it, we have prioritised the investigation to ensure that we are doing everything we can to bring our enquiries to a successful conclusion.
"I want to reiterate that hate crime and hate incidents are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in any form.
"The police work closely in partnership with the council and other agencies to tackle hate crime and we encourage anyone who has been a victim to report those incidents."
Police enquiries are continuing to trace further suspects.
