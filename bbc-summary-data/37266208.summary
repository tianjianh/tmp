The announcement came as a large crowd turned out to hear Mr Corbyn speak at a party leadership re-election rally in Ramsgate.
The Labour leader wants a regional investment bank, greater emphasis on renewable energy on the coast and improved broadband connectivity.
He said he wanted the funding to go to "the places that need it most".
Mr Corbyn and Owen Smith are going head-to-head in the Labour Party leadership contest, which will conclude on 24 September.
Before he addressed the crowd in Ramsgate, Mr Corbyn tweeted his pledge to invest in coastal towns.
On Friday, Mr Corbyn said: "I want to... focus on turning around the places that have been on the wrong side of the decisions made elsewhere" and "restore pride and prosperity to those places in so-called left-behind Britain".
The Labour leader said a £130m project in Cornwall to bring in superfast broadband had brought it one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the country.
He said the investment should be extended east into Kent "to unlock potential" in coastal towns.
Addressing the rally, he said: "We live in a deeply unequal society. We cannot afford this level of inequality."
About 3,000 people were present to hear the Labour leader speak.
His supporters tweeted their delight at the turnout in a predominantly Conservative area:
But local young Conservative Ruben Thorpe dismissed Mr Corbyn's chances of winning an election.
He said: "I like him. He will keep us in power because he stands no chance of winning."
Mr Smith's policies announced during the leadership campaign include an investment fund of £200bn - a "British New Deal" - to "rebuild Britain".
