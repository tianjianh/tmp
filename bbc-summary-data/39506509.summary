The 24-year-old came through the Saints academy and scored a hat-trick on his debut against Widnes in 2012.
Swift has scored 73 tries in 99 appearances for St Helens and is expected to make his 100th outing against Huddersfield on Friday.
"It's great to be playing for my hometown club and one I have watched since being a kid," he said.
"I want to continue to work hard and improve and I look forward to kicking on and hopefully achieving more silverware with the club."
