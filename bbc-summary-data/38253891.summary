Abu Dhabi police are travelling to the US state of Ohio to "participate in the investigation" into the death of an Emirati student who was shot by police.

Ohio officials say that 26-year-old Saif Nasser Mubarak Alameri was shot in the head after fighting with officers.
The Case Western University law student caused a car crash on the Ohio Turnpike then fled from police on Sunday, police officials say.
His body has been flown to Abu Dhabi, where he will be buried on Friday.
Jill Del Greco, a spokesperson for the Ohio Attorney General's office, said investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation will be meeting representatives from Abu Dhabi Police's Criminal Investigation Department.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a major American ally in the Middle East, and has assisted the US in its fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.
Emirati officials called the death a "painful incident" but did not elaborate on what role their investigators will have in the US.
Ohio officials have said that they will act as representatives of Alameri's family.
Police in Hudson, Ohio, say Alameri was speeding and driving erratically on Sunday when he clipped another car and flipped over.
He then allegedly fled into nearby woods, chased by officers for about a kilometre.
A struggle ensued and Alameri was shot once in the head, medical examiners say. It is unclear whether he was armed, but his death has been ruled a homicide.
The officer, who has not been named, has been put on leave.
Alameri's father, Nasser Alameri, told the Khaleej Times newspaper that his family is in a state of mourning but have been following the investigation through US media reports.
"There has been a lot of contradictions in the American media. While they call it a homicide, we read that the officer is on paid leave, which is ironic," said Mr Nasser.
Alameri, the eldest of six children, will be buried at a cemetery in Abu Dhabi after a funeral at a mosque following Friday prayers.
"We have deep trust in the government," Mr Alameri said, "and we know that they will not let the case go until we get a clear image of what had happened."
Saif Nasser Mubarak Alameri's name was trending on Twitter in his home country after news of his death.
The Case Western University Daily reports that he had planned to return to the UAE after graduation to open a law firm.
He recently hosted a Middle Eastern-themed dinner for university students and faculty.
This is the second high-profile incident involving an Emirati man in Ohio this year.
In October a grand jury chose not to indict a hotel desk clerk who falsely accused an Emirati guest of pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group.
The incident prompted the UAE's foreign ministry to warn its citizens to avoid wearing traditional Arabic garments when travelling abroad.
