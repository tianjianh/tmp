Green, 20, may be involved in Saturday's visit to Hamilton in the Scottish Premiership, subject to international clearance.
He made headlines as a 15-year-old, with Everton agreeing a fee with Bradford City that was reported to potentially rise to Â£2m.
Green has represented England at U16, 17 and 18 level.
After failing to break into the first team at Goodison Park, a move to Oldham followed in 2015 but he terminated that contract and dropped into non-league football before Burnley picked him up in January.
"It's a good feeling knowing I can play competitive football, I've been given a chance and I want to prove myself," he told the Kilmarnock website.
"The manager (Lee Clark) was a big selling point. I want to play as many games as I can and do well for the club."
