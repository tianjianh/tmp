The 24-year-old, who became Britain's first Olympic gymnastics champion at the 2016 Rio Games, will miss the iPro World Cup in London next month.
He will also miss April's European Championships in Romania.
"I know 100% that it's the right decision," said Whitlock, the pommel horse world champion.
"I want to continue to compete at the very highest level aiming towards the Tokyo Olympics in 2020," he added.
"But I'm very conscious that since suffering from glandular fever two years ago, I need to manage my body."
Whitlock won floor and pommel gold in Brazil, as well as all-around bronze alongside British team-mate Louis Smith, who is also unlikely to be part of the team heading to Romania.
The four-time Olympic medallist has been on a break while taking part in Channel 4's The Jump programme, where he has made next weekend's final.
Meanwhile, Olympic bronze medallists Amy Tinkler and Sam Oldham are among the British athletes who will take part in next month's World Cup of Gymnastics event in London on 8 April. They will be joined by Ellie Downie and Brinn Bevan.
