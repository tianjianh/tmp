It has spent five non-consecutive weeks at number one in the UK and in doing so became the first track to get two million streams in a week.
The track has also been number one in the US, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and Canada. You get the picture, people like the song.
The only place that seems immune to it is Russia where, as noted by Ronson himself, it peaked at number 198.
But why does everyone else love it so much?
During an appearance on Radio 1's Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, the producer got a pretty detailed explanation from Canadian self-labelled music genius Chilly Gonzales.
"It's a funk song which means there aren't a lot of chords. There are two in this song, they are D minor 7 and G7.
"There's a sneaky little third part that falls from a C to a B."
At this point Mark Ronson said: "I have no idea [what he's talking about] but it sounds so smart.
"I just hit the funk button on the computer keyboard. I'm dying to hear what he has to say."
Chilly continued: "You have the bass that rises, the middle part that falls and of course the top note that anchors it all together.
"This makes sense, this is a tight-ass nervous pop song.
"Secretly I believe that this build up, this break so to speak, [before the chorus] was influenced by techno music and what you might hear at a rave.
"And of course you usually hear some kind of siren.
"I would like to point out the masterful build up towards the song's money shot which is the phrase 'Don't believe me just watch'.
"The way that this build up is achieved is with live instruments with the stripped down funk band."
He then described the effect of a sequence "on the off beats in the build up to the phrase 'don't believe me just watch'" that helps to emphasise that line in the song.
Mark Ronson gives credit to Jeff Bhasker, who co-produced the record, for coming up with that section of the song.
Chilly concluded his analysis of the track by by saying: "We have a mix of the old, the new, the modern and the classic. And that's why I love Uptown Funk."
