The mother of missing toddler Ben Needham has said she would "tear up the whole island" of Kos as a police search ended without finding his body.

For 25 years Kerry Needham believed she would find her son alive and one day be reunited with him.
But that last flicker of hope seems to have vanished as police confirmed their belief he was killed accidentally by a digger when he went missing in 1991.
Mrs Needham told The Mirror: "I can't say goodbye until I know where he is."
From the moment he disappeared on the Greek holiday island, 43-year-old Mrs Needham maintained Ben was alive and had probably been abducted.
Speaking at the time of his disappearance, she said: "I've just got to keep that hope for Ben's sake, because we love him too much. I won't give up."

The search for her son took over Mrs Needham's life as she repeatedly appealed for help.
"He's got to be found. He didn't disappear off the face of the earth - he is out there somewhere," she said.
But last month, police told her to "prepare for the worst" and revealed that a friend of a digger driver, who was clearing land with an excavator on the day the toddler went missing, said the man may have been responsible for Ben's death.
In the years before the latest investigations, Mrs Needham said that "not even in my worst nightmares" did she believe Ben would be found dead near the same spot where he had vanished more than a quarter of a century ago.
It had certainly not entered her mind that her little boy may have been crushed to death by a digger.
"It's a long time to wait thinking you're going to find your son and then suddenly your world comes crashing down," said Ellie Martin, who co-runs the Help Find Ben Needham campaign group.
"For 25 years all she's thought about when she woke up in the morning is to find Ben."
The 21-month-old toddler, from Sheffield, was last seen playing outside a farmhouse in Iraklis - which his grandfather Ed was refurbishing - on the afternoon of 24 July 1991.
He was being looked after by his grandparents while his mother was out working.
When his grandmother realised she hadn't heard his voice as he played they began looking for him. Initially it was thought his uncle Stephen had taken him for a ride on his motorbike but it later transpired this was not the case and the family contacted the Greek police.
Ben's disappearance sparked one of the biggest and longest-running search operations ever seen in Europe.
This arid corner of Kos became the centre of a huge inquiry and international media attention.
In the weeks and months that followed, the family's anguish deepened as they travelled back and forth between the UK and Kos while Greek and British police followed various leads.
Hundreds of sightings of Ben were claimed with none of them amounting to anything but more pain for the family.
Pictures of what Ben may have looked like aged 12-14 years old were issued by police in 2003 and another computer-generated image was released in 2010 to illustrate how he may appear at 21.
DNA tests were carried out on two men who it was thought may have been Ben, but both were negative.
In December 2013, Mrs Needham accused then-Prime Minister David Cameron of not giving her case the same backing as he gave to the parents of Madeleine McCann, who went missing in 2007.
It came after a reports from eight witnesses who all saw a boy possibly matching Ben's description with the same Greek family.
Earlier this year, a South Yorkshire Police team returned to Kos to carry out house-to-house visits and chase new leads. They were given the tip that Ben may have been accidentally crushed by a digger while he was out playing.
The police officer in charge of the latest operation, Det Insp Jon Cousins, told a press conference: "My team and I know that machinery, including a large digger, was used to clear an area of land on 24 July 1991, behind the farmhouse that was being renovated by the Needhams.
"It is my professional belief that Ben Needham died as a result of an accident near to the farmhouse in Iraklis where he was last seen playing."
He revealed that an item found on Saturday, that it is thought Ben had with him when he went missing, had been shown to the Needham family.
"The recovery of this item, and its location, further adds to my belief that material was removed from the farmhouse on or shortly after the day that Ben disappeared," Det Insp Cousins said.
While there are still myriad unanswered questions for the Needham family, the latest find in that hot dry corner of Kos may mean they can finally begin to mourn for their lost son.
