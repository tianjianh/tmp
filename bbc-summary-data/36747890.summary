Andy Murray Wimbledon column: Raonic is tough but Lendl helps me be ruthless

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I'm proud of the fact I'm through to another Grand Slam final and have another opportunity to win the biggest title in tennis.

Someone said to me recently, "You've been in so many Slam finals but you've only won two" - but all I can do is keep trying to get myself in position to win again.
I'm not scared to fail. It's not like after losing a couple of those Grand Slam finals I thought, "I don't fancy this any more". It has been difficult to get over some tough losses but I've kept working hard, training hard, believing in myself and trying to improve. I've tried to get help from loads of different people and coaches.
After another tough loss at the French Open, I've given myself another opportunity, and I am proud of that, big time. Hopefully I'll get over the line on Sunday.
Experiencing the Wimbledon fortnight as a parent has been different because now I have a family to get home to.
For the first time ever, tennis is probably more of a distraction from my home life than the other way around.
Beforehand, in the build-up to a Slam final, I'd always just be thinking about that match. I don't feel like that just now - I'm just looking forward to the next time I see Sophia and Kim.
Sophia's already watched a bit of tennis with Kim at home over these last couple of weeks and maybe when she's older she'll want to come and see me play.
I would like that; it would be nice for me in a selfish way. I'm sure she won't be that interested but it gives me a little bit of extra motivation to keep going when I get a bit older.

This will be my first Grand Slam final without Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic on the other side of the net, but I don't think being the more experienced player will make much difference to my approach.
I just have to make sure I prepare as well as possible, and that's where my team play such an important part.
For Matt Little, my fitness trainer, it's about making sure I'm warmed up properly for practices and obviously the match, and that I don't pick up any niggles before the final.
My physio, Shane Annun, is responsible for helping my body recover as best as possible and keeping me loose.
Jamie Delgado and Ivan Lendl are responsible for the tennis side, so we'll speak a little about Friday's match and then the gameplan for Sunday.
Saturday will be a short practice but every little thing you can work on can make a difference. Then we'll talk again on Sunday before the match.
Their roles are clear but it can be easy to miss things at this stage, so it's just about everyone taking care of all the details.

There's no doubt Milos Raonic will be a very tough final opponent, after all he beat Roger Federer on Centre Court to get there.
Milos returns well and is good off the ground, but it's pretty obvious that he has one of the best serves out there, so my returning will be key.
I've always been a good returner since my junior days - I don't know why that was. I didn't practise it loads when I was at the academy in Spain, but when I got on the ATP Tour it's something I dedicated a lot of time to.
I remember the third match I ever played on the tour was against the American Taylor Dent at Queen's Club. He had a huge serve but I handled it well and won the match.
It's not just by chance that I'm good at returning. I've practised it a lot and still work on it all the time to make sure it's good.
However well I return, opportunities will probably be few and far between on Sunday and I need to be ruthless. That's something I speak to Ivan about it.
It's not as though none of my other coaches wanted me to do that, but it's something he's always made me aware of and been conscious of.
Taking my chances and not letting up on opponents is something I did well when we worked together in the past, and we've started pretty well this time around.
Let's hope I can finish the job on Sunday.
