Tigers have paid a transfer fee to buy May out of the final year of his contract, while Slater, 29, leaves Welford Road after seven years.
"Jonny is an out-and-out finisher with an outstanding try-scoring record," said Tigers head coach Matt O'Connor.
Leicester have also signed Valentino Mapapalangi and Chris Baumann.
Both have experience in New Zealand, with Tonga back-row Mapapalangi, 24, having played for Auckland, Waikato, Chiefs and Manawatu.
United States prop Baumann, 30, featured for Wellington Lions last year and played in the 2015 World Cup.
The arrival of May, who has 27 caps for England, will add to Tigers' wing options following the departures of Peter Betham and JP Pietersen.
George and Joe Ford, Jonah Holmes, Nick Malouf, Gareth Owen, Sione Kalamafoni and Dominic Ryan have also signed for Leicester ahead of the new season.
