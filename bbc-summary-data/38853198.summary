Ninth-placed Ards enjoy a 12-point lead over Carrick, who lie 11th and are favourites to occupy the relegation/promotion play-off spot.
"We are trying to play football and keep the ball on the ground," said Ards manager Colin Nixon.
"This is a huge game for both teams and we'll be working hard to try and get the right result," he added.
"We're working hard in training and when we get it right we look like a good team, but when we don't we implode a bit."
Carrick manager Aaron Callaghan was pleased with his side's performance in last week's 3-1 league defeat by Ballymena United, though disappointed with the result.
"We have brought in four or five players and it will take a few weeks for them to bed in and get the communication going better between them," said Callaghan.
