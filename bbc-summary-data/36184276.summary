The Bulgarian, seeking his first title in two years, lost 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-4) 6-0, having been a set and 5-2 up.
Dimitrov received a warning for his first racquet smash, early in the third set, then a point penalty for another.
That left him 5-0 down, before a third offence incurred a game penalty, which gave his Argentine opponent the match.
"I let my family down, I let my team down, I let my fans down with that kind of behaviour which I definitely apologise for," the world number 29 said.
After his third racquet smash, number two seed Dimitrov shook hands with umpire Mohamed Lahyani.
The 24-year-old's behaviour handed unseeded Schwartzman, 23, his first ATP Tour title.
