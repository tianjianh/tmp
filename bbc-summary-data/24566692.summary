The journey is seen as one of the five pillars of Islam, central to the faith.
Pilgrims spend five days praying both in Mecca and the surrounding desert.
In order to be closer to God, they wear simple clothes, aren't allowed to argue and perform rituals such as throwing stones at pillars to symbolise rejecting evil.
