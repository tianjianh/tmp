Peter Prendiville: Ex-Westminster election candidate admits making indecent images of children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former teacher who stood for the SDLP in the Westminster election of 1983 has pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Prendiville, from Craigdarragh Park in Holywood, County Down, used to teach maths at what is now called Belfast Metropolitan College.
The 60-year-old also stood as a Belfast City Council candidate for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).
Prendiville has been ordered to sign the sex offenders register.
Appearing before Downpatrick Crown Court in County Down, he admitted 14 counts of making indecent images of children on dates between February 2007 and July 2010.
However, he denied nine similar offences, including possession of 1,921 indecent images of children and a video of alleged child sexual abuse.
His lawyer told the court there were "ongoing discussions" between the prosecution and defence regarding the "proper charges and categorisation" of the images involved in some of the charges.
No facts of the case were opened during Tuesday's hearing, but the judge said that given the accused's guilty pleas to some of the charges, he must sign the police sex offenders register as a bail condition.
Prendiville was then released on continuing bail.
Prendiville represented the SDLP in the east Belfast constituency during the 1983 Westminster election, but failed to get elected. He resigned from the party last year.
