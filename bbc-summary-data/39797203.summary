Sultan Azlan Shah Cup: GB beaten by Australia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain suffered their first defeat in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup when they lost 2-1 to Australia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Kookaburras, ranked second in the world, took the lead in Malaysia through Trent Mitton before Mark Gleghorne levelled for GB.
A Matt Dawson penalty was enough to win it for Australia, who remain top of the six-team table.
GB are three points behind, but a win against New Zealand on Friday could put them into Sunday's final.
