The Osprey, 26, has undergone surgery on the foot he injured in Wales' final warm-up game with Italy in Cardiff.
Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny is also unlikely to play in the Six Nations after his knee injury in the same game.
"At this stage, Rhys is looking at a six to eight month period out of action," said Ospreys medical performance manager Chris Towers.
"Rhys sustained a significant foot ligament injury that required surgical stabilisation.
"He has had the surgery and will be non-weight bearing for six weeks and will then wear a protective boot for a further four to six weeks.
"Only after that will we be in a position to progress his rehab."
Webb left the field at the Millennium Stadium on a stretcher during the first half against Italy after his leg was caught in a ruck.
