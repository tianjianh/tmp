[SN]TITLE[SN]
South African schoolboy could spark 'hair revolution'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A South African schoolboy may force a change to school rules by claiming his constitutional right to choose his own hairstyle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seventeen-year-old Dylan Reynders spent his holidays studying the South African constitution and the country's Schools Act.
And on his return to school this month he decided to make a personal stand: He refused to cut his hair.
This triggered a national debate which has lasted for weeks.
According to the rules of Johannesburg's high-profile Bryanston High School, boys' hair may not touch the ears or collar or curl around their necks. Dylan's hair did.
When I asked him what drove him to defy the school rules, he told me: "I just thought enough is enough. Plus my hair wasn't that long."
I must confess when I saw Dylan's hair, I was surprised how short it was- still at least an inch above his collar.
When two other boys at school decided to support their friend, more followed. When I met Dylan, he told me: "They call me their Jesus."
Dylan was promptly suspended from the school and missed two of the first three weeks of term.
His mother Vanessa Roux supported him. She told me her son was facing up to a big challenge. "I was very proud of him. I raised both my boys to always question anything they didn't understand," she said.
The school governing body is obliged to implement the school's code of conduct and can suspend students who do not comply with the rules.
Chairman Aiden Hillebrand told me that he respected the student's courage in challenging the school but he had to comply with the rules as they are now.
He said: "This has sparked a debate about whether hair and uniform policy is still relevant at this day and age."
The provincial department of education attended some of the disciplinary hearings, after the student's mother lodged a complaint. It concluded that the school had acted correctly.
It has been suggested that it could be argued that it is unfair for girls to be allowed to have long hair, but not boys.
Phumla Sekhonyane from the provincial education department agreed that "there could be an argument for discrimination on the basis of gender...  but that's for the courts to decide".
The SA Democratic Teachers' Union's Nkosana Dolopi, told the local Times newspaper that a review of codes of conduct was necessary.
"We are not, however, saying that there should be lawlessness in schools. Children should be neat at all times and dressed accordingly," he added.
But he said it was also important that "policies should be sensitive to the fact that pupils can't be denied access to school".
Dylan is now back at school having been given the assurance that, over the next month, he will be able to contribute to a new policy on pupils' hair through the student council.
And he finally agreed to a haircut.
He told me his Moroccan barber did not appreciate the significance of the trim.
"I just sat down and I asked him to cut my hair as usual," he said "He had no idea what was going on."
If Bryanston High School takes the leap and changes its code of conduct to allow boys to keep longer hair, Dylan will have changed rules that have shaped generations.
But more importantly other schools might follow and, if so, he will have led a hair revolution.
