The book, which was part of her series of her hugely popular books The Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, was made into a film starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson in 2008.
Her publisher Harper Collins confirmed the news of her death.
"It is with huge sadness that we can confirm the death of our much loved author and friend, Louise Rennison."
She was in her sixties.
Rennison wrote the Georgia Nicolson series in a diary style about 14-year-old Georgia who lives with her annoying parents.
Louise based several episodes in the books on her own childhood in Leeds, where she was brought up in a three-bedroomed council house with her mum, dad, grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousin.
She also wrote a series of books on The Misadventures of Tallulah Casey.
Her physical book sales in the UK totalled 2.6 million copies, according to Nielsen Book Data figures.
Author Patrick Ness was among the people paying tribute.
"Shocked at the death of Louise Rennison.  Kids just laugh and laugh and laugh at her books, which is the best sort of miracle.  RIP," he tweeted.
Holly Smale author of Geek Girl also tweeted. "So, so sad to hear about Louise Rennison. Such a wonderful, talented and funny writer. Love to her family."
Fellow author Jenny Colgan also tweeted her sadness at the news:
Rennison started out as a performance artist after enrolling on a performing arts course in Brighton where she lived.
But after an audition in which Louise was asked to be an embryo, her tutor remarked: "You are obviously a very intelligent girl, Louise, but you must never go on stage again. Your performance made me feel physically sick."
However, she did continue with performing and her first one-woman autobiographical show, Stevie Wonder Felt My Face, won great acclaim and awards at the Edinburgh Festival in the 80s and a subsequent BBC 2 special was a TV hit.
Other of her own shows included Bob Marley's Gardener Sold My Friend and Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head.
She also worked for Radio 4, contributing to Woman's Hour and The John Peel Show and wrote for and with many well-known comedians.
