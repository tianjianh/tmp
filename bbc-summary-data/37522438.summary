The Rugby Football League will conduct an investigation into crowd trouble that followed Salford's Million Pound Game win against Hull KR on Saturday.

Salford won 19-18 in golden-point extra time to relegate Rovers at the Lightstream Stadium and secure their own Super League status for 2017.
"Games with so much at stake often mean emotions run high," RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said in a statement.
"That does not excuse the minority of fans who behaved unacceptably."
He added: "The RFL will conduct a full investigation into these incidents and will work with the police and club involved to ensure anyone found to have acted violently is dealt with appropriately and also banned with immediate effect."
Rovers are the first Super League team to be relegated since the introduction of the Super 8s format, which sees the top two divisions split into three after 23 regular season rounds.
Eight teams in the middle tier have points reset and play each other once for the right to feature in Super League, with three automatic places and the last place decided by the Million Pound Game between fourth and fifth.
Rovers full-back Ben Cockayne was critical of the process, which has replaced the old licensing system in the build-up and brought back relegation as a proposition for Super League clubs.
"Whilst relegation and promotion remains a part of our competition, and we believe it should, there are always going to be winners and losers," Wood said.
"It isn't a nice situation, but it is the reality of sport and it is our job at the RFL to now make sure that the club, staff and players concerned are fully supported as best they can be."
