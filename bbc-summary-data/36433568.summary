A former aide to Prime Minister David Cameron, Patrick Rock, has been given a two-year conditional discharge over indecent images of children.

The ex-deputy director of policy at Downing Street was convicted on Wednesday of five charges and acquitted of three similar counts.
The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining 12 charges.
Rock, 65, had admitted downloading 20 images of nine young girls in 2013, but denied they were indecent.
Although he will not serve time in prison, Judge Alistair McCreath said Rock's punishment was "the loss of your reputation and your very public humiliation".
"I have not lost sight of the obvious reality that right-thinking people will quite properly consider that those who did what you did should be punished for it.
"You should be. And you have been... It is a punishment which you brought on yourself, but is nonetheless a very real one. And it is one that is utterly merited."
The court heard that the youngest of the girls in the pictures was aged just 10 years and four months when he downloaded the image - meaning she would have been younger when it was taken.
