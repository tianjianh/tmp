A 250-year-old book donated to a Wrexham charity shop is to be returned to its original home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 1766 edition of the Book of Common Prayer was originally given to Worthenbury Church, Wrexham, on 6 October 1773 by the then Rector Philip Puleston, according to an inscription.
It has now been donated to the same shop that had an 1837 Welsh Bible handed in earlier this year.
The prayer book is to be given back to Worthenbury Church on Tuesday.
John Donnelly, of Nightingale Hospice shops, said: "We are used to all sorts of unusual items being donated to our shops, but this one really did take us aback.
"To hold something with so much history is absolutely fascinating so we set to work researching all we could glean from the contents."
