South Bristol link road: Plans submitted to councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Formal plans for the proposed south Bristol link road have been submitted to two local authorities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 3.1 mile (5km) road links the A370, near Long Ashton, to the Cater Road roundabout in Hartcliffe.
The plans have been drafted with Bristol City Council and North Somerset Council. People have until 21 August to comment on the proposals.
Campaigners opposing the road say it is a "poisoned chalice" and a "staggering" waste of public money.
They claim the cost of the road is £43.1m, which works out as more than £8,600 per metre.
A spokeswoman for the West of England partnership said the road was needed because of traffic congestion.
She said a lack of transport links in south Bristol discouraged investment by businesses and acted as a barrier to employers locating in the area.
The combined road and bus route also includes new cycle and pedestrian paths.
Bristol City and North Somerset Councils are contributing some £15m towards the cost of the road with other funding coming from the Department for Transport.
Paper of the plans copies can be inspected at City Hall, Bristol; Bishopsworth Library, Gatehouse Centre, the Town Hall, Weston-super-Mare; Castlewood, Clevedon, and Long Ashton library.
