An e-fit of a man wanted after a 95-year-old woman was the victim of a distraction burglary has been ridiculed on social media.

Northamptonshire Police issued the image of the man after the woman had her handbag stolen in Rothersthorpe.
"I know where he's hiding the handbag," wrote one person, while others said "his father was a platypus" and "looked like he was eating a banana sideways".
Police defended the picture and said it was "grabbing attention".
The e-fit, showing the beanie hat-wearing suspect with "the widest lips ever seen," was posted on the force's Facebook page on Wednesday and has attracted hundreds of shares and comments.

Although most responses have mocked the man's appearance, some people have questioned why police released an image more akin to the Joker from the fictional superhero Batman series.
"Poor old lady. What did the police give her to create that e-fit? A box of Mr Potato Head features," posted one.
Other comments sympathised with the victim, targeted in her Banbury Lane home at about 13:00 BST on Saturday.
As the man in the e-fit talked to her after trying to force his way in, another person got in through a side door and stole her handbag with money inside before fleeing in a large white car.
"Let's make this go viral so we can see these evils put away," someone commented, while another said, "totally awful what happened to this lady".
Some likened the suspect to "Zippy from Rainbow", while another said: "I hope they find him just to see what he really looks like!"
Northamptonshire Police said: "This was a despicable crime against a vulnerable, elderly lady and if the e-fit helps jog somebody's memory and this goes on to help catch the offender then it's done its job."
