[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil and Cambridge shared the spoils with a 1-1 draw at Huish Park in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A second-half goal from Francois Zoko put the Glovers ahead before Barry Corr grabbed a very late equaliser for the U's after coming off the bench.
Yeovil had the better of the first half and Bevis Mugabi twice went close early on, with one effort wide and then a swerving shot from distance that Will Norris did well to get his body behind.
Tom Eaves flashed a shot across the face of the goal and Zoko had one strike blocked before Norris got himself behind the second to keep it 0-0 at half-time.
The Glovers did eventually made the breakthrough deep into the second half, with a shot-cross from Alex Lawless on 78 minutes finding Zoko, who knocked it in from eight yards.
However, with time running out, substitute Corr popped up at the far post on 89 minutes to score his first goal in 14 months after injury.
