[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A vicar who believes socks are an "instrument of Satan" has been turned away from a bar for wearing sandals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Reverend Andrew Dotchin was told he could not go into The Wine Bar in Tacket Street, Ipswich, by a doorman due to health and safety fears.
The vicar of Whitton said he was "gutted" as "dog collars and sandals" are what vicars wear.
A Wine Bar spokesman said it was "unfortunate" but a man in sandals had previously cut his foot.
Mr Dotchin had been to a beer festival with friends on Easter Sunday when they then decided to go to the bar.
"We were stopped dead - sorry, we don't let sandals in here," said Mr Dotchin.
"It's the old health and safety rules - we serve in glass and the glass might break and hurt your toes."
The vicar said he always wears sandals in line with what the Bible says but joked the doorman might not have liked the sight of his feet.
"A few of my school friends were on the side of the bouncer," he said.
"The Bible says how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news - not these feet, no.
"Socks are an instrument of Satan - if you look at any pictures of stained glass windows, look at the toes - no-one in heaven is wearing socks.
"Jesus says only wear sandals in Mark ch 6 v 9. I am practising for heaven."
The Wine Bar spokesman said: "There is no hard and fast policy. On that evening it was fairly busy.
"It was on a bank holiday we had a gentleman wearing sandals who cut his foot.
"It was just unfortunate Mr Dotchin was at the bar on that particular evening."
