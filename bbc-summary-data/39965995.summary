Lorry gets wedged under Roman arch in Lincoln

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry became wedged under a Roman arch in Lincoln after trying to drive through it and getting stuck.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vehicle's tyres had to be deflated to free it from beneath the Grade I-listed Newport Arch.
City of Lincoln Council said it did not believe there was "any permanent structural damage". However, it said the arch had suffered "a small number of superficial scrapes".
The arch was built in AD200 and was a gate on the Roman London to York road.

It had to be repaired in 1964 after a lorry crash caused extensive damage.
Experts who helped restore it again in 2014 have been called in by the local authority "as a safety measure" to provide expert advice.
The transport firm involved has posted an apology online.
RASE Distribution said in a tweet that an investigation was under way.
