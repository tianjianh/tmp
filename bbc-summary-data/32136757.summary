Italy v England: How the England players rated in Turin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roy Hodgson's England remain unbeaten since their World Cup failure in Brazil after Andros Townsend cancelled out Graziano Pelle's headed opener in a 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tottenham striker Harry Kane was given his full international debut while captain Wayne Rooney remains two goals off equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's England goalscoring record.
Southampton striker Pelle headed Italy in front before the break, but Townsend's brilliant 25-yard strike rescued a draw for England.
How did England's players fare overall?
Made two good saves and had little chance with Graziano Pelle's goal.
Not a hugely distinguished night. Was caught out of position occasionally and England's narrow team line-up did not help him.
Steady but unspectacular. Missed a good second-half chance.
England's best defender - some anxious second-half moments but did well overall.
Some uncomfortable moments as Italy put England under pressure, then went off ill before half-time.
The Manchester United defender proved he will never be an England midfield player. So often he looks clumsy and uncomfortable at this level.
Part of an ineffective England midfield before he was substituted in the second half.
Anonymous and lots of the energy he did put in was wasted.
Very quiet night in a forward role with Harry Kane. Looked rusty and it is clear that if he is to play, he must play wide. Not used correctly.
Worked tirelessly throughout, although nowhere near his best. Hit the woodwork and forced a fine save from Gianluigi Buffon. Sir Bobby Charlton's England scoring record must wait for another day.
Found it much harder than his debut against Lithuania and was clattered within moments by Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. Not his fault as service was poor for so long, but still showed good instincts near goal.
So composed on the ball. Gave England direction as a midfield anchor.
Lack of defensive awareness occasionally exposed. Battle still on for England's right-back position.
Excellent cameo from Everton's youngster. Added real drive and threat - an exciting talent.
Great strike for England's equaliser and looked confident.
Quiet debut.
