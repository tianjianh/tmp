[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paris St-Germain 0-0 Lille

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain saw their 16-match winning run end in a 0-0 draw with struggling Lille but still remain unbeaten in Ligue 1 this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laurent Blanc's side failed to win for only the second time in 22 games.
Paris were without top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and rested a number of other players ahead of their midweek Champions League tie with Chelsea.
They lacked a cutting edge as Lille became the second team to avoid a league defeat in Paris this season.
