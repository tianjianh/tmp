Saints have strengthened their defensive options with Ally Gilchrist injured and Liam Gordon and Aaron Comrie on loan at Peterhead.
"I'm delighted to bring in a young defender for the rest of the season," manager Tommy Wright told the St Johnstone website.
"Clive has come highly recommended and will be a good addition to the squad."
Wright's men visit Partick Thistle on Wednesday evening.
