Cycling needs to be made safer in Wales' capital city, according to a new survey.

The Bike Life report for Cardiff showed eight in 10 people support improving cycling safety around the city.
The study was based on the Copenhagen Bicycle Account, which helped make Denmark's capital one of the world's most bike-friendly cities.
It was developed in partnership with transport charity Sustrans and covers seven UK cities.
The aim of the report was to "report on progress towards making cycling an attractive and everyday means of travel".
Jane Lorimer, the national director of Sustrans Cymru, said the response had been "overwhelmingly positive".
"Here in Cardiff - and Cardiff is one of seven cities included in the study - 78% of the population think Cardiff would be a better place if more people got around by bike," she told BBC Radio Wales.
"The other cities where this research was undertaken... broadly the results were similar but levels of cycling in Cardiff and levels of investment, the amount of money spent on cycle lanes, are less here."
Councillor Chris Weaver, assistant cabinet member for active travel and wellbeing, said: "Over the last ten years Cardiff's population has grown quicker than any UK city outside of London and this rate of expansion looks set to continue.
"The contents of this report and consultation we are currently running on our Active Travel Route maps will provide us with valuable information and feedback as we develop a comprehensive active travel network that will ensure the city has a sustainable transport network that is fit for the future of a forward looking European capital."
