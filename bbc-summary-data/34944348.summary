Ms Chapman triumphed over challenger Zara Kitson following a month-long ballot of the party's 9,000 members.
The party has both male and female co-conveners, with Ms Chapman sharing the leadership with Patrick Harvie.
The Aberdeen University rector quit her council seat in Edinburgh in the summer to concentrate on her bid to win a seat at Holyrood in 2016.
Ms Chapman said: "This has been a really exciting election, and I'm really pleased the Scottish Green Party has chosen my vision of a welcoming, socially just Scotland which works for good in the world.
"I congratulate Zara on her campaign, and look forward to working with her and the other candidates to deliver the best yet result for our party in the Holyrood election next year.
"Next year's election is a great opportunity for us to make a really big impact on Scottish politics and to give a voice to the movements that are changing and will change our country and our world."
Mr Harvie, who did not face a contest for the position of male co-convener, added: "I'd like to thank all those who stood for party positions. My congratulations to Maggie on winning the female co-convener contest and I look forward to both Zara and Maggie being elected as MSPs in May."
