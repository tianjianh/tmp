Surf Snowdonia reopens after fault fixed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new surf lagoon has reopened after engineers fixed a fault which closed the attraction for 10 days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lagoon at Surf Snowdonia at Dolgarrog in the Conwy Valley was filled with more than six million gallons (33,000 cubic metres) of water for its opening on 1 August.
But it had to be drained so engineers could fix a fault affecting the wave foil which creates the waves.
About 14,000 people visited the centre in its first two weeks.
