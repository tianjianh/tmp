Rail passengers 'stranded' after power cut near Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of rail passengers have been "left stranded" after a power cut on a main line in the west of England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
GWR said a power failure earlier had caused a signalling systems failure between Bath Spa and Bristol Temple Meads stations.
It has affected services between Swindon and Bristol Temple Meads and Westbury and Bristol Temple Meads.
A spokesman said the firm was "unable to source replacement road transport" and advised customers not to travel.
Several trains were cancelled, and one person reported on social media that "hundreds" of passengers had been "left stranded" in Bristol until Sunday.
Another passenger said they had been told by staff to go home because no replacement buses were available at Westbury.
Network Rail said engineers were working to repair damage to the railway's signalling system.
GWR said disruption was expected until the end of the day.
