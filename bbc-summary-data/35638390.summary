Oxford Westgate shopping centre: Lorry route approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concrete mixer lorries delivering to the site of a new shopping centre in Oxford have been given permission to take a shortcut through a village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxfordshire County Council made the decision on Monday to allow the vehicles to use the B4449 through Sutton.
Roadwork delays of up to 40 minutes have caused about Â£22,500 of concrete to be wasted, contractor Hanson said.
The route will now be used by up to 10 loaded mixing trucks daily.
Residents campaigned to stop the lorries passing through the village, claiming their homes were being "shaken" by the large vehicles using the narrow road.
The ready-mixed concrete company has also been criticised for using the route before permission had been given.
The authority said the agreement would be in place until the completion of the roadworks on the Cutteslowe and Wolvercote roundabouts, expected in November 2016.
County councillor for Eynsham, Charles Matthews, said it would be "to the considerable inconvenience of the local residents".
The shopping centre is scheduled to open in Autumn 2017.
