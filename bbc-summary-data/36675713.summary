Turkish profiles by Enis Senerdem, BBC Turkish
Gulsen, a 21-year-old ground services crew member, was shot dead inside the terminal building.
Her Facebook post from 21 June said: "I have never got into a war in my life, never. Not because I'm weak but because I chose so. My choice was resisting. Because I know that war is futile. There would be no winners in any war, only losers. I'm resisting against the injustices of the state. I'm only asking for the deserved welfare of the people. I resist against evil."
Umut was a customs officer who shot one of the attackers.
He tried to check if the gunman was alive or dead but was unable to escape when the attacker detonated his suicide vest.
There are numerous Facebook pages now in his memory. One of them is called "Umut Sakaroglu the hero".
People are sharing messages to say that his actions stopped the attacker and prevented an even more dire situation.
Yusuf was among nine ground services personnel killed during the attack.
He had finished his daily shift when the gunmen stormed the terminal building and was waiting for a shuttle bus outside in a parking area when he was shot dead.
He was due to be married 10 days later.
"First they told us Yusuf was seriously wounded. We lost him at the hospital. If he had stayed in the terminal building maybe he would have survived," the mother of Yusuf's fiancee told reporters.
Translator Ertan was accompanying a tourist group when the attack occurred.
He went to high school in Austria and had learned German. After his graduate studies, he started work as a translator.
He was married with a child and he and his wife were expecting their second baby in three months.
Ozgul, 21, started work at Ataturk airport as a ground services member just a couple of months ago.
She graduated from university last year.
Her friends mourned her with their Facebook posts and condemned the attack.
"4 years; we shared so many memories for 4 great years. Our sister Ozgul Ide has been killed yesterday in a cowardly attack. We are sorry for our loss," one of her old school friends wrote.
"My dearest friend, rest in peace. You left us too early. We will never forget you," another colleague wrote.
Muhammed, 25, started working with ground services at Ataturk airport only a month ago.
He shared a selfie taken with his brand new uniform on Facebook.
His family told reporters that Muhammed had decided to work to contribute to his two sisters' education. After a year unemployed, he had texted a friend in May, saying: "I got the job bro!"
His dream was to become a journalist.
Huseyin was a high school teacher in Istanbul. He was at the airport to greet a friend.
"He grew up without a father. I brought him up against all odds. We were picking breadcrumbs from streets. No mother should feel this pain," his mother said as she told his story at his funeral.
"My teacher Huseyin was killed in a cowardly attack. May you rest in peace, beautiful person," one of his pupils wrote on Twitter.
Caglayan, 27, was another ground services worker.
He described his passion for life and his country on his Twitter profile, saying: "The nation is always in my heart."
Merve, 22, had worked as a part-time cook for the past three years at the airport.
She was trying to pay for her university tuition.
She was rushed to hospital after being shot but died almost 24 hours after the attack.
"This time the pain is so different. No words for it. May you be in lights my beautiful friend. May you have the best place in heaven," one of her friends wrote on Twitter.
Goksel, 38 was a private security guard and was at the airport to greet his boss.
He was married and had two children.
Serkan, 24 was a physical education teacher who graduated last year.
He went to the airport with his neighbour to greet the neighbour's mother, Naciye Cinar.
"I've heard three explosions. Serkan noticed that something was wrong and got inside the terminal building to find me. The bomb exploded as soon as he got inside," she told reporters.
The gunman at the parking area killed three taxi drivers when he started to fire his weapon discriminately, including Mustafa.
Erol Eskisoy and Ali Zulfikar Yorulmaz also lost their lives.
