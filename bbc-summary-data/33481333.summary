Argyle's Under 18s team and their side in the South West Peninsula League will play their home games at the facility.
The club's youth team will also train there after a two-year deal was agreed.
"We are delighted to have finalised matters with Torquay United and both parties very much look forward to our joint venture," said Argyle chief executive Martyn Starnes.
Torquay have been looking for extra ways to increase their income after a takeover was completed by a consortium of local businessmen last month.
As part of cost-cutting measures, the Gulls closed their academy so had surplus space at Seale Hayne.
"In an ideal world, all our teams would train and play in and around Plymouth - the city they represent. That is our long-term ambition," Starnes added.
"Frustratingly, at the moment, this is not feasible; there is a dearth of facilities in and around Plymouth and we have experienced real problems trying to find training pitches to the standard our academy needs to help them develop our young players."
