McIlroy will use Taylor Made for all his equipment, including balls, as he attempts to displace Dustin Johnson as the world's leading player.
He had spent several months experimenting with different makes.
The 28-year-old is due to play in the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass, which starts on Thursday.
"I came to the conclusion that this was the best way forward for me to try and improve, try to win more, try to get back to world number one, try to win more majors," McIlroy said.
World number one Johnson, Masters champion Sergio Garcia and Olympic champion Justin Rose also use Taylor Made equipment.
