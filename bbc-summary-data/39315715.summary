Witham Leisure Centre in Essex was evacuated shortly before 11:30 GMT as firefighters made the area safe.
Assistant divisional officer Mark Huggins said "a small gas cloud was created" when centre staff making chlorine mixed the wrong chemicals.
Ambulance staff treated the people at the scene. Fire crews ventilated the building and made it safe by 13:30 GMT.
A Braintree District Council spokesman said a review had begun "to establish what happened and why".
Witham Leisure Centre is run by the charity Fusion Lifestyle.
