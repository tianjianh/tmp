Bale, 26, set up the winning goal as Wales edged past Northern Ireland in Saturday's last-16 tie in Paris.
Friday's quarter-final - only Wales' second at a major tournament - will be against Belgium or Hungary, who play on Sunday at 20:00 BST.
"Similar to qualifying, get one win and the confidence grows. We just want to ride the wave," said Bale.
"We know we've had difficult games but we've battled [against Northern Ireland], shown our team spirit and passion."

Hungary caused one of the biggest upsets of the tournament so far by finishing top of Group F, ahead of Austria and quarter-finalists Portugal.
They are six places higher than Wales in the world rankings in 20th place, though they would be seen as a kinder draw than a Belgian side second in the standings.
However, Wales are unbeaten in their past three meetings with Belgium and claimed a notable 1-0 victory against Marc Wilmots' side in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Cardiff in June last year.
"I can't choose. Hungary have been very good this tournament," said Bale.
"We've watched the whole tournament, we probably know a bit more about Belgium as they have been in our last two qualifying groups.
"Either game, no matter who we play, will be difficult.
"You don't get to the quarter-final of a major tournament with luck.
"You have to be a very good team to get there and we know, no matter who we play, it's going to be a difficult game, but we will be ready for it."
Wales were made to toil for their second-round win at Parc des Princes by an obdurate Northern Ireland team, who defended stubbornly and had most of the rare chances in a tight encounter.
There was an outpouring of joy and relief on the Welsh bench at the final whistle, and the players were joined by their children as they celebrated on the pitch.

Bale's three-year-old daughter Alba was one of the first to scamper on to the field, and she was embraced by her ecstatic father as he revelled in Wales' first win in the knockout stages of a major tournament.
"The feeling after was difficult to describe, very happy, very emotional," said Bale.
"To be able to share it with my daughter and my family was emotional for me.
"I haven't seen them for four or five weeks.
"An amazing experience that I will never forget. Our ambition is to keep fighting on and win every game we play."
