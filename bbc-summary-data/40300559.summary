Emergency services were alerted to the crash on Essich Road in Inverness at about 17:30 on Thursday.
The 37-year-old cyclist was taken to the city's Raigmore Hospital by air ambulance.
Insp Gus Stewart asked any potential witnesses to get in touch with the police, if they have not already spoken to an officer.
The road was closed for five hours to allow for a police investigation but has since reopened.
