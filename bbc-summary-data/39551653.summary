The wizarding saga was named best new play at the ceremony at London's Royal Albert Hall.
Based on an original story by JK Rowling, Thorne and director John Tiffany, the two-parter presents Harry, Ron and Hermione in their mid-30s as their own children head off to Hogwarts school.
Best actor winner Jamie Parker, who plays the grown-up Harry, thanked the show's "resolutely enchantable audience".
Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione Grainger, won best supporting actress.
The best supporting actor prize went to Anthony Boyle for role of Scorpius Malfoy.
Winning nine of its 11 nominations, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child beats Matilda the Musical and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - both of which had seven wins each - to become the biggest winning production in Oliviers history.
Two shows composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber also scooped awards.
School of Rock the Musical won outstanding achievement in music for the three children's bands who play their instruments live every night at New London Theatre.
