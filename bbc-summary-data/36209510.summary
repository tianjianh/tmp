Amir Khan has admitted he lacks the power to hurt Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in their WBC middleweight title fight in Las Vegas on Saturday.

However, Britain's Khan said his speed and movement would win the day.
Britain's Khan, 29, is jumping two weight classes to challenge Mexico's Alvarez, although the match has been made at a catch-weight of 155lb.
"I'm going to hit Canelo and he's probably not going to feel it, but skill is going to win it," said Khan.
"I don't want to be involved in exchanges, standing in front of him giving him free shots. I know he can hurt me with one big shot.
"So I have to make sure I'm balanced when I'm throwing my own shots. It's all about being disciplined and sticking to the game-plan for 12 rounds.
"Before, I've not respected guys who have knocked me down or out. This fight I know I can be hurt so I'll be on the edge and my defences will be sharper.
"A fight against Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao would have been easier because they're my weight, so physically I would have been stronger.
"Canelo is going to be stronger, but things I have that are better than him are speed and movement."
Khan is a heavy underdog against his 25-year-old opponent, whose only defeat was by American legend Mayweather in 2013.
Bolton boxer Khan is a former light-welterweight world champion but has lost three times, twice by knockout.
"I'm not supposed to win this fight but believe I can," said Khan, who is bidding to become only the third former light-welterweight world champion to win a middleweight world title, after Oscar de la Hoya and Miguel Cotto.
"It's the first time I've been the underdog for a fight. But that's what makes it so exciting for me, wanting to prove so many people wrong.
"This is the same kind of fight as when Sugar Ray Leonard beat Marvin Hagler [Leonard moved up from welter to middleweight to challenge Hagler in 1987]. Leonard was the underdog for that fight but won through speed over power."
Alvarez could be as heavy as 175lb on fight night, almost a stone heavier than the challenger. But the Mexican, who turned pro at the age of 15, believes Khan will be surprised by his own skills.
"I'll show a lot more than power, you'll see," said Alvarez, who is hoping to mark the Mexican celebration of Cinco de Mayo with his 47th win in his 49th fight.
"I bring speed as well. Whatever he brings, I'm prepared for. My best years are yet to come."
Khan also had a message for United States presidential hopeful Donald Trump, who has made controversial remarks about Muslims and Mexicans during his campaign for the Republican candidacy.
"This could be the last fight for me and Canelo if Donald Trump becomes president," said Khan, whose match with Alvarez will be the first at Vegas's 20,000-capacity T-Mobile Arena.
