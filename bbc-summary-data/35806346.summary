Udinese sack Stefano Colantuono and hire Luigi de Canio

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Udinese have sacked manager Stefano Colantuono nine games from the end of the season and replaced him with ex-QPR boss Luigi de Canio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club are 15th in Serie A, four points above the relegation zone after securing only one win from their last 11 games.
Colantuono, 53, was only appointed last June on a two-year contract.
De Canio, who signs a contract until the end of the season, previously managed Udinese from 1999 to 2001.
Their next match is away to seventh-placed Sassuolo on 20 March.
