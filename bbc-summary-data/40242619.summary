SWPL: Stirling University score late on to beat Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stirling University beat Hamilton Academical 3-2 to give the departing Rachel Donaldson the perfect send-off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donaldson played her last game for Stirling after 14 years before taking up a scholarship in the USA.
It was her cross that picked out Ashley McDonald to equalise after Lori Gardner had given Accies an early lead.
Jade Gallon's penalty made it 2-1, but Gardner equalised with three minutes left only for Beth McKay to find a winner within 60 seconds.
That result moves Stirling to within a point of third-placed Celtic on the day when the other six sides in the Scottish Women's Premier League were all inactive.
Hamilton though have now lost six on the bounce and sit just one point above bottom side Aberdeen.
In SWPL 2, Motherwell fought back from behind to beat Edinburgh University Hutchison Vale at Ravenscraig.
However, they still remain nine points behind pace-setters Forfar Farmington who beat Buchan 4-0.
Glasgow Girls are also level on points with Motherwell following a 2-0 win away to Jeanfield Swifts.
And Hearts remain in the promotion chase, albeit 11 points off top spot, following a 6-0 thumping of East Fife.
