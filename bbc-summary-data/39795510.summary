The family statement said Yusuf was "loved by his teachers" at Hillcrest Academy nursery and was "happy there".
It added: "Yusuf enjoyed travelling and we visited London and Scotland with him."
Det Sgt Mathew Tunney said the force continued to appeal for witnesses.
"We are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a black or dark-coloured Vauxhall Meriva that was stopped at a red traffic light as we believe he would have had a good view of the incident", he said.
