The 33-year-old Scot, who retired from racing in November, launched Dare To Be Different on Thursday.
The former Williams test driver aims to promote women in motorsport as well as branching out into other areas of life.

Wolff said the scheme will use the success of women in the sport now to inspire the next generation, not just in F1 but at many different levels.
"All the women who are doing successful roles within the sport will be showcased as role models," she said.
