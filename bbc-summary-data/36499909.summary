[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A serial rapist who abused three women in "the most vile and disgusting fashion" has been jailed for 12 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerard Porteous, 56, denied a string of offences against the women between 1994 and 2013 in Airdrie and Paisley.
Following a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, a jury unanimously found him guilty of four charges of rape.
He was also convicted of assault with intent to rape and further charges of indecent assault, assault and behaviour causing fear and alarm.
After being convicted, judge Michael O'Grady QC told Porteous: "You have been convicted of an appalling course of conduct towards three self-evidently decent women.
"You have used and abused and degraded them in the most vile and disgusting fashion."
When Porteous appeared for sentencing at the same court on Friday, judge O'Grady told him: "You have been convicted of an appalling catalogue of abuse against three women over a period of almost two decades.
"You are a deeply dangerous individual and that requires me to afford what protection I can to the public."
The judge ordered that Porteous should be kept under supervision for a further four years.
The rapist was also placed on the sex offenders register.
The court previously heard that Porteous raped and assaulted his first victim in 1994.
During attacks she was punched on the body, grabbed by the arms, head butted and kicked on the legs.
He raped a second woman in 2012 at a flat in his home town of Paisley.
He targeted a third woman in November 2013 and twice assaulted her with intent to rape her.
