Sophia Cahill, of Torfaen, said Mr Bowers had hit her in the face, pulled her hair and squeezed her throat.
District Judge Andrew Sweet told the former Another Level star he was "satisfied that he assaulted her in the manner she described".
Bowers, who will be sentenced next month, told Croydon Magistrates' Court he was acting in self-defence.
He accepted he made contact with her during a scuffle at his parents' home, but said it was accidental, the court heard.
Judge Sweet said he had not ruled out the possibility of a prison sentence and adjourned the case for sentencing until 15 October.
