Jagger and Richards had their first proper meeting on platform two of Dartford station on 17 October 1961.
They bonded over a love of the blues and formed a musical friendship that would lead to the foundation of The Rolling Stones in 1962.
The heritage plaque was unveiled at the station on Thursday.
"We've held a low key event today because Dartford is a working railway station and platform two is a modest space considering the station's enormous role in pop music history," Dartford Borough Council leader Jeremy Kite said.
"I hope that in the years ahead many thousands of rail passengers will enjoy looking at the plaque and realising what a huge part the station played in bringing The Rolling Stones together."
When they met, Richards was on his way to Sidcup Art College, carrying a hollow-bodied HÃ¶fner cutaway electric guitar, while Jagger was travelling to the London School of Economics with some of his prized blues records.
The teenagers recognised each other as they had both gone to Wentworth Primary School in the town, with Jagger then going on to study at Dartford Grammar.
The Rolling Stones formed in 1962, and went on to become one of the most successful, influential and enduring rock 'n' roll bands in the history of music.
