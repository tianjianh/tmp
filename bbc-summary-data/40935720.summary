Derby County have signed Wales international winger Tom Lawrence from Leicester City for an initial fee believed to be £5m.

The 23-year-old's deal is described as "long-term" by the Rams and BBC Radio Derby Sport reports that the fee could rise to £7m.
Lawrence, who has six Wales caps, did not start a league game for Leicester.
But he had spells on loan with Rotherham, Blackburn, Cardiff and Ipswich while with the Foxes.
He scored 11 goals in 36 games for Ipswich last season.
Derby manager Gary Rowett had earlier predicted a "hectic" end to the transfer window as he looks to create a "different feel" to his squad.
The Rams have started the new season with one point from their opening two Championship games.
And Rowett said he had not completed as much transfer business as he would have liked over the summer.
"We're moving as quickly as we can. We want to reinvigorate and get a different feel in the squad," he told BBC Radio Derby.
"People would say things still feel very similar and that's because we haven't been able to do as much work in the transfer market as we'd have liked."
Lawrence becomes Derby's fourth summer signing, following the arrival of defenders Andre Wisdom and Curtis Davies and midfielder Tom Huddlestone. Five players have also left the club.
"I still believe there will be a hectic last spell to this window," Rowett added. "It has been frustrating but it's not an easy market.
"I don't want to be saying the same things in two months that people have been saying for two or three years - we want to try to change things and to look different."
