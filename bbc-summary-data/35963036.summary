Denis Donaldson: Appeal for gardaí to assist inquiry on 10th anniversary of informer's murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in the Republic of Ireland have been asked to co-operate with a watchdog's inquiry into the exposure of a senior republican as an informer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denis Donaldson led a secret life as an agent for MI5 and the police.
The former Sinn Féin man was shot dead in a remote cottage in County Donegal in 2006 shortly after his exposure.
His family have called on the Garda Síochána to assist the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's investigation on the 10th anniversary of his murder.
In a statement, they said they were making the call for a "final time".
They have accused the gardaí of not properly investigating Mr Donaldson's murder and claim officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland may have contributed to his killing.
"Today marks ten years since Denis was murdered," the family said.
"No-one has yet been held to account for either his exposure as an agent or his subsequent murder.
"An inquest has still not even been held, yet it has been adjourned on 18 occasions by the coroner upon the application of An Garda Siochana."
The Real IRA said they were responsible for Mr Donaldson's murder.
The family said they wanted the gardaí to give investigators "unfettered access" to Mr Donaldson's private journal that he was writing shortly before he was killed.
The Police Ombudsman has been refused access to the journal in spite of repeated requests.
The family added that they were appealing to "all relevant state agencies... to finally remove any further obstructions to the truth, and sincerely acknowledge the terrible damage they caused, or continue to cause, to the family by their actions and omissions".
"The onus is with them to remedy these wrongs," they said.
