A Flintshire council worker filmed a female colleague taking showers for more than two years at the county's HQ, a court has heard.

Computer specialist Kelvin Wynn, 39, would turn up to work early at the county hall in Mold to secretly film the woman.
But he was caught when his victim spotted a phone under a cubicle door.
Wynn, from Connah's Quay, admitted voyeurism and was given a three-year community order by magistrates.
Rhian Jackson, prosecuting, said the filming exploits came to light in July when the woman victim - who was in her 40s - was naked in a shower at the Flintshire HQ and saw the mobile phone being used.
"She was in shock and could not believe her eyes," Mrs Jackson explained at Flintshire Magistrates' Court.
The woman alerted managers, and even flagged it up to Wynn, who was regarded as a trusted work colleague.
An investigation pinpointed Wynn's movements on the morning and showed him heading towards the shower facilities in the building.
His phone and computer were seized, and 18 films of his victims were found.
It emerged that Wynn had filmed her showering and undressing, as well as films of her in the offices.
Stephen Edwards, defending, said Wynn was so ashamed of his actions that he had attempted to take his own life, and had moved out of the Mold area where he had lived.
He has also lost his job at the council.
He said it was a "foolish and strange" decision to film her.
In addition to a three year community rehabilitation order, Wynn must also register as a sex offender for five years, and was also made subject of a restraining order not to approach his victim in the future.
