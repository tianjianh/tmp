Nine members of the gang were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court.
This followed the sentencing of six men, including Nosakhere Stephenson - described by police as the mastermind - yesterday.
The ring was uncovered by a surveillance operation carried out by West Midlands Police in 2014.
Eight guns, including a pump action shotgun and a Mach 10 Machine pistol, were recovered from premises in Great Barr and Handsworth - with one taken from a car in Hockley as it was being handed over to a buyer.
Another three men - Darren Mentore, 34, of no fixed address; Clinton Officer, 32, of Wallflower Street, Shepherds Bush, London; and Jamal Shaka Smith, 34, of Ladywood Middleway, Birmingham - await sentencing in January.
Joynal Abdin, 26, of Hanover Close, Aston, Birmingham was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to 7 years 3 months in prison.
Mohammed Fedar, 27, of Westfield Road, Smethwick: 4 years 4 months
Amar Ghalib, 32, of Davey Road, Perry Barr, Birmingham: 4 years 11 months

Ch Insp Simon Wallis, from West Midlands Police's serious and organised crime unit, said the convictions were a "fantastic" result for a lengthy operation.
"We've put some prolific criminals behind bars who have been responsible for bringing dangerous weapons to our city," he said.
"It is no exaggeration to say each and every gun or bullet that we've seized represents a life potentially saved."
