Exeter City to win 4-1 - a sure-fire way to beat the bookmakers?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"You will never beat the bookies" - a phrase every person who likes a flutter knows, but often chooses to ignore.

However, one Exeter City supporter may have found a sure-fire way of getting one back for the punters.
Roger Hamilton-Kendall, a lifelong fan of the Grecians, has been putting £10 on his club to win 4-1 in every game they have played since April 2008 - and his side's 4-1 victory at Barnet on Saturday was the sixth time he has been able to cash in.
Over the last eight years he believes he is around £600 up and said the whole ritual of his bet came from a premonition he had against the League Two club's local rivals in 2008 - his first pay day.
"I had a bit of a dream that we'd beat Torquay 4-1 in the first leg of the Conference play-off semi-final, so for a laugh I went and put a tenner on us to beat Torquay at home, but we lost 2-1," he told BBC Sport.
"I thought 'typical' and forgot about it when we were playing the second leg until I was walking up to the ground in Torquay and I saw a bookmaker, had a couple of quid in my pocket and thought 'go for it', and the rest is history."
Hamilton-Kendall has had wins at various prices from 33-1 up to 100-1, the odds he got when Exeter came away with three points at the Hive at the weekend - a tidy profit of £1,000.
But he said he has been close to a couple of more lucrative wins.
"I was given 500-1 for us to win away at Charlton and we were 3-1 up with about 10 minutes to go and Jamie Cureton put one over the bar for £5,000," he added after recalling a game at The Valley in February 2011.
"There was also an occasion where I thought I'd won it when we were 4-1 up at home to Sheffield Wednesday and we went and scored a fifth goal in the 93rd minute, but it's a lottery really and just a bit of fun.
"But I do it every game because the one time you don't do it, it'll come in."
Having had three 4-1 wins in 2008, before a five-year wait for their next, Exeter have recorded two 4-1 victories so far this year.
But with the Devon side hosting Cambridge on Saturday, having only picked up one point at St James Park all season, the odds of the same scoreline at 55-1 may not seem all that tempting.
