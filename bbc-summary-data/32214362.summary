Tipu Sultan was found with a gunshot wound at the back of the Herbs n Spice Kitchen in Lake Avenue, South Shields, on Tuesday night.
The 32-year-old father of two received treatment but was pronounced dead at the scene.
Northumbria Police has started a murder inquiry and believe two men on a motorbike were involved.
They said witnesses had reported seeing two men wearing crash helmets and dressed in dark clothing on a motorbike drive into the rear lane in Lake Avenue just before the shooting, shortly before 22:00 BST.
They were seen driving away from the area in the direction of Lizard Lane immediately afterwards.
Northumbria Police South Tyneside Supt Sav Patsalos said their investigation was in its early stages.
"We are trying to establish the motive behind the incident and a full murder investigation is currently being carried out," he said.
"We believe that this has been an isolated incident and not a random shooting, enquiries are ongoing to establish this.
"Those responsible may have planned the incident in advance of carrying it out and if anyone has seen anything or anyone suspicious in the area at any time in the past few days, then I'd ask them to come forward and speak to us."
He said there was nothing to suggest there was any risk to anyone else but there were extra officers in the area.
He appealed for anyone who saw the motorbike in the area or with information to contact them and said they would be speaking to other takeaway and restaurant owners.
A cordon has been set up around the scene.
Victoria Chisholm, from the nearby Lake Pub, said: "I saw a commotion out on the street, one of the lads from the curry house was outside.
"I just thought it was a wind-up, stuff like that doesn't happen round here. It shouldn't happen."
Speaking about the victim, she added: "He was an absolutely wonderful bloke, everybody round here loved him. He was a proper part of the community.
"He was just a wonderful bloke, I'm completely shocked.
"It's a nightmare for his family as well."
