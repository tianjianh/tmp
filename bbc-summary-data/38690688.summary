Motherwell have made an approach to sign Michael O'Halloran from Premiership rivals Rangers on loan until the end of the season.

Well boss Mark McGhee said he would like to bring the winger to Fir Park and that the club are awaiting a response from Rangers.
"He's another player that we are definitely interested in," McGhee said.
Rangers host Motherwell at Ibrox in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup on Saturday.
Rangers signed O'Halloran from St Johnstone for an undisclosed fee last February.
The 26-year-old was given a four-and-a-half year contract at Ibrox after spending two years with the Perth club.
Confirming Motherwell's interest in bringing O'Halloran to Fir Park, McGhee added: "But we have had no definitive answer that either he's available or he would definitely be coming here."
