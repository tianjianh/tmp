[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League Two ins and out - January 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Fife probably managed the cleverest piece of January business in Scottish League Two - selling top scorer Nathan Austin to Falkirk but keeping him for the rest of the campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old English striker was linked with a number of higher-league clubs after finding the net 18 times in 28 appearances this term.
But it was the Bairns who secured his signature for an undisclosed fee and immediately loaned him back to the Methil club.
With the Fifers sitting two points behind leaders Elgin City having played a game more, the loss of the league's joint top scorer with the Black and Whites' Craig Gunn would have been a significant blow to Gary Naysmith's side.
With a regular goalscorer seemingly making the difference between success and failure in Scotland's fourth tier, fourth-placed Annan Athletic might have pulled a rabbit out of the hat on transfer deadline day with the capture of Lewis Guy after the 30-year-old's release from National League North club Chorley.
Guy, who began his career with Newcastle United, will be remembered for a spell in Scotland's top flight with St Mirren.
Barry Ferguson will be hoping that he has found the solution to fifth-top Clyde's lack of goals - and faltering promotion challenge - in the shape of much-travelled 31-year-old John Gemmell, who arrives from Albion Rovers.
Third-placed Queen's Park have recruited Kenneth MacKay, a striker who had yet to play this season for Annan.
