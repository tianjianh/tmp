It will replace the temporary portable building which has been operating as an exhibition centre and shop.
A spokesman for the trustees said they wanted to encourage visitors to find out more about Isambard Kingdom Brunel who designed the bridge.
It is hoped the centre will be open by December 2014 - the 150th anniversary of the opening of the bridge.
"The existing temporary facility has welcomed an average of 57,000 visitors annually - including tourists from more than 100 countries - but we are keen to encourage more of the people who come to look at the bridge to visit the centre as well," said the spokesman.
Trustees have been given Â£36,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help them progress their plans to apply for a full grant later this year.
