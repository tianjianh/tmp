The men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to steal motor vehicles.

The vehicles stolen include Land Rover Discoveries, Evoques and Defenders, which all had keyless ignition systems, police said.
Det Supt Zoe Russo, from Lancashire Police, said they had "spent months following numerous lines of enquiry".
She warned: "Where possible, park your vehicle in a garage overnight and look at using visible deterrents such as steering wheel and pedal locks, as well as other security measures including disk locks and clutch claws."
