Dr Hugo van Woerden said he recognised that responsible drinking was "a normal part of a healthy society".
But he has raised concerns about levels of alcohol abuse and children's exposure to it.
He said in the health board's area 9.4% of men and 7.2% of women were classed as problem drinkers.
His report mentions "children as young as three can recognise the smell associated with alcoholic drinks".
Dr van Woerden also said there had been a rise in alcohol intake by women aged 16-24.
His full report will be presented to the health board next month.
Ahead of the meeting, he said: "We still have a major problem across NHS Highland in that 40% of the population regularly drink more than the recommended limit."
He added: "Over the five-year period 2009 to 2013, there were on average 80 deaths per year from alcohol-related conditions amongst the population of NHS Highland."
Alcohol abuse has been a long running concern for bosses at NHS Highland, which covers the Highlands and parts of Argyll.
A previous director of public health who moved from England to take up the post told of her shock at the scale of the region's alcohol problems.
At the time in 2011, the health board estimated that it was costing it Â£15m a year to treat illness caused by drink, smoking and obesity.
