The high court in the Indian city of Mumbai has suspended Bollywood star Salman Khan's sentence for a 2002 hit-and-run conviction, pending his appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Khan was convicted on Wednesday by a lower court of culpable homicide.
The court sentenced the actor to five years in prison for killing Noor Ullah Khan by driving over him as he slept on a pavement. Four others were injured.
Khan argued his driver was behind the wheel, but the judge said the actor was driving under the influence of alcohol.
