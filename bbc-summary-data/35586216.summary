Firefighters were called to Bembridge Airport on the east of the island at about 11:30 GMT after reports of an aircraft in distress.
Witnesses reported seeing the single-engine aircraft upside down on the airfield but said the occupants appeared to have got out unhurt.
Stephen Davis said he was passing the airport and noticed the plane on its back close to the runway.
He said: "I stopped to have a look in the car park and there were police, ambulance and fire engines just arriving as we parked up.
"There doesn't appear to be anybody hurt. It looks like there could have been two passengers on board and they walked away from the aircraft."
He said two people could be seen talking to emergency crews.
Isle of Wight NHS said one ambulance attended but, although the occupants were in shock, they did not require hospital treatment.
Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue said there were three casualties but described them as "walking wounded".
A spokeswoman said there was no fuel spillage. Crews made the aircraft safe and left it in the hands of the airport.
Bembridge Airport is an unlicensed airfield managed by the Vectis Gliding Club, meaning it is not open to commercial or training flights and visiting pilots require prior permission to land there.
