"Our Greatest Team Parade" will take place in London on Monday 10 September, the day after the Paralympics finishes.
The procession will leave London's Mansion House at 13:30 BST and will travel past Trafalgar Square, through Admiralty Arch and into The Mall.
A similar parade took place four years ago after the Beijing Games.
Spectators can turn up on the day to watch the first part of the parade up to Trafalgar Square, although they have been warned to arrive as early as possible because viewing areas will be closed when they are full.
The area from Admiralty Arch to the Queen Victoria Memorial will be ticketed and reserved.
Places there will go to groups who have made a crucial contribution to the running of the Games and the success of the British athletes.
This will include 14,000 volunteers, police, fire and ambulance staff, military personnel, coaches, support staff, friends and family of the athletes and schoolchildren from every London borough.
Once the parade leaves Mansion House, it will travel along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street and pass St Paul's Cathedral.
It then moves down Fleet Street, past Aldwych and into The Strand before reaching Trafalgar Square, where there will be a big screen at the bottom of Nelson's Column showing proceedings with live commentary.
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: "This is a chance to celebrate the heroes and heroines who have thrilled us with their skills, sportsmanship, and grace during London's spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games, and whose names and triumphs will live on for centuries to come."
Andy Hunt, chief executive of the British Olympic Association, said: "The parade provides a fantastic opportunity for the nation to recognise and celebrate the special achievements of the outstanding group of athletes.
"Importantly, it also gives the members of Team GB a chance to show their appreciation and gratitude for the truly inspirational support they received from the Great British public throughout the London 2012 Games."
The British Paralympic Association chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said: "We know we have to focus on what is still to come at the 2012 Paralympic Games.
"But it's also right we look ahead to what we hope will be a fantastic outcome for our team and in particular the performances and medals won that will excite and inspire the nation once again."
The parade will be broadcast live on BBC One and the BBC News Channel.
Gary Lineker and Gabby Logan will present the programme with guests including Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and Colin Jackson.
Jake Humphrey and Sonali Shah will be on the floats interviewing athletes with Huw Edwards and Hazel Irvine providing commentary throughout.
