[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 2-2 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York City suffered relegation for the second season running as they could only draw at home to National League high-flyers Forest Green Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest Green old boy Jon Parkin twice equalised against his former club after two strikes from Omar Bugiel.
But, having looked like they might survive, Guiseley's late equaliser at home to Solihull Moors sent York down.
City now have only the consolation of an FA Trophy final against Macclesfield to look forward to in three weeks.
But, next season, they will play in English football's sixth tier for the first time, in National League North.
Forest Green, already qualified for the play-offs, finish third and will now have home advantage in the second leg of their play-off semi-final against fourth-placed Dagenham & Redbridge, who could only draw at home to Woking.
Rovers made a great start on six minutes when Dan Wishart wriggled his way into the left side of the penalty area before cutting back for Bugiel to drill home right-footed into the far right corner.
York should have been level on 15 minutes when Parkin squared a low ball from the right, only for an off-balance Vadaine Oliver to slide in and horribly screw his shot over the top of an open goal from four yards.
But City did equalise when, from a poor clearance by goalkeeper Sam Russell, Drissa Traore was caught in possession by Simon Heslop, who played in January signing Parkin to coolly bend home his low finish.
Just 82 seconds later, a great turn from Fabien Robert played in Bugiel for his second goal.
And, although Parkin scored again to level for a second time three minutes into the second half, the 35-year-old Yorkshireman's 17th goal of the season - and his 13th in 23 games back at York - it was not quite enough.
