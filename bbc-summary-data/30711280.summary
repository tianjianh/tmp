[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More procedures have been postponed as Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has experienced another "very busy" day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Grampian said on Tuesday that patients were being redirected due to "seasonal pressures".
Twenty operations were affected and the health board said a further 45 planned procedures were being postponed on Wednesday.
NHS Grampian said it "categorically" denied suggestions of shortages of mattresses or drugs.
A spokesperson said: "We have opened additional areas to cope with the current pressure which may mean that in the lead up to these areas receiving patients, equipment may be in transit and not immediately available.
"Aberdeen Royal Infirmary remains very busy but staff are working hard to care appropriately for their patients and we thank them for their tremendous dedication.
"We are also grateful to the public for their understanding at this time."
