[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 1-3 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon strengthened their chance of League One survival with victory at Coventry, who are 11 points adrift from safety at the bottom of the table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side looked strong for the first 20 minutes but failed to take their best chance when Kwame Thomas turned in the box and shot straight into the legs of keeper Lawrence Vigouroux.
Nicky Ajose shot a 30th-minute free-kick over the bar but made no mistake two minutes later when Ben Gladwin crossed from the left and the striker turned in from close range.
Swindon extended their lead when another cross from the left-hand side, this time from Charlie Colkett, was headed in by Jonathan Obika.
Coventry forced a couple of corners early in the second half and substitute Stuart Beavon could have pulled a goal back, but put his effort off target.
But that was nothing compared to Ajose's glaring miss in the 53rd minute when he rounded keeper Lee Burge but blazed over with an open goal in front of him.
Coventry sent on Aiyegbeni Yakubu to try to nick something, but Ajose grabbed a second, sliding in to finish Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill's cross from the left.
George Thomas pulled one back for the home side in injury time but it was scant consolation.
