The 24-year-old moved to Tynecastle in June 2014, helping Hearts win the Championship, and was made skipper last season on the club's top-flight return.
However, the defender made just five starts this term and lost the captaincy to Perry Kitchen in September.
The former Turkey Under-21 player scored seven goals in 74 appearances during his time in Scotland.
