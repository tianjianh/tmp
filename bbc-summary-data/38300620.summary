Scottish Borders Council proposes 3% tax increase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council's administration has said it intends to propose a 3% increase in council tax.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move, which would follow a nine-year freeze, will be considered at its budget-setting meeting in February.
The local authority has estimated the increase would raise Â£1.5m towards funding its services.
The change would see payments for a band D property rise by Â£32.52 per year. Changes to council tax charges on second homes are also to be proposed.
Depute leader John Mitchell said: "The council anticipates a very challenging budget settlement and is proposing a 3% increase in council tax to offset the impact of funding reductions on the provision of services.
"By making this increase the council will raise an additional Â£1.5m a year, which is crucial to supporting our budget in these challenging times, especially as we expect a reduction in the funding we receive in the annual settlement from Holyrood."
The increase will be considered by the council on 9 February.
The council said that anticipated Scottish government changes to charges for more expensive properties would see costs rise further on band E to H properties.
