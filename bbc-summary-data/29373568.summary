A police watchdog is to investigate the response of officers who dealt with calls from a mental health unit about a missing man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Westerman, 65, a retired civil servant, was reported missing by staff at The Mount, a hospital in Leeds.
Four days after the report, Mr Westerman's body was found in the River Aire on 18 August.
Now the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is to investigate West Yorkshire Police's response.
IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone, who will oversee the investigation, said: "I have offered my deepest sympathies to members of Mr Westerman's family and explained that we are investigating how West Yorkshire Police officers responded to the calls made."
