Sophie McKinna: Shot putter 'wants everything too soon'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sophie McKinna is taking positives despite missing out on a place at the Rio 2016 Olympics after failing to reach the shot put qualifying distance.

The Great Yarmouth athlete set up her own competition on Saturday in a bid to reach Rio, but could only throw 17.14m, short of the 17.75m required.
"Not all is lost. I'm still 21, I've got lots of time," she said.
"I am gutted but a thrower doesn't peak until their late 20s. I just want everything a little bit too soon."
McKinna had already thrown 18.41m in 2016, well over the British Athletics qualifying standard, but at an event without the correct permit to count towards Rio 2016 qualification.
Two qualifying standards are required for automatic selection, so even if she had thrown the distance, she was not guaranteed a place at the Olympics.
She still decided to organise an event at the University of East Anglia, which included getting the correct permit, but missed out.
She told BBC Radio Norfolk: "It's the World Championships next year in London, so hopefully I can take the decision out of the selectors hands and they take me automatically.
"It's the Commonwealths the year after that so it's all to play for. I'm still young, I've got plenty of time and I've fallen back in love with my sport which is the most important thing."
