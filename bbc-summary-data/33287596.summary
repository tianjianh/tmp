Can the Vulcan put the vroom back into Aston Martin?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's too powerful to drive on the road.  You also need to stump up £1.5m to buy one - plus tax. But if you have the spare cash to buy one of 24 new Vulcan supercars, Aston Martin will throw in some driving lessons to get you started.

There's a lot riding on this car, the most expensive the company has made.
It's famous for being James Bond's car supplier of choice, but I'm not sure even he could handle it with top speeds of more than 200 miles an hour.
I was the first journalist to get a ride as the Vulcan was put through its paces hours before it was driven in public for the first time at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.
These days I don't tend to hit more than 20mph in my trusty old family car through the back streets of London.
Would I throw up or be thrilled?
Luckily top driver, Darren Turner, was at the wheel.  The acceleration was just incredible. It felt like I was on a rocket on wheels as we spun around the track.
Aston Martin is a company that needs to generate some excitement, given that it's been losing money and market share.
However, the private equity-owned firm has secured more than £200m of new investment to upgrade its existing models to boost sales. It's a huge revamp for this 102-year-old brand.
Aston has also got a new boss, Andy Palmer, who was lured from Nissan to restore its fortunes.
He told me the next few years will be make or break: "The company has only ever been profitable twice. Nobody's ever really made money out of the brand, which is strange because it is such an iconic brand. It's so powerful and deserves better."
A short drive away, the London Taxi Company is already on the road to recovery. It was rescued from administration in 2012 by its new Chinese owner, Geely.
It is spending £250m on a new factory with a research and development site, to build the next generation of of electric and low-emission black cabs.
The investment is thought to be the biggest of its type by a Chinese company in the UK - a move that will create up to 1,000 new jobs.
According to the C&W Local Enterprise Partnership, the area is getting more foreign investment in advanced manufacturing than any other part of England outside London.
Coventry is a city once famous for mass car manufacturing. Those days are long gone but the skills and expertise never completely vanished.
Now the area is reinventing itself as the "brains" of the UK car industry.
It's a spectacular recovery, says Jonathan Browning, the head of the C&W partnership.
"We've really seen a tremendous transformation. We now have unemployment at its lowest levels in 30 years. We're seeing the addition of five nationally renowned research institutions in the area, and they are working with the car industry to generate growth, not just nationally but internationally as well," he says.
Mr Browning knows a thing or two about cars. He was a former president of the Volkswagen group in the US as well as a former MD of Jaguar.
He says the impact of what he calls the JLR effect cannot be overestimated: "Jaguar Land Rover has doubled in size and its growth has been a catalyst for the local automotive supply chain."
Take a drive around town and you can see the trickle-down effect. Roads are being upgraded to cope with the increase in traffic and local suppliers are thriving.
Semcon is one of them. It uses cutting edge technology to produce new designs for cars, from the motor to the manuals. The Swedish company plans to open a new site next year as it continues to grow.
"Business is fantastic," says the boss, Torsten Sundin. "We started with 35 people in 2007 and we have been able to grow the business to 140 and with the growth in the region we can foresee a need of up to 200."
The inward investment really starts to mount up when you take into account the £100m being put into a new advanced propulsion centre, which will be part of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, and a further £92m for a new National Automotive Innovation Campus for the University of Warwick.
When the recession struck, the worry for this city was where were all the jobs going to come from. Would the private sector be able to pick up the slack from public sector cuts?
Now the question is where Coventry will find enough people to fill all the jobs.
The area is motoring ahead with ambitions to be a global hub for advanced automotive engineering and manufacturing.
The boss of Aston Martin believes that this iconic British brand can enjoy long-term success, too: "It's the only independent luxury sports car company in the world. We don't want to change the spirit as we're all about power, beauty and soul. But we do have to appeal to a wider and newer audience and it's down to us to deliver on the new products," Mr Palmer says.
"The Vulcan is very much part of our turnaround story. We are creating little bits of history right now which represent everything we stand for."
