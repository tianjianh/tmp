Reading 'Swan Heights' skyscraper plans recommended for refusal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three town centre skyscrapers on a former car dealership would appear "alien" and "foreboding" to the area, council planning officers have said.

The towers, dubbed "Swan Heights", have been recommended for refusal by officers at Reading Borough Council.
Developers Lochailort's plans propose 352 apartments of varying sizes along with office, retail and leisure space.
Members of the council's planning committee are set to debate the application on 29 April.
Plans for the site next to Reading railway station and along Kings Meadow Road were submitted last month and a public consultation closed soon after.
The towers could be as high as 28-storeys, standing between 285ft to 321ft (87m to 98m) in height.
Officers noted the plans failed to allow space for a proposed mass transport link system between the railway station and nearby Thames Valley Business Park.
A failure to provide affordable housing and space for HGVs to load and unload were also noted as reasons to refuse the application.
