[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset's Johann Myburgh hit the first century of the new Championship season before captain Paul Collingwood led a Durham fightback at Taunton.

South African Myburgh struck a six and 15 fours in his 118 and the home side were going well as they reached 224-2.
But his dismissal triggered a collapse and they were all out for 299, with Collingwood claiming 5-57.
Graham Onions cleaned up the tail for figures of 4-59 and Durham were 98-2 in reply at the close.
The North East county have only won one of their last 14 Championship meetings with Somerset, who included Australian batsman Tom Cooper in their line-up for the first time.
Cooper, who has played international cricket for the Netherlands, looked good in making 47 out of a second-wicket stand of 93 with Myburgh following the early dismissal of Marcus Trescothick.
He fell lbw to Paul Coughlin, but it was former England all-rounder Collingwood who did the real damage either side of tea as he picked up his first four wickets in the space of 20 balls and added Jim Allenby after the re-start.
James Hildreth hit two sixes in his 53, only to fall lbw to Collingwood, who had Myburgh caught at short cover in his previous over.
When Durham replied, Lewis Gregory removed both openers with only 13 on the board, but Scott Borthwick, who hit 52 not out at a run-a-ball, with 12 fours, and Michael Richardson (35) shared an unbroken stand of 85 in 15 overs before the close.
Somerset batsman Johann Myburgh:
"It's a great feeling to get my maiden Championship century.
"I've played well in previous innings for Somerset, but that was probably my best knock over a sustained period.
"We feel the game is evenly balanced. We let things slip a bit before tea, but we will still have a relatively new ball in the morning and a couple of quick wickets would put us back on top."
Durham skipper Paul Collingwood:
"I'm as surprised as anyone to be standing here talking about taking five wickets on the opening day of the season.
"It was only my second five-for in first-class cricket and my first for a decade. There were some good balls and some poor shots.
"We are pleased with our position, having remained positive throughout the day and can hopefully push on tomorrow."
