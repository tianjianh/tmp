Westley took charge of the League Two's bottom side after succeeding Warren Feeney.
The ex-Peterborough boss will be in charge for the first time on Saturday at Yeovil Town.
"The new manager's been trying to raise our energy levels, raise our fitness levels and it's just about embracing it," Rigg said.

"I do think you do need that, it's just a shock to the system initially.
"But I do think it will help, at least we can go into games knowing we're going to be the fittest team in the league.
"To go in with that confidence can go a long way."
County are bottom of League Two and have not won in eight league games.
