The venue that will host the mountain bike competitions at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has opened.

The Â£600,000 Cathkin Braes Mountain Bike Trails has a 5.5km circuit and will be free to use by the public before and after the 2014 games.
It is suitable for all abilities and has mixed terrain, such as moorland, woodland and hillside bedrock.
The trail was designed by Phil Saxena, the man behind the Beijing Olympic mountain bike course.
He worked on the project with a team from Glasgow City Council.
Councillor Archie Graham, executive member for the Commonwealth Games at Glasgow City Council, said: "Mountain biking is one of the fastest growing sports in the world and there has already been huge interest in these trails from riders in the city and much further afield.
"Even before they were finished, everyone from elite athletes to local kids were visiting the site and trying out each new challenge.
"This is a really exciting addition to Glasgow's top class sporting facilities - and, like all of the council venues that will be used during the Games, it is open to the public more than a year before the Opening Ceremony."
