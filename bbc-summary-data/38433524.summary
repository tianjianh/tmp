Mark Scott: "While both clubs occupy decent positions in the table, there's an air of dissatisfaction amongst them as we hit the halfway stage of the season.
"Ronald Koeman has made it clear that he expects to be busy in the transfer window, and Everton look in need of reinforcements, with time seeming to be catching up with their ageing squad judging by some of their lethargic displays.
"There were boos from Southampton supporters after their loss to West Brom in another showing that lacked in penetration and purpose.
"Claude Puel's team look short of ideas and belief right now - another defeat would represent their worst losing run in the league for more than two years."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman on facing his former club: "Of course it's always special. I was manager at Southampton for two seasons in a row.
"But we (Everton) had a really poor game there [in the reverse fixture]. Maybe it was one of the worst of the season, the whole team performance.
"You know if you go behind in just one minute it's always difficult because they play with a lot of organisation.
"But this game will be totally different."
Southampton manager Claude Puel: "It's important to keep calm, maintain good spirit and produce a good reaction for the next game.
"We must have strong character. It's a difficult moment, but I have confidence in all my players."
