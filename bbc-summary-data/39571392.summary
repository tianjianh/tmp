Michal Podlaszczyk had already served 12 and a half years for the equivalent of manslaughter in his native Poland in 2003 when he was 18.
A year after his release he came to the UK and in October raped and robbed a woman in a Leicester park.
Podlaszczyk, 33, was jailed again on Wednesday for a minimum of seven and a half years.
He had previously admitted nine different charges including rape, sexual assault and robbery.
Leicester Crown Court heard Podlaszczyk attacked a 55-year-old woman as she walked to the bus station through Bede Park shortly after 07:00.
He punched her to the ground, dragged her to a secluded part and raped her.
During the attack he took her bank card and demanded her Pin number in order to steal Â£20 from her account.
He also took her mobile phone and Â£1.15 from her purse saying he needed money for beer.
Prosecuting, Jim Thomas said the woman was left with injuries to her knees and face, including a denture being knocked out.
Reading a statement from the victim, Mr Thomas said: "She is frightened to go out and is constantly worried when there's a knock at the door."
Podlaszczyk had been released from prison in Poland in July 2015 and settled in the UK last August.
Judge Philip Head called the attack "sadistic" and described the defendant as a "damaged and dangerous" killer.
He said the defendant took "great pleasure from it [the attack] by humiliating her by some disgusting actions".
"This was motivated by sex and he thought he could profit at the same time."
