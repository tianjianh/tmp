[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tesco has recalled a contact lens solution amid concerns it could burn people's eyes and cause other "serious health consequences".

The supermarket withdrew all batch codes of the 360ml Bausch + Lomb "EasySept Hydro + Peroxide Solution".
Trading Standards said the "potential fault" means peroxide could remain in the lens case, which could cause a number of health issues.
The BBC has approached Bausch + Lomb for a comment.
The Chartered Trading Standards Institute said customers who have bought the product should not use it.
It said: "Residual peroxide could potentially remain in the lens case after neutralization.
"If the residual hydrogen peroxide is above product specification, the user could experience burning/stinging, irritation, red eye and, in rare circumstances, other more serious health consequences."
A Tesco spokesman said the solution was recalled "as a precautionary measure" as requested by the manufacturer.
He added the product is also on sale "across a number of retailers".
No other Bausch + Lomb products are known to be affected.
