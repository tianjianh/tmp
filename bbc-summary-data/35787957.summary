Dan Purvis is back in the city where he and his British team-mates made history and looking forward to competing again in front of a home crowd.

Purvis was part of the British team to win silver in the team event - their first men's team medal at a world championships - in Glasgow.
"It's great to be back," he told BBC Scotland. "Its always fantastic to be in front of a home crowd.
"To be here in a big arena in front of an enthusiastic crowd."
Purvis, who competed at the recent Scottish championships in Perth, is taking part in the Gymnastics World Cup at the Emirates knowing that he is constantly under the selectors' microscope with the Rio Olympics looming.
Britain have secured a team place in Rio thanks to their world championships showing, but the five men making up that team have yet to be announced.
The final line-up will be confirmed on 12 July.
"Rio is always on the back of your mind, but you have to keep your feet on the ground," said Purvis. "You have to train and get on the team.
"These competitions allow me to prove myself and that's what keeps your head settled.
"It's one thing to dream, but to try and get there in reality is another."
Purvis was part of the GB men's team to win bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London and, two years later, he won gold for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow on the parallel bars as well as silver with the men's team.
Last year's world championships achievements followed and he is fresh from being crowned Scottish champion two weeks ago.
"Confidence is high," Purvis added. "At the moment, the key momentum is about hitting these results and scores.
"Training has been good, so I'm ready to go and hit the routines I know I can."
