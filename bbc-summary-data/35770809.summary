Plymouth hospital bid to close spinal waiting list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Devon hospital wants to close its waiting list to people needing routine spinal operations for a year because it cannot cope with a growing backlog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plymouth's Derriford hospital has 450 people on the waiting list for elective spinal orthopaedic surgery and says it "needs time".
A further 1,000 patients have been referred for treatment.
If the move is approved, patients would not be added to the surgery waiting list from 1 April for one year.
Those already on the waiting list have been offered their surgery elsewhere, with accommodation and travel costs paid for, but most have refused, according to NHS England.
New patients would still be initially seen at clinics in Plymouth but then those needing surgery would receive it elsewhere, with a choice.
Urgent and emergency spinal referrals for tumours, trauma, infections and neurological deterioration due to degenerative disease will be unaffected.
The latest figures show 3,901 patients have waited more than the target of 18 weeks for treatment in departments across Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust.
Fourteen patients have waited at least a year.
NHS England is responsible for approving the move, along with the Trust Development Authority and Monitor.
Joe McEvoy, NHS England south west assistant director of specialised commissioning, said: "We are working closely with Plymouth Hospitals Trust which has told us it needs time to reduce the number of people waiting for routine spinal surgery.
"Our priority is to make sure all patients are seen and treated quickly with top quality care."
