[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is to face MPs amid criticism of US president Donald Trump's controversial immigration crackdown and calls for his UK state visit to be cancelled.

The US travel ban on refugees and citizens from nations including Syria, Iran and Iraq has sparked protests.
Number 10 said a "committee for state visits" had recommended the president be invited to the UK.
It also said government travel advice for Britons was correct.#
The Foreign Office has said the clampdown should not affect UK nationals travelling to the US, even if they had shared nationality with one of the countries on which restrictions have been placed.
But the US embassy in London has issued a statement telling any citizens of the seven countries in question and also those holding dual nationality not to apply for a visa for the time being.
A UK government spokesman insisted the FCO guidance "was cleared by the top team in the White House and they are in charge".
An executive order signed by Mr Trump on Friday halted the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned all Syrian refugees and suspended the entry of all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, also including Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya.
The White House says a ban is justified on grounds of national security.
It has also indicated that it might extend so-called "extreme vetting" procedures to more countries.
The move has been criticised by MPs from all parties, with former Conservative cabinet minister Baroness Warsi describing it as a "Muslim ban" in all but name.
She told the BBC that the UK government must be forthright in its response.
"If we want to continue to be a country which supports liberal progressive values in which all have equal worth and equal value in our society then we have to be clear that we voice that view and that opinion so that people in this country know that whatever crazy things the President of the United States may be doing it is not what we believe and it is not what we support," she told Radio 4's Today.
But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said many British politicians were guilty of "double standards", suggesting he had not heard any condemnation of President Obama for imposing a six month ban on Iraqis entering the US in 2011 following the discovery of two suspected Iraqi terrorists living in Kentucky.
He added: "This was all part of his (Donald Trump's) manifesto, In fact, in some ways he has not gone as far as he said during some parts of the campaign."
Mr Farage said he would like tougher vetting procedures in the UK as well.
"You were always going to find individual cases where families will have a grievance but... I have got moderate Muslims friends living in this country who feel every time there is a terror attack, that their quality of life is declining hugely."
In addition to the ministerial statement, expected to begin at 15:30 GMT, former Labour leader Ed Miliband is pushing for an emergency debate on the issue.
Over a million people have signed a petition calling for Mr Trump's state visit to be stopped.
Pressed on why the honour of a state visit had been extended to the president so soon after taking office, the PM's spokesman told journalists normal procedure had been followed after recommendations were made by a committee for state visits which works within the Foreign Office.
The spokesman said he was not aware of the membership of the committee.
