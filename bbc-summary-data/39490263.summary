Kent have signed Welsh pace bowler James Harris on loan from Middlesex for the start of the new county season.

The 26-year-old took 69 Championship wickets in 2015, but only 16 in seven games last summer as Middlesex won the title for the first time since 1993.
"I am grateful to the two counties for making it happen," said Harris, who began his career with Glamorgan.
He has initially joined Kent for their first three Championship games, plus the start of the One-Day Cup.
There is, however, a recall clause in their agreement with Middlesex.
"James has been one of the leading seam bowlers in county cricket in recent years," Kent head coach Matt Walker told the club website.
"To have him on board with us for the start of the season is very exciting and he brings extra quality to our talented squad."
Kent are hoping to secure one of the two promotion spots in Division Two of the County Championship this summer, having finished as runners-up to Essex in 2016 when only one team went up.
