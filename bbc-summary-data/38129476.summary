The safe was taken overnight between Thursday and Friday from a portable office building at Lighthouse Leisure in Southerness.
Det Con Grant Drennan said they were carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the area.
He said they wanted to hear from anyone who had seen or heard anything suspicious in the area.
"It appears that those responsible might have taken some time to carry out this crime and we are also keen to hear about any suspicious activities on the days leading up to this theft," he added.
