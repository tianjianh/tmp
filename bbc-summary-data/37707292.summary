Opinion 'divided' on Snowdonia National Park art planning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opinion is "divided" over whether planning permission is needed for art in a national park, the Snowdonia Society has said.

The society said it would "welcome clarification" following a debate on the issue in Machynlleth on Wednesday.
It said a floating canvas at Llyn Llydaw created a "good deal of controversy".
The Snowdonia National Park Authority said it was "happy to discuss the issue".
David Archer, chairman of the Snowdonia Society, said: "Opinion is divided over whether such works, temporary or not, should be permitted within protected landscapes.
"We will probably come to the conclusion that the Snowdonia Society should contact the park's planning authority and perhaps press for a better clarification on what does and doesn't require planning permission."
The debate, held at the Museum of Modern Art, was attended by about 30 people, including artists, planners and walkers.
Mr Archer said that although the definition of art was "subjective", there was a difference between commercial and creative installations.
He added that there could also be consideration given to the location and timing of artworks.
The Llyn Llydaw canvas, together with an installation in slate caverns in Blaenau Ffestiniog, was part of a commission entitled "High and Low" and will be in place until the end of October.
A Snowdonia National Park Authority spokeswoman said there was no specific legislation covering the installation of artworks.
She added: "Anything like that we would have to look at on its own merit.
"We are in constant contact with the Snowdonia Society and would be happy to discuss the issue with them."
