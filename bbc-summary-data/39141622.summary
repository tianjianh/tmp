Sixty tonnes of soil and five large containers of debris have been cleared from a railway line after a wall collapsed on to the tracks.

Part of a trackside wall "loaded with concrete and cabins by a third party" fell, said Network Rail, blocking all four lines into Liverpool Lime Street from about 17:45 GMT on Tuesday.
Network Rail said services would resume into and out of the station on 9 March.
An investigation into the cause of the 200-tonne landslip is under way.
A spokeswoman for Network Rail said: "Our engineers are working round the clock to get train services back up and running.
"Overnight we removed 60 tonnes of soil and five large containers, each holding many tonnes of material, from the top of the cutting to prevent further slips."
Engineers have been working to remove a "10 inch-thick concrete slab" before they can "start stabilising the retaining wall".
Network Rail will repair the damaged railway and overhead wires once the debris is cleared.
Network Rail said it was liaising with transport operators to ensure passengers get the right advice including Liverpool FC fans travelling to Saturday's Premier League clash with Arsenal.
Train customers are advised to check before they travel.
Liverpool Lime Street is the main station serving the city centre.
