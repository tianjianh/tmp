Champions Cup: 'Embarrassed' Leicester seek return to form against Glasgow

Glasgow Warriors can expect to feel the brunt of Leicester Tigers' wounded pride when they visit Welford Road, according to Tigers coach Aaron Mauger.

A Warriors win would all but guarantee them a first Champions Cup last-eight place while Tigers' loss to Racing 92 last week put them out of contention.
"We were all embarrassed and frustrated by the performance in Paris," said Mauger ahead of Saturday's match.
"Everyone has to look in the mirror and ask if they are giving it everything."
Leicester sit fifth in the Premiership but have lost three of their five matches in Europe this term, including a 42-13 reverse at Glasgow's Scotstoun Stadium.
"If we can put Glasgow under a bit of pressure, hopefully it will be good enough to swing a result," Mauger said.
"We'll be excited about getting back down to Welford Road. We've shown in fits and bursts that we can be a quality side."
Mauger highlighted his team's failure to "front up" in Paris and their sluggishness off the line as key failures in a match in which he felt Tigers "were not at the races".
But the New Zealander told BBC Radio Leicester that there was a determination to make up for it against Gregor Townsend's side, with fly-half Owen Williams and lock Dom Barrow likely to be available for the hosts and his "front row stocks coming back to life".
"The guys care," he added. "It's not through a lack of effort. We can make it easier on ourselves. Once we start executing the details, hopefully our game will click. We owe it to ourselves and to our loyal supporters."
The New Zealander also revealed that, with Matt Toomua and Manu Tuilagi injured, he is looking at France international centre Maxime Mermoz to strengthen his team.
