Carmarthen's Guildhall to be bought for £225,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carmarthen's Grade II* Guildhall is set to be bought by the county council for £225,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At a meeting on Tuesday, the authority's executive board voted to buy the building.
The figure was set by the District Valuer, who is acting on behalf of HM Courts which is disposing of the building.
The future of the building has been uncertain since it was announced the law courts would close in May.
Council leader Emlyn Dole said it was not an easy time to look for capital expenditure, but he "wasn't going to be the leader that left that building dilapidated in the middle of the town".
He said the next step was to find a new purpose for the building, to bring in money to sustain it.
The Guildhall has been home to many famous trials over the years.
Discussions are continuing with potential partners including Carmarthen Town Council and Dyfed-Powys Police.
A call was made in April for the public to consider establishing a trust to run the building.
