Wenvoe axe and spearheads among items declared treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An early Bronze Age axe and spearheads are among a number of finds which have been declared treasure by a coroner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bronze Age items were discovered in Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, in August 2014 and April 2015.
In Llanarmon-yn-IÃ¢l, Denbighshire, an early medieval piece which would have formed part of a gilt bronze or silver brooch was found in August 2014.
Also declared treasure was an early medieval silver ingot found in Trelawnyd and Gwaenysgor, Flintshire.
The Bronze Age axe and spearheads were found by Gwyn Rees and are thought to have been buried during a ritual ceremony about 3,500 years ago.
National Museum Wales has expressed interest in buying the items.
The brooch includes a gold baseplate, decorated with a spherical blue glass bead set in a gold collar, and was found by Karina Kucharski.
Dr Mark Redknap, of National Museum Wales, said: "Early medieval gold work of this period is rarely found in Wales.
"This new find adds significantly to our understanding of early medieval jewellery and its circulation, as well as the gold working technologies used at this time."
The silver ingot was found by Francis Hodge and Flintshire museums want to acquire it.
