[SN]TITLE[SN]
Berkshire towns' residents must apply for new waste permits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A permit will be needed for some Berkshire residents to dump waste under new rules being brought into force.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The permit will allow those living in Reading, Wokingham and Bracknell to use Smallmead Recycling Centre in Whitley.
But, residents west of Reading will be barred from using the site from 1 July due to cuts to funding.
West Berkshire Council withdrew Â£97,000 from its funding for waste disposal in the town, in March.
The authority decided the costs to cover the 75,000 visits to the tip each year, made by people crossing the border into Reading, were "too high".
This led to the establishment of Re3 - the recycling company which provides waste services to Bracknell, Wokingham and Reading councils - to bar West Berkshire residents from using the tips from July.
West Berkshire councillor Alan Macro said Re3's decision could lead to more fly-tipping in the area.
"What they have done wrong is that they have acted before they have an alternative for people who live in the general Reading area", he said.
Tilehurst resident Brian Pettiford - who uses the Smallmead tip regularly - said the changes will mean people living in Calcot and Tilehurst will have to drive up to 20 miles to access rubbish tips in Newbury as opposed to a 5 miles trip to Smallmead.
"I feel very bitter that we have to go to Newbury, which is over 15 miles away. It would be good if [Re3] would charge for a permit to use the tip," he said.
West Berkshire Council said financial challenges meant "some difficult decisions about the services provided" had to be made.
