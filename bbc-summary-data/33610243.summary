Cullen, who has scored 32 times in 79 games for GB, retired after winning Olympic bronze at her home Games.
The 29-year-old has been working in Kenya since 2012 but will join the squad for an autumn training camp,
Britain's women won their World League semi-final in Valencia last month to reach the 2016 Rio Olympics.
"I am excited about the opportunity to return to international hockey and to have a chance once more to compete for a place in the Great Britain Squad," said Cullen.
GB coach Danny Kerry said the return followed a conversation with Cullen in May.
"She will be returning to the Great Britain squad at our training venue at Bisham Abbey for an extended period of assessment through October and November," he said.
"If successful in that assessment period, Crista will be offered a place within the wider squad of athletes as they continue preparations towards the Rio 2016 Olympic Games."
Many of the GB side will be playing when England and Scotland are among the teams competing in the European Hockey Championships being held at Lea Valley and London's Olympic Park from 21-30 August.
