Hoover decision on workers' pension scheme looming

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 4,000 people in Wales could be affected if the Hoover pension scheme goes into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), BBC Wales understands.

The company has been negotiating with the pension regulator and the PPF in a bid to offload its pension liabilities and a decision is expected soon.
Most, if not all, members of the scheme would see a reduction in benefits.
Those under retirement age would receive an immediate 10% cut in their pension pot.
In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the PPF than if the Hoover scheme continued.
At about £500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as BHS.
BHS pensions is already receiving compensation from PPF which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme.
BHS is being assessed for take-over by the organisation.
The Hoover scheme has a deficit of about £250m.
Parent company Hoover Candy stopped producing washing machines in Merthyr Tydfil in 2009, blaming competition in the marketplace.
More than 300 workers lost their jobs although there is still a head office and a distribution warehouse in the town.
It is believed about half of the Hoover pension scheme's 7,800 members live in Wales.
Pensions expert Stuart Price, partner at Quantum Advisory, said: "Members of the pension schemes will lose out on their benefits but, on the flipside, those still employed by the company will retain their jobs.
"At the moment they [members] don't know what's happening so they can't really plan for their short-term future.
"If they get a 10% reduction [for those under 65] and lower increases in the future they might find it very hard to overcome."
