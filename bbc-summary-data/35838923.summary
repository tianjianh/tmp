It also plans to sell a majority stake in its home appliances business to China's Midea Group.
Toshiba is looking to raise money after major accounting scandal last year led to record losses and job cuts.
However, Japan's benchmark Nikkei fell 1.2% to close at 16,730.16 because of concerns over the Japanese yen.
The currency has gained in value for the fifth straight day and is trading at around 110 yen to the dollar, which is a level that hurts many exporters' earnings.
"The Japanese yen has received much demand in recent months due to more demand for safe-haven assets and lower US rate hikes expectations," Bernard Aw from IG Markets said.
"At the start of the year, a stronger yen was not on the radar of many analysts, but as the year and new developments unfold, they are looking at the possibility of more yen strength more closely."
The rest of Asia's major stock markets are higher after oil prices rose above $40 per barrel overnight.
Both Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 5,183.10 and Korea's Kospi Index gained 0.2% to 1,992.12.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 0.8% higher, while the Shanghai Composite added 1.7%.
Chinese shares were lifted by data showing the mainland property market recovery is gaining steam.
New home prices across 47 major Chinese cities saw the biggest gain since 2014 in February, compared with 38 a month earlier.
