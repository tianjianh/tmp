[SN]TITLE[SN]
Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe to race in Tour Down Under

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh cyclists Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe will start 2016 by returning to Australia's Tour Down Under on 19 January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas has been a regular at the six-stage race based around Adelaide and has been supporting Richie Porte over recent seasons.
But with Australian Porte no longer with Team Sky, this could be an early chance for Thomas to lead the team.
Rowe will be riding for a second time in preparation for the Classics season.
Sergio Henao, Pete Kennaugh, Salvatore Puccio, Luke Rowe, Ian Stannard and Ben Swift will complete Team Sky's lineup.
