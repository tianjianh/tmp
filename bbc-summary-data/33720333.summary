The Health and Social Care Information Centre report shows Â£869m was spent on drugs for the disease last year.
It marks a sharp rise from the Â£514m being spent on the drugs a decade ago, when they accounted for just 6.6% of the prescriptions budget.
The figures include drugs for both type-1 and type-2 diabetes, which affect 2.8 million people in England.
It includes insulin, metformin and other anti-diabetic drugs.
Ian Bullard, who wrote the report, said: "It shows that 10p in the pound of the primary care prescribing bill in England is being spent on managing diabetes.
"Diabetes continues to be one of the most prevalent long-term conditions, and the number of patients being diagnosed with the condition is increasing each year."
