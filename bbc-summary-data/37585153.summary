The athlete won Team GB's first medal of this year's Games when he took first place in the 100m breaststroke in world record time.
The 21-year-old, who trains with City of Derby Swimming Club, received the accolade at a ceremony at the Council House.
It comes amid concerns for Derby's limited public swimming facilities.
Moorways Swimming Pool, where Peaty used to train, has been closed since March due to budget cuts.
The family pool at the city's Queen's Leisure Centre has also been shut for repair work.
Before accepting his award, Peaty urged the authority to "push those facilities forward" and use the Olympic legacy as an advantage.
Derby council leader Ranjit Banwait replied he was "committed" to building a new Â£50m pool at the Moorways site by 2018.
The Labour councillor added giving Peaty the freedom honour was a chance to celebrate his "fantastic sporting success".
Peaty's coach Mel Marshall and Lewis White, who won a bronze medal in the S9 400m freestyle at the Rio Paralympics, were also honoured at the ceremony.
The Staffordshire swimmer's Olympic success made him the first British man to win a swimming gold medal since Adrian Moorhouse, in Seoul 1988.
Earlier this month hundreds of people lined the streets of Peaty's hometown of Uttoxeter during an open top bus tour.
