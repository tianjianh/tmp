[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tyrone go top of Division One as they ease to win over relegation-threatened Cavan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyrone moved top of Division One in the Football League as they outscored Cavan 0-12 to 0-1 in the second half to earn a 0-19 to 1-9 win at Healy Park.

Helped by a wind advantage, Cavan led 1-8 to 0-7 at the break with Gearoid McKiernan netting on 34 minutes.
However, Aidan McCrory's subduing of Martin Reilly in the second half and Mark Bradley's introduction helped turn the game Tyrone's way.
Tyrone levelled by the 48th minute as they went on to hit the last 10 scores.
After his side's encouraging first-half display as Reilly hit three outstanding points from play, Cavan manager Mattie McGleenan will surely be concerned by a second-half fade-out which leaves the Breffni County remaining in a relegation spot.
Cavan pulled men behind the ball in the first half and then broke at pace following turnovers as Tyrone struggled for fluency.
Points from McKiernan and Dara McVeety gave the visitors a two-point lead by the ninth minute and while two Sean Cavanagh frees helped edge the Red Hands ahead, Cavan led again at 0-4 to 0-3 thanks to Reilly's first score.
Cavan led by the minimum on three occasions over the following 10 minutes, only to be pegged back each time, before McKiernan's 1-1 late in the half left four between the teams at the break.
After Cavanagh and Kieran McGeary points halved the margin, Conor Madden replied on 42 minutes but that proved to be Cavan's last score as Bradley - introduced following half-time substitute Ronan McNamee's black card - began to make a big impact in the Red Hand attack.
After a Darren McCurry score levelled the game, Bradley's second point edged Tyrone ahead and with Cavanagh's move from full-forward to midfield also benefiting the Red Hands, Cavan faded rather alarmingly in the closing stages.
McCurry's black card briefly Tyrone's momentum as tempers, not for the first time during the game, began to fray but Tiernan McCann's 60th-minute score ended a nine-minute scoreless period.
Keeper Niall Morgan was among Tyrone's late scorers as Bradley brought up his tally to 0-3 with substitute Ronan O'Neill hitting the final two points.
Tyrone's win moves them a point ahead of Dublin while Cavan remain three points from safety with their closing games against Mayo [away], Kerry [home] and Roscommon [away] to come.
