Wolves have signed teenage left winger Will Randall from his home town club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee.

The 18-year-old, who has made three starts in his 11 first-team appearances for Swindon, will go straight into Scott Sellars' Wolves Under-21 squad.
Randall, who signed for Swindon as an academy scholar, made his debut on the final day of the 2013-14 season - the day after his 17th birthday.
Swindon rejected a bid last July of about Â£150,000 from Bournemouth.
Randall's arrival at Molineux on an 18-month deal comes in the same week that top scorer Benik Afobe was sold to Bournemouth for a reportedly eight-figure fee.
"This is a great move for me for the stage I am at in my career and my development," he said. "When I came here last Friday for the meeting and had a look around the facilities I was blown away by everything.
"I have been at Swindon's academy from the age of seven right through to now at 18 and have nothing but good things to say about them. But it is a really good time to get this move.
"Playing in front of big crowds and getting that experience of men's football will help me as I aim to push on."
Meanwhile, Wolves Under-21 regular Eusebio Bancessi is to sign on loan for the club's non-league neighbours AFC Telford United.
The young striker is set to make his debut in Tuesday night's rearranged National League North game at home to Hednesford.
Former Benfica youngster Eusebio has not played for the Wolves first team, but had a month out on loan last season with Cheltenham Town, who were then in League Two.
