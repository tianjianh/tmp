Mark Marshall also netted a fine solo goal on the stroke of half-time as City preserved their proud unbeaten league record at Valley Parade.
They went in front after 28 minutes when midfielder Josh Cullen was bundled over in the box and McMahon scored from the penalty spot.
Bradford increased their lead in the third minute of stoppage-time at the end of the first half with a superb goal from Marshall.
The winger accepted a pass from Alex Jones and, with everyone expecting a cross, he scored from an acute angle with a right-footed shot from near the by-line.
The Bantams dominated the second half and deservedly scored a third goal in the 85th minute.
Marshall accepted a cross-field pass from Cullen before sending McMahon through on the overlap and the right-back scored his second goal of the match.
