Great Yarmouth man Kevin Toye accused of killing son, six

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father has been accused of killing his six-year-old son who died from long-term head injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Toye, 28, of St Nicholas Road, Great Yarmouth, is charged with the manslaughter of Baylee Varley, who died in Ormesby, in March 2014.
Baylee had suffered serious head injuries as a baby after an alleged attack in 2008.
Mr Toye is due to appear before magistrates in Great Yarmouth next month.
He has been released on bail.
Mr Toye was also charged with the ill treatment of the boy in February 2008.
A pre-inquest review into Bayley's death earlier heard he died from bronchopneumonia due to long-term complications from a head injury that had required constant medical treatment for the rest of his life.
No further action is to be taken against a woman, aged in her 20s, who was also arrested in connection with the inquiry, said Norfolk Police.
