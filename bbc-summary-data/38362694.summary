Australia v Pakistan: Tourists fall short of world record run chase in Brisbane

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan fell short of completing a world record run chase in the first Test against Australia in Brisbane.

The tourists, set a target of 490, began the final day on 382-8 and were on target for a famous victory until Asad Shafiq fell for 137 at 449-9.
Yasir Shah was run out by Steve Smith's direct hit from second slip four balls later as the home side won by 39 runs.
The record for the highest successful Test chase is West Indies' 418-7 to beat Australia in Antigua in 2003.
However, Pakistan's 450 all out equals the third highest score made in the fourth innings of any Test.
Man of the match Shafiq, who reached his century just before the end of day four, had expertly shepherded the tail, sharing half-century stands for the seventh, eighth and ninth wicket - the first time this had happened in a Test - with Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz and Yasir.
But when Shafiq fended off a Mitchell Starc bouncer to David Warner at gully, the Australians were swiftly able to wrap up victory in the 22nd over of the final day of this day-night encounter as Yasir fell after skipper Smith's direct hit caught him out of his crease.
The three-match series continues with the traditional Boxing Day Test in Melbourne on 26 December.
