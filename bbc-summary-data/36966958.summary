Camau Bach, in Aberystwyth, temporarily shut after the boy was left on the bus outside on what had been the hottest day of the year - 19 July.
It was referred to the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW), which has now completed an inquiry.
Mudiad Meithrin, the charity which runs the nursery, said a member of staff remained suspended.
The incident had also been referred to Ceredigion council's safeguarding board.
In a statement, the council said: "We can confirm that inquiries under the All Wales Child Protection Procedures have been completed.
"The provider is working closely with the regulatory body in order to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place at the facility."
Temperatures in parts of Ceredigion on the day of the incident reached 31.8C (89.2F).
The CSSIW described it as "terrible", with parents saying the boy was "distressed" by what happened.
