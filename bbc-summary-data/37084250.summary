The 20-year-old Rhondda swimmer missed out on 200m breaststroke bronze by 6/100ths of a second in Rio.
But Adlington, who won 400 and 800 freestyle gold medals in 2008, says there's more to come from Tutton.
"I'm sure we'll be seeing her on the podium at World, Commonwealth Games and in Tokyo," she told BBC Wales Sport.
"Chloe is definitely the future, 100%.
"She's only 20 years old, she's come into her first international global meet and she's come fourth.
"I think she should be very proud of her achievement.
"She's got such a bright future ahead of her and more British records between her and Molly [Renshaw] I'm sure."
Tutton said she was honoured by Adlington's description of her as the future of British swimming.
"That's really nice, especially coming from Rebecca Adlington. It's such an honour.
"It's been an incredible experience, it's been a roller-coaster lots of ups and downs, but I'm really proud to be on this team.
"I'm sure it won't be normal for the rest of my life after this as I'll be able to look back and think 'I'm an Olympian now' and that's always been my dream.
"Tokyo 2020 was always my target so hopefully I can pull that off as well."

Adlington was delighted by the success of another Welsh swimmer, Jazz Carlin, who claimed silver medals in the 400 and 800m freestyle.
Carlin missed the 2012 London Games after illness and Adlington has been impressed with her commitment.
"She's had to fight back, but that's what makes Jazz the world-class swimmer she is," added Adlington.
"She's so resilient, so determined and dedicated to prove to herself as much as everyone else that she is this world class athlete.
"And it's so nice to see her reach that potential because I've known it from racing her back in '09.
"She's got that hunger and that 'I want to succeed mentality' and she's so lovely.
"It couldn't go to a more deserving person as well.
"It's been a long time coming - a few missing the teams, a few finishing fourths.
"But this is the one that you want to do well at, the Olympic games, and for her it is fantastic."
