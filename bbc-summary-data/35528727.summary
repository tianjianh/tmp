Ysgol y Preseli in Crymych was given the national award on Tuesday as part of Safer Internet Day.
The My Username Generator phone and tablet app prevents youngsters from disclosing personal information online.
Dyfed-Powys Police is hosting a Twitter Q&A session while North Wales Police is running anti-web bullying sessions in schools to mark Safer Internet Day.
Ysgol y Preseli pupils won the competition organised by the Welsh government and South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL) Trust, co-ordinators of the UK Safer Internet Centre.
Meanwhile, NSPCC Wales has used Safer Internet Day to call for action to be taken as soon as online hate messages are reported by children,
Boss Des Mannion said: "In recent years online abuse has inevitably surged and it's crucial that the internet industry plays its part in stamping it out.
"Safer Internet Day provides Wales, the UK and the world with a clear opportunity to highlight positive use of technology and to explore the role we all play in helping to create a better and safer online community."
Wales' Children's Commissioner Prof Sally Holland said young people needed to learn to navigate relationships "in the modern context", which included social media.
"The online world presents opportunities for children and young people to access education, to express themselves and to socialise," she said.
"We need to listen to young people's experiences and provide the right support and education for this environment, ensuring their safety online and offline so that they can access their rights as digital citizens of the modern world."
