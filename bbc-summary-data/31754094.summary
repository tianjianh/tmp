Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez will return to Anfield to play in a charity match on 29 March.

The match, organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation, will feature sides led by club captain Steven Gerrard and retired vice-captain Jamie Carragher.
Suarez, who left Anfield to join Barcelona for Â£75m last July, is among those who have agreed to play.
Fellow former Liverpool players Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina, Dirk Kuyt and Xabi Alonso will be involved too.
Chelsea captain John Terry, his team-mate Didier Drogba and former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry have also confirmed they will be involved.
The teams will be completed with Liverpool players not on international duty and academy prospects. The two managers have yet to be announced.
Suarez won all three English domestic player of the year awards last season, scoring 31 Premier League goals as Liverpool finished runners-up to Manchester City.
He left shortly after receiving a four-month suspension for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini while playing for Uruguay in a World Cup match in Brazil in June.
Money raised will go towards a number of causes, including the club's foundation, which funds community programmes across the city.
Proceeds will also go towards Alder Hey's new children's Hospital in the Park project, the Wirral-based Claire's House children's hospice, youth charities Positive Futures and Cash for Kids, and Centre 56, which supports women and children who have suffered or are at risk of domestic abuse.
