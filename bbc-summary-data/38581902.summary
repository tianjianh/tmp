Plans to bring in reduced opening times at waste recycling centres in Hampshire have been been put back by 10 months.

The changes have been put off while Hampshire County Council seeks clarity from the government over its fees for "DIY construction waste".
The authority says it could face a legal challenge over the charges which were brought in on 1 October.
It said reduced opening times, which had been due to start in January, would now start in October.
As well as a one-day closure every Thursday, the centres are to open two hours later at 11am.
The authority is seeking to clarify its legal position over the charges which it says are needed to cover the cost of disposing the waste which costs about £1m each year.
The charges, which remain in place, range from £2.50 for a bag of soil, to £10 for a sheet of plasterboard.
A £2.50 charge is also in place for individual items including wash basins and toilets.
The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) says charging for DIY waste goes against its guidance.
