Richard Duffy has joined Notts County on a one-year contract - just a month after agreeing a move to Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old Port Vale and ex-Wales international had verbally agreed to join Eastleigh on a two-year deal once his Vale contract expired on 30 June.
But the National League outfit have now agreed to release the defender after he was given the chance to continue his career in the Football League.
"I hope to bring a bit of experience and leadership," said Duffy.
Eastleigh manager Chris Todd told his club's website: "Whilst I am clearly disappointed that Richard will not be joining my squad for the 2016-17 campaign, it is vital that the whole team are here in soul as well as body.
"I felt it was best that we allowed Richard to go elsewhere."
Duffy made his Wales debut in 2005 and won 13 caps over a three-year period.
