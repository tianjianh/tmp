[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 3-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three goals in nine dramatic second-half minutes enabled Bradford to maintain their unbeaten start to the season with a 3-1 home win against Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors deservedly went in ahead in the 13th minute with their first goal of the season through 19-year -old striker Daniel Agyei, who has joined on loan from Burnley.
Agyei intercepted Danny Devine's pass before racing into the penalty area and clipping the ball over the advancing Colin Doyle.
Coventry were good value for their half-time lead but Bradford came back into the game after 66 minutes when Coventry defender Jordan Turnbull, making his debut after joining from Southampton, pulled down Billy Clarke as he burst into the area and was sent off.
Bradford skipper Tony McMahon equalised from the spot and three minutes later they went in front with a superb low 25-yard shot into the corner of the net from winger Mark Marshall.
McMahon then put the result beyond doubt with his second penalty after Josh Cullen was brought down by Vladimir Gadzhev in the 75th minute.
