Kanye West goes to Oxford: His best quotes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kanye West has been telling Oxford University students that US President Barack Obama calls his home phone - in a long and frequently bizarre speech.

The US rapper visited the city's Museum of Natural History at the invitation of a student society.
Despite being greeted by a standing ovation, he looked unimpressed, according to the independent student newspaper Versa,
Its editor Ruth McLean, 21, was one of around 300 students in the hall.
"It was surprising how he barely talked about music at all," she says. "The talk mostly flipped between art, philosophy and politics and I think he sees no separation between those worlds.
"Some of the stuff he said about how only the rich having access to beauty in the form of luxury suggested a pretty explosive political agenda - which suggests to me some projects beyond music to come in the future.
"I'm interested to see where he takes these ideas."
To give you a flavour of the star's speech, here are Ruth's top five highlights:
Aled Jones, a 22-year-old law student at the university, described the talk as "totally surreal and brilliant".
"It was basically a 45-minute long stream of consciousness, a speech about aestheticism, society and inequality. He couldn't be stopped. Not even when someone's phone went off and OneRepublic started playing," he said.
Other students said he was "odd", "more humble than I expected", and "a bit wishy-washy".
