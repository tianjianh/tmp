[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premiership leaders Saracens have signed Glasgow Warriors lock Kieran Low on loan for the rest of the season.

Low, 24, has five Scotland caps, but has only played three games for Glasgow since joining them in the summer.
The former England Under-20 international spent six years with London Irish before moving to the Scotstoun Stadium.
"He's an international quality lock who has plenty of Premiership experience," said Sarries boss Mark McCall.
"With a few injuries and the expectancy that we will lose a few second-row forwards during the Six Nations, we are very happy to be able to bring Kieran into the group."
