A Head Full Of Dreams is the band's first studio album not to debut at number one, despite selling 236,000 copies.
Their last album, 2014's Ghost Stories debuted with 168,000 sales, with 2011's Mylo Xyloto selling 208,000 in its first week.
Adele retained her top spot position thanks to another week of high sales, shifting 354,000 copies.
Meanwhile, Elvis Presley's If I Can Dream was at three in the album, Justin Bieber's Purpose at four and Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh logged a 16th consecutive week in the top 10, holding at five.
New entries to the album chart included X Factor runner-up Fleur East, whose debut album Love, Sax and Flashbacks entered at 14.
Bieber scored a second week at the top of the singles chart with as Love Yourself, after achieving the rare feat of replacing himself at number one last week.
The highest new entry was Sigala's Sweet Lovin' at three.
Rounding off the top five were Adele's Hello in fourth place and Grace and G-Eazy's You Don't Own Me at five.
The festive season has also made an impression on both charts.
Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You climbed to 13, The Pogues ft Kirsty MacColl's Fairytale Of New York was at 20 and Wham's Last Christmas at 27.
