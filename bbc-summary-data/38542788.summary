[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wayne Rooney equals Manchester United goal record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wayne Rooney has equalled Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 249 goals for Manchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He equalled the record when he scored the first goal in the FA Cup third round tie against Reading.
Sir Bobby Charlton played for Manchester United 758 times between 1956 and 1973.
In that time he won the League title three times, the European Cup and the World Cup with England.
Rooney broke Sir Bobby's goal scoring record for England in 2015 and only needs one more goal to do the same for Manchester United.
