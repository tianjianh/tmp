Al Habsi will be in goal against the Latics on Saturday, who must win their last two games to avoid the drop.
Reading need a draw themselves to secure a play-off place in manager Jaap Stam's first season in charge.
"Wigan are fighting to stay up and any team you face in their position at this stage are difficult," Al Habsi said.
The Oman international, 35, admitted he will be in "a difficult position" as he lines-up against his former employers.
"To see my former club where they are is hard," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "I had a fantastic five years there and really enjoyed it.
"But for us, we know we need to do the job.
"Last weekend against Nottingham Forest, another team in a similar position, we didn't show ourselves for 90 minutes and got punished for our mistakes.
"We've been in the top six for most of the season and we can't let it drop know."
