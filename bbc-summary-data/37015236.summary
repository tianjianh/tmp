The former Barcelona and Spain striker joined the Cookie Monster and Rosita to film a segment for the television show's Love to Learn campaign.
The 34-year-old, now playing for MLS side New York City FC, taught the two furry characters the importance of sportsmanship and teamwork.
"I grew up watching the show and now my children watch the show, so to me, it's a great honour to join the long list of notable people who have been a part of the historic program," he said.
Villa was part of the Spain squad that won the European Championship in 2008 and World Cup two years later.
He won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2011.
Former England captain David Beckham and basketball legend Kobe Bryant are among the sportspeople to have appeared on Sesame Street.
