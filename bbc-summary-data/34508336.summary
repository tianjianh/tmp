Early voting has risen significantly this year in Canada ahead of the 19 October elections, with nearly 1.6 million people casting ballots so far.

Voting numbers show a 34% increase from advance polling in the 2011 election, according to Elections Canada.
Long lines at polling stations included people dressed up in costumes to make political statements.
Voters are allowed to wear costumes and masks as long as they take an oath and provide identification.
Some voters wore costumes and masks to protest over the proposed Conservative law banning wearing niqabs during citizenship ceremonies.
The number of people who came out to vote exceeded predictions.
"So in that sense, it was exciting that so many people are coming out to vote," Elections Canada spokesman Dugald Maudsley told the CBC.
Polls were open throughout the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in Canada.
Some voters waited 45 minutes to two hours to cast their ballot in early polling, according to the CBC.
"One is that usually there is a big rush at the very beginning of advance polls. This has happened every federal election and that, as people tend to get going and get used to the process, things do tend to move more quickly," Mr Maudsley said.
For most of the campaign season, the incumbent Conservatives, the left-centre Liberals and the New Democratic Party have been tied in the polls, but a new poll tips in favour of the Liberals.
Tightened election laws from the Conservative government did not have a large effect on early voting, Mr Maudsley said.
"Maybe it's the good weather, maybe it's the fact that ... it's a weekend and they're on holidays," he said.
• Canadian election day is 19 October. Its formal campaign season lasts 78 days.
• The Canadian Parliament is comprised of 338 constituencies, called ridings.
• Members of parliament are elected in a "first past the post" system where the candidate with the most votes wins.
• Canada's prime minister is chosen by a majority vote in Parliament, either by one party or through a coalition.
