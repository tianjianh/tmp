The trio from Blackwood, in Caerphilly county, will play the final day of the annual festival on Sunday, 9 July.
"It's always really special to play in Wales," said a Manics statement.
"Particularly when we are playing an event for the first time. And to play on the festival's 70th anniversary will make it even better."
The band, whose hits include A Design For Life, Motorcycle Emptiness and If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next, have just finished the 20th anniversary tour of their platinum album Everything Must Go.
Tickets for the show at the Royal International Pavilion, which is expected sell out the 5,200 capacity, go on sale on Thursday.
"This is set to be Llanfest's biggest ever show and to say we are excited about the prospect would be an understatement," said festival's musical director Eilir Owen Griffiths.
"The Manics are one of the most important bands to ever emerge from Wales.
"They have an extensive back catalogue of politically charged songs, which resonate as much now as when first released, as well as their powerful newer works."
