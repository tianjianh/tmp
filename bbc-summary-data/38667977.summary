The 23-year-old has quit his job as a car salesman to make the switch to full-time football.
Kabamba has agreed an 18-month contract at Fratton Park, with the option of a further year.
The former Burnham and Hemel Hempstead man has scored 16 league goals for the Beavers, who play in National League South, this season.
"I'm really grateful for this opportunity and hopefully I can bring my scoring ratio into this league," he said.
"Coming from non-league, and now signing for a club like Pompey, life's going to completely change.
"I've quit my job as a car salesman after four years and I will be moving down to the area."
