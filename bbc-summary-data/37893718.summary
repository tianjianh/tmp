Thousands viewed and shared Nick Jablonka's A-Level coursework, posted on YouTube in June, thinking it was the store's hotly anticipated festive ad.
The Bournemouth student said he was "overwhelmed" by the reaction.
A John Lewis spokesman said: "Nick is clearly very talented, we'd love to invite him to spend some time with us."
The 18-year-old said the project, titled John Lewis Christmas Advert 2016 - The Snowglobe, initially got about 200 views "but in the past week it went crazy".
The piece, which features a love-struck snowman stuck in a snow globe, has had more than 460,000 views.
Mr Jablonka, who is studying at Bournemouth University, said: "I really didn't mean for the confusion. Although I really appreciate the overwhelming comments."
One viewer posted: "Easily comparable to 'the real thing'. Well done. I hope you go on to great things.ï»¿"
Another said: "Nick you've done a great job of taking our feelings on a 75 second journey."
