Danson, 32, will lead the side for this weekend's international matches against Argentina and Holland in London.
She will also skipper the team at July's Hockey World League in South Africa and the EuroHockey Championships in Holland the following month where England will be defending champions.
Danson won gold with Great Britain at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
"It is a huge honour to be handed this captaincy for the summer and to lead a fantastic squad in some very important tournaments," said Danson, who has 99 goals and 272 caps for England.
"We have a team full of very good leaders so in many ways I will be undertaking the exact same role as normal, and each and every one of us will give our all for the cause."
