Netball Superleague 2016: Manchester & Hertfordshire continue 100% record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester Thunder thrashed Team Bath to continue their 100% start to the season and top the Superleague table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Player-of-the-match Helen Housby was in inspired form as Thunder ran out 62-37 victors against Team Bath, who had gone into the match with two wins from two.
Hertfordshire Mavericks are the only other team to remain unbeaten, after Monday's 62-45 win at Team Northumbria.
Elsewhere, Loughborough Lightning beat Celtic Dragons 58-53 and Surrey Storm sealed a 59-36 win over Yorkshire Jets.
Storm, champions in 2015, were beaten by Team Bath on the opening weekend but have since bounced back to record two victories in a row, while Jets remain bottom of the table with three defeats from three matches.
Like Team Northumbria, Dragons are also yet to pick up a point in 2016 following their narrow defeat by Lightning.
