Veep creator and executive producer Armando Iannucci is leaving the HBO political satire after four seasons.

The cable network said the departure was due to "the challenges of maintaining his family life in London and producing a show in the states".
Iannucci tweeted: "Time for me to quit airports. I'm leaving on a high and kissing goodbye to jet-lag."
David Mandel, who worked as a writer and director on Curb Your Enthusiasm, will take over the producer's role.
Iannucci told the Radio Times in 2013 he did not envisage staying on the US Thick Of It-inspired show long-term.
"I want Veep to carry on, but there will come a point when I want to move on to something else," he said.
"There's a natural limit: if [main character Selina Meyer is] Vice President, she can only be Vice President for so long, unless it's like the Simpsons and they just don't age.
"So I can see that carrying on, but everyone knows there'll come a point when I will want to stop being away from home four months in a year."
Veep has won a collection of awards since it first began in 2012.
Its star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, has won the Emmy for best actress in a comedy series for three consecutive years, with the show nominated for the best comedy series Emmy three times.
The Writers Guild of America named it best comedy series in 2014, while Iannucci himself has been nominated for four Emmys and a Producers Guild of America award.
Last month it was announced Iannucci would adapting a new version of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield for the big screen.
The film is still in the early stages of development, but BBC Films said it would be a "fresh take" on the novel.
