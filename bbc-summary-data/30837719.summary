The Lego Movie director Phil Lord has reacted to his movie being snubbed at this year's Oscars by making his own Academy award out of...Lego.

He posted the photo on Twitter with the words: "It's okay. Made my own!"
The Lego Movie was thought to be a contender in this year's nominations as it was the highest-grossing film of 2014 at the UK box office.
It did pick up one nomination though, for original song; Everything is Awesome.
But it was thought the Warner Bros 3D movie would make the animated feature film category.
Instead it was Big Hero 6, The Boxtrolls, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Song of the Sea and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya that were nominated.
Leading the way in other categories were Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel, with nine nominations each, while The Imitation Game followed with eight and Boyhood and American Sniper picked up six.
The Oscars will be hosted by Neil Patrick Harris on Sunday 22 February in Hollywood.
