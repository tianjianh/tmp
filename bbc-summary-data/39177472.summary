Southern Health faces prosecution over Melbury Lodge roof fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust is to face prosecution over alleged failings at a mental health unit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it followed an incident at Melbury Lodge, Royal Hampshire County Hospital.
In December 2015 a patient sustained serious injuries during a fall from a low roof at the Winchester hospital run by Southern Health.
The CQC said the alleged offence by the trust was failing to provide safe care and treatment to a service user.
Melbury Lodge treats people with severe mental health problems.
The case is expected to be heard later in the year by Basingstoke Magistrates' Court.
