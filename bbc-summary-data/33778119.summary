Their dismembered remains had lain undiscovered for some time, said Pavel Astakhov.
Police are hunting for the children's father, the main suspect in the case.
Staff at the children's pre-school reportedly raised the alarm after they failed to turn up in July. The children are thought to all be aged under six.
