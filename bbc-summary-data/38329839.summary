Michael Burke, 37, from Rochdale, was earlier found guilty of eight counts of rape and another serious sexual offence over an 18-year-period.
Ms Danczuk, 33, the estranged wife of MP Simon Danczuk, waived her right to anonymity as a sexual offence victim.
Burke was cleared of nine other serious sexual offences after a three-week trial at Manchester Crown Court.
He had claimed his accusers were involved in a "conspiracy" against him.
Following sentencing, Ms Danczuk tweeted a tribute to the other two victims, describing their courage as "inspirational".
She also thanked the police and the prosecution barrister for their support during the criminal proceedings.
She added: "There are no winners in this case however my healing starts now and I am pleased there is now closure."
Ms Danczuk had previously branded her brother a "monster" who had "robbed" her of her childhood and made her suicidal.
During the trial, the mother-of-two told the court her brother abused her at the family home in Middleton, near Rochdale, from the age of six or seven - progressing to rape when she was aged 11 - until she was in her mid-teens.
Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Gilbart said: "She was your little sister, over whom you held sway.
"Your actions affected her emotionally, well into adulthood.
"You groomed her. Your little sister was your playmate and susceptible to anything you suggested. You have shown not a shred of remorse."
