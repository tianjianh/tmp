Wigan Warriors ran in seven tries without reply as they pulled off a comprehensive victory against an under-strength Leeds Rhinos side.

Michael McIlorum scored his first try of the season to put Wigan ahead and Sam Tomkins touched down soon after.
George Williams, who kicked just two conversions from six attempts, scored Wigan's third try before the break.
Oliver Gildart scored twice in quick succession before Tom Davies and Williams wrapped up a comfortable win.
Leeds, who could not finish lower than second before the Super 8s split going into the game, rarely threatened to put points on the board at the DW Stadium.
The hosts dominated the game and their attacking display saw them reach a century of Super League tries scored this term when Davies crossed late on.
Wigan move up to seventh following the win as they moved above Huddersfield after they were defeated by Hull FC.
Leeds, who were without 13 players and gave debuts to Harry Newman, Harvey Whiteley and Alex Sutcliffe, saw their four-point gap on third place cut to three points thanks to Hull's victory.
Wigan coach Shaun Wane:
"It was definitely a no-win situation. We know Leeds were busted.
"We're not patting each other on the back but I liked the manner in which we went about our business in those conditions, which were very testing.
"A 77% completion rate was good, some of our defence was very good and we scored some good tries. We've got 100 tries this season so we're doing something okay."
Leeds coach Brian McDermott:
"I can't tell you I'm happy but I'm not down either. On paper it was going to be a tough night and we had hoped the game would have been closer.
"We are disappointed by the final scoreline and disappointed we didn't score a try.
"But for large parts of the game we put up a fair amount of resistance against a very determined Wigan who were out to respond to their defeat last week.
"There were some good bits in there for us to feel proud of. Once our juniors and also to some extent our senior guys started to fatigue, we conceded some soft tries."
