[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Best from Poytnzpass in County Armagh has been awarded an OBE.
Ballymena man Mr Davis becomes an MBE.
Businessman John Cunningham, law professor Norma Dawson and Bernard McCaughey, director of rehabilitation of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, have been appointed CBEs.
World Superbike champion, Larne man Jonathan Rea, has become an MBE for services to motorcycle racing.
Television presenter Gloria Hunniford, originally from Portadown in County Armagh and now in her 70th year of show-business, has been awarded an OBE for services to cancer charities.
She became involved with charity work when she lost her daughter, Caron Keating, to breast cancer in 2004.
She said: "It feels unbelievable and fantastic and I can't begin to tell you how thrilled I am but at the same time very humbled by it all because I know many, many people all over the county do so much.
"When I lived in Northern Ireland my mum always taught us to give back, so we were always involved in charities of some sort.
"When Caron died, it became even more important and I go as far as to say that running the charity and doing charity work is part of my healing, it's something positive against the deep negativity of losing Caron.
"I know that she would be thrilled to bits with what we are doing in her name," she added.
Prof Mahendra Varma has been appointed an OBE.  The South African of Indian origin was recognised for his services to cardiology in Northern Ireland.
He has been a consultant cardiologist at the Erne Hospital in Enniskillen since 1981 and is the chairperson of the Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke.
He said he was "delighted".
"I accept it on behalf of myself and my colleagues. I am particularly indebted to the team of nurses who worked with me over more than a 30 year period.
"All the change and innovation which have been achieved would not have been possible without their unswerving commitment and support."

Guide to the honours
Belfast pastor Jack McKee has become an MBE for services to the community in the Shankill and Falls area in Belfast.
He said: "Obviously, I initially felt a sense of humility and I got quite emotional about it.
"There's obviously a lot of deserving people in our community and I am humbled to be among them.
"I would not be receiving it as a personal thing but in recognition of those who have stood with me.
"It is very much a recognition of the staff and volunteers of the City Life Centre and of New Life City Church," he added.
Michael Cecil, chairman of the Rathlin Development and Community Association, he has been awarded an OBE for services to community development on Rathlin Island.
Speaking from the Greek island of Lesbos, where he is helping refugees, he said: "When I got the letter I had mixed feelings, I do a lot of humanitarian work.
"Part of the reasons people are fleeing the Middle East is western policy, including UK policy, so it partially conflicts with what I do.
"But I don't want to politicise it, I see it as recognition of the role rather than me personally.
"I have been fortunate that an awful lot has happened in my favour in recent years with the Northern Ireland Executive recognising the importance of Rathlin and the work of a lot of people on the island."
"Hopefully it might open a few ears to me,"  he added.
Colm Davis, the principal of Tor Bank School in Castlereagh, County Down, has been appointed an OBE for services to children with special educational needs.
He said: "I am absolutely stunned, humbled, delighted and over the moon.
"The last five weeks trying to keep it a secret have been difficult.
"But all of it wouldn't have been possible without the school, the kids, the staff and the parents, they've been wonderful and very supportive.
"Fighting for those most vulnerable kids in society, those with severe and complex needs, you want the best for them and that's made my life and my commitment to my work worthwhile," he added.
The Lisburn-based businessman John Cunningham has been awarded a CBE.
In 2008, he sold most of his business, Kelman, to GE, the global industrial firm.
He kept one division, which he has built into the Camlin Group.
It designs and manufactures electronic equipment for the power and rail industries.
Mr Cunningham has been involved in campaigning for corporation tax devolution to Northern Ireland.
