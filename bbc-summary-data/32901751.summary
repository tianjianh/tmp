Football fans have been finding increasingly unusual ways of marking the build-up to their club's first ever appearance in a Scottish Cup Final.

Inverness Caledonian Thistle face Falkirk in their historic game at Hampden in Glasgow on Saturday.
Caley Jags supporters have been uploading pictures to Twitter of a dog called Harris and a puppet in their team's colours.
Another fan, clad all in blue, tweeted his support from a city roundabout.
The countdown to the Hampden final has already seen statues in the city draped with Caley Thistle scarves.
Supporters' colourful efforts come amid hopes within the team that reaching the final will attract new followers.
The average attendance at Caledonian Stadium has been 3,700 during a season when the team finished a best-ever third in the Scottish Premiership.
Manager John Hughes told BBC Sport Scotland: "We had an open day the other day for the schoolkids and it was great to see them all in Inverness strips. I never saw any Celtic or Rangers strips.
"If we can give them pride in Inverness and get all these schoolkids to go and support their local team then we are certainly playing our part."
Caley Thistle was formed as the result of a 1994 amalgamation of Caledonian and Inverness Thistle that is still opposed by some elements of their former supporters.
