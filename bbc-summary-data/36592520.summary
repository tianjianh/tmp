Michael O'Neill's side must now wait to find out if they will make the knockout stages as one of the four best third-placed sides.
The 46-year-old stuck with the same starting XI that secured a famous 2-0 win over Ukraine on Thursday.
But who were Northern Ireland's best players in Paris?

The biggest single reason Northern Ireland are still in with a shout of staying in this tournament is his series of heroic saves - many from point-blank range - to prevent disaster striking their all-important goal difference. Currently without a club, but that situation surely will not last long once he does return from France.
Germany's early dominance meant their energetic full-backs were camped in the Northern Ireland half, but he battled well despite often being overloaded.
Gave the ball away sloppily for Germany's goal and was chasing shadows at times early on, but was back to his usual steady self after the break.
Also vulnerable to runs from deep by Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, but one of those who got his body in the way of shots and crosses, time and time again.
Again out of position at left-back and had his hands full with the impressive Joshua Kimmich, who was often more winger than full-back. Far more comfortable after the break.
Tenacious in the tackle and the main attacking outlet too. Had Northern Ireland's only shot at goal in the first half and rattled the German defence with a dangerous run after the break.
Saw more of the ball in the second half, and used it well too, but his main job was to try to organise his midfield team-mates in a green wall to protect his defence.
His chances to get on the ball at attacking set-pieces were restricted to a couple of corners, one of which was headed over by Jonny Evans.
Another in a containing role who initially found it difficult to keep track of Germany's midfield runners. Made a couple of crucial blocks.
His display was dominated by his defensive duties and he never really cut loose down the left.
A willing runner but saw little of the ball, let alone a sight of goal.
Saw more of the ball in his own area while clearing corners than he did when he was up front.
Joined Lafferty up front late on in a tactical move that did not cause any Germany problems, but did help alleviate pressure.
No late heroics this time but still put in a shift during his short time on the pitch.
