Glyn Capper said other aspects of the budget will face a cut of 5.7% or £19.1m.
He told the justice committee that the department is receiving an extra £15m for legal aid pressures.
More than £12m would also be provided to pay for PSNI and other staff to take voluntary exit.
The money will come from the Northern Ireland Public Sector Transformation Fund.
Mr Capper told MLAs the PSNI was receiving an additional £32m from the Treasury for security.
He said that under the Fresh Start Deal an extra £10m was being provided to combat paramilitary activity and £12m  to help build a shared future, and that the department would bid for this funding in the future once more details are agreed.
The official said £30m earmarked for bodies dealing with the past would be held centrally until agreement is reached on how the legacy issue will be addressed.
Mr Capper told MLAs the Department of Justice has a capital budget of £58m. He said £3.9m of this budget had been earmarked for the proposed emergency services training college at Desertcreat near Cookstown in County Tyrone.
