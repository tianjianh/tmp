Ayeeshia Jane Smith murder: Review over toddler's death put back 'by months'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The results of a serious case review due to be revealed next month after the murder of a 21-month-old toddler have been put back "by several months".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kathryn Smith, 23, was jailed for life for the murder of daughter Ayeeshia Jane Smith.
Her then partner, Matthew Rigby, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for causing or allowing Ayeeshia's death.
Ayeeshia had been known to social services at Derbyshire County Council all her life.
Ayeeshia collapsed at the couple's home in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, in May 2014.
Birmingham Crown Court heard she had suffered a heart injury usually seen in people who have fallen off buildings or been in a car crash.
Chris Cook, chair of the Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board, said it had become clear the presentation of the review's findings was "going to take longer than we expected".
"I understand the need for answers as this has been an extremely distressing case but it is important we give it the time it deserves to ensure the final report is as robust and fully informed as possible," he said.
