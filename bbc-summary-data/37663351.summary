[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 0-1 Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dale Stephens' second-half strike earned Brighton victory at Wigan and took them second in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wigan created the better early chances, with Michael Jacobs' left-footed volley flying wide and Seagulls keeper David Stockdale saving Nick Powell's header.
But Brighton stood firm in defence and snatched the lead when Stephens slammed the ball home from the edge of the box.
And the visitors held on to consign Wigan to a seventh league loss this season.
The Latics remain in 23rd place despite having the better of the match and restricting the away side to very few chances.
Brighton's win takes them above Norwich, who lost at home to Preston, and keeps them within three points of leaders Newcastle.
Wigan boss Gary Caldwell:
"It's extremely frustrating. We're working extremely hard and putting in good performances.
"If we were being outplayed, I could come in here and hold my hands up and say it's unacceptable. But when I see the players giving as much as they are, playing the way they, I just want them to believe in themselves a little bit more.
"When they get those opportunities, they have to be a bit more ruthless; they have to have belief in themselves that they can go and score goals and punish teams."
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"We were far from at our best, particularly in that first half.  I thought we gave the ball away far too easily.
"But sometimes it's like that, and there's no particular reason for that. When it's like that, you have to make sure you don't concede.
"I thought we were fortunate to come in at half-time 0-0, and that gave us a chance in that second half."
