The 25-year-old, who was dropped from the GB team after failing to qualify for Rio, said she spoke out against technical director Shane Sutton to change attitudes at the organisation.
She alleged Sutton made sexist comments and told her to "go and have a baby".
British Cycling said it was "fully committed to the principles and active promotion of equality".
"We must take any such allegations seriously," the organisation added, with the review to be conducted in partnership with UK Sport.
Sutton, 58, denies any wrongdoing and says British Cycling did not renew Varnish's contract because her times had slowed over the past three years.
Varnish has been been invited to meet the equalities officer of British Cycling to discuss her concerns.
In a statement released on Tuesday she said: "I remain open to sharing my experiences with both British Cycling and/or UK Sport, and will happily engage with any investigations into the comments that Shane Sutton has made to me, and other riders."
Olympic champions Victoria Pendleton and Nicole Cooke have both criticised British Cycling following Varnish's claims, although Joanna Rowsell Shand - also an Olympic gold medallist - said on Monday that she was "surprised" by the allegations.
