Historic Yarrow Valley bridge repairs require complete closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final stages of essential repairs to a historic bridge in the Yarrow Valley will see it shut for five days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Broadmeadows Bridge on the A708 will be shut on 30 January until 3 February from 09:00 to 16:00 each day.
Scottish Borders Council said the timing of the closure - for resurfacing work - had been designed to minimise disruption.
The bridge is expected to fully reopen next month after the completion of the Â£240,000 repair programme.
The structure was damaged by a vehicle in September 2015, leading to temporary lights being used to allow traffic to continue to use it.
SBC's Gordon Edgar said: "This daytime closure of Broadmeadows Bridge for five days is unfortunately unavoidable.
"We realise it will cause some disruption but hope the Yarrow Valley community recognise that efforts have been made to minimise this, and will welcome the bridge being fully reopened in February."
