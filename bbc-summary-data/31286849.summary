Kanye West just pulled another 'Kanye moment' at the Grammys

It seemed like a weird joke, rather than history repeating itself, when Kanye West rushed the stage during Beck's Grammys acceptance speech.

He was making his thanks for winning album of the year, when suddenly Kanye popped up from his seat.
But unlike the time he stole Taylor Swift's thunder in 2009, this year he sort of disappeared.
Never fear though, in a later interview with Khloe Kardashian, Kanye confirmed he had intended to disrupt proceedings.
Seven things you may have missed from the Grammy Awards
"If they [the Grammys] want real artists to keep coming back they need to stop playing with us," he told Khloe for EOnline, while his wife Kim Kardashian looked on.
"Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyonce.
"When you keep diminishing art and disrespecting the craft, smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration and we as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day."
Kanye also ranted about how the Grammys cut short people's speeches in order to cut to an advert break.
"Y'all know what it meant when Ye walked on that stage," he said, before Khloe interrupted.
Beck won album of the year for Morning Phase, beating Beyonce to the prize. She had been expected to claim the award for her self-titled record.
She helped close the Grammy Awards, singing Take My Hand Precious Lord.
Clips of Beyonce and her husband Jay Z show the pair laughing as Kanye leaps to the stage.
Beyonce had lost out to Taylor Swift back in 2009 at the MTV Video Music Awards when Kanye took to the stage during the country singer's speech.
Photographs of Taylor and Kanye posing together at this year's Grammys seem to suggest that they have settled any differences.
Maybe in a few years' time it will be Kanye and Beck who'll be taking a selfie together.
