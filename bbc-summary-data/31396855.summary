Leicester manager Nigel Pearson says the club do not want to sack him, despite reports he was dismissed on Sunday.

The Premier League's bottom side issued a statement later that day denying they had sacked the 51-year-old.
"They don't want to get rid of me," Pearson said after Tuesday's 2-1 defeat at Arsenal. "I'm here. I had lunch with the owners today.
"My relationship remains very good, professionally and personally."
He added: "I'm more than within my rights to move on from that situation now."
Pearson said he spoke to Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur on Monday after the pair tangled on the touchline in Leicester's defeat on Saturday.
"It was a friendly chat and the lad comes out of it with an awful lot of credit in defusing the situation," said Pearson, who avoided FA punishment for the altercation.
Owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who bought Leicester in 2010, sat one seat in front of Pearson in the stands during the first half and the pair were spotted laughing at one point.
Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott gave Arsenal a 2-0 lead before Andrej Kramaric pulled a goal back.
He was denied a late equaliser by Arsenal keeper David Ospina to leave Leicester five points adrift of Premier League safety.
"I'm getting a bit tired of talking about being an unlucky side," Pearson added.
"It's all well and good talking about performances. It's all right looking on the bright side of life but ultimately it's about winning games and we continue to be under scrutiny because of the position we are in."
