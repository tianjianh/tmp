Hodgson quit after England suffered a shock defeat by Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016.
"It's not something I think I would get offered, but I would never rule it in to be honest," said Coleman, who has guided Wales into the semi-finals.
"I'm a Welshman through and through. At international football, it was only Wales and it would only ever be Wales."
Coleman, who is under contract for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, said his next job will probably be abroad, with a club competing in the Champions League.
"I quite fancy the chance of going abroad again, because I think that's my best chance of managing in the Champions League," said the former Fulham, Coventry, Real Sociedad and Larissa boss.

"When you're talking about Champions League football in the Premier League, you're talking about the top clubs.
"It's not something I think I'd get linked with, so my best chance of managing Champions League football would be abroad.
"It's an ambition of mine. But to manage another country? No, I wouldn't. That's not something I would consider."
Wales are the first home nation to reach the semi-finals of a major tournament since England at Euro 1996.
Having beaten Belgium 3-1 in Friday's quarter-final, they face Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday.
It is widely regarded as the biggest ever game for the country, but Coleman insists there is no pressure on his side.

"The bigger countries have got to get into the quarter-finals, semi-finals, final," said Coleman.
"We didn't. We had to come and perform for us.
"I thought we had a good chance of getting to the quarter-final, but I never came out and said to the players: 'That is what we can do'.
"Other countries who've been there before... the pressure is different for them."
