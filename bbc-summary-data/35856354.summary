A witness described seeing a "flash right across the sky" as the aircraft came down in a field off Burrows Lane, in the Middle Stoke area.
The condition of the pilot is not known.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it had deployed to an accident involving a light aircraft near Stoke Medway Airfield.
Representatives from UK Power Networks and fire crews also attended the scene.
Louise Holloway, who lives nearby, said: "I was outside in the garden and heard this huge bang.
"There was a massive orange flash right across the sky.
"One man ran across the field but there was no way the pilot could have got out. It's really sad."
