New Zealand's Joseph Parker remains on course to challenge Britain's Anthony Joshua for his IBF world heavyweight title after beating Russia's Alexander Dimitrenko in Auckland.

Parker, Joshua's mandatory challenger, knocked Dimitrenko down four times and won by TKO in the third round.
Joshua, 26, is scheduled to defend his title in Manchester on 26 November.
His promoter, Eddie Hearn, has said that Parker, 24, is Joshua's most likely opponent.
Saturday's fight finished in controversial fashion as Parker, who has won all 21 of his professional bouts, appeared to deliver a blow to the ribs while Dimitrenko (38-3) was on one knee.
"It was not correct. I was down on one knee and he hit me," said 34-year-old Dimitrenko. "But this is the boxing business - heavyweight boxing."
