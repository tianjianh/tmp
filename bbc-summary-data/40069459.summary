[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A woman made a 999 call at about 22:20 BST on Friday. Coastguard crews from Ballycastle and Coleraine were sent to the scene.
A rope rescue specialist was lowered down and coaxed the springer spaniel, before securing the dog in an animal rescue bag.
The dog was shaken, but was not believed to be injured.
The Coastguard's Ryan Gray said: "We would urge dog walkers to keep their dogs on a lead when out walking close to cliffs."
The rescue operation ended at 23:45 BST.
