Catherine -  also known as the Countess of Strathearn in Scotland - joined dozens of school pupils and teachers at a tennis workshop hosted by Ms Murray in Edinburgh.
Earlier she took part in a sing-along on a visit to an Edinburgh school.
The events were part of a tour by Catherine of school-based charities in the city.
The workshop was part of the Tennis on the Road project created in 2014 by Ms Murray, who is the mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie.
During the duchess' visit, teachers and pupils were taught how to coach and pass on the basics of tennis to children.
Ms Murray said Catherine's participation in the class was "fantastic for tennis and women's sport".
She added: "She said she'd love to come back and do some more."
Earlier in the day, Catherine visited St Catherine's Primary where she joined an assembly.
The school is one of 28 in Scotland where counsellors from children's mental health charity Place2Be support pupils having difficulties in some of the most disadvantaged areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Pupils presented her with a quaich, a Scottish toasting cup, after she sang along to the children's song Welcome Everybody.
The duchess, who is the charity's patron, told pupils: "I think everybody should start their morning like that. Have a wonderful day."
The duchess, who was carrying out her first solo set of official engagements north of the border, also travelled across the city to Wester Hailes Education Centre to see work being carried out by The Art Room.
The charity, of which she is patron, set up its first Scottish studio at the school in 2014 and works with children to increase their self-esteem, self-confidence and independence through art.
She was greeted by cheering pupils in the school playground before attending an art session.
Pupils involved in the project showed her the work they were producing.
Project director Juli Beattie said she was delighted to be able to show the duchess the charity's first Scottish base.
She added: "Our presence in Edinburgh represents a new phase in our growth.
"The needs of the local community are imperative and our work relies on our partner schools having the vision to host an art-room studio offering early intervention to the children and young people."
