Two heat lamps and about Â£120 in coins were also taken after the Perth Pet Centre in St Catherine's retail park was broken into.
The theft took place between 16:30 on Thursday and 11:30 the following day.
The owners of the pet centre have offered a reward for the safe return of the creatures and conviction of those responsible for the thefts.
A post on the centre's Facebook page said: "Despite being closed for business since the end of January we were broken into again.
"A reward will be paid for the recovery of our property and the conviction of the culprits."
