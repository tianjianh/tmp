Norwich City 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City were held to a goalless draw by Sheffield Wednesday in their first home match of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Neil's side, who began life back in the Championship with a 4-1 win at Blackburn, almost led before the break when Sam Hutchinson struck his own bar.
But the Owls edged the second period, with Gary Hooper well denied by substitute goalkeeper Michael McGovern.
Wednesday were without striker Fernando Forestieri, who refused to play amidst recent transfer speculation.
The 26-year-old striker has been linked with a move to Championship rivals Derby County, having scored 15 times last season.
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal said after the match the Italian had "caused a problem to himself", and that chairman Dejphon Chansiri had confirmed to him that no player was for sale.
Despite enjoying large spells of possession after half-time, last season's losing play-off finalists failed to create many clear-cut opportunities at Carrow Road.
Both sides remain unbeaten in the league after two matches.
