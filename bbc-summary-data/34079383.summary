Newport County fans need to raise £225,000 by the end of next month if they are to own the club, its interim chairman has said.

Newport County Supporters Trust wants to acquire the club from the current owner, Les Scadding.
Interim chairman Tony Pring said fans had been asked to pledge money at a meeting on Thursday night.
The body advising the trust, Supporters Direct, has set the "very tight" but "necessary" deadline.
James Mathie, from Supporters Direct, said: "It is a very tight timescale but actually with the season started, people want clarity, is this going to happen or not.
"So, we need to stretch people, we need to push people and that's why we've set a deadline for the end of September."
BBC Wales understands the six-figure sum will go towards paying off debts and creditors, and providing working capital for the season.
There are currently 1,200 members of the trust but Supporters Direct believe the figure could rise to about 4,000.
Mr Mathie added: "We expect and hope some individuals will be able to put in significant amounts, which will make it easier for the community as a whole."
Earlier this week the club's manager, Terry Butcher, said he would be buying shares in the club.
