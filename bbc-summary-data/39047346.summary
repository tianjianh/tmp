Hanno Dirksen: Wing signs new Ospreys deal until 2019

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hanno Dirksen has signed a new two-year contract with Ospreys which will keep the wing at Liberty Stadium until 2019.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dirksen, 25, follows Sam Davies, Justin Tipuric, Dan Baker and Dan Lydiate in committing his future to the region.
The South-African born wing made his debut in November 2009 and has scored 32 tries for Ospreys in 105 appearances.
"If you're in Wales, the Ospreys are the team to play for," said Dirksen.
"It didn't take much thinking about to be honest, when the offer came I knew what I wanted to do. I've been in Swansea for seven years now and it's my home, I have a wife and child born here, so why would I want to go anywhere else."
