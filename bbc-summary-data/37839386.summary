FC Copenhagen 0-0 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League champions Leicester edged closer to the Champions League knockout stages thanks to a goalless draw at FC Copenhagen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The best chance of a lacklustre match came in the 90th minute as Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel pushed away Andreas Cornelius's header.
The closest the visitors came to scoring was when winger Jeffrey Schlupp's deflected shot dribbled into the hands of keeper Robin Olsen.
Claudio Ranieri's Leicester, who won their opening three Group G games, need only a point from their final two matches to reach the last 16.
They have not conceded a goal in four games and remain top of the group, three points ahead of Porto.
Leicester had Schmeichel to thank for a late save to deny Cornelius, just as he did at home two weeks ago.
The Dane kept his concentration by springing to his right to claw away the ex-Cardiff striker's flicked header from Kasper Kusk's cross.
Before the match, Ranieri said his side were close to "achieving something special" in Europe's elite club competition.
History is on their side as all the previous 64 teams that had won their opening three games all progressed to the knockout stages.
The draw means they will finish, at worst, third in the group, securing at least a place in the Europa League.
Copenhagen have not lost at home in all competitions since August 2015, a run that now stands at 29 games.
England striker Jamie Vardy scored 24 league goals in a stunning campaign last season, but has managed only three this term in all competitions.
He has not netted for club or country in 12 games stretching back to 10 September.
With regular partner Shinji Okazaki on the bench, Vardy was deployed as a lone frontman against Copenhagen, a role which did not help his prospects of ending his goal drought.
He had only one shot in the match and his 37 touches of the ball were the second fewest of any player in the Leicester starting XI.
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "I am happy. The first 20 minutes was not so good but the second half was much better.
"Kasper Schmeichel is a great keeper and we are very, very, happy. I was expecting this kind of match. I wanted to do more on the counter-attack. We had a chance to score but a draw is OK.
"It is our first time in the Champions League. We want to be very, very attentive until the end."
Leicester host West Brom in the Premier League on Sunday (16:40 GMT), having won only one of their previous four games.
