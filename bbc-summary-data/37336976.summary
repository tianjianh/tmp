One hundred years on from the birth of the popular children's author, the website revealed Dahl's top 10 books in both digital and print format.
The BFG - recently adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg - was second, followed by George's Marvellous Medicine.
Matilda and James and the Giant Peach rounded out the top five.
Dahl published his first children's book more than 70 years ago - yet he still ranks in the top five best-selling children's authors on Amazon's UK site.
Dahl appeared in the top five alongside the modern day best-sellers, Julia Donaldson, JK Rowling, Jeff Kinney and David Walliams.
Dan Mucha, books director for Amazon.co.uk, said: "Having grown up with Roald Dahl's books and seeing my children read them today, I understand firsthand the joy and enduring quality of his stories.
"The centenary of his birth marks a big moment in the literary calendar and we have seen his books continue to sell incredibly well in both print and on our Kindle store.
"We expect that he will remain one of the top children's authors for years to come."
Sales of the titles were tracked over a five-year period.
