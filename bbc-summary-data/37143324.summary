Police said the 18-year-old woman was raped in the toilets of Moo Moo nightclub in Tunbridge Wells in the early hours of Friday.
The attack happened between 01:30 BST and 02:03 at the Newton Road club, which held the party on A-level results day.
Officers seized CCTV from the nightclub as part of their enquiries.
The attacker is described as a white man with brown hair. He was wearing dark jeans and a short-sleeve T-shirt.
Moo Moo's Facebook page billed the event, from 21:30 to 03:00, as an "adventure as we go Pokemon mental to celebrate everyone's A-Level results when our three floors become three different Indigo League Locations."
