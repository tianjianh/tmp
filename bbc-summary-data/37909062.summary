Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust out of special measures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust that was warned over its high mortality rates and finances has been taken out of special measures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was ordered to improve in 2013 and 2015 over higher than expected death rates.
A Care Quality Commission (CQC) report said while the trust still requires improvement it is now rated as good for safety.
The trust's chief executive said he was "immensely proud" of his staff.

Peter Herring said while there was much to celebrate in the report there was "more to be done" before the trust could be rated outstanding.
In 2015, the CQC said the trust, which runs Kings Mill Hospital, Newark Hospital and Mansfield Community Hospital, had almost double the national average rate of deaths from the bloodstream infection sepsis.
However, the latest report said it was now among the best performing in the country for sepsis management and improving mortality rates.
In 2014, it was revealed the trust was spending Â£3.56m a month - 16% of its budget - on a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project.
The agreement was signed in 2005 to build King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield.
The announcement led to MP Chris Leslie, former Labour shadow chancellor, calling for the government to "wipe out" the trust's deficit.
Fresh scrutiny of the country's hospitals followed the scandal at Stafford hospital when data showed there were between 400 and 1,200 more deaths than expected.
Those trusts with unusually high death rates, including Sherwood Forest Hospitals, were put into "special measures".
It has been a long three years of extra scrutiny and uncertainty over the future to change that ranking.
Death rates at the trust are now below the England average. Sepsis care is seen as outstanding and A&E waiting times are now among the best in the country.
But there are still challenges. There's a heavy reliance on agency nurses and there are unfilled doctor posts.
Whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure - hospital staff have been through the mill.
