Eileen Garas, of Hampers Lane, Storrington, was struck by a Honda outside the Millford Grange housing development in the village on Saturday.
She died of her injuries at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.
Her son Anthony said he "loved her dearly" and she would be "missed by all who knew her".
Mrs Garas, who was born in Staffordshire, moved to Sussex from London in 1973, shortly before the death of her husband.
She was well known in Storrington and enjoyed being in her "beloved garden, tending the flowers and feeding the birds", according to Mr Garas.
"We are deeply shocked and saddened by our sudden loss."
The rider of the motorbike, a 67-year-old man from Worthing, suffered minor injuries in the crash.
