Paramedics criticise East of England Ambulance Service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ambulance management in the east of England have been told they are running a "flimsy excuse for a service" by their own paramedics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The complaints were raised at a board meeting of the East of England Ambulance Service held in Norwich.
Essex paramedic Ian Harvey told how a pregnant woman was recently taken to hospital by car because an ambulance was unavailable.
The ambulance service said it would be considering the concerns raised.
Mr Harvey, and fellow Essex paramedic David Taylor, claimed there was "widespread bullying of workers" and that managers "don't care about frontline staff".
Mr Harvey said waits for a fully-equipped ambulance - rather than a rapid response vehicle - could vary between two minutes and two hours.
Mr Harvey said: "This is a service which impacts on the public greatly, it is life or death."
Responding to concerns, board chairman Paul Remington, said: "It's vital to have a discussion, however uncomfortable"
A spokesman for the ambulance service said the two Essex paramedics had been "asked to share their concerns and listen to how the trust is going forward in the future".
