McLaughlin made 200 appearances for the Cod Army after joining the League One club from Shrewsbury in July 2012.
The Northern Ireland international featured in 42 games in all competitions last season.
"He's a solid, reliable right-back, who is first and foremost a very good defender," Millwall manager Neil Harris told the club website.
The 25-year-old has won 26 caps for Northern Ireland, with his only goal to date coming in the 4-0 World Cup qualifier win over Azerbaijan in Belfast in November.
McLaughlin made his debut as a substitute against Italy in October 2011 and was part of manager Michael O'Neill's squad at the Euro 2016 finals in France.
