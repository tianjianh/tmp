Evelyn Nolan, who had a complex seizure disorder, was receiving palliative care at University Hospital Southampton.
Hospital staff specially adapted a ventilator to allow Evelyn to go into the water with her parents.
Her mother, Debbie Vavangas, said: "We knew it was a huge ask but they made it happen for us."
"The minute we put her in the water her whole body relaxed and she had a smile on her face," Ms Vavangas said.
"It was truly, truly magical.
"We wanted to give her a final gift, the team at the hospital made all of that possible."
Evelyn, who had her first seizures at three months old, was diagnosed with a rare chromosomal disorder.
The main impact of the condition meant she was profoundly epileptic.
Dr Michael Griksaitis, paediatric intensive care consultant at the hospital, said: "Evelyn was a very brave young girl who so many of our staff were extremely fond of.
"To have given Evelyn and her family such a significant memory at such a difficult time means a great deal to everyone involved."
She died on 19 August two days after the swim.
