The German side allowed the 44-year-old speak to the Swans, who are bottom of the Premier League.
Clement was interviewed by the club before Bob Bradley was appointed as their manager in October.
He is set to be Swansea's third manager of the season and it is likely he will be at Selhurst Park for their game against Crystal Palace on Tuesday.
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid assistant manager was in charge of Derby County for eight months before he was sacked by the club in February of 2016.
After Bradley was sacked following a spell of seven defeats in 11 games, Clement emerged as the frontrunner to be Swansea's next manager
Former Manchester United assistant Ryan Giggs, Wales boss Chris Coleman and former Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett were also linked with the job.
The Swans are four points adrift at the bottom of the table and have lost their last four games, including Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Bournemouth.
