Premier League Darts: Dave Chisnall thrashes Phil Taylor in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dave Chisnall kept his slim hopes of making next month's Premier League play-offs alive with two impressive wins in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The St Helens thrower beat Adrian Lewis 7-3 before thumping six-time champion Phil Taylor 7-2.
World number six Chisnall is now two points from the top-four spot he needs to reach London's O2 Arena on 18 May.
Michael van Gerwen remains two points clear at the top after beating fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld 7-2.
Five-time world champion Van Barneveld, who celebrated his 50th birthday on Thursday, looked out of sorts and drops to fifth in a tight table.
Second-placed Peter Wright kept the pressure on pacesetter Van Gerwen with a comfortable victory over James Wade, who slipped to the bottom of the table.
Before his loss to Chisnall, 16-time world champion Taylor won seven straight legs to beat Scot Gary Anderson 7-4 to remain in the hunt for a play-off spot in his final season before retirement.
