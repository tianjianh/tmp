Jerome Binnom-Williams: Crystal Palace left-back joins Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough United have signed Crystal Palace left-back Jerome Binnom-Williams for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old, whose two appearances for Palace's first team came in the League Cup, has moved to the League One side on a two-year contract.
Binnom-Williams had four loan spells away from Palace, spending the first half of last season at Burton and the second part at Leyton Orient.
He comes in after Posh missed out on Leicester left-back Callum Elder.
Elder made 21 appearances for Posh on loan last season, but he has joined Championship side Brentford on a season-long loan deal.
