A friend of the boy, who has not yet been officially named, said: "He was trying to swim to an island and got into trouble.
"The two boys he was with tried to save him, but there was nothing they could do."
Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, which led the operation, said the boy's body was found "after an extensive bankside and water search".
They issued a warning to people thinking about swimming in open water.
"Now that the weather is so warm it's very tempting to cool off with a swim," Chief Fire Officer Darryl Keen said.
"However, even the strongest swimmer can get into difficulties and we would advise people to think carefully before swimming in unsupervised areas and look out for signs and advice about the specific dangers at the location where you are swimming."
