He said he has spoken to the country's PM Jens Stoltenberg to express the UK's condolences and offered assistance in tracking down the perpetrators.
A bombing in Oslo severely damaged government offices and a gunman is said to have opened fire at a youth camp.
Diplomats say they are checking whether any British nationals are affected.
Around 250,000 British tourists visit Norway every year, the Foreign Office says on the Norway travel advice section of its website.
And according to the UK Embassy in Oslo, there are also between 25,000 and 30,000 Britons resident in the country.
Mr Cameron said: "My thoughts are with the wounded and those who have lost friends and family, and I know everyone in Britain will feel the same.
"These attacks are a stark reminder of the threat we all face from terrorism.
"I have called Prime Minister Stoltenberg this evening to express my sincere condolences and to let him know that our thoughts are with the Norwegian people at this tragic time.
"I have offered Britain's help, including through our close intelligence cooperation."
The UK's ambassador to Norway, Jane Owen, told the BBC: "We are in touch with the Norwegian government at all levels  and also with the police who are trying to work very hard to establish what has happened.
"We are also in very close touch with hospitals and other services to try and establish whether there are any British citizens affected we can help."
She added it was believed to have been the first attack of its kind in the country but said: "The Oslo government, however, has been aware for a long time of the potential danger and threat and have been working to combat it. And we indeed have been working very closely with them on the terrorism agenda."
At least seven people were killed in the bombing and 10 more are known to have died at the camp for young members of the Labour Party in Utoeya, an island outside the capital.
Police arrested the suspected gunman at the camp and the government have confirmed that he is Norwegian. No group has said it carried out the two attacks but police say they are linked.
Foreign Secretary William Hague said Britain stood "shoulder-to-shoulder with Norway and all our international allies" after the "horrific" attack.
"Our embassy stands ready to provide assistance to any British nationals who may have been caught up in the attack."
Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney also sent a message of condolence to Norway.
He said: "I have spoken with David Windmill, the honorary consul general, this afternoon and conveyed on behalf of the Scottish government our deepest sympathy and condolences."
