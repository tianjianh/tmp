Ashley McLaughlin, 25, attacked Lynda Christie, also 25, at the victim's flat in Glasgow's Castlemilk area.
Following the attack, in May last year, Ms Christie suffered a punctured lung and required more than 20 stitches.
At the High Court in Glasgow, McLaughlin was jailed after she pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting Ms Christie to the danger of her life.
Jailing her, judge Lord Boyd told McLaughlin: "During the assault you left and returned with a large knife and stabbed her causing her lung to collapse.
"You also inflicted facial wounds which may require plastic surgery. I take into account you are expecting a child and are remorseful and this was out of character.
"However, you went and armed yourself with a knife and used it in a brutal manner and inflicted life-threatening injuries."
Lord Boyd told McLaughlin that but for her early plea he would have jailed her for five years.
The court heard that the incident took place after Ms Christie had allegedly "bad-mouthed" McLaughlin's friend, Caroline Broadfoot, one week earlier.
A number of people were at the flat when a fight broke out between Ms Christie and Broadfoot.
Ms Christie was initially hit by Broadfoot and then McLaughlin joined in.
As the victim was punched and kicked, she pleaded for help and asked the pair to stop.
McLaughlin then grabbed a knife and stabbed Ms Christie who screamed: "What are you doing? You know I have kids."
Two men - who could see from outside what was happening - burst into the flat and yelled "police" in a bid to stop the attack.
McLaughlin and Broadfoot then fled the blood-splattered property, but were later held by police.
Broadfoot, 37, of the city's Tollcross area, admitted assaulting Ms Christie to her injury.
She was given a two-year community payback order and walked free from court.
