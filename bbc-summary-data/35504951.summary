Flying Scotsman's mainline return after £4.2m revamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the world's most famous locomotives has returned to the West Coast mainline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flying Scotsman is travelling from Carnforth on the West Coast Main Line following a £4.2m restoration project, which has taken 10 years.
The engine, which was retired from service in 1963, has been restored for York's National Railway Museum by Riley and Son Ltd, based in Bury.
Low-speed tests have taken place along the East Lancashire Railway.
The locomotive is in its black undercoat and sporting wartime numbers.
It will be painted in its new green livery next week after the test run.
Jim Lowe, head of operations at the National Railway Museum in York, said: "We have all been looking forward to the day when Flying Scotsman is once again running on Britain's tracks."
The train is travelling from Carnforth and into Carlisle with a return journey through Appleby and across the Ribblehead Viaduct to Farrington.
