The free event is being held in Duns on 16 and 17 May.
A line-up of classic Formula One, touring and sports cars in which Jim Clark raced in 1965 will also be on the show over the weekend.
Organisers also hope it will raise awareness of plans for a new Jim Clark Museum by 2018.
The Jim Clark Weekend will mark the 50th anniversary of his most successful season on the track.
In 1965 he won his second F1 world championship, the Indianapolis 500, the Formular 2 Championship and the Tasman Series.
He remains the only driver ever to claim both the F1 and Indy 500 titles in the same year.
Alan Morgan, chairman of Club Lotus, which is organising the event, said: "By demonstrating the cars he drove during that year we'll be bringing the sight and sound of these fabulous racing cars to Duns."
Earlier this year Scottish Borders Council agreed to give Â£500,000 in funding to a project to expand and improve the Jim Clark Museum.
Sir Jackie Stewart said: "Jim, who was a great friend, projected Scotland and the Borders of Scotland in a dignified fashion around the world, during his motor racing career.
"I am also very proud to be honorary president of the Jim Clark Trust and a patron of this justifiably important statement to be made to attract people to Duns and the Border region, to celebrate the life of Jim Clark. I am delighted to attend this special Jim Clark Weekend."
