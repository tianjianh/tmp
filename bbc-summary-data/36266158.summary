Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies says there is no crisis in the domestic game despite disappointing results by the four Pro12 regions.

Davies says there will be a review after Scarlets, Ospreys, Blues and Dragons all failed to make the play-offs and only the Scarlets qualified for the European Champions Cup.
The former Wales captain advocates a calm but "robust" response.
"It's not crisis time at all, it's time for some level heads," said Davies.
"[We must] review what's good and what's not so good."
Scarlets finished as Wales' top team in fifth place in the final Pro12 table, with Blues seventh, Ospreys eighth and Dragons 10th.
For the first time Wales will have only one team - Scarlets - in the top-flight European tournament next season.
Davies said the regions will review their own campaigns before meeting with the Wales national coach Warren Gatland and his team plus WRU head of rugby Geraint John.
He said that meeting would "robustly review what happened, where the weaknesses are, where the shortfalls are and how we can start to review [and] repair what has happened this year."
Davies added: "It's a collective responsibility I think, yes the Union has to provide some leadership in all of this and we're trying to do that.
"We've sat down with colleagues in the regions over the past couple of weeks not just looking at how we performed this year, but have we got the right people, the right talent in all the positions.
"I'm not going to speculate on a position otherwise it will be a headline - but in terms of have we got the right personnel in place throughout the game.
"We have to review what's good - and there have been some good aspects - and we have to be serious.
"And I think that's the first time that has been done, that the regions sit down with the national coach to get their perspective.
"It's a two-way process and I'm not saying one is right or one is wrong, but we're a small nation and we have to work together."
