George "Tornado" Smith, who grew up at The White Hart at Boxford, performed the stunt for 30 years - even riding with his pet lioness, Briton.
A "Wall of Death" has been set up at the pub this weekend in honour of Smith and as part of a charity festival.
One of the sponsors described the event as a "great occasion" and "part of the village's history".
The attraction, which features motorcyclists riding around a vertical wall, was set up by Smith at the Kursaal amusement park in Southend-on-Sea.
The lioness became part of his act, riding with him on the handlebars, before moving to a sidecar as she got larger.
Out of season, Smith, who died in 1971, would return to Boxford and set up his attraction there.
Briton is said to buried under the pub car park.
Lawrence Motts, one of three sponsors of the event, said the "Wall of Death" event was a "great occasion" and "part of the village's history".
He said: "This guy used to ride with a lion on his handlebars, which seems absolutely bonkers, and he would actually walk around with this lion on a lead in the village."
At Boxford the Wall of Death will be performed by Ken Fox, who recently trained motorcyclist Guy Martin to break the speed record for the stunt on television.
Proceeds will go towards local charity The Smile of Arran Trust, set up in memory of 13-year-old Arran Tosh, who died in 2014, five days after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.
