Janice De'Botte, 57, died in hospital six days after she was hit by a van at a pedestrian crossing in West Didsbury.
Her friend, aged 70, who was also hit remains in a serious but stable condition.
Mrs De'Botte's family described her as a "loving mum, partner, nana, sister, auntie and cousin" with many friends.
They added: "Janice, known to some of her work colleagues as Angela, has lived and worked in and around the West Didsbury area all of her life.
"She held two jobs as a cleaner at Wythenshawe Hospital and also at a local care home.
"Everything Janice did was for her family and she was extremely proud of them all and everything they had achieved.
"Our thoughts remain with Patricia, Janice's friend who was with her at the time.
"We wish her well and pray that she makes a full recovery from her injuries."
The family also thanked the staff at Wythenshawe Hospital, and expressed gratitude for the support they had received from friends and the wider community.
Witnesses reported seeing a white Vauxhall Vivaro hit the women, before stopping briefly and driving away.
Two men were later arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision, and have been released on bail.
