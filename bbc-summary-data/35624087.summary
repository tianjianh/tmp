Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg finished sixth to earn a place in the women's synchronised 3m springboard.
Georgia Ward secured an individual 10m platform berth by reaching Sunday's semi-finals.
British Diving now have eight Olympic places, with four more on offer this week.
The team claimed five berths through impressive results at last summer's World Championships in Russia, whilst Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow attained synchronised 10m platform Olympic qualification with bronze on Friday.

Commonwealth champions Gallantree and Blagg were on course to finish on the World Cup podium themselves, but slipped down the rankings after a poor fifth and final routine.
Their score of 299.28 was still enough for an Olympic place though, as China (339.60) took gold, Canada (312.27) silver and Australia (307.50) bronze.
Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow impressed in their international debut together - qualifying for the Sunday's synchronised 10m platform final with the fifth-highest score.
The pair only began training together late last year, with Daley having been initially reluctant to contest the synchronised 10m event if there was not a strong chance of challenging for an Olympic medal. That could still be a difficult challenge should the pair reach the Games.
They will need to finish in the top four - out of nations who have not already qualified for Rio 2016 - in order to guarantee an Olympic place for GB.
