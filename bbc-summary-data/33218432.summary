Scottish builders' confidence 'at seven-year high'

Confidence within the construction industry is at its highest level in at least seven years, according to an industry survey.

The Scottish Building Federation found confidence had been boosted by a supply of new work and the availability of training grants for new apprentices.
Its latest quarterly monitor recorded a record peak since its launch in 2008.
It was the eighth consecutive quarter that building employers' confidence had been rated positive overall.
Scottish Building Federation managing director Vaughan Hart said: "It's encouraging that employers' confidence about their future prospects is continuing to rise.
"The results are particularly striking against the backdrop of recent reports that overall business confidence in Scotland has declined due to falling profits.
"In construction, there can be no doubt that margins remain very tight but there is at least a supply of new work out there now, which certainly wasn't the case two years ago.
"As we've said before, certain sectors of the industry are faring better than others and we're concerned that industry employment is lagging significantly behind output."
Meanwhile, a separate survey has suggested that small business confidence is also growing.
But the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) found firms were worried about the availability of staff.
About one in three businesses reported that staff skills were a potential barrier to the growth of their business, FSB said.
However, the falling price of fuel and utilities eased cost pressures on small firms, which reported increased revenues, profits and growing wages.
FSB Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: "Scottish small business confidence is picking up but remains behind the level recorded a year ago.
"And, while the long term trend looks good, decision-makers need to reinforce their links with local small enterprise if they really want to understand how their community, local economy and the country, ticks."
