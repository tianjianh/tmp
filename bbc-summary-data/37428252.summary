The pair retained their individual dressage gold at August's Rio Games.
Dujardin - who revealed in 2015 that Valegro would be retired after Rio 2016 - told BBC Points West last month: "I owe it to him to finish at the top.
"I want everyone to remember him as the horse he is - a hero. What he has done for the sport is truly inspirational."
The meeting at Olympia will take place from 13 to 19 December.
