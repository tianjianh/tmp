The soap star confirmed her living situation on Twitter, saying that she's had a tough year and had "lost" her home.
"I have the love of my kids and a few good friends," she said.
She last appeared in the BBC One soap in 2010, playing the role of Sam Mitchell.
Ms Westbrook says she spoke out because someone was trying to sell a story about it to a magazine.
The 41-year-old first appeared on Albert Square in 1990 but left in 1996. She had a brief second stint in the show between 1999 and 2000.
In 2002, she was replaced in the role by another actress, Kim Medcalf, who left EastEnders in 2005. Ms Westbrook then returned to the role in 2009.
Ms Westbrook has previously dealt with cocaine addiction.
She was one of the contestants in I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2003 but left the competition because she feared it was interfering with her recovery.
"I was living hour to hour in a world of hurt and thought, 'I've got to go to an AA meeting and centre myself'," she said in a later interview.
