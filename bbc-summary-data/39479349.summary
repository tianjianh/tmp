Ian Paterson: Cancer surgeon says patient notes went 'missing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A breast cancer surgeon accused of carrying out unnecessary operations told a jury that patient notes had "gone missing".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Paterson denied accusations that he did not make notes and also said the lack of records was "frustrating".
Mr Paterson, 59, is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court and denies 20 counts of wounding with intent.
The procedures relate to nine women and one man and were carried out between 1997 and 2011.
Giving evidence Mr Paterson, of Castle Mill Lane, Ashley, Altrincham, told how copies of clinical meetings, attended by other medical experts, to discuss a second opinion for patients would be shredded.

In earlier evidence he had described the lack of records of what were known as MDT (multi-disciplinary team) meetings as "frustrating".
Under cross examination by Julian Christopher QC, prosecuting, the surgeon described a process where notes would be ripped up or shredded.
He described how a breast cancer nurse would also take notes in "a series of diaries".
But Mr Paterson then added: "It's also interesting that those seem to have gone missing."
Asked what would have been in those diaries, the surgeon replied: "Find the diaries and I'll show you."
Asked by Mr Christopher if the reason no MDT notes could be found was because he had never made any, the surgeon replied: "That's not true."
Jurors have previously heard claims he carried out completely unnecessary operations for "obscure motives" which may have included a desire to "earn extra money".
The jury has heard prosecution expert evidence from two consultants, who claimed a different approach could have been adopted to Mr Paterson's alleged victims.
The surgeon was formerly employed by Heart of England NHS Trust and also practised at Spire Healthcare.
