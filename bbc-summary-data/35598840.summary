[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three police forces in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have failed to adequately investigate crime and protect vulnerable people, a report said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Humberside, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire forces have been told to improve by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).
It comes after a review of effective policing levels in England and Wales.
The forces have said they will make improvements.
HMIC inspector Zoe Billingham said the constabularies were good at tackling serious and organised crime, but they each got a "requires improvement" rating overall.
All three forces were marked down for failing to protect vulnerable people, manage offenders and investigate crime effectively.
Humberside Police was also told to improve the way it prevents crime and anti-social behaviour. This comes after it was rated "inadequate" at keeping people safe and reducing crime, by the HMIC in October.
The force said "significant progress" had been made to tackle some of the issues raised.
Deputy Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: "We now answer calls from the public faster, deal with their issues better, have improved the way we investigate crime and put resources where, and when, they are most needed.
"We are on the right track, heading in the right direction and will continue to make every effort to improve."
The report said South Yorkshire Police has developed a training and awareness programme to help protect vulnerable people but said its effectiveness needed evaluating.
Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: "Some aspects of our response to vulnerable people need further work, but HMIC found [the force] has an effective response to victims of child sexual exploitation, repeat vulnerable victims and missing children."
Lincolnshire Police said areas needing improvement would be "addressed and acted upon."
Forces in West and North Yorkshire were rated "good" by the HMIC.
