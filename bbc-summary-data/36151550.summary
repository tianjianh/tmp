The sport has changed a lot since 1977 - the game itself, its characters, and its fashion.
Snooker got its big break during the 1970s and 1980s, with the advent of colour television and increased media exposure boosting its popularity, and making superstars of the era's leading players.
iWonder: Why did snooker get its big break in the 80s?
Into the 1990s, when the prize every snooker fan wanted was a John Virgo waistcoat.
While Big Break entertained millions of television viewers on Saturday evenings, Stephen Hendry became the sport's dominant force and many of snooker's colourful characters from the 1980s drifted out of the game's elite.
One snooker star has shone brighter than most since the turn of the century - Ronnie O'Sullivan. While his choice of playing attire has rarely changed, his hair certainly has.
And it is not just "The Rocket" who has experimented with his hairstyle over the years.
The snooker fashion parade has even continued during this year's championship, with Alan McManus sporting a tartan trouser and waistcoat combination during his semi-final against Ding Junhui.
Snooker is now a global sport, with ranking events staged all over the world and players competing for huge prizes - the winner of the 2016 World Championship will take home Â£330,000.
The game appears to be as popular as it ever has been - and there is still room for the fashion-conscious to strut their stuff.
