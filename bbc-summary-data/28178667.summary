Arthur Jones, 73, has not been seen since 19 June, two days after arriving on the island for a walking holiday.
Phil Benbow, chair of the North Wales Mountain Rescue Association, and two police officers are joining the hunt.
A fundraising event was held last night in Denbigh to raise funds for Mr Jones's family who are also in Crete.
They decided to fly out a week ago to search for him.
Mr Jones had sent them a postcard two days into his stay to saying he planned a walking trip.
However, his equipment was found still in his room in Chania.
North Wales Police Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard confirmed the police force will be sending officers with experience of missing person inquiries and searches to the island.
Det Ch Insp Gareth Evans, of St Asaph CID, and missing person co-ordinator Mark Owen are to meet up with foreign office officials and the head of the Chania police.
They will be accompanied by Mr Benbow, who chairs an association of 12 search and rescue teams, with around 400 experts in searching for people lost in hostile terrain and conditions.
He is also secretary of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team which operates on Snowdon and surrounding mountains.
The three men are due to fly out on Sunday.
Former soldier Mr Jones is described as 5'6" tall, medium build with short grey hair and a grey moustache.
A Facebook campaign to Find Arthur has attracted support from over 3,000 people.
On Saturday evening, residents in Denbigh held an event at the town's Plas Pigot pub to raise money for his family towards their costs in helping with the search.
His son Jeff from Prestatyn and other family members and friends on Crete have handed out 1,000 leaflets on the island, hoping British tourists will remember bumping into the pensioner.
They are concerned "foul play" may be to blame for his disappearance
