Concerns had been raised by the Pakistan Cricket Board over threats from Hindu extremists, who attacked the offices of Indian cricket's governing body last year.
However, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Thursday that the team had been cleared to play in March and April.
"I am pleased that our government has given its consent," said Shaharyar.
"As a duty of care, we have asked [world cricket governing body] the ICC to put in place special arrangements for the Pakistan cricket team while in India."
India and Pakistan have not played a Test series since 2007 due to fallout from the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008, blamed on militants based across the border.
Since 2009, Pakistan have played their 'home' Test series in the UAE after a terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan team led to a boycott on tours to the country.
The World T20 runs from 8 March to 3 April.
Pakistan are scheduled to play a qualifier team on 16 March in Kolkata, then hosts India on 19 March in Dharamsala.
