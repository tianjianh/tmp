The 24-year-old centre-back was told he would be released at the start of the month after making 69 appearances over five years at Craven Cottage.
Burn started his career at Darlington and also had loan stints at Yeovil and Birmingham City.
"He is a powerful defender, but he likes to play as well," boss Gary Caldwell told the club website.
He joins Stephen Warnock and Alex Gilbey as new signings so far this summer for the Latics, who won the League One title in 2015-16.
