If approved, the £15m development of the Jersey company's King Street store and creation of a New Street store could be completed by 2017.
The current store, which covers 17,000 sq ft (1,600 sq m), is due to remain open during the work.
Neville Moore, managing director of the firm which employs 200 people, described it as "a very exciting time".
He said agreement had been reached with a leading UK retailer to occupy the development in New Street.
Daphne East, town centre manager, said: "[When] the UK is still seeing a decline in investment... it is heartening to know that Jersey, and St Helier in particular, can still attract development on this scale.
"It is also exciting to see a company that has traded on our high street for the last 200 years making this kind of commitment to the future of retail in Jersey."
The company was founded in 1810 by Abraham de Gruchy and his wife Marie Le Brocq with the original shop located near to St Peter's Church.
