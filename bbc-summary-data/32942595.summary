[SN]TITLE[SN]
Disbanded squadron at RAF Cosford in Shropshire to re-form

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recruitment is under way for the re-formation of a disbanded squadron at RAF Cosford in Shropshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Named 605 Squadron, it will be an auxiliary unit of 120 part-time and 14 full-time volunteer reserve posts.
The 605 Squadron was originally formed at Castle Bromwich in 1926 and was finally disbanded in 1957.
The squadron, expected to provide general support to other RAF units, will take up to four years before it is fully operational.
The formation is part of the Ministry of Defence's plan to create a new, fully integrated reserve force for operations in the UK or overseas.
Wing Cdr Mike Sherburn said: "Having been mobilised on operations as a reservist myself, I appreciate how juggling civilian commitments with the RAF Reserves takes dedication, however, the rewards are worth it."
RAF Cosford is currently home to a number of units, including the Defence School of Aeronautical Engineering and the Defence School of Photography.
