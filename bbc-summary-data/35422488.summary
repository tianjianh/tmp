[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England women will not be content with a repeat of last year's fourth-place finish in this year's Six Nations, says captain Sarah Hunter.

England went into last year's event as world champions but, after Gary Street's departure as head coach and a number of player retirements, England struggled.
"We have to be better than that," Hunter told BBC Sport.
"We feel confident we can push on as a team and as individuals."
England begin their campaign against Scotland on 5 February, and Hunter added: "We have a settled coaching set-up now, know exactly the players we have got for this Six Nations and the new players from last year's Six Nations have experience."
Ireland are the defending champions.
