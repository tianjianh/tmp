[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Investigators from the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) will stop pedestrians and motorists in Hayfield Road, Kirkcaldy, early on Sunday morning.
Sheku Bayoh was detained by police there between 06:30 and 07:30 on Sunday 3 May.
The 31-year-old died in custody shortly afterwards.
PIRC is investigating Mr Bayoh's death and is keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident.
Its investigators will be helped by traffic police, a PIRC spokeswoman said.
The contact details of potential witnesses will be recorded and follow-up interviews will take place next week, she added.
Mr Bayoh's relatives were said by police to be "extremely distressed" by his death.
A female police officer was also injured during the incident.
Aamer Anwar, solicitor for Mr Bayoh's family, said they had "the right to know the truth".
A statement released by Mr Anwar on Tuesday said: "At the age of 31 he leaves behind two young children, his partner Collette and a heartbroken family."
The PIRC will submit its finding to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.
