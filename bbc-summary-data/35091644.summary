Boulders twist in Cove harbour wrangle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fishermen who use a small Aberdeen harbour have had their access restricted by boulders after a long-running dispute took another twist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fishermen have been involved in a legal wrangle with the landowner over access since last year.
Over the weekend, the large boulders were placed across the entrance to the pier, preventing access for vehicles.
The fishermen have been warned they face legal action over their boats and equipment being on the beach.
More than 5,000 people have signed a petition to save the harbour.
Landowner Pralhad Kolhe has not responded to a request for comment.
