He will join team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton when the new series returns on 2 October.
Clarkson pulled out of hosting the BBC One panel show in April, after being sacked from Top Gear after a "fracas".
He is set to front a new motoring show for Amazon next year, alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.
Clarkson's appearance on Have I Got News For You will be his first on the BBC since his departure from Top Gear.
He was suspended in March after assaulting producer Oisin Tymon, and the BBC later confirmed his contract would not be renewed.
At the time, BBC director-general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and that "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another".
Clarkson signed up to present Have I Got News For You on Friday, and his appearance will mark the start of the show's 50th series.
When he pulled out of hosting in April, production company Hat Trick had suggested the presenter would appear on the show soon.
A statement said: "On reflection, Jeremy Clarkson has decided not to host Have I Got News For You. We fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year."
Pointless assistant host Richard Osman will be one of the two guests joining Clarkson for the opening episode.
