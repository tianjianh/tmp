General manager Kris Radlinski confirmed Burgess' exit at a fan forum.
"We did everything we could but he wants to experience the Sydney lifestyle," said Radlinski.
Burgess, 20, scored a try in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens and was selected in England's squad for the end-of-season Four Nations tournament.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old prop Ryan Sutton and 22-year-old half-back Sam Powell have agreed four-year contracts with the Warriors, who begin the new campaign with an away fixture at Widnes on 5 February.
