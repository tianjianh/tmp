The closure of the 50-year-old Molson Coors complex ended a 250-year history of brewing in Alton, Hampshire.
A newly-published development brief includes plans for 140-200 new homes and at least 100 jobs on the site.
The Alton Society said the brief, to be considered by the district council next week, was "one of the most exciting things to happen to Alton for years".
The group's chairman Bob Booker said the blueprint had the "wow factor", including a new "green corridor" along the River Wey, linking the High Street to King's Pond.
He said it would help to attract tourists to Alton, which neighbours the South Downs National Park and Jane Austen's House Museum at Chawton.
The brief has been compiled by Molson Coors, East Hampshire District Council and Alton Town Council to guide future planning applications for the site.
It says 100-120 jobs should be created, possibly in a new hotel or micro-brewery.
There could also be an unspecified "community facility", possibly replacing the town's community centre.
The brewery closed in May 2015 with the loss of around 108 jobs, after losing a contract with Heineken.
