The good news is that the last statistics showed that the average wage gap for women and men in full time work is 9.4%, which is the narrowest gap since the two wages began being compared in 1997.
The bad news is that once part-time work is included, that difference increases to 19.1%, which means that women earn 84p for every pound a man earns.

The report Equality for Girls was based on a survey of more than 1,200 girls and young women aged seven to 21.
Despite there still being some way to go to complete equality, women in the UK are making gains.
As Emma Watson said at the Davos World Economic Forum last week: "It is my belief that there is a greater understanding than ever that women need to be equal participants in our homes, in our societies, in our governments, and in our work places."
