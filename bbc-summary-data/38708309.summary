A Commonwealth light welterweight champion, Pryce lost to super middleweight Zach Parker on Saturday, his first stoppage defeat since 2009.
The 35-year old tweeted that he would no longer be able to pass a medical due to issues with his eyesight.
Pryce, who trained from childhood with world champions Joe Calzaghe and Gavin Rees, has a record of 38 wins and 21 defeats having made his debut in 1999.
