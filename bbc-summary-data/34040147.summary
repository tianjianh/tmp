World Championships 2015: Fraser-Pryce retains 100m title

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Double-Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce continued the Jamaican sprint dominance of the Bird's Nest as she retained her world 100m title in blistering fashion at the World Championships.

Twenty-four hours on from Usain Bolt's triumph in the men's 100m, Fraser-Pryce repeated her Olympic victory in this same stadium seven years ago as she held off the fast-finishing Dafne Schippers in 10.76 seconds.
For Schippers - the former heptathlete who only decided to switch full-time to sprinting in June this year - her silver in a huge personal best of 10.81 brought both vindication and wild celebration.
USA's Tori Bowie took bronze in 10.86, but as in 2008 this was the Fraser-Pryce show.

Just as her compatriot Bolt is the undisputed greatest sprinter the world has seen, so the 28-year-old can lay claim to the same title: twice Olympic champion over 100m, world champion three times over that distance and both world and Olympic titles over 200m too.
With her long plaits dyed green and a headband of daisies around her forehead [she owns a beauty parlour in her country's capital, Kingston] Fraser-Pryce did not get her trademark explosive start.
Schippers was out faster, but by 50m the Jamaican had opened up a two-metre lead over the tall Dutch athlete, and although Schippers was closing at the death, she had enough to hold her lead through the line.
"I'm getting tired of 10.7s. I just want to put a good race together and hopefully in the next race I get the time I'm working for," Fraser-Pryce told BBC Sport.
"I definitely think a 10.6 is there. Hopefully I will get it together."
Canada's Shawn Barber pulled off the shock of the championships so far by snatching pole vault gold from world-record holder and Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie.
The 21-year-old's first-time clearance at 5.90 metres put pressure on the French favourite, who jumped 6.05m earlier this year but had to settle for bronze here after three failures at the same height.

Germany's Raphael Holzdeppe cleared 5.90m on his third attempt but could not improve when the bar was raised to 6m, leaving Barber - whose father George competed in this event at the World Championships in 1983 - with his first global title.

Vivian Cheruiyot won Kenya their first gold of these championships as she kicked off the final bend to hold off Ethiopian rival Gelete Burka in a slow, tactical 10,000m final.
Ezekiel Kemboi, Conseslus Kipruto and Brimin Kipruto bringing home a Kenyan 1-2-3 in the steeplechase a few minutes later.
Columbia's defending world champion Caterine Ibarguen retained her triple jump title with a fourth round 14.90m, with no other athlete going past 14.78.
But there will be no gold this summer for Keshorn Walcott, Trinidad's 22-year-old Olympic javelin champion, who crashed out in qualifying with a best throw of 76.83m.
Britain's Rabah Yousif produced a fine run of 44.54, a personal best by almost half a second, to qualify for Tuesday's 400m final as a fastest loser.
Yousif, who came to Britain from Sudan 13 years ago and has an English wife, improved dramatically on his first-round performance as others who had lit up the heats struggled 24 hours on.
Team captain Martyn Rooney had set a new personal best of 44.45 in the heats but, perhaps tired, he was unable to reproduce that run and came home sixth in the third semi-final in 45.29, Olympic champion Kirani James (44.16) and Botswana's Isaac Makwala (44.11) the most impressive semi-final winners.
Eilidh Child made it through to the final of the 400m hurdles as a fastest loser as Meghan Beesley went out, while Britain's Asha Philip exited the 100m at the semi-final stage and Kate Avery came home 15th in the 10,000m in 32:16.19.
Earlier, Britain's Greg Rutherford reached the long jump final, while Christine Ohuruogo qualified for the 400m semi-final.
