Tyson Fury's win over Klitschko 'best since Ali beat Liston'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyson Fury's world title victory over Wladimir Klitschko is the greatest since Muhammad Ali beat Sonny Liston in 1964, says trainer Peter Fury.

The 27-year-old outpointed Klitschko in Dusseldorf to become the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion of the world.
The Manchester fighter claimed his victory was "not a shock for him".
But Peter Fury, also the fighter's uncle, said: "Ali said he had shaken the world [by beating Liston]. Tyson has done that, he's shaken the world."
He added: "Tyson will be in boxing a long time and will cement his legacy. He is going to enjoy his reign at the top. It has been a hard road but now he has landed at the top of the hill."
Ukrainian Klitschko went into Saturday's contest having won 65 of 68 professional fights and unbeaten since 2004.
But he was out-boxed over 12 rounds by Fury, who was awarded the fight on a unanimous verdict to become Britain's fifth bona fide heavyweight world champion after Bob Fitzsimmons, Lennox Lewis, Frank Bruno and David Haye.
"I am not surprised or overwhelmed. It is not a shock for me," Fury told a news conference in Bolton on Monday. "We always said what I would do and it came true. I have been telling everyone what would happen when I fought Klitschko.
"My performance, out-boxing him, was better than knocking him out in two. I beat him in his own home. I am like a mongoose going into a cobra's nest, taking all the eggs home with me.
"This was a masterclass performance over the best fighter on the planet. And It just shows you what type of talent you're messing with.
"Anyone who wants to discredit my performance is plain jealous."
The self-styled 'Gypsy King' taunted his opponent before the fight and even dressed as Batman at one memorable news conference.

But there were late doubts over whether the fight would actually go ahead after Fury's camp complained about the thickness of the foam under the ring canvas, leading to it being torn up and re-laid.
Fury used Monday's news conference to point the finger at Klitschko's camp and said he refused to accept any water after the fight for fear of possible sabotage.
"I went home dehydrated before I even touched anything, I was so frightened of being drug-tested and failing the drugs test," he said.
"They are cheats, they are extremely good at cheating."
Fury's first defence of his three world belts could come with a rematch against Klitschko, with Peter Fury suggesting in an interview on Sunday that Wembley could stage the bout, with May 2016 a possible date.
Immediately after Saturday's fight the Ukrainian said he would trigger a rematch clause, although he could yet decide, at 39 years old, that his best days are behind him.
Fury said: "I was expecting him to be stronger. He hit me flush on the nose - I didn't feel it. He hit me on the temple - I didn't feel it at the time. I did afterwards, I've been taking Nurofen for the pain!
"Take the glamour and the glitz away from these people, they're all just bare bums in the shower.
"It has not sunk in yet. It will take a week to come round. I have not touched the floor yet. When I come down I will decide who to fight and when.
"Klitschko will analyse it. He will know what he can and can't do. I don't think he can do much better but if he fancies his chances again, let's go."
Haye, who recently announced his comeback to the ring, has said he would like to fight Fury, having twice pulled out of scheduled meetings due to injury.
Another prospective opponent is American Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC heavyweight belt. Victory in that fight would make Fury the first undisputed world heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000.

Fury, who is now unbeaten in 25 professional fights, has previously claimed he has no interest in being a role model and courted controversy in the build-up to the Klitschko fight.
He repeated his stance on Monday, saying: "If people don't like it, change the channel. I will be dictated to by nobody. If you don't like it, don't take photos and don't print it in your newspaper. I don't care."
When asked about his responsibilities as a role model, he replied: "Depends what kind of role model you are after.
"If you want a yes man, I am not that person. If you want someone who will tell you like it is, I am that man."
