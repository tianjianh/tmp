Royal Family attend the Braemar Gathering

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke of Edinburgh has attended the Braemar Gathering with other members of the Royal Family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Duke, who is 91, has been recuperating at Balmoral after spending several days in hospital in Aberdeen with a bladder infection.
Organisers were concerned Prince Philip would not be well enough to attend.
The Gathering, held at The Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park, is seen as the biggest event in the Highland Games calendar.
It has a long history, stretching back in its modern form nearly 200 years.
The Duke accompanied the Queen, who is patron of the Games, to watch traditional events, including the tossing of the caber and the tug of war.
Prince Philip spent five nights at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a "precaution" after a recurrence of a bladder infection he had in June.
Last weekend, the Duke made his first public appearance, since leaving hospital on 20 August, when he attended a church service at Crathie Kirk.
In June he was admitted to hospital with the same infection the day after braving cold, wet and windy conditions on the royal barge for several hours during the Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thames.
Prince Philip spent five nights in London's King Edward VII Hospital and missed some of the key celebrations of a special bank holiday weekend marking the Queen's 60-year reign.
