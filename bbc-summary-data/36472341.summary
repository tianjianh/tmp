Surrey had reached 53-1 off 11 overs when heavy rain, thunder and lightning halted play for more than four hours.
The hosts eventually posted 163-6, with Rory Burns (51 not out) and Jason Roy (46) the main contributors.
Somerset openers Jim Allenby (71) and Johann Myburgh (76) helped the visitors to their revised target of 180 with five balls to spare at The Oval.
The pair shared a first-wicket stand of 155 as Somerset maintained their 100% winning start to the competition.
Surrey, meanwhile, have lost their first two games in the South Group.
