Mark Anderson held Nigel Poustie hostage in his flat in the Charleston area of Dundee in July.
The 49 year-old was battered with a baseball bat and hammer and had boiling water poured over his head.
Mr Poustie eventually escaped but was later discovered seriously injured in the street and later died in the city's Ninewells Hospital.
Anderson, 51, who was originally charged with murder, admitted a reduced charge of culpable homicide and will be sentenced in January.
Mr Poustie was described in court as a "poor soul" who had suffered personal problems following the death of his mother.
Mr Poustie and Anderson were said to have had a falling-out which led the killer to state to another friend: "I will torture him".
Prosecutor Adrian Cottam said that Mr Poustie was tortured overnight in Anderson's flat after being strapped to a chair and repeatedly punched.
He was also hit on the legs with a hammer and baseball bat.
Mr Cottam told the court: "He repeatedly begged him to stop.
"Anderson said he had betrayed him and would take what was given to him."
Mr Poustie then had a pillow case put over Mr Poustie's head as he sat "immobilised" in the chair.
Anderson told a woman in the house to boil a kettle, and a cup of boiling water was poured over Mr Poustie's head.
After leaving Anderson's home, Mr Poustie was seen looking "injured and disorientated" and later collapsed in the street.
He was taken to hospital, but suffered a cardiac arrest and never recovered.
Mr Poustie sustained extensive bruising and scalding, but existing health issues were a factor in his death.
Anderson was arrested four days later and initially claimed his victim must have been hit by a car or fallen over.
His QC Mark Stewart told the High Court in Glasgow his client was "ashamed" and deeply regretted his actions.
Judge Lord Boyd deferred sentencing until 18 January in Edinburgh.
