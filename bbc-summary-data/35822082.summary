James Purdie faces jail over child abuse images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from North Ayrshire caught with images of children being tortured and sexually abused is facing jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Purdie was caught with 115 images on his computer after police raided his home in Ardrossan.
The 32-year-old, who had file-shared with other paedophiles, told officers: "Everything you have found is mine."
Purdie admitted downloading and possessing the images at two addresses in Irvine between November 2014 and November 2015. Sentence was deferred.
Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard that several of the pictures were at the highest level of depravity, featuring girls as young as two being abused.
Purdie's name was also added to the sex offenders' register.
