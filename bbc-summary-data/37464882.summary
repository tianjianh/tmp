The Sun reported that about 3,000 photographs were stolen and that it was offered images by someone asking for Â£50,000 within 48 hours.
It said the images included shots of the duchess's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
Scotland Yard said a man had been arrested in Northamptonshire.
Police said the man had been arrested on suspicion of a Computer Misuse Act offence and had been taken into custody at a south London police station.
The haul from the alleged hack was reportedly offered for sale to the newspaper via encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.
Miss Middleton is set to marry hedge fund manager James Matthews next year, after announcing their engagement this summer.
