Biggest house price drop in Swansea between 2010 and 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea has suffered the biggest fall in house prices of any major town or city across Wales and England over the past five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prices fell by just under 4% - or about £5,000 - between 2010 and 2015.
Of the 112 areas covered by the survey, it was the steepest of just four places which saw falls.
Elsewhere, house prices in Newport and Cardiff rose 12.5% and 8.5% respectively, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.
The survey looks at all the towns and cities of Wales and England which have a resident or working day population of at least 75,000.
The aim of the Towns and Cities Analysis is to focus on their core built-up areas, rather than surrounding districts.
In the south of England, 29 out of 45 areas had a median price above £200,000.
But only three did in the north of England, and there were none in Wales, where prices were £125,000 (Swansea), £132,500 (Newport) and £170,000 (Cardiff).
There were also no areas in Wales, nor the north or Midlands regions of England, where median house price rose by more than 20% during this period.
This meant median house prices in Swansea typically fell by £5,000 over those five years. That compares with a median rise of more than £100,000 in Cambridge and London.
