The Easter Road side are waiting for a response to a new contract offer for the 20-year-old, who has scored 43 goals in 90 appearances.
Cummings, with 20 goals this term, is currently tied to the Championship club until summer 2017 after signing a deal at the start of last season.
"We rate Jason very highly," Stubbs told BBC Scotland.
"We've offered him a new deal. We're hopeful that we can get that concluded but we all have to work together because we know how influential agents are now.
"And unfortunately, I've got to say, sometimes decisions are made for the wrong reasons.
"Jason, since he's come to us and certainly since I've been here has improved at a rate of knots. I think that's there for everybody to see and his move will happen one day no matter what.
"I honestly believe he will go on to play at a high level but he has to make sure he makes the right football decision.
"I make decisions for players. I don't make them from a financial point of view.
"So, when I speak to a player, I speak to them about their careers. When I speak to a player, I speak to him about him personally and I have that personal opinion [of] what I think's best for him.
"I obviously have an opinion from the club's point of view and I'm not really interested in the agent's point of view because sometimes - not all the time - the agent's point of view is from a selfish, individual point of view."
Cummings has been at Hibs since the summer of 2013, having been released by Edinburgh rivals Hearts the year before.
