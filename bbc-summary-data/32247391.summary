The only cafe in a Norwich park hosting BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend has been told it will have to close during the event for "safety" reasons.

About 50,000 music fans are expected at Earlham Park on 23 and 24 May.
Earlham Park Cafe owner Ingrid Henry said she felt "let down and hugely disappointed" when told by the city council she would not be able to open.
The council said the cafe would be compensated for loss of its usual takings over the bank holiday weekend.
The family has run the cafe for 15 years and Ms Henry said they were initially "led to believe we would be able to open" during the festival.
However, last week a company contracted by the council, wrote to her saying the park would be cordoned off to "control access and ensure the event is safe at all times".
A council spokesman said the cafe area "falls within the event's backstage production area" and access needed to be controlled.
He added that the owners would be "fully compensated for rent and any loss of income to see they won't be a penny out of pocket."
Ms Henry said: "It's no real compensation for tens of thousands of extra customers."
After expressing her anger on Facebook, one customer started a petition on a website calling for the cafe to be allowed to stay open.
Within hours it had more than 5,000 signatures.
