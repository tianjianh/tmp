[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicky Maynard's volley in the sixth minute of stoppage time snatched a 1-0 win for MK Dons in a dour encounter against Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was rough on the Latics, who were set to climb out of the League One relegation zone but instead remain one point adrift of fifth-from-bottom Swindon after losing out to the Dons' only shot on target.
Chances were at a premium throughout, with the hosts' Kieran Agard just unable to get on the end of Dean Dowditch's low cross and Oldham's Paul Green volleying over.
The closest either side came to scoring before half-time was when the Latics' Aaron Amadi-Holloway glanced Green's cross wide of the far post.
The quality did not improve after the break, with Darius Osei dragging a shot well wide after a promising run down the left before MK Dons substitute Chuks Aneke had his own disappointing effort.
But there was a very late twist as George Williams' long ball was headed out as far as Maynard, who whipped a terrific volley into the bottom corner.
