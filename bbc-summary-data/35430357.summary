James Collins gave the Cobblers the lead when he headed in Brendan Moloney's right-wing cross.
It was 2-0 soon after the break when Collins' low cross from the right was converted from a yard out by Marquis.
Substitute Russell Penn crashed home a 25-yard dipping volley in the 93rd minute, but there was not enough time for York to find an equaliser.

York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:
"Disappointing. I think the two goals we lost were soft.
"The first one comes from a throw in and there was no communication. But the second goal was too soft as well.
"We've done some things later on that caused them a few problems and we had a few chances to score which gave us a little bit of hope, but unfortunately we were too late."
