All 22 local authorities in Wales have now agreed to accept refugees from Syria, Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths has told assembly members.

17 councils were "happy" to do so when a Wales summit on resettling refugees was held in September, she said.
Ms Griffiths said a "task force", holding its first meeting in November, would assess how many Wales could take.
She told AMs she refused to "set an arbitrary number today as to how many refugees we should be welcoming".
Prime Minister David Cameron has said up to 20,000 refugees will be accepted in the UK over the next five years, under his government's expanded resettlement scheme.
