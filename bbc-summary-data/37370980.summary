[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Howard, who has worked for the authority since joining as a junior clerk in 1971, will stand down in the spring of 2017.
Occupying his current post since 1998, he is widely credited with inspiring the regeneration of Manchester following the IRA bomb blast in 1996.
The council said the search for his successor will begin shortly.
Sir Howard oversaw Manchester's hosting of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the launch of the Metrolink transport system and the region's devolution project.
He was also involved in the establishment of Manchester Airport as a PLC in the mid 1980s and the hub's ongoing expansion.
Sir Howard, who was knighted in 2003 for services to the city, said it had been a "privilege to serve the city during such a pivotal period".
"I'm incredibly proud of what the city has been able to achieve in this time, and to have played a part in it," he said.
"Manchester is firmly established as a confident and dynamic place, recognised as a premier league world city, although of course there are still significant challenges to address."
"I will have been at the council 46 years next year, and this feels like the right time to plan for my succession."
Council leader Sir Richard Leese said: "Sir Howard is widely recognised as one of the great local government chief executives. Having someone of his talent, vision and drive dedicate his career to the city has been an undoubted plus for Manchester.
"Working with him over many years, addressing challenges and attempting to capture opportunities for the city, has been a pleasure. He will be a hard act to follow."
