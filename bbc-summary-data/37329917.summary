[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford captain Troy Deeney said his team were motivated to fight back from 2-0 down at West Ham because they felt their opponents were embarrassing them.

Dimitri Payet set up Michail Antonio's second goal with a rabona after Manuel Lanzini had tried to score with the same skill.
Odion Ighalo, Deeney, Etienne Capoue and Jose Holebas gave Watford victory.
"As a player I though they were trying to mug us off a little bit," Deeney told BBC Radio 5 live.
"You can appreciate good skill and that was great skill for the second goal but as a professional you cannot allow someone to do that to you.
"You see that in the playground with six and seven year olds and we are grown men.
"There were some harsh words said to each other and everyone had that fire in their belly again."
Payet set up Antonio for his second goal with a brilliantly improvised cross as he wrapped his right foot around the back of his left leg to chip the ball to the back post.

Watford fought back before the break thanks to Ighalo's deflected shot and a brilliant finish from Deeney after dreadful defending from the hosts.
Capoue scored his third goal of the season when a deep ball came to him at the back post and Holebas grabbed his first goal in English football with a shot from the edge of the area.
Deeney added: "We all dug in and started to lay a bit of a hand on them and before you know it we were getting more chances and we got two goals before half-time.
"I thought we were the only team who were going to win it in the second half."
