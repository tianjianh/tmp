A study has found that reopening three disused railway stations in Dumfries and Galloway could cost up to £37m.

The report commissioned by the South West Scotland Transport Partnership (SWESTRANS) looked at Eastriggs, Thornhill and Beattock.
An early assessment of the potential costs involved has been carried out as part of an appraisal process.
The study - which is also examining service timetabling issues - is due to be completed in March.
The findings will be used to determine whether a bid is made to tap into the £30m put in place by the Scottish government to help finance new stations, reopenings and improvements.
However, the report to members of the SWESTRANS board highlighted that half the overall costs would still have to be found locally.
