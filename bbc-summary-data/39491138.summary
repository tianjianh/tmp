Henry Ayabowei, known as Henry Esin, was found collapsed near a Bangor nightclub in the early hours of Saturday.
The 27-year-old, from Llangefni, Anglesey, was taken to hospital, but died on Sunday morning.
A man who was arrested has now been charged and will appear before Llandudno magistrates on Wednesday.
Mr Ayabowei played football for a number of clubs on Anglesey and was described as a "true gentleman in every sense" by Llanfairpwll football club.
Floral tributes to Mr Ayabowei have been left outside the Peep nightclub, close to the Brick Street-High Street junction where he was found.
A post-mortem examination was also expected to be carried out on Tuesday, with family liaison officers supporting Mr Ayabowei's family.
