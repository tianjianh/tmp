Police said a brawl broke out among a number of people in a takeaway and spilled out on to Westgate at about 05:00 GMT.
A 38-year-old man from Bradford was punched in the face and hit his head on the road. He is being treated at Leeds General Infirmary.
Four men in their 20s have been arrested and are being questioned.
Det Supt Nick Wallen, from West Yorkshire Police, said "tragic circumstances" led to the injury.
"It is always worth taking that deep breath, turning and walking away", he said.
Police said officers would be in the area on Saturday night to speak to nightclubbers.
