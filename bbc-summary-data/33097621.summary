[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dimmer waste processing station approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A waste processing station in Somerset to compact rubbish for incineration has been approved despite local concerns over increased traffic levels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Viridor will build the plant at its landfill site in Dimmer near Castle Cary to reduce the amount buried there.
The station will compact rubbish and send it to Oxfordshire and Avonmouth.
Traffic studies have shown lorry trips will drop overall, but the B road via Clanville will be busier as waste is carried away for incineration.
The decision was approved by four votes to three at Somerset County Council on Thursday.
