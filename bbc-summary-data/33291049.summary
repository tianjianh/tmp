Young people will be encouraged to have a "digital detox" at a festival in Dumfries and Galloway this summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Environmental Art Festival Scotland - Off Grid - will be held next to the ruins of Morton Castle, near Thornhill.
Five interns have played a central role in organising the event, in a bid to build a wider, young audience to engage with environmental issues.
There will be specially commissioned artwork, walks, fireside conversations and food art on display.
Intern Ruaridh Thin-Smith said: "The festival is a celebration of the natural energies and sources of vitality which allow life to flourish - and what better way to celebrate life than to live as young people making a commitment to healing our planet.
"Let's join the digital detox, and learn how to unplug from the status quo grid and recharge our relationship with the earth."
Organisers hope to bring together scientists, artists, environmentalists, cultural thinkers, poets and performers at the free event on 29 and 30 August.
