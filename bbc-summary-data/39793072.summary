One-Day Cup: Alastair Cook makes 127 as Essex beat Gloucestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England opener Alastair Cook's century set up a 29-run win for Essex against Gloucestershire in the One-Day Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old hit 12 boundaries in his 127 before driving Chris Liddle (4-54) to extra cover in the 44th over.
Nick Browne (42) and Varun Chopra (41) provided good support as Essex posted 315-8 under gloomy skies at Chelmsford.
Phil Mustard made 90 and Ian Cockbain struck 79 in the chase, but the visitors struggled to keep up with the run-rate and they finished on 286-8.
Cook, who can play in all of Essex's matches until England's first Test against South Africa in July, was given a life on 67 when he was dropped on the mid-wicket boundary by Jack Taylor off paceman Liam Norwell.
But the rest of the innings was chanceless, as England's all-time leading Test run-scorer brought up his three figures off 110 balls.
Just as Gloucestershire looked well set on 175-2 and ready to accelerate, Mustard fell swiping Matt Quinn to Cook at deep square-leg 10 short of an eighth List A hundred.
Cockbain, off the back of his match-winning century at Lord's on Sunday, continued to fight valiantly to bring the equation down to 60 runs off 30 balls, but then skied Ravi Bopara (3-34) to Cook ending any chance of victory.
Essex have now won their opening three matches in the competition, while Gloucestershire have lost two out of three.
