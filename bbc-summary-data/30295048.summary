Gone are the days when facial hair merely bristled on the faces of vicars, uncles and Father Christmas.

Beards are now hot property.
As a result a new dating website has sprung up seeking to take advantage of the appetite for hirsute heartthrobs.
Bristlr links up those who want to stroke beards with the furry faced.
John Kershaw from Manchester, initially set it up as a joke, but its popularity convinced him to take it further.
Around 25,000 people have signed up for free since the website was set up five weeks ago, according to its 28-year-old founder.
Speaking to Newsbeat he said that the website was growing at around 10% a day.  While he doesn't track gender information, the ratio of those that possess beards to those searching for the bearded was roughly 50/50.
As well as allowing you to search by location, Bristlr also provides a beard-rating option, allowing you to find out how well a potential date's beard ranks compared with other bearded locals.
He said that there was also a huge range of ages using the service, from 20 to 40 years old.  He hopes to roll out an age filter soon.
Explaining the appeal of beards, he said "it is a style thing, but also there is warmth and if you take good care of them, they smell nice."
His own personal beard inspiration is actor Zach Galifianakis.
