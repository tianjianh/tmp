Plymouth Argyle 2-3 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth's League Two automatic promotion hopes were dealt a massive blow as they lost to relegated Dagenham & Redbridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fifth-placed Argyle have drifted three points away from the top three after going 3-0 down by half-time.
A Matty Cash strike from 25 yards in between Clevid Dikamona and Christian Doidge headers had the Daggers flying.
Plymouth replied as Peter Hartley headed in and Graham Carey curled home, but it proved too late.
