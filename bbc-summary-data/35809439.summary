Students will be able to work on Morgan racing cars and alongside traditional craftsmen on a range of vehicles made by the Malvern-based firm.
The university has invested Â£12m at its Telford Innovation Campus to support students' work on Formula 3 and Morgan racing cars, a spokesman said.
Motor racing workshops and car bays will be created at its Priorslee site.
Morgan managing director, Steve Morris, said: "Without a doubt the combined expertise of craftsmanship working alongside engineering students on a number of projects will bring added benefits to both parties, whilst affording students an invaluable insight into the world of car manufacturing and racing."
The car maker was founded by HFS Morgan in 1909.
It began producing three wheeler cars in 1910, but the firm's reputation is based on hand-built small sports cars.
