[SN]TITLE[SN]
Arran Coghlan's Alderley Edge home seized by National Crime Agency

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man suspected of buying a Â£450,000 house with the proceeds of drug dealing has had to surrender the property to the National Crime Agency (NCA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A possession order had been granted against Arran Coghlan, 44, at the High Court on 20 July, for the house in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.
Coghlan, who has previously been cleared of killing three people, had fought the order for four years.
But the High Court ruled his appeal had "no real prospect of succeeding".
Coghlan was given 90 days to hand over the keys to the house he bought in 2007, and an NCA spokesman has now confirmed the property was vacated last month.
He said a decision on its disposal would be "made in due course".
At a proceeds of crime hearing in 2012, a judge said Brook Lane Chapel had probably been bought with the profits of drug dealing in the Stockport area.
Mr Justice Simon ruled that Coghlan had "engaged in unlawful conduct as a drug dealer" and lived on the proceeds from 1999 until at least April 2004.
The NCA argued that Coghlan's relatively meagre legitimate income over the relevant timeframe could not have covered the thousands he pumped into "extravagantly" restoring the house.
The ruling opened the way for the NCA to seize the property under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
Coghlan claimed the NCA based its case against him on "fraudulent misrepresentations" but the High Court upheld its decision that his appeal had "no real prospect of succeeding".
Charges were dropped against Coghlan in 2010 when he was accused of shooting dead Stephen Akinyemi in a fight at his home in Alderley Edge.
He was also cleared in 1996 of shooting Chris Little dead at the wheel of his Mercedes in Marple, Stockport.
Seven years later he stood trial and was cleared of the murder of drug dealer David Barnshaw, who was kidnapped and forced to drink petrol before being burned alive in the back of a car in Stockport in 2001.
