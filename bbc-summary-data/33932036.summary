Firefighters helped free Alexys Brown from the lift at Emmadale Close, Weymouth, on Thursday, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.
Aster Group said it would assist the police investigation "any way we can".
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also confirmed it was investigating.
The coroner's officer said a post-mortem examination would be carried out next week and an inquest would follow.
A spokesman for Astor Group said: "We're sorry to learn of a death at one of our properties at Emmadale Close, Westham, yesterday and our thoughts are with the little girl's family at this difficult time."
Due to the ongoing investigation into the circumstances of the death, he said it would be inappropriate to comment further "at this stage".
Mayor of Weymouth and Portland, Christine James, said news of Alexys' death had come as a "total shock" to the "tight-knit" community.
She added residents were likely to "rally round and do what they can to help".
Dorset County Council said it had not installed the lift at the property.
A spokeswoman for the authority said the lift involved was commonly known as a "through floor lift" and enabled someone with a physical disability to access upper floors, where stairs cannot be used.
The two-storey house has a disabled ramp outside.
