Robson made her comeback last week in Eastbourne after a wrist injury kept her out since the 2014 Australian Open.
Wild card Robson, 21, will play Russia's world number 101, Evegniya Rodina, in the first round on Tuesday.
"My coach, my trainer, we're all very patient - if I don't play well, then it is not the end of the world," she said.
"We all learn in tennis that there's always next week. There's always going to be another week for me, because I'm injury free, I think that's the main thing.

"If it doesn't work out after this tournament, I'm going to go play some challengers in America. It's going to take a while. But, yeah, patience."
Robson won just one game as she lost to Russia's Daria Gavrilova in Eastbourne qualifying last week but was able to take the positives from just being back on court.
"I don't think anything is worse for an athlete than doing over a year of rehab," said the former world number 27.
"So even though last week I got absolutely pummelled, getting pummelled is better than not playing anything at all."
She added: "To be honest, I would have preferred to start at smaller tournaments than Wimbledon.
"I think I'm pretty realistic that my level is not at the point where it was before I was injured."
Robson last played at Wimbledon two years ago, when she reached the fourth round, and last year had to make do with a stint in the BBC commentary box.
She said her return is "super exciting".
"It's nice to see everyone again from the locker room attendants to the ladies who work at accreditation. It's a good feeling," she added.
Heather Watson, the current British number one, welcomed her Fed Cup team-mate back to the fold.
"I'm glad she's back and fit and healthy," said the world number 64. "I think last week for her was great to be back on the court finishing a whole match.
"I really am glad she's back on tour. She's not just a great player, but she's also a really good person off the court."
Watson, 23, began the year by winning her second WTA title in Hobart but struggled in the recent clay-court season.
"I've definitely had some highs and lows," said the Briton, who plays French 32nd seed Caroline Garcia on Monday.
"But the highs have been quite high. I am really feeding off of that.
"I feel very, very good about my game. I just had a little lapse, I think, in the clay-court season. But back on the grass I'm feeling great."
