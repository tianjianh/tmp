AGA to close Coalbrookdale foundry with the loss of 35 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AGA is closing one of its foundries in Shropshire with the loss of 35 jobs after 70 years of production there.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The US-owned firm said its base in Coalbrookdale was "no longer economically viable".
Castings made at the site will now be sourced from elsewhere in the UK and Europe.
The news comes less than two years since AGA Rangemaster was sold for about Â£130m to Chicago kitchenware firm - the Middleby Corporation.
At the time Middleby said it intended to "maintain manufacturing operations in the UK" but has been steadily reducing the Coalbrookdale workforce.

The company moved most of its oven-making there in 1947.
In a statement, the company said: "In recent times we have introduced a number of initiatives to support the foundry, but unfortunately we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we need to cease the manufacture of castings at Coalbrookdale and close this facility."
Some workers will be transferred to other roles within the group.
"The closure of the foundry is part of a plan to improve efficiency and secure the longer-term future of the AGA brand and its manufacture in the UK," the firm added.
The Aga foundry in Ketley will remain open.
