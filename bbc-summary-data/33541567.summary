Durham County Council backs £50m HQ move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
County councillors in Durham have provisionally approved plans to move to a new £50m headquarters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority's base at Aykley Heads in Durham City has been described as "over-sized and inefficient".
Officers suggested a move could create up to 6,000 jobs and put £1m into Durham city's economy.
A cabinet meeting backed proposals to demolish the existing site and build new homes and offices ahead of a further meeting in November.
A recent report said the existing complex, which opened in 1963, was no longer fit for purpose and would be attractive to businesses.
More than 2,000 jobs have been axed by the authority in recent years as it seeks to make budget cuts.
From 2011 to 2019, it said it would have to make a reduction in spending of £250m.
The cabinet meeting was told any relocation would take up to four years to complete.
