The Scotland captain does not believe, however, the double-header will make or break Scotland's qualification bid for the 2018 World Cup.
"We look forward to the games and we try to get two positive results, which would be two wins," Fletcher said.
"We see where we are when we come out of them and we go again."
West Brom midfielder Fletcher, who is set to win his 75th cap against Lithuania on Saturday, says failure to win either match would not be a fatal blow to Scotland's qualification hopes.
"There is still a long way to go in the campaign," he said. "It is no different, no matter what game we play.
"We strive to win, we are determined to win, we are focused to win, we are prepared to win. That's the mindset that goes into it."
Fletcher says that, even if Scotland fall short of two wins, they would not "just write off the rest of the campaign" because "there are still plenty of games to go".

"We know it is going to be a tough game," he said of Saturday's game. "We have played Lithuania in the past and it has always been a difficult game, very physical.
"Now I think they are trying to have a real go in games and attack and look to be very expansive on the counter-attack."
Head coach Gordon Strachan is reluctant to set a points target for his side as they approach the two matches in four days.
"I've never made any targets in my life for anything I do," Strachan said.  "I just get on and do it and just live in the present.
"Some managers do that, but if you don't achieve what you're after then you can disappoint yourself and disappoint everybody so you just get on and see where we go.
"Great first game, scoring five goals away. We got a bit of luck at the right time, but we were prepared for that.
"Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. That's what we did, we prepared for that.
"So we take it on from there. We feel good about ourselves, but we know the task."
