The 33-year-old, capped 56 times by his country, is set to join on Monday on a 35-day deal until 22 November.
"I'm sure he'll have a fantastic impact," said City boss Tony Mowbray.
"I've met with Joe. He has watched us play several times this season. He likes the way we play and has shown a real enthusiasm to come."
Cole, who will watch fifth-placed City's League One game at home to Blackpool at the Ricoh Arena on Saturday, is expected to make his debut at Rochdale on Tuesday night.
"I need to have a chat with Joe," added Mowbray. "He feels quite positive, is ready to play and wants to play.
"He has one or two things he wants to sort out on a personal level, but I'll talk to him on Monday about what his thoughts are for Tuesday and beyond."
