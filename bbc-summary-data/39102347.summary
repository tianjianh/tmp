The free ScotlandVR app features 360 degree imagery and footage.
They include Abbotsford House near Melrose, Alloway's Robert Burns Birthplace Museum and Dunnottar Castle near Stonehaven.
The Cairngorms National Park, Falkirk Wheel and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh are also featured.
The footage and animations play on a smartphone placed inside a cardboard 3D viewer.
The app emerged from a competition held as part of the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design.
Tourism body VisitScotland challenged students to create an interactive digital product to inspire people to visit Scotland.
The winner was a team from Edinburgh Napier University led by Prof David Benyon and Dr Oli Mival.
The team developed the concept for an app which would allow users to explore a virtual Scotland.
