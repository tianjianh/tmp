[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called to Ryde Harbour off the Isle of Wight at about 06:00 GMT.
The man got stuck after jumping from a pontoon to help the woman when she got into difficulty, a coastguard spokesman said.
Both suffered suspected hypothermia and were left in the care of the ambulance service, he added.
He also said the service "discouraged" people from jumping in to help others, in order to avoid putting themselves at risk.
