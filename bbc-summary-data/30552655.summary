An intruder who fatally stabbed a man at a flat in Glasgow is facing a life sentence for murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Boyle, 38, repeatedly stabbed 52-year-old Kenneth McNeill at the flat in Dumbarton Road, Yoker, on 15 May.
The victim was treated by paramedics but died from blood loss caused by a stab wound to his leg.
Boyle denied murder but was convicted following a five-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. Judge Lord Stewart deferred sentence until the new year.
Shortly before his arrest, police revealed that Mr McNeill had been assaulted after someone had broken into the flat.
Mr McNeill was not the householder at the property but police managed to piece together enough evidence to convict Boyle.
His former girlfriend, Fiona McInally, 36, gave evidence for the Crown during proceedings.
She said that following the fatal attack, Boyle had told her that he had assaulted someone.
Ms McInally told prosecution lawyer David Nicholson that she noticed he had a blood stain on his arm.
She said: "Paul said someone had stabbed him on the arm and he marked their face."
Police said at the time of Mr McNeill's death that an intruder had forced his way inside the flat at about 00:50 and "targeted" the victim, who died at the scene.
