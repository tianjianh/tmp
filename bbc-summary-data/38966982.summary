[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blerim Hajdarmataj, 24, of Chelmsford, was found guilty of sex offences by a jury in his absence last September.
His 18-year-old female victim, from Hornchurch, was left bruised and bitten after the attack.
Chelmsford Crown Court jailed him for eight years after he was caught under a European arrest warrant.
Hajdarmata was flown back to the UK last Friday and sentenced on Monday.
The trial jury was told how he had bought a drink for his victim in a Chelmsford bar in September 2014.
She had refused his request to go home with him but awoke the following day in his bed.
The woman fled and flagged down a passing motorist for help.
Det Insp Terry Balding said: "Hajdarmataj took advantage of a vulnerable woman in the most horrendous and vile way.
"He has shown no remorse for his actions, which have had a lasting effect on the victim.
"By fleeing the country during his trial, he put her through more fear and pain.
"I would like to thank her for her strength in providing evidence throughout the case."
