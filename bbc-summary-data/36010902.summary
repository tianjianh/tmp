Cameron to face MPs amid tax affairs row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron will attempt to seize back the initiative on tax as he faces MPs for the first time since the Panama Papers scandal erupted.

He will tell the Commons the government is bringing forward plans for criminal penalties on companies whose employees encourage or enable tax evasion.
But Labour is still demanding answers over Mr Cameron's own tax affairs.
It comes after the PM published data on his 2009-15 tax and earnings including a £200,000 gift from his mother.
The figures were released in attempt to defuse a row about Mr Cameron's investment in his late father's offshore fund, details of which had earlier emerged in a leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm.
The summary of tax returns released by Mr Cameron show he received two payments of £100,000 from his mother Mary in 2011, a year after he inherited £300,000 from his father.

Kamal Ahmed: Is David Cameron a tax avoider?
Personal finance experts say it is not unusual for wealthy families to use this kind of "tax planning" to legally avoid inheritance tax.
Downing Street said the payments had been an attempt to "balance" the sums received by all the Cameron children, as the prime minister's older brother had inherited the family home.
Mr Cameron had already been pushing for greater tax transparency and is due to hold a summit on beating corruption of all kinds in London next month.
He said: "This government has done more than any other to take action against corruption in all its forms, but we will go further.
"That is why we will legislate this year to hold companies who fail to stop their employees facilitating tax evasion criminally liable."
David Cameron will tell MPs he will get tough on companies which are soft on tax evasion.
This is part of his battle to regain voters' trust after a torrid week of headlines.
He will repeat he is now being more transparent than any previous prime minister. But he may be inflicting some collateral damage on colleagues amid growing calls for senior politicians to reveal their tax affairs.
The chancellor has not committed to publishing his returns, but aides are making it clear he has not held shares in overseas trusts.
The Labour leader faces a challenge to convince voters his party can be trusted to do things differently, and his MPs that he can strike a blow against the PM.
Not for the first time UKIP leader Nigel Farage is bucking a trend, telling the BBC it was "a big no" to releasing information on how he is taxed.
Plans for a new offence for firms that fail to act to prevent economic crime were announced in February last year by the then-chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander.
They were put out to consultation and Mr Cameron is expected to announce that they will be included in May's Queen's Speech, with a new offence then expected to become law later this year.
It would lower the threshold of responsibility for companies whose employees may have advised clients to take actions which would evade - as opposed to avoid - paying tax.
This proposed legislation is an extension of the Bribery Act, which made firms responsible if they failed to take enough measures to prevent their own staff or contractors paying inducements.
The government has also announced it is to set up a new task force led by HM Revenue and Customs and the National Crime Agency to investigate allegations of tax-dodging and money laundering.
On Sunday, Mr Cameron took the unprecedented step of releasing a summary of earnings and tax going back six years after being accused by Labour of misleading the public over money he had invested in his father Ian Cameron's company, Blairmore Holdings.
But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Cameron needed to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister in 2010, when he sold off shares in Blairmore for a £19,000 profit.
"We need to know why he put this money overseas in the first place, and whether he made anything out of it or not before 2010 when he became prime minister," Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.
Asked about the £200,000 gift Mr Cameron received from his mother, the Labour leader said there was "possibly" a case for looking at inheritance tax rules.
Blairmore was a client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm that was the subject of a huge data leak last week known as the Panama Papers.
The prime minister insisted it was a "fundamental misconception" to suggest Blairmore had been set up to avoid tax, instead asserting that it was established to enable people to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies.
Labour has announced a 10 point plan to "clean out" tax havens - including forcing MPs to disclose any offshore holdings in the register of members' interests. It has also called for a full public inquiry into the Panama Papers.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, has followed other Scottish party leaders by publishing her tax return for 2014-15, and committed to publishing it annually for as long as she is first minister. It shows she earned £104,817, and paid more than £31,000 in tax.
