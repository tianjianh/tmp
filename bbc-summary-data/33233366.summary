Mark Footitt bowled Ben Foakes and Gary Wilson to leave Surrey on 170-6.
But in only his fourth first-class innings Burke (73) and Batty (37) helped Surrey to 315, to set Derbyshire a challenging target of 348 runs.
Two wickets each for Luke Fletcher, Tom Curran and Burke and Gareth Batty's 4-32 skittled the hosts for 125 to complete a comprehensive 222-run win.
Burke hit 11 fours and one six in to ensure that Derbyshire would be chasing the highest score of the match for victory.
The bowlers then combined to dismiss Derbyshire within 40 overs and reduce Lancashire's lead at the top of Division Two to 28 points.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty: "I thought the boys, to a man, were magnificent and they should all be really proud of themselves.
"A special mention to James Burke. He copped a few in the chops from Mark Footitt and just kept battling through and played a magnificent innings that turned the game."
Derbyshire's elite performance director Graeme Welch: "That was one of the worst days since I've been in this job.
"We've had opportunities in games but we've shown no fight, no bottle - which is the most disturbing thing really.
"There have been a few harsh words said and a few things people didn't like to hear so we'll see where we go from here."
