[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Fusilier Museum in Bury was searching for the medal for a centenary exhibition to start on 25 April.
It owned two, was loaned three and has now been handed the remaining VC, won by Maj Cuthbert Bromley, which was last heard of in the 1980s.
Maj Bromley's nephew Nick handed the medal to the museum.
The Six VCs Before Breakfast exhibition will be the highlight of the museum's special programme over the weekend of 25-26 April - the first time the VCs have been displayed in one place.
Staff traced Maj Bromley's family through genealogical research after first appealing to find the medal in January 2014.
The major, who was temporarily promoted from captain, received Britain's highest award for bravery along with Cpl John Grimshaw, Pte William Keneally, Sgt Alfred Richards, Sgt Frank Stubbs and Capt Richard Willis for their actions when the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers landed at Gallipoli in Turkey on the morning of 25 April 1915.
The battalion lost more than half of its men as they landed on W Beach, which was later renamed Lancashire Landing.
Maj Bromley was honoured in his local church, St Leonard's, Seaford and had a road named after him in the East Sussex town.
Eighteen men from the Lancashire regiment were awarded the VC during World War One.
All six medals will be displayed until 16 May.
