Norwich defender Ivo Pinto said his first goal for the club was a thank you from him to their "amazing" fans.

The 26-year-old scored late on in the 3-1 win over Burton to put the Canaries on top of the Championship table.
"I'm very happy that my first goal happened at this stadium amongst this fantastic crowd
"When I go forward and try to attack, I normally look to make an assist. This time I went on the run and shot for goal," Pinto told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"In this league, you don't know what could happen, it's hard. But when you score the third one, it's the end of the game and I think that's very good for us."
Although Norwich came away with three points, they had to battle against a stubborn Burton side.
"We didn't have the best day, but in the end we did enough to take the three points," Pinto said.
"If we're not having a good day, we still have players in the squad that can make a difference."
Norwich are next in action on Wednesday when they travel to Newcastle United - both teams having been relegated from the Premier League last season.
"When you keep winning games, you're just waiting for the next one to come," he added.
"It'll be a big game for us against Newcastle, but if we have a better day and keep doing our jobs, I think we can win the game."
