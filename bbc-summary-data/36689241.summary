Cornwall College boss Amarjit Basi resigns £200,000-a-year post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The boss of one of the largest employers in Cornwall has resigned his £200,000-a-year position.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amarjit Basi will leave his post as principal and chief executive of Cornwall College at the end of July.
The college is the fifth largest in England with seven sites across the county employing around 2,800 people.
Nick Varney, from the University and College Union, said now would be a good time for the college to "reflect on its remuneration policy".
He said there was a "serious inequality of pay" and called for "a moratorium on the appointment of a new principal".
Cornwall College did not comment on the circumstances of Mr Basi's departure.
It said: "He has led the college to change its direction and structures, delivered a very good Ofsted inspection outcome and overseen the merger with Bicton College."
The college wished Mr Basi well and said it would put in place the process of recruiting a new principal immediately.
