A former soldier who repeatedly raped a vulnerable 14-year-old girl has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Rodgers, 28, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, was convicted of abusing the girl between December 2013 and June 2014.
At the High Court in Glasgow, he was told he would be monitored for two years after his release from jail due to the risk he posed to the public.
Rodgers was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
Judge Kenneth Maciver QC told him: "You repeatedly raped a 14-year-old girl over a six-month period.
"You knew she was vulnerable. Sexual intercourse with you was never a matter of choice for her, it was forced upon her.
"The girl says in her victim impact statement she has continuing distress and emotional difficulties because of the crime of rape perpetrated on her."
Defence counsel Dale Hughes said: "He [Rodgers] served in the Army and did one tour in Northern Ireland and two tours in Afghanistan.
"He suffered from post traumatic stress disorder."
