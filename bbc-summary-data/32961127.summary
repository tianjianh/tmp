[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman in Birmingham jailed after making 'loud sex noises'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who breached a court order that barred her from making "loud sex noises" has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gemma Wale, of Small Heath, Birmingham, was given a two-week prison sentence.
A civil court judge concluded she had breached an anti-social behaviour order by "screaming and shouting whilst having sex" at a "level of noise" that annoyed a neighbour.
The details emerged in a written ruling by Judge Emma Kelly following a hearing in Birmingham County Court.
Birmingham City Council took legal action after a neighbour complained.
The judge did not give Miss Wale's age in her ruling but said she had a boyfriend called Wayne.
Judge Kelly said she had also breached the order by arguing with her boyfriend, swearing at a neighbour, "banging around the house" and "running around in the property".
She said a neighbour had complained "paragraph 3 of the order" had been breached at about 05:00 on 29 January.
"Gemma started screaming and shouting whilst having sex, which woke us up," said the neighbour. "This lasted 10 minutes."
The judge concluded: "I am satisfied that during the course of the early hours of 29 January 2015, at around 5am, the defendant was guilty of screaming and shouting whilst having sex at a level of noise which caused nuisance or annoyance to (a neighbour)."
