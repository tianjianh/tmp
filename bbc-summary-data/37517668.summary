England Rugby: Eddie Jones calls up seven uncapped players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wasps flanker Sam Jones is one of seven uncapped players named in England coach Eddie Jones' 37-man training squad ahead of the autumn Tests.

Leicester's Zimbabwe-born flanker Mike Williams is included, as is Wasps' Fiji-born back-rower Nathan Hughes.
Harlequins' 20-year-old centre Joe Marchant, Wasps' Dan Robson, Sale's Josh Beaumont and Worcester's Ben Te'o are the other uncapped players.
And there is a surprise return for Gloucester number eight Ben Morgan.
The back row forward has not played for England since the World Cup last year.
The 37-man squad will gather in Brighton on Sunday for a three-day camp, with the final squad to be announced on 26 October.
England's first game of the autumn series is against South Africa on Saturday, 12 November, before matches against Fiji, Argentina and Australia.
With James Haskell and Jack Clifford ruled out by injury, Wasps flanker Jones is now a prime contender to play at open-side against the Springboks.
"We're not looking for your traditional seven [open-side flanker] because at the moment we don't have that in England," said Jones.
"We're looking for a more destructive, defensive-type player like a Haskell, so Sam Jones and Mike Williams come into that category."
Haskell will attend the camp but will not train as he continues his recovery from the toe injury that finally gave up on him in the second-Test win against Australia this summer.
Saracens' fly-half Alex Lozowski has been included in a wider 45-man Elite Player Squad, but will be not be part of next week's training camp.
Northampton back rower Teimana Harrison and Exeter back Ollie Devoto will both be involved in the camp next week, but have not been named in the Elite Player Squad.
Captain and hooker Dylan Hartley and fly-half/inside centre Owen Farrell, who are both injury concerns as they are yet to return to action as they recover from back problems, will attend the training squad.
"Owen's injury is one of those where you never really know how long it's going to take to repair," said Jones.
"But he is the sort of player who can come back very quickly. He needs only a small amount of game time, so we're still confident he can be ready for November."
Notable absentees from the 45-man elite squad include Tom Youngs, Tom Wood, Luther Burrell and Danny Cipriani.
"They're are some disappointed players out there but it's not the end of the road for those guys," said Jones.
Expanding on Cipriani's omission, Jones said: "It was a difficult conversation. Danny knows what he's got to do. He's a talented player but at the moment he's not number one or two in England in terms of stand-offs.
"I don't see him as someone who comes in as [third or fourth choice]. He likes to be the main man. When he plays well enough, he'll be in the squad."
Jones also confirmed that England Under-20 backs and attack coach Rory Teague will join his staff in November as a part-time skills coach.

"The 45-man Elite Player Squad is a type of legal agreement between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership clubs, and so it includes long-term injured players such as Haskell, Tuilagi and Clifford.
"Of far more relevance ahead of the autumn internationals is the 37-man training squad. All these players are fit - or nearly fit - for selection, and barring further injury it's from this group of players that Eddie Jones will select his matchday squad to take on South Africa." CJ
