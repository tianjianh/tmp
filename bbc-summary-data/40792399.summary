Manu Vatuvei's first try in the English game put Salford ahead before Albert Kelly and Tuimavave hit back for Hull.
Niall Evalds and Robert Lui scored as Salford led again, only for Jake Connor's penalty to bring Hull level.
Second-half Hull tries from Fetuli Talanoa, Connor and Tuimavave ensured victory before Vatuvei got a second.
While the double from New Zealand winger Vatuvei ensured he marked his Super League debut in fine fashion, it was not enough to inspire the Red Devils to victory on what was their first Super 8s fixture, having twice previously fought for Super League survival via The Qualifiers competition.
Defeat extended Salford's losing run to five matches, including their exit from the Challenge Cup at the semi-final stage to Wigan a week earlier.
Hull, the Challenge Cup holders who booked a Wembley final return with victory over Leeds last weekend, boosted their Super League semi-final aspirations with a win that lifts them three points clear of fifth-placed Salford.
In a tense first half, the Red Devils twice had Hull chasing the game, with Evalds coming up with the game's finest individual moment, a stunning slaloming effort from 60 metres out after 29 minutes.
While it was enough to help Salford rebuild their lead, it was short lived as parity was restored by the break and a missed opportunity by the visitors after the interview allowed Hull to race away to an ultimately comfortable win.
Hull head coach Lee Radford:
"I hope the 8s are going to be quicker as that wasn't a great advert for our game and I hope that improves. We did enough to get the result.
"This win sets us up nicely for Saints [in the next game] and I'd love to go and put a sterling performance in against a side in good form.
"It should be a good contest. The next two games are big for us."
Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester:
"We need a win, a feel-good factor about the place again and that confidence.
"You want these challenges, you don't want the challenges we had last year with the Million Pound Game.
"The better players and individuals should be stepping up to the plate now and saying that this is the level they want to be playing at, this is the level for me, and putting their best performances out there. Some are and some aren't."
