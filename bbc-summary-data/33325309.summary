[SN]TITLE[SN]
New platform to give views over Loch Maree

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has started on building a new viewing platform overlooking Loch Maree in Wester Ross.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will replace a view point destroyed by trees blown down by strong winds more than 10 years ago.
Forestry Commission Scotland said the new platform at Slattadale would be an improvement on the old one.
Loch Maree near Kinlochewe has been regarded as one of Scotland's most picturesque lochs and has more than 60 islands scattered across it.
The loch was named after St Maelrubha, an 8th Century Irish monk.
