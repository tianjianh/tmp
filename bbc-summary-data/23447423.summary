Large amounts of young roach and other species of fish were found floating on the surface of Pittville Park's lake in Cheltenham.
Park owner Cheltenham Borough Council said low oxygen levels were to blame, with one possible cause being recent storms stirring up the sediment.
Fishing on the lake has been banned until further notice.
The Environment Agency is re-circulating water into the lake in an effort to stabilize oxygen levels.
An agency spokesperson said at least 25,000 fish had been killed.
Janice Peacey, a community ranger, said: "Low oxygen levels could be due to a number of factors linked to environmental conditions such as decomposing algae or sediment stirred up by recent storms.
"The surviving fish now have areas which are oxygenated and we will continue to work with the Environment Agency to make sure that oxygen levels stay at the required level.
"We would also like to remind people that, as always, we would advise against people and pets swimming and paddling in unsupervised, open water."
The authority added that the Environment Agency had ruled out blue-green algae, which can be hazardous.
Pittville Park opened in 1825 and is the largest ornamental park in the town.
