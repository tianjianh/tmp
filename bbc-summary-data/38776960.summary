[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool have loaned midfielder Cameron Brannagan to Fleetwood Town until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brannagan, 20, has played nine first-team games for the Reds since his debut in a Europa League tie against Bordeaux in September 2015.
His first start came in last term's EFL Cup tie against AFC Bournemouth and he has played for England Under-20s.
The move reunites Brannagan with Joe Maguire, who joined from Liverpool permanently earlier this month.
