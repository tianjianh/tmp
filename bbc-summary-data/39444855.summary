[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hawick business boost plans agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has agreed to council proposals on how to spend more than Â£3.6m to boost economic development in Hawick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The funding was awarded to help deal with a series of employment setbacks.
Scottish Borders Council submitted its spending proposals earlier this month including the immediate development of a number of key sites.
The local authority said ongoing negotiations meant specific details of the projects could not be released.
A second phase will see a feasibility studied carried out on other prominent sites in the town.
The council said the projects being funded would provide "new job opportunities to benefit the local community" and also "act as a catalyst for further potential property development in the future".
