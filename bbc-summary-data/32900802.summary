The 30-year-old made 245 appearances for the Royals and was part of Australia's 2010 World Cup squad.
"It was difficult to leave Reading - I had been there an extremely long time," he told Bournemouth's website.
Federici was a free agent after the expiry of his contract, and now joins Bournemouth ahead of their first Premier League season.
"I feel like I'm joining something special and I'm looking forward to working with the manager and the boys. I can't wait to get started," he added.
"I had a lot of success at Reading and the fans were great for me, but I thought it was time I moved on."
Federici is the second goalkeeper signed by the Cherries this week after Artur Boruc, joined from Southampton on a one-year deal.
He played 49 games for Reading this season, including the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, but let Alexis Sanchez's shot slip through his hands as they were defeated at Wembley.
But a career highlight was his injury-time goal for Reading in a 1-1 draw with Cardiff at the Madejski Stadium in 2008.
