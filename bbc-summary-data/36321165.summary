It opened its first bricks and mortar store in Seattle in 2015, with a second to follow this summer in San Diego.
Speaking at its annual shareholders meeting, Mr Bezos also promised new services for Amazon Prime members.
He said he wanted Amazon users to feel "irresponsible" for not signing up to the membership service.
Mr Bezos gave no details about the new services, although it has been rumoured that Amazon plans to launch its own-label food and home products.
Currently users who belong to Amazon Prime, which has an annual fee of Â£80 ($99), can get unlimited next-day delivery at no extra cost as well as access to a video and music streaming service and e-reader Kindle's lending library.
"Our goal with Amazon Prime... is to make sure that if you are not a Prime member, you are being irresponsible," he said.
"We're definitely going to open additional stores, but how many we don't know yet," he added. "In these early days it's all about learning, rather than trying to earn a lot of revenue."
As Amazon mulls expansion into the real world, struggling clothing retailer Gap has said that it would consider allowing its clothes to be sold on Amazon.
"To not be considering Amazon and other would be - in my view - delusional," said chief executive Art Peck at the company's annual investor meeting in San Francisco.
According to a Morgan Stanley report, Amazon is the second-largest clothes retailer in the US, with only supermarket giant Walmart ahead of it.
