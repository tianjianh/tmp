The England international, 26, has been sidelined since injuring his right knee during the Gunners' 2-2 Premier League draw at Manchester City on 8 May.
He had missed the first seven months of last season with another knee injury.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: "It is fantastic. For him, it is like starting a new career because he has been out for such a long time."
Wenger, whose team host West Brom on Boxing Day (15:00 GMT), added he would be "patient" with Welbeck.
Welbeck has scored 13 times in 49 appearances for the Gunners since joining from Manchester United for Â£16m in September 2014.
