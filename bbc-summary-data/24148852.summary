In addition to the pylons, eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables would be buried underground in the Meifod valley.
National Grid has also identified a preferred "secluded" site for a substation, on the Tir Gwynt wind farm.
The wind farm plans have sparked opposition from campaign groups, while a public inquiry is already under way.
Kevin Renddell of National Grid and farmer Rob Whittall, an opponent of the wind farms, give their views.
