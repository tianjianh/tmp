Hatters officials have contacted Orient for information regarding the reported chanting at the Matchroom Stadium.
"Luton Town do not condone any kind of discriminatory chanting or comments from supporters, and any serious abuse will be dealt with," said a statement.
The Hatters won the game 2-1 to move up to fourth in the table.
Orient said on Saturday that the club were "reviewing CCTV footage of the incident and will be sharing all relevant information with Luton Town in order to identify any offenders".
