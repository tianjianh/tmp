The Belgian club expect 9,000 of the 29,000 seats at Jan Breydel Stadium to be empty for the Foxes' European debut.
"Maybe [fans] have the wrong perception of the quality of the opponent," said Preud'homme, whose side play their first group-stage game for a decade.
"The Belgium press says it's not a big team but I say they are."

"If we get Roma, everyone will say 'Roma, we want to see it' but they might eliminate us," added Preud'homme, whose team are 10th in the domestic league after three defeats in six games.
"If Arsenal are here, everyone will want to see Arsenal, but Leicester won against Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea and so on.
"At this moment it means this team are better than the others. Maybe tomorrow people are expecting less from us because on paper they are better."
