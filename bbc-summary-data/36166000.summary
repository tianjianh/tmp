[SN]TITLE[SN]
South Yorkshire Police chief to stand down over criticism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The officer appointed to stand in as head of South Yorkshire Police is to stand down after facing criticism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley will return to her substantive role while another candidate is sought, police and crime commissioner Alan Billings said.
Mrs Copley was made chief after the suspension of David Crompton following the Hillsborough inquests.
She had been investigated over her conduct with another force.
Dr Billings said Mrs Copley did not want "any further negative publicity or criticism to be levelled at the force" and would step down "in the interests of the force and the workforce".
"Mrs Copley will need to stay in post for a very short period of time to deal with pressing matters but, at her request, this will be for the shortest possible period."
While Assistant Chief Constable at Greater Manchester Police, Mrs Copley was in charge of the force's professional standards branch which investigated Ch Insp John Buttress over alleged mortgage fraud.
A criminal case against Ch Insp Buttress was thrown out in 20 minutes, but the force pursued a case of gross misconduct against him and he was eventually sacked.
Mr Buttress claimed he was the victim of "corrupt practice" within the force's anti-corruption unit and complained about misconduct within the force.
Dr Billings said Mrs Copley had "fully declared the details of allegations into her conduct" when she applied for the post of deputy chief constable at South Yorkshire Police.
The report of an investigation by Kent Police into the matter has been given to Greater Manchester Police for consideration.
