The 23-year-old signed a three-year contract after joining for an undisclosed fee from Vitoria Setubal.
"I have to adapt to the new country and the new way of living. I am going to be successful though," he told Rangers TV.
"I will do my best to help me and my team-mates win. A club as big as Rangers has to win."
Cardoso, a former Portuguese Under-21 international, made 23 appearances for Vitoria Setubal last season, having moved to the club from Benfica.
He becomes the second Portuguese centre-back to move to Rangers this summer after full international Bruno Alves joined from Cagliari.
They have been joined at Ibrox by midfielder Dalcio, on loan from Benfica, and former Aberdeen captain Ryan Jack.
Cardoso said of Alves: "He is an amazing player and is one of the best defenders from my country. I know with him I will learn a lot.
"I met Caixinha for the first time in the airport and I spoke to him a lot.
"I like him and what he had to say and he is the right person to put Rangers where it belongs, which is first place.
"I am very happy to be here. For me, this is the best club in Scotland and I will do my best to help us make history together."
Mexican midfielder Carlos Pena and his compatriot, striker Eduardo Herrera, are awaiting the outcome of a work permit hearing by the Scottish Football Association and are also expected to join the club.
Caixinha thinks Cardoso is a future full international.
"Everyone describes him as having potential to be one of the centre-halves of the future with the national team," he said.
"We believe in him and he can perform on the right or on the left, which is good in a centre-half.
"We try to organise the centre-halves by thinking about them as a double and we have four very good centre-halves who can perform together or independently.
"Fabio is 23, so having an experienced player around like Bruno Alves is good - he is a player whose one main characteristic is leadership - so Fabio will feel comfortable and grow and learn from him."
