The cat-eyed snake, also known as a frog spawn snake, from Costa Rica, was found by the man once he got home to his house in Tryst Park.
He had bought the pineapple from an Aldi store on Tuesday.
The snake, which has been named Ricky by the Scottish SPCA, is now being cared for by experts at Butterfly World in Edinburgh.
Catherine Atterton, of the Scottish SPCA, said, "It's not every day that we get called out to attend to snakes found in peculiar places.
"I know not long ago there was a wee lizard found on a head of broccoli so I was quite excited to see what had stowed away on this pineapple.
"We named him Ricky, as he's come all the way from Costa Rica. He's in a good condition and is now being cared for by experts at Butterfly World in Edinburgh.
"We're glad we were called out as without proper care Ricky wouldn't survive our climate. Now he'll be able to recuperate from his adventures."
An Aldi spokeswoman said: "This is the first time we, or our supplier, who supplies all major supermarkets, have received a complaint of this nature.
"All our fresh pineapples are transported in cold storage with additional processes in place to prevent such issues occurring.
"We are investigating this isolated incident with our supplier to understand how this could have happened."
