Benjamin Robinson, 30, and Daniel Hutchinson, 24, took posing and grinning selfies after the thefts.
North Yorkshire Police found more than £3,000 in cash, balaclavas and a screwdriver when they were stopped in their car in Skipton in June 2014.
They admitted conspiracy to steal at a previous court hearing on 23 November.
13 of the world's most stupid criminals
The duo wore balaclavas to disguise themselves during the fruit machine raids, which they carried out across the UK, the force said.
Officers stopped them at about midnight on 27 June on the A65 at Gargrave after they were caught speeding.
Speaking outside court after their previous hearing, Robinson said: "I don't care that [I'm] guilty. I'm not bothered mate. I love it mate."
During a search of their Vauxhall Insignia, police discovered more than a thousand £1 coins and £2,000 in notes.
Det Ch Insp Matt Walker, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "We knew we hit the jackpot when we investigated these lemons."
"These offenders carried out a string of crimes with no thought for the businesses they were targeting - but ultimately their greed, arrogance and affinity for selfies proved to be their downfall."
Robinson, of Harrogate Road, Bradford, was jailed for 32 months while Hutchinson, of Damon Avenue, Bradford, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years.
Hutchinson was also ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.
