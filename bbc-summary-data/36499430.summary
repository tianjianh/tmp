Team GB rower Graeme Thomas says there is no reason why he and the men's quadruple sculls team cannot win gold at the Olympic Games.

Thomas, 27, was selected to be part of the quadruple sculls (M4x) team that will travel to Rio this summer.
"I've got very high hopes for this boat and it's proven all the time, we're kind of trailblazers," Thomas said.
"We've got a lot of ambition. We want to be the first GB quadruple skulls to medal at an Olympic Games."
"There's absolutely no reason why that can't be a gold medal."
Thomas missed out on qualification for the London 2012 Olympics but used the experience to spur him on to Rio qualification.
"When I signed up to the GB rowing start programme, I definitely had my eyes set on London but it was 2009 and they were already a year into a four-year Olympic cycle," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"In the end I only missed out by a second on going to London which is a pretty fine margin given the timeframe.
"It's made me tougher, it's made me realise what's actually on the line here to go and race and compete for Team GB."
The one-time rugby-player played for Preston Grasshoppers before turning his attention to rowing, but plans to do Wales proud thanks to his Welsh father.
"The Welsh link's on my father's side from the Rhondda Valley. I've been down to visit where he grew up and I do feel I've got enough Welsh in me to claim that one," Thomas said.
"It's a great country and I'm proud to be flying the Welsh flag for Team GB."
