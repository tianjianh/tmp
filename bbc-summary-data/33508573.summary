Plans for a wind farm in Dumfries and Galloway have been scaled back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Banks Renewables said it has amended its proposals for Knockendurrick community wind farm in response to feedback during a consultation process.
In its original plans, the developer wanted to build seven 132m high turbines at the site near Twynholm.
Under revised proposals due to be submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council, six towers will be reduced to 115m in height.
The seventh will be 100m high.
Banks Renewables has also agreed to alter the position of the turbines on the site.
They will sit to the east of the site, further away from the National Scenic Area.
The changes mean the output of the proposed wind farm will decrease from 23.8MW to 14MW.
Colin Anderson, development director at Banks Renewables, said: "A wind farm application such as the one at Knockendurrick is very much an ongoing process.
"As always, as part of our development with care approach, we've listened to local people and statutory consultees and I believe we have come up with a more balanced proposal that importantly gives the communities the chance to secure an even greater stake in the project.''
"Knockendurrick community wind farm remains a unique project that can deliver a wide range of benefits for communities and businesses in the local area."
The local community has also been offered the opportunity to buy up to 10% equity in the project - an increase from the original 5% offered as part of the initial planning application.
