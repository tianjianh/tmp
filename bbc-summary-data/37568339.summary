Passengers were forced to take replacement bus services after workmen found the item near Gaer Park Drive, Newport, at about 15:30 BST.
Explosives experts later determined the object was a type of excavation device.
All lines have now reopened but some services have been delayed.
A spokesman for British Transport Police (BTP) said: "At around 15:30 today, our officers were called to the line near Newport railway station after workmen reported finding a potential unexploded device.
"All trains in the area were put on stop while investigations were carried out. A cordon was put in place and explosives experts were called to identify and deal with the device, which was later confirmed to be an item of construction equipment similar in appearance to ammunition.
"The cordon was lifted at 18:15 and the line was subsequently handed back to Network Rail."
