The 31-year-old, whose current deal was set to expire at the end of this season, scored in Saturday's 3-2 Premier League win at Chelsea.
"It's just great to be part of a club like this at the minute," he said.
Republic of Ireland international Ward, who joined Burnley from Wolves in 2014, made 37 appearances in the league last season.
He was part of the side that won promotion from the Championship the previous season.
