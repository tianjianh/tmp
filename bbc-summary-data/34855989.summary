Former Wales captain Jonathan Davies said his death was a "devastating loss" while current captain Sam Warburton tweeted that Lomu was "the first reason I wanted to play rugby".
He has been dubbed a "phenomenon" by Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby legend Sir Gareth Edwards.
Lomu played 10 games for Cardiff Blues in 2005 and 2006 shortly before retiring.
Warburton dubbed Lomu an "inspiration and true legend" while Jonathan Davies described him as one of the game's greatest.

He tweeted: "RIP Jonah you were a true legend and a gentleman. You changed the game of rugby and will be sorely missed. My thoughts are with your family."
Welsh international rugby referee Nigel Owens tweeted that Lomu was a "great player but more importantly a great man".
Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby legend and Cardiff Blues board member Sir Gareth Edwards echoed the sentiment, telling BBC Radio Wales: "He was an absolute phenomenon at the time and indeed has been a great ambassador to the sport and a lovely gentleman."
