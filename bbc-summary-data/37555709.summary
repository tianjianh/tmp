Named the Silk Series, professional and amateur jockeys will compete in nine Ladies' Day races in 2017.
The top six finishers will be awarded points on a sliding scale, with first getting 20 and sixth getting two.
The overall winner will win The Tufnell Trophy in memory of Meriel Tufnell MBE, who was Great Britain's first female Champion Jockey in 1972.
The new series has been announced during Women's Sport Week.
"This will be a great boost to the opportunities available to female amateur jockeys next year," said amateur jockey Hayley Moore.
"It is always positive to have a chance to race against professional jockeys for good prize money on racedays with big crowds and The Silk Series promises to deliver all of these things.
"I hope to have the chance to ride in several of the races and even have a go at competing for The Tufnell Trophy."
