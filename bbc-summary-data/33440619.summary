James Reilly and Ted Simpson have to beat a time of five hours and 19 minutes to set a new record.
The pair plan to attempt the 23 mile (36km) loch on 16 July.
Mr Reilly from Guernsey is studying medicine at the University of Bristol and Mr Simpson is a history student at the University of Edinburgh.
They have already done some training on the loch and the Caledonian Canal.
Their record bid will raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.
Loch Ness has been the focus of other feats in the past.
In 2011, former Hearts FC owner Vladimir Romanov was among a group who made a bid to make the fastest width crossing of the loch by swimming.
And in 2010, a team of women completed a swim-relay up the 23-mile length of Loch Ness.
They finished the relay in 13 hours and 23 minutes.
The members of London's Serpentine Swimming Club, who had tartan swim suits specially made for the challenge, had expected to take about 18 hours.
