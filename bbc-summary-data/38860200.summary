[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The masters of two vessels that collided in the Humber during thick fog have been fined Â£3,000 each.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull Magistrates' Court heard a catalogue of failures resulted in one of the vessels sinking after colliding with a larger transport ship.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency prosecuted David Carlin and Thomas Neilsen after the 19 May incident.
The court heard the men had "shown a blatant disregard for the rules designed to prevent collisions at sea".
The coastguard agency said Mr Carlin left Grimsby Docks in the early hours making his way to Hull in his 15m (50ft) vessel, Peggotty.

Despite the thick fog, he failed to comply with a number of regulations to keep his and other vessels safe, the court was told.
These included failing to make his vessel's radar operational, failing to make sound signals and failing to ensure all the navigation lights were working.
He had also not prepared an effective plan for the journey and was relying on an untested mobile phone app, the court heard.
At the same time, Mr Neilsen, from Denmark, was on the bridge and in charge of the Petunia Seaway, a 200m (656ft) transport vessel making its way down the Humber towards Grimsby.
The court heard he allowed the vessel to move at speeds of 14 knots (about 16mph) in zero visibility.
He also neglected to properly monitor the ship's radar, and "failed to spot they were bearing down on the other boat".
After the incident, the crew of the smaller boat were rescued before it sank.
Gwen Lancaster, from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said the collision could "easily have resulted in far worse consequences for those onboard the Peggotty".
"Both vessels were under the command of experienced professional captains who should have known better," he added.
