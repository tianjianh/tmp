He spoke to the BBC from his hospital bed about the attack.
"I was in the library at the time. We were in a gathering of students, a lot of students were with me.
"I heard four men screaming 'kill every student, kill them all'. They were very wild. It was a terrible moment of my life.
"The attackers were equipped with hand grenades and AK47-style rifles. They were killing everyone. It was a horrible and wild attack.
"I ran and tried to escape quickly. A bullet hit me, but I don't know how it happened.
"When I ran, I fell and stumbled. When I opened my eyes, I was in hospital.
"My leg is badly injured. The doctors say I will be all right in two to three months, God willing.
"My best friend Abdul Majid died, and our staff lecturer of chemistry also.
"I can't tell you, I am feeling extreme rage.
"My family are hurt so much. My grandmother is calling me every hour continuously.
"We are ruined by this aggression and the situation of the war. I would like to go to a foreign country because our life is like life in hell now.  I just want to live in a peaceful country."
