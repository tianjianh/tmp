Scotland 1-1 Lithuania: Willie Miller's Scotland player ratings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Did Scotland's World Cup qualifying hopes suffer a major setback by only managing a 1-1 draw with Lithuania at Hampden Park?

Or will James McArthur's late header, after Fedor Cernych opened the scoring for the visitors with a crisp strike, be viewed as a priceless goal come the end of the campaign?
Former Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan's side.
Not much to do in the game apart from that one save from Novikovas early in the second half. Can't really be faulted for the goal. It was hit with power and at close range.
He was exposed a couple of times in the first half, but he's a powerful boy and he defended pretty well in the main. Had a hand in the equaliser as well with that long throw-in. He's a threat going forward.
In the second half, he lit up the Scotland performance and gave the stadium a bit of hope. Every Scotland chance seemed to come through him. He was excellent. A real plus on a grim night.
The Lithuania goal came right down the middle and the centre-halves had a big part to play in that. It was well worked, but the finger has to be pointed at the centre-backs. Beaten in the air in the second half as well and that could have been more danger for Scotland.
Does he get an extra point for the flick-on for the goal? Probably. He doesn't rate at all highly for his defensive qualities though. Hanley and Martin worry you, but is there better out there? That's the question.
Over-run in the first half and taken off injured at the break. Lithuania played some good football in midfield while he was on the pitch and just passed it by him and Bannan.
In the first half, the two sitting midfielders were overwhelmed. Creatively, he offered no real service. He was better in the second half, but I wouldn't agree with Gordon that he was terrific. He was nowhere near.
Very quiet by his standards. He is a talisman but not this time. This was nowhere near a performance that he will be happy with. Had a shot blocked but not a lot else. He's a very creative player, but it didn't happen for him.
Disappointing. He's in the team to get quality crosses into the box and to run hard down his side, but he didn't do it. His delivery in Malta was really good, but not here. I wasn't surprised when he was taken off.
Made positive runs in the first half and I don't know why he was taken off. He was positive and tried to cause problems with his pace and his directness. He was doing his best to try to claw Scotland back into it when he came off.
Had a couple of chances - a shot midway through the first half and a header in the second half. Not scored in 20 league games and didn't do enough. Gordon Strachan said he was outstanding. I doubt if many will agree with him.
Gets a high mark for his goal. Got himself in an unusual position for him and, even if it wasn't the cleanest of headers, it salvaged a point when the game looked like it was going away from Scotland.
Missed a great chance and it looked like it affected his confidence. He drifted out of the game after that.
Didn't have long to turn it around but had a great chance and didn't take it. He had a great sight of goal and either side of the goalkeeper and it was in. Frustrating.
