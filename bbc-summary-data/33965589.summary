Postal staff in the area have been given extra security briefings as a result of the incident.
The military site also includes the Northern Ireland headquarters of the intelligence service MI5.
A small device went off on Friday in a postal van, damaging nearby vehicles and a garage.
It is not clear whether it was a letter bomb, or a device had been attached to the van.
DUP MLA for North Down Alex Easton said: "It was a big shock to everybody who lives around Palace Barracks.
"There needs to be a re-look at security - what's coming into the camp, how it's being dealt with and looked at."
There were no postal workers in the van when the device went off on Friday, but staff have been advised to take extra precautions.
A Royal Mail spokesperson said: "We understand and appreciate any concerns our employees may have and the safety of our people is our number one priority.
"Our employees are regularly briefed on how to deal with suspect packages and have received additional briefings over the past few days.
"All of our procedures are designed to ensure their safety and we work closely with the relevant police and security services as and when required."
The police have appealed to anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
