Almost 200 responses in a public consultation into a new Edinburgh Airport flight path  have been lost.

The airport said the blunder happened during a planned upgrade of the consultation website and it "apologised wholeheartedly".
The airport has now extended the consultation for an extra week until Monday 19 September and urged people to resubmit.
Campaigners against the new flight path said it was "shocking incompetence".
Officials are contacting 21 of the 199 people whose responses were lost, as they had included their email addresses.
Gordon Robertson, Edinburgh Airport's director of communications, said: "Edinburgh Airport has been conducting its Lets Go Further ACP consultation since June this year and has already had an excellent response with thousands of submissions.
"We have identified that responses submitted via the consultation website between 10:31 on Monday 29 August and 00:05 Friday 2 September did not save during a planned upgrade of the site.
"Although this is a relatively small number of responses in the context of the overall number of submissions, we are committed to ensuring that all who want to comment on our plans can.
"We apologise wholeheartedly for this and believe that this extension offers sufficient time for people to resubmit their input."
A spokesman for campaign group Edinburgh Airport Watch said: "This is simply shocking incompetence, even for Edinburgh Airport.
"Their consultation is fatally flawed, and for the sake of their reputation they must scrap this unnecessary and bungled ACP process now.
"We further call on the airport to reverse the changes they have already made to airspace without any consultation that are already causing misery to thousands across West Lothian, Falkirk and Fife, and to seriously rethink their deplorable approach to community engagement."
It follows a report that was published in February by Edinburgh Airport with findings from last year's trial, which saw planes take off towards the Forth, passing over West Lothian.
The trial was held to find a way for planes to depart every minute at peak times instead of every two minutes.
At the time, Stop Edinburgh Airspace Trial said noise had caused "misery" to the public.
The trial was stopped early after nearly 8,000 complaints from 567 individuals, although the report said 57% were not about trial flights but were about aircraft operating on flight paths that have existed since the runway was built in the mid-1970s.
The trial route, which was called Tutur, had been due to run from 25 June 2015 until 24 December 2015.
However, it was halted on 28 October.
No decision will be made on the new flight plan's future until the end of the year.
