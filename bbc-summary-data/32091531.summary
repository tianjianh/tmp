York City Council planning committee has given the green light for work to start on the Â£37m ground at Jockey Lane, in Huntington.
The Minstermen's move comes after the club said refurbishing Bootham Crescent was not financially viable.
The development will include a leisure centre and cinema and facilities for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and York St John University.
Speaking after the meeting York City's chairman Jason McGill said: "This is a once in a generation opportunity that I'm so pleased that the planning committee have taken on board."
A council report said the development would "provide extensive and comprehensive sports, leisure and community facilities that would effectively replace and significantly enhance the provision of such facilities in the city".
It said it would also create "additional employment opportunities both during construction and on completion".
Construction work is expected to begin in June.
