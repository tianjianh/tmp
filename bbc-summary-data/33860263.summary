Culling dairy cows could help solve problems within the industry, a Welsh farming leader has suggested.

Eifion Huws, chairman of the Farmers Union of Wales' (FUW) milk committee, told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf programme "extreme thinking" was needed to halt overproduction.
He added: "Perhaps it's time to bring back a cull for some of the cattle."
Meanwhile, supermarket Morrisons announced it will sell a new milk brand with 10p per litre paid to farmers.
It followed a meeting between the supermarket and representatives from the UK's four main farming unions - the National Farmers' Union, NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers' Union, along with lobby group Farmers for Action.
Some farmers are being paid less than the cost of production, according to the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales.
Speaking on Tuesday morning, Mr Huws added: "Many people may not like to hear us saying that but we're still overproducing, we're producing 40 pints a person extra compared to a year ago and this is one of the roots of the problem."
