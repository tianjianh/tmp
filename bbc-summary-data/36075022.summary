[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dries Mertens scored a hat-trick as Napoli thrashed Bologna to keep alive their slim hopes of winning Serie A.

Manolo Gabbiadini scored twice, while David Lopez added the sixth, in a win which cuts Juventus' lead at the top to six points for 24 hours at least.
Had Napoli lost, Juve could have won a fifth straight title with victory over Lazio on Wednesday.
Victory, achieved without suspended top scorer Gonzalo Higuain, moves Napoli eight points clear of Roma in third.
Only the league's top two sides will qualify automatically for next season's Champions League, with the third-placed side having to negotiate a play-off.
