[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grant Murray, 20, was convicted of attempted murder following the attack on 38-year-old James Martin in Newarthill on 1 February.
His brother, Graham Murray, 30, was convicted of assault for punching Mr Martin and causing him to fall.
Grant Murray was jailed for eight years and his brother for 11 months.
Jailing them at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Johanna Johnston QC told Grant Murray: "Mr Martin was on the ground defenceless and motionless. You did not care if the blows caused fatal injuries or not.
"Even when your brother tried to pull you away you continued the attack.
"This brutal attack left Mr Martin with shocking injuries. He could have died. Your behaviour was brutal and vicious."
Judge Johnston told his brother Graham Murray: "You were convicted of assaulting Mr Martin by punching him repeatedly and rending him unconscious. He had done you no harm."
During the trial, the victim's 18-year-old son, Jordan Martin, told the court that he had gone to collect his father from a pub and buy items from a local shop.
As they walked down a lane, Grant Murray approached them and asked Mr Martin snr for a cigarette.
When he handed one over Graham Murray came over said "don't touch him" and punched Mr Martin to the ground.
His brother Grant then stamped on and kicked Mr Martin as he lay unresponsive on the ground.
The court was told that Mr Martin's jaw was split in two by the force of the blows and he suffered life-threatening injuries.
Jordan Martin said that after the attack he called 999 and flagged down a passing car which was driven by his aunt, Pamela Hughes, who gave first aid until an ambulance arrived.
As Ms Hughes tended her brother, Grant Murray shouted at her: "It was me, it was me. What are you going to do."
The brothers claimed that the assaults were sparked by Jordan Martin hitting them with a shopping bag, but he denied this.
Both were convicted following a trial last month.
