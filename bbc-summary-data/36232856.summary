The only evacuation convoy leaving the Canadian city of Fort McMurray has been suspended due to 200ft (61m) flames flanking the road, officials say.

The police-escorted convoy of 1,500 vehicles was due to pass by the southern part of the city en route to Edmonton and Calgary.
Parts of the city in the province of Alberta have been left devastated after a wildfire struck earlier this week.
Officials had said it would take four days to to move all the evacuees.
The BBC's James Cook, who is in Alberta, says that officials now fear that an oil facility near the  flames could explode.
In a statement released Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called upon Canadians to donate to charities assisting relief efforts.
"I would once again like to thank the many first responders who are working tirelessly, day and night, to fight this fire," Mr Trudeau said.
"To those who have lost so much: we are resilient, we are Canadians, and we will make it through this difficult time, together."
Weather forecasters predict a 40% chance of rain this coming Sunday, which may help to slow the fire's spread.
More than 1,000 fire fighters and 150 helicopters, 295 pieces of heavy equipment and 27 aircraft tankers have been deployed, according to the Canadian government.
Workers and equipment are being brought to the are from all across Canada. Officials say that if more resources are required they may request assistance from the United States.
But Chad Morrison, Alberta's manager of wildfire prevention, said that what they really need is rain.
"We have not seen rain in this area for the last two months of significance," Mr Morrison said.
Without rainfall, officials predict that it could be "weeks and weeks" before the fire is completely out.
Alberta has the third highest reserves of oil in the world, after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Market watchers estimate that up to a third of Canada's oil sands output has been taken offline due to the fire.
The fire now covers an area larger than New York City.
