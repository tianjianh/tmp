South west Wales awoke to a blanket of white although the worst of the weather passed Pembrokeshire by.
Bus services were hit with all routes in Swansea closed first thing while a five lorry crash shut the A4109 near Neath in both directions.
Meanwhile, the Met Office issued a severe weather warning for Friday night predicting further showers.
In Carmarthenshire over 130 schools are closed, about 80 are shut in Neath Port Talbot and over 100 in Swansea.
Swansea Council said all refuse and recycling services had been cancelled until further notice with refuse and parks employees diverted to grit the city centre and to clear walkways.
Many shops in the city centre were opening late as staff struggled into work.
Swansea council said it was focusing on providing emergency services to vulnerable people and clearing the roads and urged people only to contact the authority with emergency requests.
Carmarthenshire council said it had also cancelled all refuse collections while its day centres, meals on wheels service, libraries and leisure facilities had been badly hit.
A spokeswoman said: "Urgent calls have been made for friends, families and neighbours of those who usually receive meals on wheels to help out wherever possible to ensure older people have a hot meal whilst the service tries to overcome the worst of the disruption."
The authority is also appealing to owners of 4X4 vehicles to help deliver food in the Brynaman area and to help to transport staff to Amman Valley Hospital.
Ospreys say their Heineken Cup game against Munster on Saturday is going ahead.
The National Botanic Garden of Wales said it had "little alternative" but to close and it would remain shut for the weekend due to health and safety concerns.
Cor Meibion Llanelli's Christmas concert due to be held at the town's Theatr Elli on Saturday has been cancelled and Llanelli's rugby match against Nottingham has been postponed.
Pembrokeshire council said the worst of the weather had missed the county with most services operating as normal and less than 10 school closures.
But its Highways Department is monitoring the situation with gritting lorries out in expectation of more ice and snow.
