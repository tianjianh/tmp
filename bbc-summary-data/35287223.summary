Shaun Harrad: Torquay United sign Worcester City striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League side Torquay United have signed Worcester City striker Shaun Harrad on a deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harrad, 31, made 17 appearances in four months with National League North club Worcester.
The ex-Burton and Notts County forward finished last season on loan at Cheltenham, scoring once in 12 games as they were relegated from League Two.
"We've signed a proven player," said Gulls player-manager Kevin Nicholson.
"Things maybe have not gone so well for him at Worcester this season, but that only adds to the appeal as I have a good, experienced player on my hands with a point to prove."
