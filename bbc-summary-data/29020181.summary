Now she is using her beautiful and compelling voice to draw the world's attention to the ongoing plight of her people.
"I think music is the most powerful weapon," she tells Africa Beats. "If I can give publicity to my conflict, it's a duty and a satisfaction."
She comes from an artistic family - her grandmother is Al Khadra, a legendary Saharawi war poetess.   Aziza Brahim left the camps to study music in Cuba and now pursues her musical career in Barcelona.
Her fourth album Soutak (your voice) was released earlier this year to high acclaim.
