Bury 1-2 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe went three points clear in League One after winning their top-of-the-table game at Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Wiseman opened the scoring for the leaders three minutes before half-time, only for Tom Soares to claim a 58th-minute equaliser.
But Josh Morris fired in a superb winner in the 65th minute as Bury's five-match winning run in the league came to an end.
Bury had started well, with Zeli Ismail denied by visiting goalkeeper Luke Daniels before Tom Pope headed against the Scunthorpe crossbar.
The Iron replied with Stephen Dawson's cross being deflected against a Bury post, while Soares volleyed wide for the hosts.
But Neal Bishop and Dawson went close for Scunthorpe before they took the lead following a 42nd-minute free-kick.
The visitors worked the ball down the right for Duane Holmes to shoot and after his effort was blocked, Tom Hopper squared for Wiseman to convert.
Bury drew level shortly after the break as Scunthorpe failed to clear a corner and Ismail fired it back across goal for Soares to tap in.
But Morris soon restored the Iron's lead as he curled a 25-yard effort into the top corner - and he almost repeated the feat moments later as he struck the Bury bar.
Jacob Mellis and Soares went close as Bury pressed for another equaliser but their six-match winning run in all competitions came to a halt.
