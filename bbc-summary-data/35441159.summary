Wrexham police station art gallery plans get go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to convert an art gallery into a new home for Wrexham's town centre police station have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrrexham council voted in favour of moving the police station to the former Oriel Wrecsam building on Monday.
Plans had been put on hold on 4 January due to concerns over disabled parking.
The council-run gallery has already been temporarily relocated and will eventually move to a new arts and culture hub planned for the town.
The police's town centre tower block offices are to be demolished.
