Calls to the non-emergency police phone number and the NHS 24 helpline are working again after technical difficulties.

The problems meant some callers were unable to get through via the 101 and 111 numbers.
Police Scotland and NHS 24 had advised those seeking non-emergency assistance to contact them on alternative numbers.
Similar problems were also experienced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Vodafone, which operates police and NHS services, said both the 101 and 111 numbers were "restored" by 13:00.
The company apologised and said it would carry out a "full investigation".
The new freephone 111 number for NHS 24 was launched in Scotland in April.
At the time, ministers said the change made the number easy to remember, while the introduction of the free-to-call service removed any barrier to the public accessing the health advice out of hours.
