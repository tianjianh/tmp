[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru needs a more effective and targeted election campaign in 2016, its former parliamentary leader has said.

Elfyn Llwyd said it was "disappointing" the party failed to add to its three seats at the general election in May.
Mr Llwyd said the anti-austerity message was correct, but he said he shared the blame for not choosing more "eye catching" policies.
He said Plaid Cymru needed "a clearer message" going into the 2016 assembly election.
Mr Llwyd told BBC Wales: "It was disappointing because we missed Ynys Mon by 200-odd votes and slightly more in Ceredigion.
"This isn't meant as a backhanded insult to Leanne [Wood] or the leadership.
"I was part of the team inputting into the manifesto, a very good piece of work, but perhaps we didn't choose from six or maybe eight policies that were really eye catching."
Mr Llwyd, who stood down as MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd after 23 years in Parliament, has not discounted the possibility of a return to politics.
