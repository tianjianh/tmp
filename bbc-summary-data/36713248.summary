Josh Warrington has denied avoiding a fight with IBF world champion Lee Selby and says he postponed his wedding twice to try to arrange one.

In May, Selby said Warrington was "running scared" after negotiations for a summer bout broke down.
"There's no way I'm ducking him - I want that fight so bad," Warrington told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I just want to make sure everything goes perfect, at the end of the year would have been ideal."
"The way they came back was they said I ducked the fight. After that I did cancel the wedding a couple of times, we rang the venue and said it's not going to happen because I've got boxing commitments.
"But I sat down with my manager and my dad and they said 'just don't jump to his bait, it will still be there at the end of the year and if he doesn't want it then that's his problem, it's him who's ducking'."
Selby's last fight was a unanimous points decision win over Eric Hunter in April, his second successful defence of the title he won in May 2015.
Leeds fighter Warrington defends his WBC International featherweight belt against Patrick Hyland on 30 July.
"That fight is there to be signed for November now for Lee Selby," Warrington's promoter Eddie Hearn said.
"Lee is a wonderful fighter he's looking at some big fights as well and maybe we look at another champion but if we wants that fight we can make that fight."
