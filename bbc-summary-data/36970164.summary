Amina Al-Jeffery: 'Tact' required to get 'locked-up' woman home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Further negotiations may be needed to help a Swansea woman return home despite a court ruling that her father must allow her to leave Saudi Arabia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Al-Jeffery disputes claims by Amina, 21, he kept her locked up.
A judge has said the UK courts could do "little" if her father did not comply.
Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, claimed her father took the action against her will after she "kissed a guy".
The judge in the case said she had been "deprived of her liberty" and her father must facilitate her return by 11 September.
On Wednesday, Mr Justice Holman told the High Court the courts in Saudi Arabia would not "recognise the basis of the claim because it does not recognise dual nationality".
Sir William Patey, the former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told BBC Radio Wales it was a "very difficult" case which involved a "clash of cultures".
He said he did not think the UK court judgement was enforceable in Saudi Arabia.
"Amina is a dual national so when she's in Saudi Arabia she is subject, not only to Saudi laws, but to Saudi customs," he said.
"While we think it's very normal that a 21-year-old woman is a freely independent actor, and can do what she likes, that's not quite the same in Saudi Arabia where a single woman is subject to the guardianship of her appropriate male relative."
Sir William added that, while relations with Saudi Arabia were good, the country and the UK had "very different cultures and views on human rights."
He said in Saudi Arabia the case would be considered as more of a "family dispute" rather than a legal one.
Shereen Williams from the Henna Foundation, which supports Muslim families in Wales, has said more negotiations may be needed.
She told BBC Wales: "I welcome the judge's ruling to bring Amina back to Wales and I hope we can find a way forward to make sure that she does come back.
"It's now up to our politicians, our diplomats, our governments to help her come home."
The former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in.
Mr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales.
He has claimed she had become "reckless", taking drugs in her teenage years and that he was "trying to help" her.
He said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities.
Her lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015.
Ms Hutchinson told BBC Newsnight on Wednesday that it had been a "difficult" but "compelling" case to work on.
"I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order," she said.
