The fire service said they were trapped in a bedroom after the fire broke out in a downstairs flat on Railway Road, Leigh, at 03:20 GMT on Wednesday.
Firefighters had to use a nine-metre ladder to rescue them.
Geoff Thornley, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said the two were "shook up but OK".
"The fire was in one of the first-floor flats and we suspect it was started deliberately," he added.
