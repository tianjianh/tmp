Luke Cowan-Dickie: Exeter hooker worth England place on current form - Baxter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie's current form is worthy of a place in the England side, according to Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter.

Cowan-Dickie, 23, has scored four tries in his past two games.
The Chiefs front-row has found himself vying with Jamie George to be second choice behind captain Dylan Hartley.
"I think he'll give Eddie Jones a few difficult selection issues with the form he's playing with at the minute," Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
The Cornwall-born hooker scored a hat-trick in Saturday's win over Harlequins, having also crossed the whitewash in the loss to Saracens six days earlier.
"Luke's playing fantastically well, I thought he was good last week against Saracens and he's bang on form," added the Exeter boss.
"It'll be great to see him carry on that form into the autumn internationals."
