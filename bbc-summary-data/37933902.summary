Hovertravel has said it will offer refunds after delays and cancellations in recent weeks on its services between Southsea and Ryde.
Commuters with season tickets will have up to two weeks added when they renew.
The operator said it was also temporarily bringing its Island Express craft back into service.
The firm said one of the new hovercraft, the Island Flyer, was currently out of action after suffering a transmission fault at Southsea on Wednesday.
Hovertravel said: "We are sorry for any disruptions as we introduce our new craft. We are confident that we will get there."
The new Solent Flyer and Island Flyer, costing Â£10m, were launched in the summer.
The firm said the compensation policy would remain in place until 31 March.
Hovertravel has been running ferries between Southsea and Ryde since 1965.
