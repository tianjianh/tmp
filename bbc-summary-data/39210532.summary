They are among 20 riders heading to the Worlds in Hong Kong from 12-16 April.
Ten riders will be making their championships debut, including Scot Neah Evans and Welshman Lewis Oliva.
"The team is made up of a good mix of experienced and developing riders," said Head coach Iain Dyer.
"I'm pleased to see non-programme riders Neah Evans and Lewis Oliva in Great Britain colours and their selection is testament not only to their hard work but to the support we receive from Scottish and Welsh Cycling respectively.
"It's also great to have some of our Olympians in the squad. This year's Worlds will allow them to race different events which were not possible in previous years due to the focus on the Olympic events."
Four-time Olympic gold medallist Laura Kenny, 24, will miss the World Championships after announcing in February that she and husband Jason Kenny are expecting their first child.
