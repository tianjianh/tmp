The Cumbrians lost 2-0 to their fellow promotion hopefuls but remain fifth in the table and four points off third.
Curle's side did not drop out of the top three between October and March before the recent slump.
"I'll turn results round," Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria. "I'll turn negatives into positives. That's what I do."
Curle continued: "That what I do as an individual, as a professional. I've got the full backing of the board, the owners and the dressing room - before all that starts.
"Those are the negatives which get thrown in, he's lost the dressing room, players aren't playing for him or the board aren't backing him. Watch me do my job now."
Curle has been in charge at Carlisle United since September 2014 and has won 55 of his 141 games in charge.
