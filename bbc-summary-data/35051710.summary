Geminid meteor shower: How to watch it this week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the most dazzling meteor showers of the year is lighting up the sky this week.

The Geminid shooting stars are due to peak overnight on Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 December.
But it's going to be a bit trickier to see them this year because it's happening at the same time as a supermoon - the third one this year.
The light from the closer full moon will make it harder for stargazers.
Meteors are small space rocks ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a pea that enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light.
Most meteors break off from comets, which are dirty "snowballs" mainly made of ice, but the Geminids are different.
The object they come from, the 3200 Phaethon, is more like an asteroid.
As it orbits, the heat of the Sun causes surface material to crumble, before it tumbles off into space, leaving a trail of rocky debris behind it.
The Earth passes through this trail each year as it orbits around the Sun, and we see them glow as the rock burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.
You don't need any special equipment to view the meteor shower.
Find a clear space away from street lights or the light coming from your house.
Give your eyes enough time to adjust to the dark, and look up.
Hopefully, with clear skies, you will be able to spot them as they blaze across the night sky.
