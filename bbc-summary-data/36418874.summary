The defender stays along with Barry Fuller, George Francomb and Dannie Bulman, who have agreed new deals.
"Darius has been immense," manager Neal Ardley told the club website. "This is a guy who just does not want to lose."
The Dons confirmed earlier on Tuesday they had released Callum Kennedy, Sean Rigg and Adebayo Akinfenwa following the club's promotion to League One.
Striker Akinfenwa, 34, revealed his contract would not be renewed moments after the play-off final win against Plymouth.
Akinfenwa leaves after two seasons with the Dons, having been named their player of the year last season.
Midfielder Kennedy, 26, leaves after three seasons with the club and having played in Monday's Wembley final.
Former Oxford and Port Vale forward Rigg, 27, departs after joining on a two-year deal in May 2014.
