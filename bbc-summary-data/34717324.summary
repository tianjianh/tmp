[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales manager Chris Coleman has left Gareth Bale out of his squad for the friendly against Netherlands following "correspondence" with Real Madrid.

Bale will remain in Spain to undergo special training after playing only 45 minutes for Real since 13 October because of a calf injury.
"He misses this game [so] the Madrid medical team can get him up to scratch. It's in our interest," said Coleman.
Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey will also miss the match with a hamstring problem.
Bale has missed Real's past four games but has resumed light training and could feature in the La Liga game against Sevilla on Sunday.
"After correspondence with Madrid, he'll probably figure in the next game for them I'd imagine, but they want to use this time wisely and carefully to get him up to scratch, and we respect that," added Coleman.
"I think Gareth also wants to do what's right and we've never taken risks with players, it's not in our nature.
"It's not that Madrid have said we can't take him, but we've got to look at it and think it's a wise thing to do."

Ramsey suffered his injury in Arsenal's Champions League win over Bayern Munich on 20 October.
Gunners manager Arsene Wenger criticised Wales for playing the 24-year-old in the 2-0 win against Andorra after their Euro 2016 qualification was already secured.
This is the first time Bale and Ramsey will both be missing for Wales since they last faced Netherlands, losing 2-0 in a friendly in June 2014.
Reading forward Hal Robson-Kanu will also miss the Netherlands game after suffering an ankle injury against Andorra.
Walsall striker Tom Bradshaw is included for the first time in the absence of Bale and Robson-Kanu, while defender Paul Dummett returns after missing the last four games in Euro 2016 qualifying with a hamstring injury.
Bournemouth midfielder Shaun MacDonald replaces David Cotterill in the squad as the Birmingham City winger has a knee injury.
