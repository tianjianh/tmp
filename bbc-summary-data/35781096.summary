Mauricio Pochettino: Tottenham boss defends Europa League changes

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has "no regrets" about making seven changes to his side, despite a 3-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie.

Pochettino, whose side are also trying to win the Premier League title, named striker Harry Kane as a substitute.
"I am very disappointed with the result. It was a bad day in the office but we need to accept that," he said.
"We picked the starting XI to try and win the game."
A first-half Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang header and two second-half goals from Marco Reus left Spurs on the brink of elimination before the return leg at White Hart Lane on 17 March.
Tottenham have not won for three matches, their loss in Germany following a 1-0 defeat at West Ham and a 2-2 draw with Arsenal.
They travel to Premier League bottom club Aston Villa on Sunday looking to close the gap on leaders Leicester, who are five points clear at the top.
"I am not worried, I know the circumstances," Pochettino added. "We need to accept some periods during 10 months that we will have good and bad times.
"We have always had things good, it has only been in the last few games not so much. The players are very sad but we have to take the positives."
Dortmund are unbeaten in 2016 and were in control throughout Thursday's game as Tottenham struggled to cope with the German side's swift and incisive attack.
Despite the defeat, Pochettino is confident his players will benefit from the experience, claiming the game against Dortmund was like playing in the Champions League.
"We were disappointed, but it was a very good test for us to compare to their level," said the 44-year-old Argentine.
