Kawasaki's Rea, who has won six of this year's eight races, has 190 points for the season with Aprilia rider Leon Haslam his nearest rival on 140.
In the first race Rea, 28, was a second clear of Welshman Chaz Davies with Dutch rider Michael van der Mark third.
The second race had an identical 1-2-3 with Haslam fourth both times.
Tom Sykes, Rea's Kawasaki Racing team-mate, had started on pole, but faded in each of the races to finish fifth.
Rea won both races in Thailand in March and enjoyed single victories in Phillip Island and Arag√≥n.
In Sunday's opening race, Rea set a lap record on the penultimate circuit to record his sixth win at Assen and the fifth of his 2015 championship campaign.
Pata Honda rider Van der Mark became the first Dutch competitor in the history of the World Superbikes Championship to make the podium when he edged out Haslam.
Rea continued his dominance in race two to stay clear of trouble, while Van der Mark again got ahead of Haslam around the penultimate corner to claim another third-place finish.
Spanish rider Nico Terol, of Althea Racing, crashed on lap four and was taken to hospital for checks on a wrist fracture.
The World Superbikes Championships moves on to Imola next month.
