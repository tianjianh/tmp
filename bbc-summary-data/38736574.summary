A thief who held up an Edinburgh city centre shop with a knife is being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The armed robbery happened at a shop in Rose Street about 18:30 on Monday.
The man ran off towards Charlotte Square with a three-figure sum of cash in a white carrier bag.
The thief was a white man in his mid-20s, about 5ft 10in, of medium build and was wearing an olive green hooded jacket with the hood up. The shop owner does not want the shop identified.
The robber possibly had an English accent and had a tattoo on his right forearm by the wrist.
His jacket had two pockets on the chest area. He also had a black scarf covering his face and a top underneath with two black tassels hanging down.
He was also wearing dark trousers and black shoes with light-coloured soles.
Det Sgt Grady, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a very distressing incident for the female shopkeeper and we are keen to trace this individual as quickly as possible.
"Anyone who was in the area of Rose Street on Monday at about 18:30 and who may have seen something suspicious, however small, is asked to please get in touch with us."
