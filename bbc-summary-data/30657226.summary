The BBC One comedy reached 9.69 million viewers, up from a live Christmas Day audience of 7.61 million.
Call the Midwife was the second most popular show, attracting 9.4 million.
Viewing figures were generally down on last year, with nearly two million fewer people watching the number one rated show than last year.
Irish-based sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys, starring Brendan O'Carroll, also topped the Christmas Day ratings last year, but the number of viewers dropped from the 11.5 million it attracted then.
The Queen's Christmas Message, the most watched programme live, fell to 7th position with a total of 8.04 million viewers.
BBC One had six of the top 10 most watched programmes while ITV had four - the channels shared the Queen's Christmas Broadcast at 15:00 GMT, which was also aired on Sky News and Sky One.
The Queen used her broadcast to highlight the importance of reconciliation between people, speaking of the impact of the Scottish independence referendum, and recalling the moment German and British soldiers put down their weapons and met on Christmas Day in 1914.
Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas special, which saw gymnast Louis Smith scoop the champion title for a second time, attracted 8.98 million viewers, putting it in third position.
Sitcom Miranda, which drew to a close on 1 January in a two-part special, was in fourth position with 8.65 million viewers and an audience share of 30.6%.
BBC drama Doctor Who was in 6th position with 8.28 million viewers, a decline on the 11.1 million viewers last year, when former Doctor Matt Smith was seen regenerating into Peter Capaldi.
ITV's highest rating Christmas Day show was for Coronation Street with 6.65 million viewers tuning in. ITV's figures do not include ITV+1.
