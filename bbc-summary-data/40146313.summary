Woakes, 28, bowled two overs in the hosts' eight-wicket win over Bangladesh on Thursday before leaving the field, with scans revealing a side strain.
Finn, 28, who has played 69 one-day internationals, was selected ahead of Tom Curran, Stuart Broad and Toby Roland-Jones.
England's next game in the tournament is against New Zealand on Tuesday.
Victory over the Black Caps in Cardiff would put England into the semi-finals, after New Zealand's match with Australia on Friday was abandoned because of rain.
Eoin Morgan's side face Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday in their final Group A game.
Finn took 3-54 and 2-49 for England Lions in back-to-back wins over South Africa A this week, sealing victory in the three-match one-day series that concludes on Monday.

England were already likely to drop a pace bowler to make way for leg-spinner Adil Rashid, so it is now a three-way fight between Finn, Jake Ball and David Willey.
As for Woakes, he now faces a fight to be fit for the first Test against South Africa in July. When James Anderson suffered a similar injury in 2015, he was out for almost two months.
