Ashley Keast, 26, was jailed for 32 months in March after he admitted breaking in to a property in Rotherham.
On Wednesday, he was jailed for a further four years after being found guilty of making threats to kill.
Keast, of Norfolk Court, Rotherham, was convicted after a trial at Sheffield Crown Court.
The court heard Keast had arranged for a threatening letter to be sent to the victim of the burglary after he was jailed.
He was also found guilty by a jury of witness intimidation and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Keast was arrested in connection with the burglary after he took a selfie on a stolen SIM card and sent it to his victim's colleagues.
PC Adam Broughton said: "Following the original conviction for burglary, the victim in this case felt that justice had been done. Unfortunately, this was not the end of the ordeal.
"The safety and wellbeing of any victim of crime is our main priority and this sentence reflects the seriousness of threats, intimidation and attempts by anyone to pervert the course of justice."
