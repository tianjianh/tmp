Flanagan's previous deal with the Saddlers had been set to expire at the end of the current season.
The 22-year-old has made 35 appearances for the Saddlers, but has yet to play this season, having torn his anterior cruciate knee ligament in April.
"I took the positive from it and I feel like I'm going to come back stronger than I was before," he said.
"Initially my target to return was Christmas, but when I had my operation, the injury was worse than first thought so I'm looking at January now."
