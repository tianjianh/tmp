Second row Craig, 28, broke into the Saints side in the 2011-12 campaign and has made 65 appearances.
"He's a talented player with a good rugby brain and has played well this season," said boss Jim Mallinder.
Alex Mitchell and James Grayson, who helped England Under-20s win the Six Nations, are among the others to sign.
The length of the deals have not been disclosed by the club.
Half-backs Mitchell and Grayson have featured in the Northampton first team this season along with fellow academy players James Fish, Alex Moon and Devante Onojaife, who have also agreed contracts.
Josh Peters, Tom Emery, George Furbank and props Ehren Painter and Toby Trinder are the others to commit their futures to the 2014 Premiership champions.
Saints academy manager Dusty Hare said: "We've been impressed by how much they have improved in a short period of time, both in training and playing at other clubs on loan, but it's important that they are given the space to learn even more."
