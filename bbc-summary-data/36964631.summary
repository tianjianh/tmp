Devon and Cornwall Police said dozens of birds had been "placed" in a line along the central markings of the A35, about 100 yards apart.
A "large amount of feathers" and a discarded seed bag, believed to have been used to move the birds, was found nearby.
It was too early to say how they died, the force added.

"We are also asking for any pigeon fanciers in the area to check their flock to make sure all are accounted for."
