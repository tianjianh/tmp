The first photo from the set of stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Romola Garai has been released to mark the first week of filming.
The award-winning book has sold more than a million copies.
Set in Amsterdam in 1686 it tells the story of Nella played by Taylor-Joy who moves to the city to become the wife of a wealthy merchant.
Nella is given a miniature version of her new home, which is furnished by a Miniaturist, whose creations start to reflect real events in the house.
She then starts to discover the secrets of the house and its inhabitants including her cold sister-in-law Marin, played by Garai.
The cast also features Emily Berrington, Paapa Essiedu, Alex Hassell and Hayley Squires.
The three part dramatisation is due to air on BBC One later this year.
Taylor-Joy, who has starred in horror film The Witch and was nominated for the Bafta rising star award,  said: "I immediately fell in love with Nella's resilience and am so looking forward to telling her story and helping to bring this magical book to life."
Garai described it as a "moving and iconic story" that she was "truly honoured" to be part of.
Author Jessie Burton said: "The assembled cast is perfect to the vision I had in my mind's eye in every way, and I know they'll make magic."
Also released this week was the first image of Benedict Cumberbatch from the adaptation of  of Ian McEwan's award-winning novel The Child in Time.
In the dramatisation the Sherlock star plays a children's author struggling to find a purpose in life two years after his daughter goes missing.
Cumberbatch will also executive produce the 90 minute film, which also stars Kelly McDonald, Saskia Reeves and Stephen Campbell-Moore.
It is also being made for BBC One, but a screening date has not yet been announced.
