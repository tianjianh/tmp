The remains were found by staff at Callington Road Hospital, a specialist unit for patients with psychiatric and addiction problems.
It is thought the body, and the head found nearby, are those of a man and they had been there for six months.
Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust said none of its in-patients had been reported missing in that time.
It is understood the body had been there for about six months and that it may have been recently disturbed by animals.
An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said the death did not appear to be suspicious adding that detectives were studying outpatient records as part of their attempts to identify the remains.
"A post-mortem examination is due to take place in the next few days to try to find the cause of death," he added.
The hospital, in Marmalade Lane, specialises in treating patients with drug and alcohol problems and people with mental health issues.
It also offers psychiatric intensive care for men compulsorily detained, usually in secure conditions.
Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Trust, which owns the hospital, is a provider of specialist mental health services operating across Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire.
