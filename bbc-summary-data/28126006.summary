The man 24, was picked up in the Marlborough Crescent area of the city between 04:00 and 06:00 BST on Monday.
But minutes later he was attacked in a grassed area near Skinnerburn Road, directly under the Redheugh Bridge.
Detectives want to hear from a "Good Samaritan" who stopped near the Metro Radio Arena and gave a man a lift home.
Acting Ch Insp Caroline Ord, of Northumbria Police, said: "This was a horrific ordeal for the victim and specially trained officers are working with him to ensure he has the support he needs at this time.
"Extra patrols are being carried out in the city centre to offer reassurance to people and we would encourage people to make sure they consider ensure their own safety when they're out and have plans to get home.
"We're keen to speak to the Good Samaritan who may have witnessed something in relation to the incident without being aware."
Ms Ord said the attacker was driving a dark saloon.
