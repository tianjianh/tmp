Ed Sheeran, who doesn't have a driving licence, has managed to drive Top Gear's "reasonably priced car" off the show's race track.

The star slid off the circuit at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey while recording his slot for the opening episode of the latest series.
On Twitter he said: "I'm driving for the first time ever today, on a race track, on tv. Wish me luck."
Kiefer Sutherland and Will Smith will also appear in the new series.
Sheeran managed to drive off the test track a few times and admitted he'd never driven a car ahead of the recording.
Johnny Vegas drove round the track in the now retired Suzuki Liana with big L plates on the top of the car in 2003, while Jack Whitehall didn't have a driving licence either and drove an automatic version of the Vauxhall Astra in series 21.
Top Gear's track was added to Google Street View last year.
The show's test driver, The Stig, was followed by a Google car round the 1.75 mile (2.82km) circuit so it could be mapped.
The latest series, the show's 22nd since its relaunch in 2002, is to start with a simultaneous broadcast in more than 50 countries.
The programme will be seen in Australia, Africa and the Middle East at the same time as it is shown on BBC Two.
A further 10 countries including Malaysia, Taiwan and Mongolia will screen it within 24 hours of its UK debut.
Ed Sheeran's Top Gear appearance is on Sunday on BBC Two at 20:00 GMT
