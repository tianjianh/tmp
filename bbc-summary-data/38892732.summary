Manx round pound coins to remain 'legal tender'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man's round pound coins have been saved from extinction, the Manx Treasury has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The United Kingdom's new 12-sided Â£1 coins - designed to tackle forgers - will enter circulation on 28 March. The old, round coins will cease to be legal tender in the UK from 15 October.
But the Manx government said both the UK's old coins and Manx round ones will still be accepted from this date.
A spokesman said the UK's round pounds would be "gradually repatriated".
He said the new 12-sided UK coin will circulate alongside the round Manx pound after 15 October.
He added that they will continue to "monitor the situation" and "consider the introduction of a 12-sided Manx pound coin in the future".
The 12-sided coin was announced in the UK's 2014 budget and has been billed by the Royal Mint as "the most secure coin in the world".
