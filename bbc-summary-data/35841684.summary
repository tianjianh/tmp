Unite says strike by Grangemouth dockers suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strike by dockers at the Port of Grangemouth has been suspended following a breakthrough in a dispute over shift patterns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union Unite said the action was suspended after port owners Forth Ports agreed to hold talks.
Arrangements are being made with the conciliation service Acas, with talks expected to begin early next week.
Unite said picket lines would be lifted and about 80 port workers would make "a full return to work" by Monday.
Crane drivers and loaders began a two-week strike on Tuesday, with Unite claiming that new rotas being introduced by Forth Ports amounted to a "de facto pay cut".
On Friday, Unite claimed that fuel supplies to forecourts in Scotland and the north of England could be hit by the strike.
Forth Ports said only its container quayside operations had been affected by the action.
Announcing the suspension of the strike, Unite regional officer Sandy Smart said: "We are pleased that Forth Port's management have lifted their imposition on our members' shift rotas and agreed to enter into conciliation.
"Our strike action will now be suspended with immediate effect and picket lines will be lifted, enabling full operations at the port to get under way again.
"This is an important first step on the path to resolving this dispute.
"If Forth Port's management approach the conciliation with the same spirit in which they accepted our offer then we will be able to negotiate a mutually agreeable outcome."
The Port of Grangemouth handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.
