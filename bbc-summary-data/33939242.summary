First Minister Carwyn Jones gave a reading at Llandaff Cathedral at 15:30 BST on Sunday.
On Saturday, services were held across Wales to mark the day Japan ceased fighting in World War Two.
They did not surrender until 15 August 1945, days after the atomic bombs were dropped Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war ended in Europe three months before.
Over the weekend, services have been held across Wales, including at St John's Church in Cardiff and at the war memorial in Llandudno, Conwy.
About 300 people joined the parade from Llandudno Pier Head to the war memorial.
The national service on Sunday was open to the public and organised by the Welsh government and Cardiff council.
Afterwards, the first minister said: "These men are not forgotten", adding: "today is our opportunity to remember them".
