[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow and Dumbarton power generator Aggreko saw its share price dip sharply after a warning that it's going to under-shoot its profit target.

A statement to the stock exchange on Friday morning said it was facing problems with the conditions attached to a contract in Bangladesh.
It is also facing challenges from the break-down of security in Yemen.
In North America, it has suffered the impact of the slump in the North American shale oil and gas sector.
It is now being hit by a slump in offshore power provision in the Gulf of Mexico.
Aggreko's statement profits this year are likely to be between £250m and £270m - at least 8% lower than previously forecast in a poll of business analysts. In response, the share price fell 12%.
Chris Weston, the chief executive, will issue results for the first half of this year, setting out his plans and priorities.
The under-shoot in financial performance could hit production at the Aggreko plant in Dumbarton, where its generators are assembled.
A statement in May said: "We anticipate fleet capital expenditure to be around £300m for the full year, with £140m now expected in the first half, reflecting planned investment in our gas fleet.
"As we have said in the past, our model allows us to flex this number up and down, and we will continue to do this based on the opportunities that we see in front of us."
