Watch: Cameron's memorable PMQs moments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron faces his final Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, before handing over to Theresa May. Here are some memorable PMQs moments from his time at the despatch box.

Making his debut against Tony Blair in December 2005, this was perhaps Mr Cameron's most famous PMQs line.
Most of Mr Cameron's despatch box duels as PM were with former Labour leader Ed Miliband. In one of their early exchanges in December 2010, Mr Milband said allies of Mr Cameron described themselves as "children of Thatcher".
To roars from his backbenches, the PM hit back: "I would rather be a child of Thatcher than a son of Brown", in a reference to Mr Miliband's predecessor as Labour leader.
It was the then shadow chancellor Ed Balls, not Mr Miliband, who seemed to rile Mr Cameron more than any other opponent, often using hand gestures to make his point. In March 2011, the PM switched from answering a question about regeneration to describe Mr Balls as "the most annoying person in modern politics".
In response, the Labour man leaned forward to offer the PM a glass of water.
Ed Balls again, as Mr Cameron suggested a new gesture for the shadow chancellor in December 2013.
He broke off from reeling off a list of government actions, as Mr Balls pointed downwards, to say it "should be bye bye" - telling Ed Miliband he did not need it to be Christmas to know he was "sitting next to a turkey".
In April 2011 the PM's attempted put-down to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Angela Eagle - borrowing a Michael Winner catchphrase - backfired, with Labour accusing him of sexism.
He later apologised, saying it had been a "lighthearted reference", but Mr Miliband used the phrase back at him in future exchanges.
There were huge cheers from the Tory benches when Mr Cameron responded to Ed Miliband's challenge in March 2015 to give a "straight answer" on whether he would rule out a rise in VAT ahead of the general election.
"The answer is yes", Mr Cameron replied, and sat down.
The Conservatives' general election victory in 2015 signalled a change in Labour leader and a new PMQs sparring partner for Mr Cameron.
First though, he came under fire from interim leader Harriet Harman, who accused of "gloating" at the result and told him to "show a bit more class".
Mr Miliband's replacement was Jeremy Corbyn, who promised a new approach to PMQs and an end to personal attacks.
But when they clashed in February, the PM took aim at Mr Corbyn's appearance, saying his mother would advise the Labour leader to "put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem".
Mr Cameron was applauded at the end of his 182nd and final PMQs as prime minister. He closed proceedings by adapting his famous line to Tony Blair, telling MPs: "I was the future once."
