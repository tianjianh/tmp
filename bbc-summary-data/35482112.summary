Sean Terry: Batsman leaves Hampshire by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire batsman Sean Terry is to leave the county by mutual agreement.

Terry indicated he wanted to secure more regular cricket elsewhere despite being under contract at the Ageas Bowl until the end of the coming season.
The Southampton-born 24-year-old right-hander, son of former Hampshire batsman Paul, made his first-class debut for the county in April 2012.
He made one Twenty20 and five first-class appearances last season, scoring two half-centuries.
