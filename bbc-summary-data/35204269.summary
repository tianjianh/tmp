South Africa have added uncapped seamer Hardus Viljoen to their squad for the second Test with England at Cape Town starting on Saturday.

He is named as cover for Kyle Abbott, who had tightness in his left hamstring in the first Test defeat at Durban.
Viljoen, 26, has taken 20 wickets for Highveld Lions in the first two rounds of this season's Sunfoil Series, South Africa's domestic first-class event.
The Test series ends in January with matches at Johannesburg and Centurion.
"With a short turnaround between the first and second Tests, we've included Hardus in the squad as a precautionary measure to cover all bases," Convener of Selectors Linda Zondi said.
England took the lead with a 241-run victory in Durban after taking the remaining six South Africa wickets for just 38 runs on the final morning.
