[SN]TITLE[SN]
A&E; departments across Wales under 'extreme pressure'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A&E departments across Wales are facing "unprecedented demands", prompting health boards to urge the public to attend only if necessary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At least five hospitals have declared the highest alert, level four, meaning they are under "extreme pressure".
It comes as some hospitals in England declared a "black alert", saying they are "overwhelmed" by demand.
The Welsh government said winter plans were working and the situation was "broadly beginning to stabilise".
A spokesman added: "The last few days have seen further, more severe surges in demand following the festive period, especially for emergency ambulance calls, GP out of hours consultations and attendances at emergency departments - all of which have seen a greater proportion of elderly and frail patients with complex needs."
NHS Wales has four main status levels used to determine appropriate responses, level one indicating a "steady state" and level four meaning the service is under "extreme pressure".
Level four alerts have been issued for Ysbyty Maelor in Wrexham, Ysbyty Glan in Clwyd, Prince Charles in Merthyr and Royal Gwent in Newport.
A level three alert is in place for Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, with level two alerts for the remaining hospitals.
These levels were correct at the time of publication but can change quickly as patient demand fluctuates.
Morriston Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
Singleton Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
Princess of Wales Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
Neath Port Talbot Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
The health board has thanked the public for heeding its advice and attending alterative services such as minor injury units.
Nevill Hall Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
Royal Gwent Hospital - level 4 (extreme pressure)
The health board said it was facing "unprecedented demands" on its services and asked the public to only attend emergency departments "if they really need to".
Ysbyty Gwynedd: level 3 (severe pressure)
Ysbyty Glan Clwyd: level 4 (extreme pressure)
Wrexham Maelor Hospital: level 4 (extreme pressure)
The health board said the increased demand was expected and it had put on additional staff to treat patients.
University Hospital of Wales: level 2 (moderate pressure)
The health board said the service had been much busier since Saturday and urged the public to "choose well" if their condition is not life threatening.
Prince Charles Hospital: level 4 (extreme pressure)
Royal Glamorgan Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
The health board said it had robust plans in place to deal with the extra pressures and urged the public to choose appropriate health care services for their needs.
Bronglais General Hospital: level 2 (moderate pressure)
Glangwili General Hospital: level 3 (severe pressure)
Withybush General Hospital: level 4 (extreme pressure)
The health board said it was putting into practice winter plans as required.
