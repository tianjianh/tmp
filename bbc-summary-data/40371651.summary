According to reports, South Korea sports minister Do Jong-hwan said North Korea could host some skiing events.
He also said the countries may enter a combined ice hockey team.
"We are happy to discuss his ideas. The Olympic movement is always about building bridges, never about erecting walls," said an IOC spokesperson.
"We are looking at the comments of the new minister of sport, culture and tourism with great interest."
The Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will take place from 9-25 February.
In comments reported by the Korea Herald, Do suggested the North and South could enter one women's ice hockey team, helping to make Pyeongchang a "peace Olympics".
He said he would discuss co-hosting at the Masikryong ski resort with Jang Woong, North Korea's delegate to the IOC.
Earlier this month, South Korea's new president Moon Jae-in said North Korea could be part of a bid to co-host the 2030 football World Cup across north-east Asia.
Moon, the son of refugees from North Korea, advocates greater dialogue with their neighbours.
