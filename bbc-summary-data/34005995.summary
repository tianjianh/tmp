[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portadown-based Ulster Carpets has increased its pre-tax profit to £7m in the year to March.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 9% rise in profit came despite a marginal drop in turnover to £61m.
The company said it was a record trading profit with sales increases in most market segments.
The strong performance came despite an increase in the cost of wool and the strength of sterling, which makes its exports more expensive.
The company said trading conditions in the Eurozone continued to be difficult as most countries have failed to "achieve significant growth in GDP".
It added that by contrast the UK economy was continuing to improve, which should increase demand for its products.
In particular, the firm pointed to improving demand for its Axminster products in the residential market.
Employment at the firm rose slightly over the year to 532.
The shareholders shared a dividend of £1.2m, up from £1m in the previous year.
In April 2014, the firm announced it was investing £30m to upgrade its facilities in Portadown.
