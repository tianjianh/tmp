[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire reached the midpoint of their County Championship season with a sixth draw in eight matches as rain prevented any play on the final day of the game against Nottinghamshire.

Following prolonged overnight and morning rain at Edgbaston, an early lunch was taken at noon.
But the decision was then taken at 12:45 BST to call off play for the day.
It is the fourth complete day's play lost by luckless Warwickshire in the Championship this summer.
The Bears took 11 points from a game they had dominated to stay within reach of top spot, having gained two more bonus points from the match than Division One leaders Lancashire.
Nottinghamshire, in seventh, stretch further clear of bottom club Hampshire, but they have not won in eight games since the opening round of the season.
With both Jake Ball and Luke Fletcher having picked up injuries in this game, they now hope to have England fast bowler Stuart Broad available for their next game against Lancashire.
Captain Chris Read could also be back, following over a month out injury, for the four-day game, which starts at Trent Bridge on Sunday.
Veteran spinner Imran Tahir could further reinforce them as he due to arrive on Friday in time to play and, in fact, may make his Notts debut in Friday's T20 Blast tussle with Durham.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM:
"A lot of teams have suffered from the weather this season but of course it is pretty frustrating. That's 740 overs we have lost in Championship cricket so far this summer - nigh on eight days of play.
"When you are looking to play a style of cricket that evolves over the entirety of a four-day game it's annoying when you keep having to try to cram in a result in three days because of the weather.
"It has cost us a few match-winning positions but we still take plenty of positives. The guys bowled beautifully and the way they challenged the batsmen all the way through was high quality."
Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"We have to be realistic and say we were on the wrong end of the game for what was played.
"So, from our perspective, eight points from a draw is welcome at the moment.
"We weren't in a position where we were winning the match at any stage but we would like to think we would have turned it round."
