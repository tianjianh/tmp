[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish breeding project polar bears meet for first time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Polar bears involved in a Scottish captive breeding project have come face to face for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland has placed male bear Arktos in an enclosure next to female Victoria's at its Highland Wildlife Park.
The society said Victoria was showing signs she might be ready to breed, but it would not be until later this month before the pair shared an enclosure.
Polar bear cubs were last born in the UK almost 25 years ago.
Arktos is one of two male bears at the park at Kincraig, near Aviemore.
He was deemed to be more suited genetically than younger male bear Walker for the breeding attempt.
