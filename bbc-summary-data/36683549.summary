Photos of the project spread across social media using the #wearehere hashtag.
Mandy Charlton tweeted this image of the scene at Grey's Monument in the city centre, saying "with all that is happening right now in the country, this really puts things into perspective".
John Wilson, BBC Front Row presenter, captured the scene at King's Cross station this morning, calling the appearance of the soldiers an "incredibly moving tribute".
"I was surprised at how moving it was to see young lads in uniform, as if they were going off to war," says Alan Meban.
The uniformed men have been handing out cards to people who ask them what is happening. Each card details a soldier killed on the first day of the battle.
Madeline Littlejohns tweeted that she had "been handed several of these this morning, so moving".
Barbara Leatham has been capturing events in Salisbury and says that it's "incredible how many people have been touched by the #Somme100 Remembrance scenes".
Gemma Swallow describes the scene in Royal Exchange Square as "powerful and deeply moving".
