Brexit: Nesbitt asks if Assembly was misled over issue of Brexit contingency planning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Stormont speaker has been asked to examine Hansard to see if the assembly was misled by ministers over the absence of Brexit contingency planning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt made the request following the revelation by the Detail website.
It found a report, compiled last May, listed more than 20 ways Brexit could damage Northern Ireland's economy.
It  was compiled by officials in the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
It was not released under Freedom of Information until after the EU referendum was held a year later.
The Speaker, Robin Newton, undertook to examine the matter, but he said another assertion by Mr Nesbitt - that not releasing the report was a breach of the ministerial code - was not a matter for him.
Alliance Leader David Ford confirmed that neither he or his colleague Stephen Farry were consulted over the executive report on the impact of Brexit when they were ministers in the former Executive.
Mr Ford said that if the paper had been made public "perhaps it would have changed some minds in the lead-up to the EU referendum".
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said that agreement was required between the two parties at Stormont Castle before a document of this nature could be published.
He said that Sinn FÃ©in had publicly identified the many challenges listed in the Stormont paper.
Mr McGuinness claimed the revelation of the paper was a "non story" as the arguments had been made and the Remain camp had won the day within Northern Ireland, even though the UK-wide decision was in favour of Brexit.
In Northern Ireland, the majority of voters (56%) voted for the UK to stay in the EU in last week's referendum.
But overall, the UK voted to give up its EU membership by 52% to 48%.
