[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Voges, 37, was struck as he turned away from a Cameron Stevenson bouncer in the Sheffield Shield match with Tasmania.
He dropped to his knees and received medical attention before being helped from the pitch and retiring hurt on 16.
Australia's Phillip Hughes died aged 25 in 2014, two days after being hit on the top of the neck in a Shield game.
Voges will play no further part in the four-day match at the Waca, which started on Thursday.
While playing for Middlesex in May, he was taken to hospital and diagnosed with concussion after being struck on the head by a throw from the boundary from team-mate Ollie Rayner.
Voges is among several Australia players featuring in the current round of state matches between the second and third Test of the series against South Africa.
He scored only 30 runs in four innings as Australia lost the first two Tests.
The final Test in Adelaide starts on 24 November.
