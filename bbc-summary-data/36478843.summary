Huddersfield Giants forward Larne Patrick has agreed a three-year deal with Castleford Tigers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wales international, who is currently on loan at the Tigers, will join the club on a permanent basis when his Huddersfield deal runs out at the end of the season.
Patrick, 27, has made three appearances for Daryl Powell's side.
"He has fitted in well while on loan and we feel he still has a lot of improvement in him," Powell said.
