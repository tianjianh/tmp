Energy bills: Move to clarify firms' cheapest deals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Suppliers who sell their energy through various brands must tell domestic customers of their cheapest tariff across the lot from October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energy suppliers in the UK must already tell customers of their cheapest deal, under regulations set by regulator Ofgem to encourage competition.
From October, they must extend this service to include all brands under their umbrella.
Ofgem said the move was aimed at "regaining the trust" of consumers.
The move will affect licensed energy firms that provide gas and electricity to other retailers and brands, known as white labels, who then sell it to their customers.
Suppliers who operate such arrangements are British Gas with Sainsbury's Energy, and SSE with M&S Energy and Ebico.
"It is important that consumers are given the complete picture about all their supplier's tariffs," said Rachel Fletcher, senior partner at Ofgem.
"We are acting to reduce barriers to white labels entering the market and to ensure suppliers tell their customers what the cheapest deal is for them, whatever brand it is marketed under.
"Transparency about the cheapest tariff that a supplier offers is important in rebuilding consumer trust in the market."
