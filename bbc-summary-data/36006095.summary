Scotland women can beat group favourites Iceland and seal a place at Euro 2017, says coach Anna Signeul.

A Jane Ross double and a Kim Little penalty saw off Slovenia at the Paisley 2021 Stadium on Friday and made it five group wins out of five for Scotland.
They face the top seeds in June, and Signeul believes Iceland's attacking style will suit the Scots.
"They will come at us, we'll need to be very sharp defensively, but there will be more space to attack," she said.
"We maybe need to play a little faster."
The win put Scotland six points clear at the top of the group, though Iceland have two games in hand. The eight group winners and six best runners-up qualify for the finals next summer in the Netherlands.
Slovenia made life difficult at times for Scotland and had plenty of chances of their own before and after Kristina Erman's surprise first-half equaliser.
However, Signeul bristled at suggestions her side looked sluggish.
"I don't think it has anything to do with the amount of games we have played," she said. "I'm very happy with the players' form and shape they are in right now.
"Even if you look at the Sweden game [the recent friendly defeat] and where they were then to where they are this week, you can see they have started to get very sharp.
"We knew it was going to be a tough game. There are a very physical side. They are good football players. They're well organised, they were hard to break down but I think we were patient.
"We created some chances and we could have scored more. We are not happy with conceding the free-kick [that led to Slovenia's goal] but I think getting the goal before half-time meant a lot."
With Scotland leading 2-1 at half-time, a pivotal moment came when Little won and scored a penalty five minutes into the second half.
It left the visitors incensed, but Signeul agreed with the referee's decision.
"He [Slovenia head coach Damir Rob] was very upset with the penalty and came to me afterwards as well, but I definitely think it was a penalty," Signeul explained. "She kicked her, stopped her from taking the ball - that's how I saw it."
Signeul also lauded the strength in depth of her squad, with a number of regular starters having to make do with a place on the bench against Slovenia.
"Joelle [Murray] did really well against Spain, so it wasn't easy to put Leanne Ross and Caroline [Weir] and Joelle on the bench, that was a difficult decision.
"But as I coach I am delighted we have that problem instead of having no competition. We had some really good performances individually as well as a team."
