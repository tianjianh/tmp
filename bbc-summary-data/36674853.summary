Rio 2016: Great Britain name biggest boxing team since Los Angeles 1984

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain have named a 12-strong team for this summer's Rio Olympics, their biggest since Los Angeles 1984.

London 2012 flyweight champion Nicola Adams, 33, is one of two women included, while British men qualified in all 10 weight divisions.
Britain topped the boxing medal table in London with three golds, one silver and a bronze.
GB Boxing performance director Rob McCracken described the qualification success as a "historic achievement".

He said: "It was a very gruelling qualification campaign and to get to the end of it with 12 boxers going to the Olympics is a great reward for the hard work and efforts of everyone connected."
Adams is aiming to become Britain's first two-time Olympic boxing champion.
Her fellow gold medallists in London, Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell, have since turned professional.
Joshua is the IBF heavyweight world champion - he defended his title for the first time on 25 June - while Campbell is the lightweight Commonwealth belt holder.
Professionals will be eligible to compete in the Olympics for the first time in Rio, a decision that has been widely criticised.
However, as Team GB secured 10 amateur male qualifiers, they were unable to take any professionals.
The Olympics run from 5 to 21 August.
Great Britain team
Men: Galal Yafai (light-flyweight), Muhammad Ali (flyweight), Qais Ashfaq (bantamweight), Joe Cordina (lightweight), Pat McCormack (light-welterweight), Josh Kelly (welterweight), Antony Fowler (middleweight), Joshua Buatsi (light-heavyweight), Lawrence Okolie (heavyweight), Joe Joyce (super-heavyweight).
