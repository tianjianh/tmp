Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty for the second successive game as Portugal lost at home to Bulgaria in a friendly.

Marcelinho marked his debut by giving the visitors the lead in the first half, poking home from close range.
Portugal dominated from then on but were frustrated by stout Bulgarian defending in Leiria.
Ronaldo, who missed from the spot for Real Madrid against Sevilla on Sunday, saw his second-half penalty saved after Nikolay Bodurov's handball.
Ronaldo's spot-kick failure was not damaging for Real as his club side beat Sevilla 4-0 in La Liga but it did prove costly for his country as Portugal could not find a breakthrough despite having 30 shots on goal.
