Jersey were unable to repeat their stunning nine-wicket win over Hong Kong as they lost to Papua New Guinea by 24 runs at the World Twenty20 Qualifier.

Asked to bat first in their opening game, Papua New Guinea posted 145-9 in an innings which lacked fluidity.
But it turned out to be more than enough as Jersey were unable to build any partnerships of note at Bready.
Teenager Jonty Jenner top scored with 44, but the Channel Islanders were all out for 121 in the final over.
"It was disappointing to come out on the losing side, but I think there were a lot of positives to come out of today," Jenner told BBC Radio Jersey.
"Papua New Guinea got off to an absolute flyer and we managed to drag them back.
"Without making excuses for today, yesterday took quite a lot out of us emotionally. To win [against Hong Kong], we were all on a massive high and today is pretty annoying."
Fourteen teams are competing over the next fortnight for the six remaining spots at next year's World T20 in India.
The start was delayed by more than an hour because of earlier rain, and when Jersey won the toss they again chose to bowl first.
Papua New Guinea raced to 40-0 from the opening four overs, but left-arm spinner Ben Stevens stemmed the flow of runs, first dismissing opener Lega Siaka (26) who was caught at deep square leg by Corne Bodenstein, and then taking a caught and bowled chance to send Tony Ura back to the pavilion.
Jersey skipper Peter Gough kept ringing the bowling changes, giving his attack single-over spells, and successfully upset the rhythm of the innings.
Kila Pala was dropped on 17 on the boundary by Corey Bisson, but he was gone in the very next over bowled by youngster Rhys Palmer.
The majority of the PNG batsmen got starts, but they lost wickets at regular intervals, which saw them stutter to 145-9. In all Jersey used eight bowlers, with Stevens and Anthony Kay both taking 3-24.
In reply, Gough and wicketkeeper Ed Farley struggled to get the ball to the boundary in the early overs, and Gough was caught for 14 after pulling a short ball and failing to connect properly.
Sussex academy player Jenner started to find his stride at the midway point in the run chase, including a huge reverse-swept six, but he was caught by Norman Vanua off the bowling of Willia Gavera for 44 soon after.
It left the Channel Islanders needing 55 runs from the last six overs with Stevens and fellow all-rounder Nat Watkins at the crease, but they both went in quick succession and Jersey's lower order never looked equal to the task facing them and Chuggy Perchard was the last man out in the final over.
The qualifier, jointly hosted by Ireland and Scotland, is the most high-profile tournament in which Jersey have competed, having booked their place in the event by topping the ICC T20 European Division One on home turf in May.
Also in Group A, leaders Ireland made it two wins out of two, beating the United States by 46 runs at Stormont.
