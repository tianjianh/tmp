Sky said the parties were closing in on a sale, valuing it at more than £600m.
It added that a deal between Bridgepoint and Miller's shareholders could emerge during the summer.
Miller Homes declined to comment when approached by BBC Scotland.
The housebuilder is controlled by a division of private equity firm Blackstone,
In 2014, Miller Homes shelved plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, blaming market volatility.
