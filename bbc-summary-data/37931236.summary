Keith Bertschin: Solihull Moors appoint former Birmingham striker as head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League side Solihull Moors have appointed former Ipswich, Birmingham and Norwich striker Keith Bertschin as their new head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 60-year-old replaces Marcus Bignot, who left to take over League Two club Grimsby Town on Monday.
Bertschin has previously worked as Steve Bruce's assistant at Birmingham, Wigan, Sunderland and Hull.
His first match in charge of the Moors, who are 15th in the table, will be Saturday's home game against Dover.
The club say Bertschin will be supported by captain Theo Streete, goalkeeping coach Darren Acton and academy manager Mark Fogarty for Saturday's game, but that a further coaching appointment will be made "in the near future".
Bignot's assistant Micky Moore also left the club to move to Grimsby.
