[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has set off for Nepal to become a self-styled artist-in-residence on the world's highest mountain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derek Eland will spend six weeks at Everest Base Camp recording the experiences of those attempting to reach earth's highest peak.
Using a "diary room", he will explore what it is like to "be human in a different and difficult place".
Mr Eland, from Carlisle, has previously spent time as a war artist with British Forces in Afghanistan.
He will invite everyone who passes through Base Camp to help him with the task, and use sketches, photography and recordings.
He said: I'm particularly interested in the Nepalese and their story of working and living on a mountain that's a goddess.
"But there are also the sports climbers who pay a lot of money to get there, queuing often to get to the summit
"What does it mean for them? Why are they doing it? Why would you risk your life to do something that's on a bucket list."
Following the earthquake a year ago Mr Eland worked with Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Centre - a local charity - helping to raise money for artists and their families.
To fund his present trip he has sought sponsorship, and has held auctions of his work.
The trip will culminate in an exhibition at the Rheged Centre, Penrith in Spring 2017, which will then go on tour around the UK.
