The leader of a controversial men's group whose plans to visit Australia have sparked outrage has not applied for a visa, authorities say.

Daryush Valizadeh, a self-styled "neo-masculinist" also known as Roosh V, created the Return of Kings group.
It is planning to hold worldwide "tribal meetings" on Saturday.
The 36-year-old American said he would go to one in Canberra, but an itinerary posted to Twitter to support his claim does not show a booked ticket.
Instead it shows the American Airlines site's "Review and Pay" page, which is shown to customers one step before a ticket is booked.
Mr Valizadeh did not respond when asked on Twitter to provide further evidence of his proposed Australian trip.
The Return of Kings group pushes an anti-women agenda - it believes men are innately superior to women and oppressed by feminism.
Mr Valizadeh wrote a widely criticised article last year calling for the legalisation of rape on public property as a way to "defeat rape culture". He has since said the post was satirical.
His group is planning to hold meetings in 43 countries, but generated a particularly strong reaction in Australia after a university student started an online petition denouncing the group.
Mr Valizadeh's proposed trip to Australia sparked widespread outrage, including demands that he be prevented from entering the country.
But Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement that no-one with his name had applied for a visa.
"People who advocate violence against women are not welcome in Australia," Mr Dutton said.
Australia has previously refused to issue a visa to pick-up artist Julien Blanc and rapper Tyler the Creator because of views they have expressed about women.
