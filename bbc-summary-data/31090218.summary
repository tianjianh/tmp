The academy graduate has scored 20 goals in all competitions this season and his form has helped Spurs challenge for a Champions League spot.
Kane tweeted: "Very happy to have signed my new contract at Spurs! Excited for the future ahead!"
The Walthamstow-born forward has also impressed for England Under-21s, scoring eight goals in 10 games.
He had only signed a new deal in August, but his impressive performances have earned him an improved contract until 2020.
The striker's two goals in Spurs' victory against against West Brom on Saturday took his Premier League tally into double figures.
Kane is widely tipped to be named in Roy Hodgson's England squad for the friendlies against Lithuania on 27 March and Italy on 31 March.
