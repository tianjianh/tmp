Varun Chopra: Warwickshire confirm ex-skipper's departure at end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire have confirmed that former captain Varun Chopra will leave Edgbaston when his existing contract expires at the end of this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old Barking-born England Lions opening batsman had already intimated to the Warwickshire hierarchy that he would like to return home to his native south-east.
He has already been targeted by former county Essex, as well as Hampshire.
But he has now been given permission to officially talk to other counties.
Chopra, who left Essex for Edgbaston in 2010, was appointed captain in September 2014, after leading the Bears to the T20 Blast trophy the previous month as stand-in skipper.
Having deputised for Jim Troughton, he was in charge for the 2015 season, but he was then replaced by England's Ian Bell before the start of this campaign.
In a club statement, Warwickshire said: "Discussions have taken place with Varun since he took the decision to step down as captain earlier this year.
"Whilst everyone at the club is fully aware of his capabilities as a top-order batsman, there is also a need to look at the development of the squad in order to be able to maintain a challenge on all fronts in the coming years.
"Both parties believe now is a good time for Varun to accept a fresh challenge. He is now able to talk to other counties to realise his own career ambitions. In the meantime, he remains fully committed to the club."
