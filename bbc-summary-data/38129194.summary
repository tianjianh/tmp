The council said the incident at Cae Ddol fields in Ruthin could have had "serious consequences" for the young girl's health, although there were no "lasting effects".
David Smith, Denbighshire's cabinet member for environment, said he was "disgusted and disappointed".
"We would urge everyone to be responsible and clean up," he said.
