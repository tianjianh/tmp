A sinkhole appears when the ground gives way and everything above it falls into the resulting hole.
Rocks in the ground can be weakened by rainfall until they crumble or collapse and the sinkhole forms.
Sinkholes like this are very rare and the emergency services are monitoring it.
Homes in the area are not thought to be in any danger
