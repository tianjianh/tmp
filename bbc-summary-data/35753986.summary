Six Nations 2016: England women v Wales women (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales Women have been forced to make one late change to their starting side for Saturday's Six Nations game with England at Twickenham Stoop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Number eight Sioned Harries is ruled out by illness and replaced by Alisha Butchers, with Dragons centre Gemma Rowlands coming in to the replacements.
Back-rower Mel Clay replacing Jenny Hawkins had been the only previous change to the replacements bench.
Wales are currently third in the table after winning their previous two games.
England are top after winning all three of their matches and are the only side that can still win the Grand Slam.
Wales claimed only their second win against England with a 13-0 victory at St Helen's in Swansea last year.
"Going in to the championship, it was always our target to beat England away, as we have never achieved this in the past," Wales coach Rhys Edwards said.
"We have taken confidence from our result last year in St Helen's, and the way we have developed this year.
"We've shown that when we perform we can compete against anyone. We now have to be confident that if we focus on our own processes we can beat anyone."
