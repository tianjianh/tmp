Astana rider Fuglsang, 32, crossed the line in a photo-finish with Porte and defending champion Chris Froome at the end of the 147.5km stage.
Porte now has a 39-second lead over Froome in the general classification.
The leader after stage five, Belgium's Thomas de Gendt, lost over eight minutes and is now 30th overall.
Fugsang said: "There has been a lot of bad luck for our team this year, but finally everything seems to come together. We start to be competitive.
"Luckily it is at the right time just before the Tour de France."
The race continues in the mountains for the final two days. The Tour de France starts on 1 July.
