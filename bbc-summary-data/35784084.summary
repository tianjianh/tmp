The performer then forgot to switch his microphone off as he was sick.
Ramsey was only a few minutes from the end of his show at Aberdeen Music Hall when he felt sick.
The comedian, who was performing in the Granite City as part of a UK-wide tour, had earlier warned his audience that he was unwell.
He told fans on his twitter: "As a lot of you will already know, I had to run off stage last night in Aberdeen and projectile vomit was all over the place. It was beyond grim."
As well as stand-up, Ramsey starred as Jack Pearson in BBC Two sitcom Hebburn, set near his home town of South Shields in north east England.
Ramsey has also appeared on the BBC's Live at the Apollo and is a regular panellist on Channel 4 series Celebrity Juice.
