Abdul Basit said no meetings were currently scheduled between the foreign secretaries of the two countries.
Diplomatic talks were postponed after an attack on an Indian air base in January which Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
Pakistani investigators were in India recently to investigate the attack on the base in Pathankot.
Indian media reports said that the team had told the Pakistan government the attack had been "staged" by India.
Last month, Pakistan also said it arrested an Indian spy in the restive Balochistan province.
India denied the allegations, but said the man was an Indian national and a retired naval officer.
Mr Basit told foreign journalists on Thursday that his country would like to have a comprehensive dialogue with Delhi to resolve their outstanding issues and were willing to wait if India isn't ready.
"As of now there is no date for the foreign secretary talks. I think you can say for now that the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue is suspended. Let's see if we can commence the process," he said.
However, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry told The Hindu newspaper that the "countries are in contact" to work out dates for talks between the two foreign secretaries.
India accused Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammad of carrying out the assault in January.
Seven Indian soldiers and six militants were killed in the attack.
