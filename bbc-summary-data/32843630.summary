They will visit the British Memorial at Dunkirk Military Cemetery on Friday, 75 years after the evacuation.
A series of events is planned at the French town this weekend to commemorate the rescue of Allied troops.
On Thursday, about 50 "little ships" involved in the evacuation of troops from its beaches sailed from Kent. Such a trip is staged every five years.
Operation Dynamo, between 26 May and 4 June 1940, saw hundreds of boats of all types rescue 338,000 troops from France after they had retreated from Nazi forces.
This year's main commemorative event will be on Saturday, when an official service will take place at the Allied Beach Memorial in Dunkirk.
There will then be a parade of military vehicles and bands through the streets.
On Sunday a memorial plaque will be unveiled at the site of the MV Crested Eagle, a paddle steamer which was sunk with 300 soldiers on board.
There will also be a commemorative service for the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships (ADLS) on the quayside in Dunkirk.
The ADLS has organised sailings across the English Channel since 1970 in honour of the fishing boats, pleasure yachts and lifeboats that took part.
In 1940, their crews had heeded the government's request to help British, French and Belgian troops stranded after a German advance.
Historians say if the evacuation had not been a success, the allied war effort may have been critically damaged.
Among those sailing with the ADLS was Michael Bentall, 94, who came over from Ontario in Canada for the event.
In 1940 he was a soldier in the 4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, and marched almost 120 miles to the beaches near Dunkirk to escape the German advance.
Eventually he found a rowing boat and was picked up by a navy ship during the rescue mission.
He said: "I didn't come here because I was feeling I had to come because of myself, it was for the chaps that I was with.
"I feel very lucky that I managed to get away in one sense, but I am also sad that I lost so many friends, pals and comrades. I don't understand how I have lived so long."
Aside from Operation Dynamo, two other troop evacuations from France were carried out.
Operation Cycle evacuated allied troops from Le Havre from 10 to 13 June 1940.
And Operation Ariel was carried out between 15 and 25 June, transporting many thousands of troops to Britain from locations which included Cherbourg, St Malo, Brest, St Nazaire and La Pallice.
Between Operation Cycle and Ariel, some 191,870 troops were rescued.
