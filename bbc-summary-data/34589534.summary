Stormont talks session like Fawlty Towers says Nesbitt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first session of Stormont talks after the publication of a government report on paramilitaries was like a Fawlty Towers episode, UUP leader Mike Nesbitt has said.

Mr Nesbitt said it was "like the episode where you're told 'don't mention the war'".
The report said the Provisional IRA still had a ruling army council but is committed to the peace process.
Mr Nesbitt said his attempts to mention the IRA army council were rebuffed.
He said he was "admonished" the first time and "by and large ignored on the second and third occasion".
"You cannot hope for a successful outcome if you're going to build this by ignoring the elephant in the room and having on your foundation stone a lie," he said.
Asked if his party would continue in the talks, Mr Nesbitt said they would "try to stay in and argue the case, because we know we are right".
Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy accused Mr Nesbitt of hypocrisy.
He said Mr Nesbitt had "singularly failed to confront armed loyalist gangs who are tormenting their own communities through extortion, drug dealing and murder.
"That is the real elephant in the room."
The government commissioned the review of paramilitary organisations after a police assessment that IRA members were involved in the murder of former IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr in east Belfast in August.
All but one of the unionist ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive left their post in protest last month,
However, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers ended their policy of rolling resignations after the publication of Tuesday's report.
The report said IRA members believed the army council oversaw both the IRA and Sinn Féin with an overarching strategy that was "wholly political" in focus.
"Not a great deal has emerged today.
"Some insiders are predicting that the talks will move up a gear, that it's all been shadow-boxing up to now.
"But [they say] now that we've got that paramilitary report out of the way, that the negotiations will get more serious."
However, speaking on Wednesday, Sinn Féin's Gerry Kelly said the party was overseen by its own executive committee, not the IRA army council.
"That is the sole place where we get instructions from, the ard chomhairle, which gets its instructions from the membership," he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who stepped aside temporarily in September, is back in his post in the first minister's office.
He has warned that the political problems have not been resolved.
His party colleague, Gregory Campbell, said Tuesday's report had to act as a basis for action.
"What we're saying is that report now provides the basis for which everyone has to get those vestiges of paramilitary activity removed," he said.
"They have now set the benchmark and everyone then has to say 'right what do we do to get rid of that army council, what do we need to do to dismantle those structures'."
