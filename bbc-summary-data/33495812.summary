[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New head coach Trevor Bayliss says England's players must take credit for their emphatic win over Australia in the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

England bowled Australia out for 242 on Saturday to seal a 169-run victory in four days and take a 1-0 series lead.
"The players have been heading in the right direction over the last series with New Zealand and I was lucky to come in at this time," said Bayliss.
"They are interested in playing good, attacking cricket."

Australian Bayliss, 52, was appointed as successor to Peter Moores at the end of May but this was his first match in charge, with assistant coach Paul Farbrace looking after the side in the interim.
During that time, they produced a number of attacking displays during the drawn two-Test series with New Zealand and the subsequent one-day international series victory against the World Cup finalists - form they carried over into the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.
Bayliss was full of praise for his players, singling out captain Alastair Cook for his leadership qualities.
"Any win is a fantastic feeling," said Bayliss. "I thought Alastair's captaincy was top notch. It always helps when the players underneath him are playing well."
However, Bayliss warned against any complacency from the hosts.
"The boys are aware that when you beat Australia, the next match is going to be even tougher because they will come back hard," he added.
"There is a long way to go in this series. To win we will have to play some very good cricket."
The second Test begins at Lord's on Thursday.
