Graham Higgins, 28, slashed, kicked and stamped on Albert McDonald in the city's Riddrie area on 15 June 2015. The 58-year-old died later in hospital.
Higgins was also convicted of attempting to murder another man and assaulting two others.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Armstrong ordered him to serve a minimum of 21 years in prison.
Following the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie paid tribute to the victims and their families who have been left "devastated" by Higgins' "mindless violence".
"Whilst nothing can replace the loss of Albert, we hope this conviction brings some measure of comfort to those closest to him and sends out a clear message that such crimes will not be tolerated," she added.
It emerged after the trial that Higgins already had a lengthy criminal record for offences including assault and possession of a knife which saw him jailed on 12 separate occasions.
The court heard how Mr McDonald was murdered shortly after leaving the Snug Bar, near his home in the city's Duke Street, at about 21:05.
He was seen getting into a silver Audi car that was driven by a person wearing a green top.
Higgins had been seen earlier that night wearing a hoodie matching that colour.
By 21:22 the emergency services had been called after Mr McDonald was found seriously injured in nearby Cumbernauld Road.
He was rushed to the city's Royal Infirmary but died soon after from "blunt force injuries of the abdomen".
Prosecutors said Higgins repeatedly kicked and stamped on Mr McDonald as well as striking him with a knife.
Higgins and Mr McDonald were believed to know one another, but the motive for the killing remains unclear.
The court heard that before the murder, Higgins had already set upon two other men.
He attacked Richard Gachagan in the city's Townhead and later turned on Joseph McLean in the nearby Royston area.
He initially pulled Mr McLean from a car before kicking and stamping on the man in a similar way to how he later assaulted Mr McDonald.
Even after the murder, Higgins went on to glass Paul McPhail at a pub in the city's Baillieston area.
He was held the next day by police after causing a disturbance in Lauders Bar in Sauchiehall Street by throwing chips at staff and customers.
He was finally detained on suspicion of murder in July last year following a high-profile inquiry.
Higgins admitted assaulting Mr McPhail and was found guilty of murdering Mr McDonald, attempting to murder Mr McLean and assaulting Mr Gachagan.
Jailing him, judge Lord Armstrong said the attacks were all on "older men" and appeared to be "unprovoked".
