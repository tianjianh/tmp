Dubbed the "mouth of hell", the building was reduced to about 22,000 tonnes of rubble using more than 2,000 individual explosive charges in March.
Contractors are anticipating recycling about 97% of the materials, a borough council spokesman said.
Stone, concrete and bricks will now be re-used on the site as hard-standing.
The materials will be "crushed and processed on the site" as part of the demolition, which has cost upwards of Â£4m, the council said.
Excess material will be removed from site and re-used within the construction industry for applications such as hard-standings, paths and roads.
The site is due to be cleared and levelled at the end of July. It is being considered for retail and leisure schemes.
