Long-time assistant Dave Kemp has also arrived at The Hawthorns as joint-assistant head coach with Jewell.
Tuesday's appointments come a day after Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely all left the club.
"Jewelly is someone I have known for a long time. When I thought about what I wanted for this post, he fitted the bill perfectly," said Pulis.
And on the departures he added: "It is never a pleasant task making changes because it always means some fellow professionals have to leave the club. I would just like to say that while I only worked with Keith, Dean and Rob for a short time, they impressed me as top lads who I wish well for the future."
Jewell's last managerial post was at Ipswich Town, which he left by mutual consent in 2012.
Kemp and Pulis have worked together since being manager and assistant at Portsmouth in 2000.
West Brom are also looking to appoint a new goalkeeping coach this week, the club confirmed.
