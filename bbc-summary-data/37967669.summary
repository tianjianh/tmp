Coach Joe Schmidt believes Ireland will face a furious backlash from a fired-up New Zealand side in Dublin on Saturday.

The Irish made history on 5 November with a first ever win over the world champions in Chicago and Schmidt knows the All Blacks will want revenge.
"I think they'll come full-strength, fully loaded. Maybe we surprised them a little bit last week," said Schmidt.
Ireland made a full 15 changes for Saturday's 52-21 victory over the  world's 18th-ranked side Canada.
Schmidt will recall all his big guns for the rematch at the Aviva Stadium, while the visitors are expected to be far stronger too.
Steve Hansen's back-to-back world champions were hampered by a string of second-row injury problems at Soldier Field, but will have lock Brodie Retallick back in his unique auxiliary playmaker role in Dublin.
Despite Ireland ending New Zealand's record 18-match winning sequence in Chicago, most neutrals will expect the All Blacks to assert their authority with victory.
New Zealand reacted to their shock loss by running in 10 tries in beating Italy 68-10 on Saturday.
South Africa were the last team to beat New Zealand in successive encounters, back in 2009, further emphasising the scale of Ireland's challenge.
"I read that they didn't really look back too much at the defeat to us before playing Italy this weekend," added Schmidt.
"Well they have that game done and now they will look at us over the next few days, and they'll have a really good plan.
"They are extremely well coached and incredibly well prepared physically, and I think the rate they play at if they have the ball, you're under pressure if they've got it.
"And I think they'll have more access to it if they've got their second row back."
