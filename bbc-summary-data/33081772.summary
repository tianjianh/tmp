James Last: How Sunday Game theme became the sound of the summer

He's the big band leader whose death is being mourned around the world - James Last sold millions of records and was the man behind dozens of iconic compositions.

His music has been a regular fixture on screens big and small over the past five decades.
But across the island of Ireland, Last is best remembered by many for one piece of instantly recognisable music - the theme song from The Sunday Game.
Known as Jagerlatein (Hunters' Yarns), the piece's distinctive blasts of brass and quickstep marching beat have been introducing RTÉ's flagship Gaelic games programme since it began in 1979.
For GAA fans it's considered the sound of the summer - synonymous with car journeys to far-flung stadiums, ham sandwiches on the terraces and championships won and lost on the turf of Croke Park.
It's also an insidious, brain-invading earworm, likely to have you humming the tune all week after hearing even the briefest note or two on any given Sunday.
The song is so popular that when RTÉ replaced it in 2004 as part of a "remodernisation of The Sunday Game", it caused uproar.
The network reinstated it four years later.
Speaking at the time, Paul Byrnes, the programme's editor, said RTÉ had been "inundated with requests from the public" to bring back the theme.
"Travelling the length and breadth of the country with The Sunday Game over the last few years, the replacement of the theme tune was always much talked about and lamented," he said.
Michael Lyster, the programme's presenter, told RTÉ's The Late Late Show in April that "people just demanded that it be brought back again and rightly so as well".
There are some drawbacks to being at close proximity to such a catchy slice of Irish television history though.
"At the end of the season of The Sunday Game, you park the whole thing for a couple of months and you get a break from it all," Lyster told the Late Late Show.
"This is good because at the start of the season, it's all very fresh again and you're ready to go.
"But you hear the Sunday Game music so often and it's not just on the Sundays, but obviously in the office there's somebody rehearsing a piece of footage - and over and over and over again and you get to the point where you think to yourself, if I hear this one more time, I'm actually going to go scatty."
However, Michael Lyster will have to forgive people if they break out a chanted, hummed or whistled version of Jagerlatein in memory of the man who inadvertently gave Gaelic games its iconic theme.
