Gerard Pique headed in a late Andres Iniesta cross, finally breaking the resistance of their stubborn opponents.
Alvaro Morata, Jordi Alba and David Silva had earlier efforts saved as the holders lacked a cutting edge.
Spain had also survived a scare when Cesc Fabregas hooked a Theodor Gebre Selassie header off the goalline.
Vladimir Darida had a chance to equalise but Spain keeper David de Gea, who started the game after a build-up dominated by allegations against him in the Spanish press, blocked his volley from 10 yards.

There might have been a few Spanish nerves after the team's exit at the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and loss to 137th-ranked Georgia in their final warm-up game before Euro 2016.
Spain's goalscoring threat in attack was a worry and any anxiety would not have been helped during a first half in which La Roja had 74% possession and made 378 passes but still failed to engineer a breakthrough.
Morata led the Spanish attack with support from Silva and Nolito, and they were comfortably contained by a disciplined and organised defence.
Spain increased their urgency after the break but it was a similar story as they failed to translate their dominance into goals. Silva's chipped ball put Alba through on goal but the left-back's control let him down, while Silva cut inside and sent a left-foot shot wide.
When substitute Aritz Aduriz put an acrobatic overhead kick wide, it looked like being a frustrating start for Vicente del Bosque's side - but centre-back Pique broke the deadlock in the 87th minute.
"We created a lot of chances - we hope finishing will not be a problem," said Del Bosque. "We had the game completely under control and that's the most important thing."
Pavel Vrba's side had won just one of their past six matches and came into the tournament having conceded 14 goals in qualifying - the most of any team at Euro 2016.
They were happy to sit back and try to catch out the holders on the counter-attack or from a set-piece.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech's impressive saves from Morata, Alba and Silva, as well as resilient defending, kept them on level terms and gave them hope of holding out.
Gebre Selassie's near miss against the run of play almost gave them a lead to defend but ultimately the Czechs failed to keep Spain at bay and have now kept just one clean sheet in 23 games.
Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta: "There's not a single solution to breaking down these teams. You have to keep pressing forward until you get what you want. The goal came the way it came - it just takes patience."
Czech Republic coach Pavel Vrba: "It's disappointing to concede a goal so late. We could have scored ourselves, which doesn't often happen against Spain. We played at our maximum level and it is a shame not to get at least a point."
BBC pundit Robbie Savage on BBC Radio 5 live: "This Spain team are lovely to watch but at times a bit dull and boring - even the fans were just sitting there expecting them to get a goal."
Czech Republic play Croatia on Friday, 17 June at 17:00 BST in Saint-Etienne, while Spain's next game is against Turkey at 20:00 BST on the same day in Nice.
