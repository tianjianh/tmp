Osama Bin Laden's death: Political reaction in quotes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
News of the death of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has drawn reaction from around the world. Here are some key quotes:

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
US President Barack Obama
Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children.
For over two decades, Bin Laden has been al-Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaeda.
Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort. There's no doubt that al-Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must - and we will - remain vigilant at home and abroad.
As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not - and never will be - at war with Islam.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper
Canada receives the news of the death of Osama Bin Laden with sober satisfaction. Sadly, others will take his place.
This does remind us why Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to Afghanistan. Through their operations there to cut off terror at its root, our men and women in uniform have made an enormous contribution to Canadian security at home and abroad.
Former US President George W Bush
This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world, and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done.
Former US President Bill Clinton
This is a profoundly important moment not just for the families of those who lost their lives on 9/11 and in al-Qaeda's other attacks but for people all over the world who want to build a common future of peace, freedom, and co-operation for our children.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg
New Yorkers have waited nearly 10 years for this news. It is my hope that it will bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001.
The Security Council welcomes the news on May 1st 2011 that Osama Bin Laden will never again perpetrate such acts of terrorism and reaffirms that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or group.
The Security Council recognises this critical development and other accomplishments made in the fight against terrorism and urges all states to remain vigilant and intensify their efforts in the fight against terrorism.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai
We hope that the terrorists' activities will be stopped after Osama Bin Laden's death which was his punishment.
And as well, the world should realise what we have repeatedly said all these years and every single day, that the war against terrorism should not be followed in the villages of Afghanistan.
The war against terrorism is not in the houses of innocent Afghan civilians. The fight against terrorism is not in bombing children and women in Afghanistan. The war against terrorism should be carried out in his safe haven, sanctuary and his training camp, not in Afghanistan, and today this has been proved right.
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari
Pakistan, perhaps the world's greatest victim of terrorism, joins the other targets of al-Qaeda... in our satisfaction that the source of the greatest evil of the new millennium has been silenced, and his victims given justice. He was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be, but now he is gone.
Although the events of Sunday were not a joint operation, a decade of co-operation and partnership between the United States and Pakistan led up to the elimination of Osama bin Laden as a continuing threat to the civilised world. And we in Pakistan take some satisfaction that our early assistance in identifying an al-Qaeda courier ultimately led to this day.
Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani
We will not allow our soil to be used against any other country for terrorism and therefore I think it's a great victory, it's a success and I congratulate the success of this operation.
Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf
This was the best... good military action. But, having said that, it was not good politically, the sensitivities of Pakistan regarding the violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan. Before this, we have captured dozens of al-Qaeda operatives, and very important ones. Never have any US troops been involved. It has always been Pakistan's law enforcement agencies, smaller targets, police or rangers or the army. This is the first time where it was intelligence and action by US troops across our border.
Indian foreign ministry
The world must not let down its united effort to overcome terrorism and eliminate the safe havens and sanctuaries that have been provided to terrorists in our own neighbourhood. The struggle must continue unabated.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron
The news that Osama Bin Laden is dead will bring great relief to people across the world. Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the worst terrorist atrocities the world has seen - for 9/11 and for so many attacks, which have cost thousands of lives, many of them British.
It is a great success that he has been found and will no longer be able to pursue his campaign of global terror.
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair
My heartfelt gratitude to President Obama and to all of those who so brilliantly undertook and executed this operation. We should never forget 9/11 was also the worst ever terrorist attack against UK civilians, and our thoughts are with all those - American, British and from nations across the world - who lost their lives and with their loved ones who remain and who live with their loss. 9/11 was an attack not just on the United States, but on all those who shared the best values of civilisation.
The operation shows those who commit acts of terror against the innocent will be brought to justice, however long it takes.
So this is a huge achievement in the fight against terrorism but we know the fight against the terrorism and the ideology that Bin Laden represents continues and is as urgent as ever.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy
The scourge of terrorism has suffered a historic defeat but it's not the end of al-Qaeda.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
The US military has achieved a decisive blow against al-Qaeda with its commando action against Osama Bin Laden and his killing.
Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Terror was brought to many countries on his direct orders and in his name, against men, women and children, Christians and Muslims. Osama Bin Laden claimed to be acting in the name of Islam, but in reality he made a mockery of the basic values of his and all other religions.
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
This is a great result for the United States but also for all democracies. I think that we should not lower our guard because this could provoke reactions in the world of terrorism.
Spanish government
The government considers the death of Osama Bin Laden... to be a decisive step in the fight against international terrorism. The government reiterates its commitment to co-operating with the United States and other nations in the fight against terrorism wherever it is developed or carried out.
European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek
We have woken up in a more secure world.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul
This shows that terrorists and terrorist group leaders in the end are caught whether dead or alive. The most dangerous and sophisticated terrorist organisation leader in the world being caught this way should be a lesson to everyone.
Russia
The Kremlin welcomes the serious success the United States achieved in the war against international terrorism. Retribution inevitably reaches all terrorists.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil al-Arabi
When it comes to the declared death of Bin Laden, Egypt is against all kinds of violence. The Egyptian government does not have a comment.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
This is a resounding triumph for justice, freedom and the values shared by all democratic nations fighting shoulder-to-shoulder in determination against terrorism.
Israeli President Shimon Peres
It is a great piece of news for the free world, it is a great achievement for the security forces of the United States of America, it is a great achievement for the President of the United States, Barack Obama.
This man was a mega-murderer, he killed thousands and thousands of people, people who were totally innocent. He tried to murder people and murder nations including the State of Israel. He reached his end.
Terrorists and murderers are so dangerous. We shouldn't fall victim to believe that they are immune.
Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ahmed Bin Abdul Aziz
We hope that with the death of Osama Bin Laden, an evil has ended. He has been an evil to himself, to his immediate family and to the Arab countries as a whole.
Palestinian Authority spokesman Ghassan Khatib
Getting rid of Bin Laden is good for the cause of peace worldwide but what counts is to overcome the discourse and the methods - the violent methods - that were created and encouraged by Bin Laden and others in the world.
Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas administration in Gaza Strip
We condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior. We regard this as a continuation of the American policy based on oppression and the shedding of Muslim and Arab blood.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
We, like many people in the world, are delighted to see an end to his mentality and his devious ideology. Iraqis suffered a great deal at the hands of this man and his terrorist organisation. Thousands of Iraqis were murdered and killed because of his ideologies.
We as Iraqis have suffered enormously as a result of al-Qaeda and its leader.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Ramin Mehmanparast
US and their allies have no more excuse to deploy forces in the Middle East under pretext of fighting terrorism.
United Arab Emirates statement on official TV channel
The killing of Osama Bin Laden is a positive step that will enhance international efforts for combating terrorism.
Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
The killing of Osama has taken place nearly 13 years after the terrorist bombings in Nairobi that led to the death of over 200 people, in an act believed to have been masterminded by Osama. His killing is an act of justice to those Kenyans who lost their lives and the many more who suffered injuries.
Ethiopian statement
Al-Qaeda has wrecked havoc in stateless Somalia, killed and maimed many innocent people in Kenya and Tanzania, and has for years been engaged in terrorist activities aimed at destabilising the Horn of Africa.
Although the death of Osama Bin Laden does not mean the end the anti-terrorist struggle, it is, nonetheless, a big victory for the global anti-terrorist forces.
Chinese government spokesperson
We have noted the announcement and believe that this is a major event and a positive development in the international struggle against terrorism.
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
We welcome this significant progress in counter-terrorism measures, and I pay respect to the efforts by the officials concerned, including those in the United States and Pakistan.
Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard
Whilst al-Qaeda has been hurt today, al-Qaeda is not finished. Our war against terrorism must continue. We continue to be engaged in Afghanistan so that that country does not again become a haven for terrorists.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, including New Zealanders, in several different parts of the world.
While his removal will not necessarily bring an immediate end to terrorist activity, I have absolutely no doubt that the world is a safer place without Osama Bin Laden.
Mexican government
The Mexican government acknowledges the efforts of the United States in fighting and capturing the head of al-Qaeda... one of the world's cruellest and bloodiest terror organisations.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota
We're very worried that they'll be reprisals. We hope that this event doesn't trigger an attack.
Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino
If the United States managed to kill Bin Laden, they can celebrate it. I'm not celebrating anyone's death.
