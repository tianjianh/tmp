Truro City boss Steve Tully says his side are still good enough to secure fourth place in National League South, despite their 2-0 loss at Basingstoke.

City could secure fourth spot, which they currently occupy, on Tuesday with a win over sixth-placed Whitehawk, as they aim to seal a play-off place.
"We want to finish fourth," Tully told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"We have the players and the capability to do it, but it was one of those days that didn't go right for us."
City face three games in the final week of the season as they catch up following a series of postponements, and Tully believes the extra fixtures might have affected his team.
"We lacked energy in certain areas," he admitted.
"Travelling away, with a long trip on Tuesday and some of the players having to work on Wednesday, it takes time for their bodies to recuperate."
