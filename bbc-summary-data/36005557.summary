The body of Adrian Greenwood, 42, was discovered by his cleaner in the hallway of his four-storey house in Iffley Road on Thursday afternoon.
Police said he had sustained multiple stab wounds to his chest and neck.
A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but police said they are anticipating further arrests.
Det Supt Chris Ward, of Thames Valley Police, said it was likely the murderer and victim were known to each other.
He said: "We believe that Mr Greenwood was an historian, biographer, author and a dealer in art, cars and other historic artefacts.
"He was usually smartly dressed, and often wore a tweed jacket.
"The post-mortem [examination] confirmed Mr Greenwood died following a vicious and sustained attack.
"It is very likely that the offender may have injuries as a result of this altercation."
He urged anyone who had met Mr Greenwood in the last few weeks, either for personal or professional reasons, to get in contact.
