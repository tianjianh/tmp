The painting by Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel is said to be the earliest depiction of Henry VIII's Nonsuch Palace in Surrey.
A temporary export bar had been placed on the artwork in the hope a UK buyer could match the asking price of Â£1m.
Senior curator at the museum Mark Evans said it was a "a beautiful work of outstanding importance".
He said: "Among the earliest surviving English landscape watercolours, it brings to life one of the greatest monuments of the English Renaissance, now lost to us."
The museum bought it with the help of the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and the Art Fund.
Sir Peter Luff, chairman of the NHMF, said: "We felt it essential that this rare and beautifully detailed artwork, documenting one of our most important lost palaces, stay in the UK for us all to enjoy."
The 1568 watercolour is said by Christie's to be the earliest and most detailed depiction of the palace.
The mansion featured a towering facade with elaborate plaster work in a Franco-Italian style and was one of the most important buildings of the English Renaissance.
