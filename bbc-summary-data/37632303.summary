Glasgow and Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg has signed a new two-year deal with the Warriors which will keep him in Scotland until at least May 2019.

Hogg, 24, has scored 11 tries in 45 Tests for his country and toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2013.
Retaining this year's Six Nations Player of the Tournament is a coup for Scottish Rugby given the financial clout of French and English clubs.
"Glasgow Warriors is such a big part of my life - I love this club," Hogg said.
"I've played for the Warriors for five years and it was an easy decision to sign for another two seasons.
"My wife enjoys living in Glasgow and with a young boy and another baby on the way there is nowhere else I'd rather be.
"There is still a lot of rugby to be played this season and then next season I'm looking forward to working with [new Warriors head coach] Dave Rennie when he takes over.
"It means a lot to me that the club and Scottish Rugby want me to stay and I'm very happy that I'm going to be continuing my career in Scotland."
Hogg has helped Glasgow reach the Pro12 play-offs for each of the last five seasons since his debut in 2011, including lifting the title in 2015.

The youngest member of the Lions squad in Australia in 2013, he is a strong contender for a place on next year's tour to New Zealand.
"Stuart works extremely hard in training every day to improve himself and he gets real joy from playing the game," said Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend, who will succeed Vern Cotter in the Scotland job next summer.
"He is entering the best years of his career, as he is in great physical shape and he has become one of our most experienced players.
"The fact he wants to continue to play his rugby in Scotland is a massive boost for the development of the club and it's exciting for our supporters.
"I firmly believe that we can compete with the best teams in Europe and having Stuart on board for another two seasons will certainly help."
Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson hailed retaining Hogg as "a really important signing for Glasgow Warriors and Scottish Rugby".
"It is our intention to keep as many of our best players in Scotland as we can and despite the sharply increased costs of professional rugby we are delighted to have secured Stuart for the next two seasons," he said.
