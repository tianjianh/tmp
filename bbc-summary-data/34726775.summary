"Any player who disturbs or is problematic would be put aside and if I was unable to put the player aside I would leave myself," Belinga said.
"My watch words are respect, discipline and humility - these qualities have been lacking in the team."
Belinga, who replaced Volker Finke on 30 October, is preparing to face Niger in a 2018 World Cup qualifying tie.
The Indomitable Lions play the first leg away on 13 November and four days later they will host the second leg.
"If the players give their best with determination and commitment, Cameroon has a good chances of reaching final phase of the 2018 World Cup," Belinga said.
Cameroon will be without Standrad Liege midfiedler Enoh Eyong, who has a leg injury, and there is also a doubt over the fitness of Marvin Matip - the  FC Ingolstadt defender will be assessed in camp by the national team doctor.
Malaga goalkeeper Idriss Karlos Kameni has been called into the 25-man group.
