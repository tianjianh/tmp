The 28-year-old's latest video, featuring his skills on the mountains on the Isle of Skye, has been watched more than 12 million times on YouTube since it was published last week.
In the film, MacAskill rides along and jumps between the crags off the mountain, which is 992m (3,255ft) at its highest point.
He told Radio Scotland's Fred MacAulay: "The main action plan when I am riding along the high stuff is just not to fall off. I picture it just like a pavement."
A BBC One Scotland documentary featuring the story of the stunt rider's latest film entitled Danny MacAskill - Riding the Ridge will be shown on Friday, 10 October, at 19:30.
MacAskill shot to fame in 2009 when he showcased his skills in Edinburgh.
Earlier this year, he performed stunts on the Finnieston Crane in Glasgow for short films which were shown during the Commonwealth Games.
The BBC documentary follows MacAskill and his team as he tackles the mountain range on Skye, where the stunt rider is from.
He said: "It was a pretty special project for me. I have wanted to ride up there for years.
"I spoke with (filmmaker) Stu Thomson earlier this year and we decided to go and do it. It was really good fun, and we were so lucky with the weather.
"The whole project was a labour of love. I wanted to show off the Cuillins and Skye for the amazing place it is."
MacAskill told the Macaulay and Co programme that The Ridge took six days to make, and revealed the bike he uses in it is worth almost Â£8000.
In one of the most memorable moments of the film, MacAskill bounces the front wheel of his bike off a fence and flips over the barrier before settling down on the beach.
He added: "I think every mountain biker has had a run in with a fence at one point, and I always thought 'could I use that - the bounce of the fence - to have the front wheel flip over the top'.
"It worked out, which is good."
