The Italy international, his wife and two friends, were at traffic lights in the southern Italian city of Naples on Saturday night when they were attacked.
A motorbike pulled level and a masked gunman on the back of the bike forced them to hand over their valuables.
Insigne trained on Sunday is expected to play against Fiorentina on Monday.
The player's agent Antonio Ottaiano said the robber fled with a Rolex watch, jewels and 800 euros (Â£626) in cash and asked Insigne, 24, to dedicate a goal to him during Monday's Serie A match against Fiorentina.
"Lorenzo suffered a terrible experience and told me that it was a really bad moment," said Ottaiano.
Insigne, who has scored 12 goals this season, has been linked with a summer move to Tottenham.
