McLaughlin, who left Liverpool in June, has signed a one-year deal with the League One club with an option for a further 12 months.
The 21-year-old, who failed to make the first-team at Anfield, has had loan spells with Barnsley and Aberdeen.
McLaughlin is Steve Robinson's 16th new signing since he took charge in July.
"Ryan gives us something we haven't got at the moment which is a bit of pace and energy out wide," boss Robinson told the club's official website.
"He is a lad I've known since the age of 12 so he brings a lot of pace, energy and quality. He's had a good grounding at Liverpool so we are looking for Ryan to make a big impact."
McLaughlin is the second player to sign for the Latics in the last five days following former Kidderminster Harriers midfielder Ousmane Fane.
Oldham lost their opening game of the League One season 3-0 at Millwall on Saturday.
