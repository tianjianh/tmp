Rose Polge, 25, whose car was found in a car park near Ansteys Cove in Devon, disappeared on Friday.
Police, coastguards and search and rescue groups searched for Dr Polge in Torquay at the weekend.
Police said it was "totally out of character" for her and concerns for her welfare were rising. The search is expected to resume on Tuesday morning.
Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed an item of clothing had been found at the cove, but would not say whether they believed it belonged to Dr Polge.
Friends and local residents combed the beaches in the area on Saturday and Sunday, while police also searched more remote areas such as cliff tops and woodland.
More than 100 people have been involved in the search operation, including Dr Polge's boyfriend and her family, who live in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire.
Police, a coastguard helicopter and search and rescue helicopter have assisted with the operation, as well as Teignmouth RNLI lifeboat, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service and Dartmoor Search and Rescue Team.
Torbay Hospital on-call Director Martin Ringrose, said: "We are aware that one of our junior doctors is missing.
"Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones at this very distressing time.
"We will do whatever we can to support the authorities investigating her disappearance and searching for her, as well as providing support to her colleagues, who are anxious for her wellbeing."
Colin Smith, from Royston Hockey Club where Dr Polge used to play, said: "We're devastated. We're a big hockey family.
"We've had players want to go down to Torbay, but we just don't know what we can do."
"Our thoughts are with the family."
A police spokesperson said: "We are searching for a missing person and we are extremely concerned for her welfare. The conditions have been rough since she was reported missing.
"We are working with the Coastguard and other agencies."
A statement released by UK Coastguard said they had been called to support the police operation at 18:20 GMT on Friday.
Torbay, Teignmouth and and Berry Head Coastguards have been involved in the search.
Police are appealing for the public to contact them with any information or sightings of Dr Polge.
