Vale took a deserved lead when AJ Leitch-Smith converted Byron Moore's cross.
Jamal Campbell-Ryce equalised just after half-time with a drilled finish and Sam Hird headed the hosts in front.
JJ Hooper's curling shot brought the visitors level, but Gboly Ariyibi turned in a corner and O'Shea's 20-yard shot sealed the win.
The win moved the Spireites up to 17th, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Port Vale dropped to 13th, 10 points adrift of the play-off places.
