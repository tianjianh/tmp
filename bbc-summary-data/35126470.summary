County Armagh native Hinds was known as one of the 'flying doctors' who provided medical cover at motorcycling events throughout Ireland.
Dr Hinds, 35, died after being in an accident at the Skerries 100 meeting.
"We accept this for John but also for the volunteer teams that John was part of," said his partner Dr Janet Acheson.
Mr Hinds worked as a consultant at Craigavon Area Hospital and saved the lives of many riders at spectators in his role which provided fast-response medical treatment at meetings throughout the island of Ireland.
His colleague Dr Fred McSorley said Mr Hinds's death had been a "tragedy".
The BBC award was aimed at celebrating his work as a volunteer within the sport that he loved.
Dr Hinds had led a campaign for an air ambulance service to be introduced in Northern Ireland.
