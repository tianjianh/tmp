The show will follow a format developed by The Voice creators Talpa Media, the Dutch production company ITV acquired last year.
According to the company, the show uses "revolutionary technology to mimic the original setting" of routines taken from pop, theatre or the movies.
Each week one couple will be voted out after a critique from a judging panel.
The BBC understands the show will be broadcast at a different time of year to BBC One's own dancing programme, Strictly Come Dancing.
Dance Dance Dance drew impressive ratings when it premiered in the Netherlands last year.
It went on to win an award for best format at a Dutch TV awards ceremony.
The six-part ITV series will see celebrities join forces with a partner of their choosing to recreate iconic dance performances.
Routines featured in the Dutch version include that seen in Rihanna's Umbrella video and the climactic lift from Dirty Dancing.
Established by Big Brother creator John de Mol, Talpa Media was acquired by ITV last year for Â£355m.
Later in the year it was confirmed that ITV would air The Voice, previously seen on BBC One, from 2017.
