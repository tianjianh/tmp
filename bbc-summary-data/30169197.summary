Twelve teams will be competing in the South American showpiece which begins in Santiago on Thursday, 11 June.
Brazil reached the World Cup semi-final with a gripping 2-1 win against Colombia last summer.
The match was notable for the injury sustained by tournament poster boy Neymar, which ruled him out of the last-four tie against Germany.
Barcelona's Â£75m signing Luis Suarez will miss the Copa America after being suspended for nine competitive Uruguay matches for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during a World Cup match.
World Cup finalists Argentina's group features a rematch of the 2011 final between Uruguay and Paraguay, while Jamaica are one of two invited nations alongside Mexico.
After the round-robin group phase, the top two teams from each section will qualify for the quarter-finals along with the two best third-placed teams, at which point the tournament takes on a standard knockout format before the final on 4 July.
You will be able to follow online coverage of Copa America next June on the BBC Sport website.
