[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British drugs smuggler on death row in Indonesia has been told sentence will not be carried out this year, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lindsay Sandiford, 59, of Cheltenham, has been in jail since 2012 after arriving in Bali from Thailand carrying drugs with a street value of Â£1.6m.
She was sentenced almost three years ago but the government has put a hold on executions until at least January.
A grandmother, she is raising money in the hope of lodging an appeal.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo previously said there would be no clemency for more than 60 people convicted of drug offences, and two rounds of executions were carried out earlier this year.
The attorney-general's office in Indonesia told the BBC there were no plans for the third round of executions "in the near future" due to the government's focus on the current economic situation.
Ms Sandiford's lawyers have argued she was pressured into smuggling the drugs by a criminal gang.
Alongside her appeal, an online petition calling on the British government to fund her legal expenses has been signed by 2,500 people.
The Foreign Office (FCO) said it was a long-standing policy of the UK to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances.
A spokesman added: "It has been the policy of successive governments not to fund legal assistance for British Nationals abroad.
"The FCO receives numerous requests for help with legal bills and cannot provide funding because of the costs and complexities involved."
