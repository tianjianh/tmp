Police were made aware of alleged racial abuse at around 07:40 BST on a tram travelling towards the city centre after a video was posted online.
Two men, aged 20 and 18 and a 16-year-old boy, were detained on suspicion of affray, Greater Manchester Police said.
The video shows a man on a tram at Shudehill being called "an immigrant" and told "get back to Africa".
Footage indicates that the man targeted then retorted with: "How old are you? Are you 18, 19? You are extremely ignorant and not very intelligent. Do you know that?"
One of the men continued to shout "get off the tram now", as he spoke.
One of the group, who were holding beer bottles, then apparently approaches the man and flicks alcohol at him, as a passenger shouted: "There's a baby there - there's absolutely no need for that".
As the youths got off, the victim said to himself: "Seven years in the military," as other commuters told the three, "You are an absolute disgrace.  A disgrace to England".
Police said the suspects were being held in custody for questioning.
