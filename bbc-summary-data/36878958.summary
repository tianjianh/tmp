Randox, the County Antrim healthcare diagnostics company, increased its pre-tax profit by more than a third to £18m in 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turnover was up slightly from £92m to £95m.
Randox is one of Northern Ireland's major exporters, shipping to 145 countries.
The firm continued to spend heavily on research and development, with total R&D spending of almost £9m.
Randox has grown rapidly in recent years.
It will sponsor the Grand National from next year as it tries to grow the consumer side of its business.
At the end of 2013, the firm bought the former Massereene army base in Antrim to develop into a manufacturing and research facility.
Randox's owner, Dr Peter Fitzgerald, bought the 1,200 acre Dundarave estate in north Antrim in 2014.
Meanwhile, another of Northern Ireland's major manufacturing firms, Norbrook, has appointed a new chairman.
Sir Ian Gibson will take over from Sir Roy McNulty from 1 August. Sir Ian has held board positions on some of the UK's biggest firms.
He has previously been chairman of Morrisons supermarkets and the publisher, Trinity Mirror.
