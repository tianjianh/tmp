An Post tells people not to send mail to Ireland over strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Republic of Ireland's postal service An Post has said people in Northern Ireland should not mail any items to the country due to industrial action by some of its staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has advised all international postal services "not to send mail to Ireland".
Thirty-six staff who maintain sorting equipment at four An Post centres are taking strike action over pay cuts.
The staff are employed by contractor IO Systems, but are retained by An Post to work at its four sorting centres.
The company said it had no indication of how long the dispute would last or how long its services would be affected.
Royal Mail has said its customers should be aware that there may be delays in sending items to and receiving them from the Republic of Ireland.
An Post handles about 2.5 million items of mail each day.
It is understood that all automated sorting machinery at the Dublin centre broke down overnight, which had an impact on mail processing.
In Athlone, County Westmeath, machinery for sorting large objects also broke down.
The machines in the two remaining mail centres in Portlaoise in County Laois, and in Cork were functioning normally.
Communications Workers Union official Sean McDonagh said An Post managers refused to repair the machines as that was the work of the IO Systems employees.
He also said the object of the new rosters sought by IO Systems is a cost saving of 100,000 euro (Â£73,500) but the disruption to An Post services resulting from the dispute would cost much more.
An Post earlier urged both sides to avail of the State's dispute resolution institutions to resolve their differences.
