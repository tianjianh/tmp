Jimmy Savile report: BBC culture 'to be criticised'

A report into cases of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile linked to the BBC is set to criticise the corporation's culture, according to a news website that says it has seen a leaked draft.

Exaro said retired judge Dame Janet Smith's draft report says the BBC had a "deferential culture", "untouchable stars" and "above the law" managers.
But Dame Janet does not believe the BBC can be criticised for not uncovering his "sexual deviancy", Exaro said.
The BBC says it has not had the report.
Dame Janet's review was set up in October 2012 by the BBC to carry out an impartial investigation of the culture and practices of the corporation during the years it employed Savile.
The leaked report, which Exaro said was completed more than a year ago, should come with "a lot of health warnings", the BBC's media and arts correspondent David Sillito said.
But he said many of the quotes in Exaro's article "match exactly" with what he had been told during his own investigations.
According to Exaro the leaked draft
Former BBC presenter Savile was revealed to be a prolific sexual predator who abused adults and children across the country after allegations against him first emerged in 2012, a year after his death.
Children's charity the NSPCC said Savile was the one of most prolific sex offenders in its history.
Dame Janet's investigation has interviewed 375 witnesses in connection with Savile.
Earlier on Wednesday the review's website said it planned to publish the final report within six weeks, after being told by police that they were no longer concerned about the report prejudicing ongoing investigations.
In February a separate report concluded Savile abused at least 63 people connected to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire.
