An oil spill in south-eastern Mexico has left more than 200,000 people without water.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The spill, near Tabasco state capital Villahermosa, was caused by oil thieves puncturing a pipeline and has polluted two rivers.
Four water treatment plants in the region have been shut down as a precaution.
Oil company workers have set out containment booms and have been trying to scoop oil from waterways.
Local authorities have asked for help from the army to supply drinking water to those most affected.
They are planning to send tanker trucks to Villahermosa and neighbouring towns.
In the past, illegal pipeline taps have caused fires, explosions and spills in Mexico.
