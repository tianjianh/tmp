Basuki Tjahaja Purnama: Jakarta's governor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known by his Chinese nickname "Ahok", became Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor for 50 years when he took over from Joko "Jokowi" Widodo in 2014.

He is the first ethnic Chinese Indonesian in the post, a significant development given the violent anti-Chinese riots that occurred in the city in 1998.
Ahok had previously served as Jokowi's deputy. Widely hailed as a straight-talking politician with a strong anti-corruption stance, he is ahead in the polls to win the governorship in his own right in 2017.
In both his native Belitung and later in Jakarta, his policies on setting minimum wages, calling for free school education and healthcare, reducing traffic congestion and tackling corruption among government officials have won him widespread popularity.
A technocrat rather than a party politician, he has changed his party allegiance several times.
Some Islamists, however, rejected him from the outset as a "kaffir", or infidel, on the grounds of both his Christian religion and his Chinese ethnicity. These attributes make him a double minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia.
The first Islamist protests were against his 2014 appointment, while the current protests centre on his dismissal of political attacks upon him that cited a Koranic verse, Al-Maidah 51, which supposedly bars Muslims from voting for a Christian candidate.
The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has filed a police report against Ahok alleging blasphemy. The FPI has called on Muslims to converge on Jakarta to take part in protests on 4 November, although more moderate mass Muslim organisations have discouraged their members from taking part.
In 2008, Ahok published a book called "Merubah Indonesia" ("Changing Indonesia", subtitled "Not always forgetting the poor") which sets out his political vision.
"If you want to criticise, you must also offer solutions, so there is always that trade-off," he writes.
On his personal integrity, he said: "I can be bribed, but only at the price of your life."
In January 2016, the citation for an award from former president Gus Dur's family described Mr Purnama as "intrepid and resolute, in tune with the thinking, values and ideals of Gus Dur".
It praised him for tackling corruption in a bid to improve public services.
But some of the governor's detractors are not nearly so polite.
"Sentence Ahok or we will sentence him with bullets," a message posted on social media attributed to Indonesians fighting with Syria's radical Jabhat Fateh al-Sham militant group says.
