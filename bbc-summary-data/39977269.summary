Ian Paterson case: 100 more patients come forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 100 people treated by shamed breast surgeon Ian Paterson have come forward since he was convicted of intentionally wounding patients.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paterson, 59, who was found guilty in April, carried out "completely unnecessary" operations.
Since then, a legal firm is considering 103 more cases on top of 350 due to be heard at the High Court.
Spire Healthcare, which runs two of the hospitals, said it was supporting affected patients.

Paterson was employed by the NHS at the Heart of England Trust, based in and around Birmingham, as well as doing operations at the Spire's Little Aston and Parkway hospitals in the West Midlands.
The NHS trust has paid out Â£17.8m in damages and legal costs after Paterson was found to have carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations.
He was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man and is due to be sentenced later this month.
In October, 350 private patients who had unnecessary operations will seek compensation at the High Court.
Linda Millband, medical negligence specialist at Thompsons Solicitors who is leading on the civil claims said: "Over the weeks we have received more and more calls from ex-private patients of Paterson."
The firm said the majority of the 103 new cases would be pursued if the lead case in October is successful.
Spire Healthcare said independent medical consultants had reviewed Mr Paterson's patient notes.
"Where there was potential concern, patients were invited to attend a recall appointment with a consultant to review their treatment and where further treatment or surveillance was advised this was arranged.
"Whenever a patient contacted us with concerns about treatment from Mr Paterson, they were offered this face-to-face consultation, regardless of the outcome of the medical records review.
"We have also provided counselling services for patients in order to offer appropriate psychological support."
