The 22-year-old will replace New Zealand's Kane Williamson from 18 July and play in all three formats.
Head has played two Twenty20 internationals and worked under Tykes coach Jason Gillespie at the Adelaide Strikers in Australia's Big Bash.
"I can't wait to get over to England and play for Yorkshire, the best side in the English game," said Head.
"To work alongside Dizzy (Jason Gillespie) is also an added attraction. He was brilliant for the Strikers and I have heard so many positive things about what he is doing with the team at Yorkshire.
"To play across all formats is important to me and playing in English conditions will be a good challenge."
Head scored 299 runs from nine innings with an average of 42.71 as the Strikers reached the semi-finals of the Big Bash, although he is not in the Australia squad for the forthcoming World Twenty20.
Gillespie is delighted to be linking up with the batsman, who is set to play in the Indian Premier League with Royal Challengers Bangalore, for a second time.
"The fact that he can adapt to all formats is beneficial to us," said the former Australia fast bowler.
"He will add something different to the squad with his aggressive batting style and his ability with the ball as a genuine spinner."
