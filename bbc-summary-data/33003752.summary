A prized Japanese koi was stolen, then barbecued and eaten by thieves just a few metres from its lake at a pedigree fish farm, the site's manager said.

Allan Joyce, who runs Tranquil Waters Aquatic Centre in High Ongar, Essex, said the carp's bones were found on a bed of coals on the site.
"It's just a shocking and horrible thing to find. It's like losing a child, or a dog," Mr Joyce said.
The ill-fated fish was worth between Â£200 and Â£300, he estimated.
It is not yet known who is responsible for the theft, but Mr Joyce said he had heard of other bodies of water in the area being targeted for similar reasons.
"We're aware of local lakes and rivers being slowly depleted and we all know there are carp-eating fans out there. It is quite a delicacy in some other ethnic origins," Mr Joyce said.
He said CCTV was being installed to monitor security at the site's 19 lakes in the wake of the theft, which is believed to have taken place between 22 and 25 May.
"We'd like to put a warning out to local residents to keep an eye on their own ponds," he said.
An Essex Police spokesman confirmed the theft had been reported.
