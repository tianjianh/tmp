LAPD have confirmed he was not contacted, questioned or arrested.
It's understood they did not pursue the claim because the alleged victim was not willing to co-operate.
In an email, the former Big Brother contestant denied he was arrested but made no further comment.
News of this investigation, on 16 July, comes after several British women made allegations to Newsbeat that Mr Pepper had sexually harassed them.
Sam Pepper's legal team told Newsbeat he "denies any and all accusations that have been made against him."
The 25-year-old has been in the spotlight over the last fortnight after posting a video on his YouTube channel called his Fake Hand Ass Pinch Prank.
The video received a number of complaints saying that it was a form of sexual harassment and it was later taken down.
His co-star Mazzi Maz spoke to Newsbeat at the time to say he had "gone too far".
Sam Pepper then uploaded another video of a woman doing the same to men and that was also removed within minutes.
Finally the star released The Reveal, where he claimed the videos were all part of a social experiment to highlight sexual harassment against men.
Sam Pepper has more than two million YouTube subscribers and has made a name for himself filming prank-style videos.
