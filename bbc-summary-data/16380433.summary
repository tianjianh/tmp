The region's chief operating officer says the claims of head coach Sean Holley and forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys will also be assessed.
New Zealander Hore, a former Wales fitness coach, said: "We definitely will be looking at both scenarios."
Johnson will become Scotland boss Andy Robinson's senior assistant coach.
Hore said: "We've been talking for a long period of time about where to go from here, that kind of thing.
"What we want to do now is sit down and look at the blueprint.
"We started this exercise four years ago to bring him [Johnson] in to help develop those coaches and that coaching staff and put those systems in place.
Are we happy with where we're at?
"And we've just got to review that now and make a decision on whether we bring somebody else in, that maybe the process needs to be finished.
"Or, are we happy with where we're at and go with from within, as we said?
"And then it's who, from within, is going to head that up?"
Hore admits the festive period has made it difficult for the Osprey's power brokers, such as joint managing directors Roger Blyth and Mike Cuddy, to meet to discuss the issue.
"With some directors being away, obviously with the festive period and that, we just haven't had a chance to sit down because it [the news about Johnson leaving] came out a little bit earlier than we expected," Hore added.
"So yeah, we've got a bit of work to do yet."
The Ospreys stopped a run of three defeats with a 17-12 win over Welsh rivals Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day at the Liberty Stadium.
