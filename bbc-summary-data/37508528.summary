[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plaque has been placed on a bench near Conwy castle appearing to protest against cuts to deaf services.

Campaigners from North Wales Deaf Association (NWDA) said they do not know who placed it there on Tuesday, but "appreciate the support".
The group has been left "frustrated and angry" at a Â£50,000 annual funding cut from Conwy council.
But the authority said talks took place 18 months before funding was cut and it is probing a bench being "defaced".
