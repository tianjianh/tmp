Labour attack NHS 'private medicine' levels

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leading English hospitals saw income from private patients rise by more than half since 2010, Labour has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Documents from NHS trusts and financial regulator Monitor show the average income per trust went up by 58% from £1.7m in 2009/10 to £2.7m in 2013/14.
But it said cancelled operations and A&E waits had increased for NHS patients over that period.
The Conservatives said private patient income was falling as a proportion of hospital budgets.
Both of the coalition parties argue private health provision within the NHS accelerated under Labour and only went up from 4% of total NHS spending in England to 6% while they have been in power.
In other election news:
The coalition government's Health and Social Care Act, which took effect in England in 2013, allowed foundation trusts - which look after their own finances - to earn up to 49% of their total income from private services.
Before that, there was a capping mechanism which restricted how much private work these trusts could carry out.
The figures quoted by Labour were derived from House of Commons written answers listing total private patient income, divided by the number of foundation trusts.
The party is now proposing a cap of 2% on work for private patients as a proportion of total income, unless key performance benchmarks are achieved.
This issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Health spokesman Andy Burnham said: "Following the Tories' decision to allow hospitals to turn over up to half of their beds to private patients, the growing financial crisis in the NHS has seen many hospitals forced to treat more private patients in NHS beds too - while waiting times get worse for everyone else.
A senior source in the hospital trust sector told the BBC that most private work was concentrated in major teaching hospitals and specialist centres, including income from wealthy foreign patients.
This revenue helped these trusts balance their books and so secure the treatment of their NHS patients.
The source pointed out that Labour's figures showed average private patient income, although up more than half, still only amounted to £2.7m - or about 1% or less of an average trust's total income.
Labour also highlighted again the issue of NHS contracts awarded to private providers.  It said its own analysis, based on Freedom of Information requests, showed that 40% of such contracts went to private companies, though the party admitted it did not have full data on the value of those deals.
A Conservative spokesman said: "This is a gimmick from Labour - official figures show that outsourcing accounts for just 6p in each NHS pound, and private patient income is actually falling as a proportion of hospital budgets."
He said Labour were "fixating" on the issue of "privatisation", claiming experts said this was a "myth".
The real debate should be "good care against poor", he added.
