[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe's march towards the League Two promotion places was slowed by a 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Yeovil, despite a leveller from skipper Joe Jacobson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chairboys had to come from a goal down after the visitors went ahead through a Kevin Dawson penalty in the first half.
They quickly levelled with a spot-kick of their own from Jacobson but could not find a winner despite intense late pressure.
Wycombe had come close to an opener through midfielder Dominic Gape, with his shot hitting the inside of a post.
But Yeovil took the lead from the spot after 20 minutes, with Dawson converting after Sido Jombati had fouled Francois Zoko.
Wycombe responded just six minutes later after Town defender Alex Lacey tripped Paris Cowan-Hall inside the box.
Wanderers defender Jacobson stepped forward to take the resulting penalty and made it 1-1 as he sent goalkeeper Artur Krysiak the wrong way.
Krysiak kept his side level with a brilliant save before the break, diving full-length to keep out a powerful shot from Luke O'Nien.
