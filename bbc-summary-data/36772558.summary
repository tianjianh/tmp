"I am really looking forward to a fresh challenge and getting started," he said. "I see a good opportunity to play first team football with the development squad here.
"Swansea play good attractive football and I think that suits my style of play."
The 18-year-old joined United after coming through the Arsenal academy.
The right-back is hoping to make a quick impression at his new club.
"I see myself as a quick, strong and powerful player who likes to get forward. I hope I can offer something both in attack and defence," he said.
"Having grown-up in London and living in Manchester for the last four years, Swansea will be a fresh challenge for me. It is one I am looking forward to, I can't wait to get started.
"I want to make my mark, secure a starting place for the development squad and help make an impact this season."
