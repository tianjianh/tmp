Walsall midfielder Franck Moussa says his summer move to the club could be the pivotal moment of his career.

The 27-year-old Belgian joined the Saddlers in July after a short spell with Southend United came to an end.
"I've had a few highlights in my career in this league and I've tried to stand out in one way or another and this year will be no different," he told BBC WM.
"Last season I had a few injuries and this year it is a chance for me to have a platform to produce some good form."
Moussa came off the bench in Walsall's 3-1 win against AFC Wimbledon on the opening day of the season and Saddlers boss Jon Whitney, the former club physio, has started him in the lat two games.
"I need to play games to try to get fitter and sharper to bring something the fans will be happy to watch," he continued.
"It was a massive factor in my decision to come to this club knowing that the manager has got such a good background in the terms of dealing with injuries and rehab."
On Saturday, Walsall face Charlton, a club that Moussa made 23 appearances for during an injury-plagued two-year spell.
"I signed for them and it started off quite well at the club but then a few injuries and different things hampered my progress.
"That's football. At this stage I'm playing for Walsall and Charlton will be a good game because they have just come down the Championship so they'll have a point to prove."
