[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Top Gear has had a bumpy ride over the last two years, having just lost Chris Evans as its main presenter after its latest series ended.

Last year saw the BBC drop Jeremy Clarkson following a "fracas" with one of the show's producers, with co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May deciding not to return to the show just days later.
After much media speculation about who was to replace them, BBC presenter Chris Evans joined the show, followed by Friends star Matt LeBlanc.
