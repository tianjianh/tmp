The show's executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins announced the change at Student Pride in London.
He says it's important to tell the story properly, and to get the casting right.
So he wants to find a trans actor to play the part.
It won't happen anytime soon though.
He admits that the writing process hasn't even started yet - that he needs to find the right actor and the right character first.
He said "We try and do our research and get it all in our heads - the way we want to go because we want to tell it properly.
"Also I would want to cast a trans actor as well. You have to - you have to cast a trans actor, but you also don't want to mess up the story because EastEnders reaches so many people and a lot of our audience are quite traditional.
He added "The power of EastEnders is we can change the world a little. You can change it gently and influence people who would be maybe quite bigoted."
Coronation Street was the first British soap to bring in a a transgender character. Hayley Cropper first came to the cobbles in 1998.
Hollyoaks' Blessing Chambers is trans too.
Recently, E4's Banana had another TV first, with a transgender actor playing a transgender character.
