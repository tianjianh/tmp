The 27-year-old Germany defender, who has recently been linked with summer moves to Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal, is under contract until 2017.
"So far, Bayern Munich has not made an offer," Dortmund said in a statement.
Hummels started his career at Bayern Munich before joining Dortmund in 2009.
He has made 44 appearances for the club this season.
Should Hummels join Bayern he will become the third player to make such a move in the last three years after midfielder Mario Gotze in 2013 and striker Robert Lewandowski in 2014.
