David "Les" Ross, 39, had opened the Rubix nightclub in Corby in the weeks before he was killed on 17 December 2012 in a Village Inn Express.
A witness has come forward to report seeing a man at the hotel entrance an hour before Mr Ross was assaulted.
The man is described as wearing dark clothing and having gingery-brown hair.
Det Ch Insp Martin Kinchin, of the East Midlands Major Crime Team, revealed the new lead on the second anniversary of the murder.
Mr Ross had been staying at the hotel in The Jamb, Corby after damage had been caused at his home in Chelveston Drive.
He had been alone in his hotel room at about 07:30 GMT when he was attacked.
Last year police said they believed former taxi driver and doorman Mr Ross had been intimidated by organised criminals intent on taking over his share of the Rubix.
Several people have been arrested and bailed in the inquiry, but no-one has been charged with his murder.
Det Ch Insp Kinchin said a number of people with "key information" had previously decided not to come forward.
He said: "Some of these people now recognise this crime will not be solved without their involvement.
"In particular this includes a witness who describes a man at the entrance of the hotel about an hour before Les was assaulted."
He said the man was not a guest or employee of the hotel.
"Mr Ross should have been celebrating achieving his dream, the opening of the successful Rubix nightclub, but instead he was a man in fear and lying low," he said.
