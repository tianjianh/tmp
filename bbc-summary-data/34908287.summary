Margaret Slater, who has dementia, was taken to Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham suffering severe hallucinations.
Her family said there appeared to be too many patients for the number of staff with queues of people in the hallways and waiting areas.
In a statement the trust apologised and said there was a "surge" in patients.
Ms Slater was taken to the emergency department on 11 November during a week when the Nottingham University Hospital's Trust missed its admissions target every day.
3,870
emergency patients seen in week beginning 9 November
80.7% admitted to ward within four hours over the week
74.1% admitted within four hours on the Wednesday
95% should be admitted within four hours according to the government
She was assessed by a nurse when she first arrived and then, three hours later, a doctor said she needed to be admitted but it was another eight hours before she was moved to a ward.
Linda Hughes, her daughter, said the staff were "very caring" but there did not appear to be enough of them.
"It was only due to the pressure we were putting on them that she was moved to a ward. In that time she was offered nothing to eat or drink.
"At one stage, we counted about a dozen [patients on trolleys] and more queuing outside in a corridor with paramedics."
In the week beginning 9 November, the hospital had 3,870 emergency admissions with 80.7% treated within four hours. The government target is 95%.
On the Wednesday, when Ms Slater was at QMC, the figure was 74.1%.
Alun Harcombe, divisional director of medicine, said the hospital was fully staffed but there had been a "surge in people attending", leading to longer admissions times.
"We apologise to Ms Slater and her family for the long wait and that she was not offered any food or drink and have reminded our staff of the importance of doing so at regular intervals," he added.
