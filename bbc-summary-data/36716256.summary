Up to 350 Tube passengers were forced to walk through London underground tunnels after being evacuated from a train, Transport for London (TfL) said.

Passengers walked along the tracks for more than five minutes because a fault with the track led a train to get stuck outside Shepherd's Bush station.
It came to a halt at about 18:00 BST on Wednesday.
TfL said the evacuation was "safe and routine". Passengers thanked crews for "leading them into the light."
It said it was investigating why the line which carried the electrical current to the trains was dislodged.
All affected customers have been offered a full refund.
Jasmin Barras, one of the evacuated passengers, said TfL staff were "fantastic".
"It only took five minutes to walk once we could get off the train," she said.
"But I was in the very end carriage so first to get off - it would have been considerably longer for people further down the train."
Commenting on Twitter, Helen Pratt said: "Well, that was fun on the Central Line in the dark. Thanks TfL for sending friendly staff to lead us into the light."
A TfL spokesman confirmed nobody was hurt and said: "Emergency staff attended and led passengers off the train and back onto the platform."
