Two walkers had to be rescued after they became "disorientated" at the summit of a 3,000ft Snowdonia peak.

Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team were called to the summit hut on Cader Idris after a man and woman became stuck at about 15:50 GMT on Saturday.
The Birmingham pair had attempted the walk in "poor conditions" and with "inadequate equipment", the team said.
Other walkers were able to offer them warm and dry clothes before 14 rescue volunteers arrived to escort them down.
Team volunteer Graham O'Hanlon attended the rescue near Dolgellau, Gwynedd.
"It is always great to see people enjoying the outdoors, but it is really important to take the mountain environment seriously, particularly in winter," he said.
"The weather was pretty much as forecast, so to head out into those conditions without the equipment or navigational skills to cope is to invite misfortune. Without the helpful intervention of the other walkers in the hut, the situation for these walkers could have been much more serious by the time rescuers arrived."
