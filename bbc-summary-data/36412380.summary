Monday's fourth-round play was due to get under way at 10:00 BST, but the forecast suggests there will be little or no action.
Djokovic will face Spanish 14th seed Roberto Bautista Agut in the day's opening match if play begins.
Williams will then take on Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina.
Britain's Andy Murray, seeded second, is already through to the quarter-finals, where he will face French ninth seed Richard Gasquet.
That match is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, although the weather could force a delay.
