Mazembe - who won the home leg of their play-off 2-0 last weekend - held off Kabylie's challenge to continue the defence of their crown.
There was a big shock in Abidjan as former African Champions League winners, Asec Mimosas, were knocked out by CF Mounana of Gabon.
Mimosas went into their home leg needing to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg, but despite fielding a side including the likes of Burkina Faso star Aristide Banc√©, the match ended 0-0 with Mounana going through 2-1 on aggregate.
Also on Sunday, Platinum Stars of South Africa squeezed past another Ivorian side AS Tanda to progress 5-4 on penalties after their tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate.
The South Africans went into their home leg in Rustenburg trailing 2-0 overall, but fought back to take the tie to spot-kicks and book their place in the group phase.
It was much more straightforward for another South African side, SuperSport United, who overwhelmed Liberia's Barrack Young Controllers 5-0 in Pretoria.
A hat-trick from Jeremy Brockie helped SuperSport United take the tie 6-1 on aggregate.
Sudan's Al Hilal Obeid defeated Ports Authority of the Gambia 3-0 at home to progress 4-1 on aggregate.
