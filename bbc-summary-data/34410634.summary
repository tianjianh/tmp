[SN]TITLE[SN]
MSPs approve human trafficking law

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs have unanimously approved new legislation designed to tackle human trafficking in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Bill establishes human trafficking as a specific offence.
It also increases the punishment for offenders to a maximum life sentence and ensures more support for victims.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson told the Scottish Parliament that it should be "very proud" of passing the legislation.
He said it would demonstrate to those who want to "peddle in the misery of human trafficking" that they are not welcome in Scotland.
The bill also:
Police Scotland Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone welcomed the new legislation, which he said would help to more effectively tackle the "despicable crime".
He added: "Trafficking is unacceptable. We will target those who trade in human beings and we will work with partners to ensure victims have the support they need.
"This new law sends a clear signal to those who choose to exploit and enslave others, that we are committed to ending this horrific crime and that we will pursue those responsible to bring them to justice."
Christina McKelvie MSP, who is co-convener of the cross party group on human trafficking, said: "Many will assume that slavery was a crime that only existed in some bygone era but unfortunately the trafficking of humans continues to this day across the world.
"We therefore have a moral obligation to ensure that Scotland is an inhospitable environment for those who seek to commit this despicable crime.
"This bill will ensure that we put in place the measures needed to prevent people trafficking men, women and children through Scotland and that their victims are properly protected. In particular, it will strengthen protections for the most vulnerable children through the provision of independent child trafficking guardians.
"The solution to this complicated, and often hidden, crime is not just to be found in legislation - that's why this bill will also require ministers to work with others to develop a Scottish trafficking and exploitation strategy. The strategy will seek to increase awareness of the crime, to improve detection and training for staff on the front-line."
