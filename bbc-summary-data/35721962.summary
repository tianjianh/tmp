Dow DuPont heads will get $80m golden parachute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The heads of Dow and DuPont will get a combined $80m (Â£56.5m) in "golden parachute" leaving bonuses following the tie up of the two companies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dow and DuPont announced plans for a $130bn merger in December.
Dow's chief executive officer, Andrew Liveris, will get $52.8m in cash and stocks - a deal that includes his $40m retirement package.
Edward Breen -who became DuPont's chief executive in October - will receive $27.2m.
The new DowDupont company will be broken into three businesses focusing on agriculture, material sciences and specialty products over a two year period.
The companies have said they hope to save $3bn over this period through cost cutting efforts.
These types of leaving bonus have been given the name "golden parachute" to reflect the large payouts executives are given when a company is taken over and the executives are replaced.
