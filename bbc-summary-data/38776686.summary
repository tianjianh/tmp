Michael Dunn, 57, made the secret hole in a wall behind his fridge.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was concerned by reports officers and social workers "missed a string of opportunities to stop him".
The force has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
The BBC understands Dunn kept the girl in a house in Mottram near Hyde.
Teesside Crown Court heard he raped and abused four girls over several years in locations around the country.
Dunn was convicted of 10 rapes, false imprisonment and indecent assault.
He would use a bag of dust and a panel to camouflage the hole behind the fridge where one girl was kept, concealing her from police on eight or nine occasions, the court heard.
The jury was told he imprisoned a second female victim, subjecting her to repeated violence, and filled his house with cameras, locks and alarms.
He also groomed and sexually assaulted another vulnerable under-age girl, giving her alcohol and cigarettes, and raped another pre-teenage girl.
GMP's Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Hankinson, said: "Reports made during the trial of Michael Dunn are very concerning and we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
"The contact would have happened over 20 years ago and a lot of our records are paper files which will need to be physically searched through."
The force was working with Cleveland Police and Tameside Council to "urgently understand" what information is held about any previous contact with Michael Dunn and victims, she said.
"Once we have all the information we will decide what further action needs to be taken. In the meantime, we are voluntarily referring ourselves to the IPCC."
Dunn, from Redcar, is to be sentenced at a later date.
