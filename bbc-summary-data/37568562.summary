Slabs of concrete in the garden at the Forth Valley Sensory Centre in Camelon were broken up and walls were spray painted in the incident.
A fountain was also damaged and defaced with graffiti during the attack over the weekend.
Police said the youngsters, who are aged between seven and 11, will be referred to the Children's Reporter.
A spokesman for the sensory centre said: "The centre would like to pass our thanks to PC McInnes for his swift and dedicated activity.
"The response from the community has been amazing and we have been overwhelmed by the messages of support from local people and businesses."
