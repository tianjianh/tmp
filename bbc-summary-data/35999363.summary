[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Suffolk Hospital nurse asks to be struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who failed to seek help when a flat line trace alarm sounded for 20 minutes is to be struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Carrington was employed at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for three years until 2007.
A hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) this week heard how Mr Carrington had not shown "the standards of skill and judgement required".
Mr Carrington, subject to a number of NMC hearings since, asked for his name to be struck from its register.
The hearing was told how in 2006 "did not seek assistance when there was a flat line trace and alarm sounding for approximately 20 minutes".
It is not known what happened to the patient involved. Mr Carrington also made errors in giving patients necessary medication.
"Although well motivated," the NMC heard, "he had difficulties in applying his good theoretical knowledge in practice.
"The drug administration errors which he made could have had serious consequences."
In his statement to the NMC, Mr Carrington said: "My registration is lapsed and I cannot legally practise as a registered nurse since I was unable to sign my notification of practice (NOP) form.
"To have done so would constitute a criminal offence and I was not prepared to do that.
"Therefore I have to end what has turned into a charade by requesting a strike-off order."
The NMC agreed and Mr Carrington will be removed from its register in May.
A spokesman for West Suffolk Hospital only confirmed Mr Carrington left the trust in 2007.
