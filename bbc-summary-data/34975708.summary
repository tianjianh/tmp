[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The match ended 0-0 - just as it did when the sides when in the group stage last week - and, with no extra time played in the competition, penalty kicks were required to determine a winner.
Goalkeeper Akram Elhadi Salim was Sudan's hero, saving the very first effort from Eric Johana and then going on to score the final kick to give his side a 5-3 victory.
Sudan will next face Rwanda, who also need a penalty shootout to advance.
The defending champions were held to a goalless draw by Kenya but emerged victorious 5-3 after spot-kicks.
Uganda and Ethiopia meet in the other semi-final.
