Darlington fighter Stu Hall says he will consider his boxing future once he has taken a break with family, after Saturday's IBF world bantamweight title defeat by Lee Haskins.

Hall, 36, was disappointed by the unanimous points decision loss, which saw Haskins retain his belt.
The one-time champion was bidding to regain his crown after June 2014's defeat by Paul Butler.
"Retirement has crossed my mind," Hall told BBC Tees.

"I'm just going to see what happens and I don't think I can leave on this note."
His fight of choice would be a return fight with Bristolian Haskins, who won the title against Ivan Morales in May.
"I should be world champion now, but we'll see what happens and if we can get a rematch that will be great," Hall added. "If there are no big fights, then I don't think I will be continuing."
