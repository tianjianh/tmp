Rio 2016: Emily Scott goes from boy's team to GB women's sevens squad

Team GB women's sevens fly-half Emily Scott can hardly believe she is going to the Olympics after starting her playing career in an Essex boy's team.

Scott has been chosen in a 12-strong squad for Rio 2016, the first time the sport has been part of the Games.
"At my local club I had to play in the boy's team because there was no women's rugby team," Scott, 24, told BBC Essex.
"That we are actually going to an Olympics is something I couldn't have dreamed of."
Scott hopes that the exposure women's rugby will enjoy in Brazil will inspire future generations of players.
"I used to sit at home on my sofa with my mum and dad and we'd watch the Olympics. Being a rugby player I never dreamed that could be me," she said.
"Hopefully now it's something aspiring young women rugby players can look to achieve."
Scott, who was out of action for five months last year after breaking her leg in a game against Saracens, is joined in the squad by Thurrock Women's team-mate Heather Fisher.
The Essex side are part of Women's Championship South One and finished second last season.
"I wouldn't have been able to achieve what I have without their support and everything they've allowed me to go and do over the past few years," said Scott.
"I absolutely love it there. It is absolutely fantastic to be part of the club."
