Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says he is hopeful that Shaun Harrad will sign a new deal at Plainmoor.

Harrad, 31, who joined the Gulls in January, is out of contract after making 15 appearances as they staved off relegation last season.
"A lot of it comes down to economics," Nicholson told BBC Sport.
"But to have somebody of Shaun's calibre, both on and off the pitch, would be fantastic and it would give us three genuine strikers up there."
Torquay have already retained the services of Nathan Blissett, whose eight goals in 17 league games helped them claw back a 12-point deficit at the foot of the National League, and signed ex-Forest Green striker Brett Williams.
"I'm still waiting on confirmation to see if they're going to scrap the emergency loan system, which is making things even more difficult for lower-league managers," added Nicholson.
"Whereas before you always had the option to get a young players for a month to fill a hole, we're now looking like we're going to have our squads ready to go before the window closes and you can't do anything about it until January.
"I have to weigh everything else too, the balance of the team, how I think we're going to win games and how much money we're going to spend, but Shaun is someone I'd love to have back if I can.
"I want a squad of 17-19 players. It's all I can afford, and it's a number where hopefully a couple of injuries won't put us in absolute turmoil."
