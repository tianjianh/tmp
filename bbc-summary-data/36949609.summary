[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 1-0 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York marked their first home game back in the National League with a 1-0 victory over Macclesfield thanks to Matt Fry's second-half winner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
York had a header cleared off the line in the early stages but goalkeeper Scott Flinders needed to produce a smart save to deny Macclesfield's Danny Rowe from 20 yards.
The deadlock was broken in the 57th minute in fortunate circumstances as an attempted clearance struck Fry and rebounded into the net.
Macclesfield had several chances to equalise but John McCombe poked wide from close range and Jack Mackreth was denied by Flinders at his near post late on.
