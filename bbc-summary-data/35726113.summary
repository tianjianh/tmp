City leaders want to spend £700,000 on developing blueprints to confirm how much they will have to invest to plug a funding gap and begin tendering.
Councillors will meet on Thursday to discuss a report on the project.
The cost of the new centre has been estimated at £41.1m. The council has a £5.98m funding shortfall.
The new site will feature a 500-capacity outdoor athletics track, synthetic sports pitches, a gymnastics hall, studios, changing facilities, a cafe and meeting rooms.
Andrew Burns, Edinburgh city council leader, said: "This report sets out quite clearly the funding required to turn one of our flagship facilities, which everyone agrees is at the end of its useful life, into a sports venue fit for the 21st century.
"While it is a significant investment for the council, creating a detailed design would give us greater clarity about how much money we need to invest.
"Not only would we see a new Meadowbank but more homes would be built to meet the city's housing needs."
Richard Lewis, Edinburgh city council's culture and sport convener, said: "Transforming Meadowbank into a brand new sports complex would provide a modern, fully accessible high quality sports centre for sports clubs and local communities.
"The new venue will bring health and wellbeing benefits across the city by supporting even more people to become and stay active."
