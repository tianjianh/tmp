Lincolnshire Police is looking into allegations dating back to 1958 as part of its Operation Redstone inquiry.
An 81-year-old man from Dorset has been charged with eight historical child sex abuse offences against boys.
Officers said they wanted to speak to those who attended the school between 1963 and 1970.
The inquiry follows a review of past safeguarding cases by the Diocese of Lincoln.
Det Sup Rick Hatton said he was "keen to hear from anyone who might have information that could assist the enquiry".
He added: "It takes tremendous courage to talk about any sort of abuse but we want anyone who may have been affected to know how seriously we take all the information you give us."
Lincoln Cathedral said it was working "proactively in partnership with Lincolnshire Police and stands ready to offer support to anyone who contacts them about issues of harm and abuse".
"The cathedral can promise that they will listen attentively to their experiences, walk alongside them in seeking justice and ensure that their voices are heard," a spokesperson added.
