Southend United 1-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend's frustrating recent record against Swindon continued with a draw against the Robins at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers seemed set for a third win in a row when Will Atkinson fired Phil Brown's side in front on his 150th appearance for the club.
But Jonathan Obika netted an equaliser 17 minutes from time to make it nine games without defeat for Swindon against Southend.
The hosts - who have now gone seven league games without defeat - opened the scoring after only 12 minutes with Atkinson on target for the third time in two games.
The midfielder was picked out by Anthony Wordsworth's through ball and stabbed a low, left-footed shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net from close range.
However, Swindon hit back to equalise after a spell of sustained pressure in the 73rd minute with Obika firing a deflected left-footed shot into the bottom corner.
Southend piled on the pressure late on with Stephen McLaughlin, Marc-Antoine Fortune and Wordsworth all being denied by Town goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux.
