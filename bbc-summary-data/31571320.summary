Relatives of the three London teenagers who are thought to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State extremists have appealed for them to come home.

The girls, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets, travelled to Turkey on Tuesday.
They told their parents they were going for a day out but Gatwick airport CCTV shows them passing through security.
The three families have released statements, saying they are "extremely worried" about the girls.
We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you.
Please, if you hear this message, get in touch and let us know you are safe. We want you home with us. You belong at home with us.
Syria is a dangerous place and we don't want you to go there. Get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home. You are not in any trouble.
We understand that you have strong feelings and want to help those you believe are suffering in Syria. You can help from home, you don't have to put yourself in danger.
Please don't cross the border. Please come home to us.
Our mum needs you home and is really worried. We are not mad at you, we love you.
Our dearest Kadiza and the two friends accompanying you, we, together, sincerely pray and hope this message reaches you.
We pray that no harm comes to you, and you are all safe and in good health.
We have come to learn that you and your friends went missing on Tuesday, 17 February and have been identified to be in Turkey.
In your absence, we, as a family, are feeling completely distressed and cannot make sense of why you left home. Due to the speculation that you may be travelling towards Syria, we are extremely worried about your safety.
As time progresses, our concerns are increasing more and more.
We are sending you our heartfelt love, and continue to pray that you along with your friends safely return to us, or at least contact us to let us know you are okay.
We all love you dearly and the last four days have been a complete nightmare not knowing where you are and how you are keeping.
We would like to emphasise that we are not angry with you and you have not done anything wrong. We just want you all to return home, safe and sound.
We miss you terribly, especially mum, and things have not been the same without you.
Amira, We miss you so much, everyone, your family and your friends.
We want you to come home as soon as possible. All we are hoping for is you to come home safe, we love you so much.
Please come home Amira, everyone is missing you. You are strong, smart, beautiful and we are hoping you will make the right decision.
We miss you more that you can imagine. We are worried and we want you to think about what you have left behind.
You had a bright future, so please return home.
