Aberdeen GP practice to close due to lack of doctors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen medical practice is to be dissolved, in part due to a shortage of doctors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bosses at the Brimmond Medical Group practice in Bucksburn said a lack of trained GPs, diminished resourcing and extra demand from new housing developments had left the business "unviable".
The group's Dyce surgery has more than 8,000 patients.
Responsibility for primary care will be handed to NHS Grampian from October.
A letter to patients stated that there had been "progressive problems with GP recruitment and retention".
It read: "Inevitable staff turnover has become impossible to manage in the context of an inadequate number of trained GPs being produced, and a collapse in those GPs seeking partnerships in GP businesses.
"Brimmond Medical Group is faced with a number of GPs leaving or retiring - and an inability to adequately replace them.
"Locally, combined with substantial extra expectation from new housing developments and massively diminishing resourcing, the business of the practice has become unviable."
The British Medical Association has warned of a crisis in GP staffing due to the number of doctors planning to retire or move abroad.
However, the Scottish government said recent investment in primary care had seen the number of GPs increase by almost 7%.
