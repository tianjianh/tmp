Aaron Amadi-Holloway coolly side-footed Oldham ahead from 16 yards before Henderson levelled with a penalty after Tim Dieng felled Callum Camps.
Henderson then saw red for a second caution for a tackle on Curtis Main.
Oldham's Anthony Gerrard headed into his own goal and Camps made it 3-1 before Amadi-Holloway pulled one back.
Victory in manager Keith Hill's 400th game in charge of the team lifted Rochdale up to 11th in League One and to within four points of the top six, while Oldham slip to 22nd.

Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's very disappointing, obviously with it being a derby. I'm a bit frustrated and a bit down at the moment.
"I think we had some good chances. We possibly could have scored two or three goals in the first half.
"The penalty just knocks us back and gives them a bit of belief again."

Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester: "What we have done is learnt how to fight. That's essential, that's one of the first things your parents teach you.
"No matter what your ring is, or what your arena is, you've got to know how to fight and enjoy (it), in probably the same breath.
"I thought it was an excellent fighting spirit today when we went down to 10 men.
"I thought we started the game superbly but I think that was the problem, we almost took our foot off the pedal and allowed Oldham to grow into the game."
