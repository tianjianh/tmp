Zoe Hallam was surveilled while she was on holiday after her Nottinghamshire Police colleagues became suspicious.
She and her husband, also a police inspector, were arrested but the force said he was "completely exonerated".
Mrs Hallam, 48, was dismissed after gross misconduct between December 2011 and November 2013 was proven.
She was said to have exaggerated the severity of her injuries in order to get medical retirement and receive an enhanced pension.

Speaking about the surveillance of her holiday, Assistant Chief Constable Simon Torr said Mrs Hallam was not as injured as she had made out.
"She looked like a mother enjoying a family holiday," he said.
She was also seen cycling and driving on the motorhome trip to France.
However, she told doctors and colleagues at Nottinghamshire Police she could not drive for more than 15 minutes following injuries sustained in a crash in 2011.
She also indicated an inability to bend, twist or reach, or lift and carry large or heavy objects, but she carried out these tasks while shopping and on holiday.
Debra Powell, representing the force's professional standards department, said: "We are talking about taxpayers' money and it's the most flagrant and outrageous abuse of position."
In mitigation, Nicolas Yeo said Mrs Hallam was a "high-calibre officer" and was given a commendation by the chief constable for her service during riots in Nottingham in 2011.
Mr Torr, who chaired the misconduct panel, said it was clear Mrs Hallam had "provided excellent service to the public", but "following the accident, that all changed".
She and her husband were arrested in November 2013 on suspicion of fraud and misconduct offences, but it was later determined that no criminal charges were appropriate.
