Jonathon Margetts tapped in to give Alty the lead early on, before Matt Rhead headed in Lincoln's equaliser.
The hosts went back in front through Josh Ginnelly's volley, only for Rhead to miss a penalty and convert another.
Jack Muldoon poached to put the visitors ahead for the first time but Damian Reeves rescued a draw, charging down goalkeeper Paul Farman, who took too long to clear a back-pass.
Farman kicked the ball in the air twice before attempting to kick downfield, but Reeves put pressure on the Imps' goalkeeper and got his reward, diverting the ball into an empty net.
Lincoln City manager Chris Moyses told BBC Radio Lincolnshire:

"It was a great game for the neutral but we're very disappointed that we've not come away with all three points today. We felt we'd done enough but a costly error  took it the other way.
"We came to win today, we said we would attack from the start but were a bit lax defending so we'll have a look at that. We might have taken a point  before the game because this is a tough place to come.
"We're still only three points outside the play-offs so it's all to fight for."
