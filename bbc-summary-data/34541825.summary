Fifa acting president Issa Hayatou has said it is crucial for football's world governing body "to restore public trust" in the organisation.

Hayatou arrived at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich on Thursday for the first time since he assumed interim control after the body suspended Sepp Blatter.
Fifa is conducting investigations into allegations of corruption.
"It's an unprecedented situation but we remain focused on the necessary reform process," said Hayatou.
He added that the body is focused on "the presidential election and on supporting the current investigations".
On 8 October Fifa announced it had suspended its president Sepp Blatter, secretary general Jerome Valcke and vice-president Michel Platini for 90 days.
The three, who are being investigated by Fifa's ethics committee, deny wrongdoing.
Hayatou, who has made it clear he will not replace Blatter on a permanent basis, continued: "To restore public trust is a crucial objective.
"It is essential that Fifa carries on its mission of developing the game and staging international tournaments."
The 69-year-old Confederation of African Football president will remain in Zurich until next week when he will lead the Extraordinary Executive Committee meeting on 20 October.
