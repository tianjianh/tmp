[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ballot over offer to striking National Museum Wales staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National Museum Wales workers are being balloted on a "massively improved offer" which could end a long-running dispute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PCS union members have been involved in an all-out strike since 28 April over changes to weekend working allowances.
Additional financial support from the Welsh Government has now allowed NMW to improve the previous offer, it said.
As a result, an outline agreement has been reached with the union.
The improved terms would apply to all staff.
They include:
The museum has sites in Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Blaenavon in Torfaen, Llanberis in Gwynedd, and Carmarthenshire.
The ballot, which opened on Friday, closes on 24 June and the union has recommended acceptance.
A joint statement from NMW and the PCS union said they "aim to bring this dispute to an end quickly and resume a normal service for visitors and the people of Wales as soon as possible".
