[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 2-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow took their incredible run of form to 18 matches unbeaten with a 2-1 home win over Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A pair of early strikes set them on their way. Defender Moussa Diarra netted his first goal in Barrow colours, not long after Danny Livesey had hit the bar.
Within three minutes, the Bluebirds' new goalscoring machine, Byron Harrison, grabbed his 12th goal since signing from Chesterfield in the summer.
Harrison nearly made it 3-0 when he hit the woodwork in the second half. Instead, Akwasi Asante went down the other end and was more clinical with his finish.
Jamey Osborne then hit the bar as Solihull rallied strongly, but the push was ultimately fruitless.
