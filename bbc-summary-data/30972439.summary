Sylvia, a Japanese Shiba Inu, was discovered in the sea by a dog walker at the western entrance of the Menai Strait near Caernarfon on Saturday.
She had vanished on Newborough beach on the island's west coast a week ago.
Her owner Janice Bannister had spent Â£750 hiring a helicopter to search the area.
People from all over the UK joined her on Saturday to help look for Sylvia after her story attracted huge support, while a facebook campaign was started to help find her.
"We were all out looking for her when the news came though that she had been found," said Mrs Bannister, of Telford, Shropshire.
"We were all devastated. The coastguards were out searching with us at the time but they went to the point where she was found - a very treacherous place - and they carried her back to me in a blanket.
"She's at home with us now and we're going to bury her."
Mrs Bannister said she had been comforted by the "thousands" of messages she had received on social media and now wants to raise money for the coastguards in the area.
She also hopes to have a memorial bench for Sylvia on Newborough beach, if she is given permission.
"I really want to put something back into the local community because they have been so good and without the coastguards I wouldn't have had any closure.," she added.
"We're determined to make sure she didn't die in vain."
