Zambia election: Edgar Lungu, Hakainde Hichilema in tight race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The two leading candidates in Zambia's presidential election are in a tight race, according to partial results from the election commission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With nearly three-quarters of the 150 constituencies having reported results, the governing Patriotic Front (PF) candidate, Edgar Lungu, was on 48.8%.
Hakainde Hichilema of the opposition United Party for National Development was on 46.8%.
Final results are expected to be released later on Friday.
The vote was caused by the death in office of Zambia's then president, Michael Sata, last October.
The winner will serve the remainder of Mr Sata's term, leading up to elections in 2016.
Both main parties requested a meeting on Friday morning with the electoral commission to discuss the vote.
Those talks have taken place but there has been no public comment so far by those involved.
