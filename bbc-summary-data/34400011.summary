He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he had met with the MSP during the party's annual conference in Brighton and would be with her in Scotland later in the week.
Mr Corbyn said: "Kezia and I are working fine together. I have had discussions with her here in Brighton and in Scotland tomorrow morning, in Holyrood and other places, meeting colleagues and other people in Scotland."
He added that he would listen to the views of people in Scotland on issues like economic policy because the "mood in the party was one of openness and democracy".
Mr Corbyn also stood by his comments at the weekend that the SNP government was "privatising CalMac" and was "behind the privatisation of ScotRail".
These are claims that the Nationalists have strongly denied.
