Chinese salvagers have fully righted the ship which capsized on the Yangtze River, killing more than 400 people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The salvage operation began late on Thursday evening in Jianli, Hubei province.
As cranes slowly turned over the stricken ship, relatives gathered to hold a candlelit vigil nearby.
Just 14 of the 456 passengers and crew are known to have survived. Authorities said the chances of finding anyone else alive were slim.
Why did the Eastern Star sink?
