[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheryl James Deepcut death 'may not have been suicide'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There may have been "third party involvement" in the death of a teenage soldier at an army base in Surrey 20 years ago, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found dead at Deepcut barracks in November 1995.
The army claimed she had shot herself in the head, but in December 1995 a coroner recorded an open verdict.
Lawyers told a new inquest that evidence suggested her injuries may not have been self-inflicted.
Alison Foster QC, acting of behalf of human rights organisation Liberty and representing Pte James's family, said any scientific evidence should be heard before other witnesses to set out what was possible.
She said: "Now there is distinguished pathological evidence showing that the shot that killed Cheryl James may not have been self-inflicted.
"Third party involvement is more than merely speculative, according to this inquest's pathologist. It's important such evidence is fully acquired and assimilated."
Lawyers representing the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police, who investigated the death, opposed a request for an adjournment for more forensic and ballistics reports to be filed.
Pte James was one of four Army recruits to die at the barracks, in Surrey, between 1995 and 2002 amid claims of bullying and abuse.
She was found at the base with a single gunshot wound to her head.
Coroner Brian Barker QC, has said he will not consider allegations of a culture of abuse at the base during the inquest, which was granted by the High Court as a result of the emergence of new evidence, although he will explore "the impact of any sexual abuse against Cheryl on her state of mind".
At the resumption of the hearing, in Woking, Ms Foster told the coroner: "The family has at all times sought to assist you with regards to forensics and ballistics. It is not fair or practical to start this inquest other than with the scientific evidence."
