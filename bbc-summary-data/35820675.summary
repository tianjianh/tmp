The West Indies batsman struck 11 sixes on his way to scoring 100 from just 47 balls as England slumped to a six-wicket loss in Mumbai.
"The world is watching, so the universe boss got to deliver and he did today," the 36-year-old left-hander said.
"The Gayle force got the better of England today."
Gayle said his thrilling innings was inspired by the words of West Indies team-mate Sulieman Benn.
"Sulieman said to me I had to go out and entertain him, that gave me the spark," the Jamaican said.
"I just try and keep people entertained around the world. That's my objective."
Gayle's century was the joint-third fastest in T20 internationals, saw him become the first man to score two tons in the World T20, and took West Indies to their target of 183 with 11 balls to spare.
"It was a fantastic innings and I'm really happy to have finished the game, I didn't leave it for anyone," he added.
"It was always good to bat second. A target of 183 we always had a chance of chasing down. We didn't panic. Now we're on to the next one against Sri Lanka."
For England, Joe Root made 48 in a total of 182-6, the highest score they have failed to defend in a Twenty20. Captain Eoin Morgan described the total as "competitive".
"We would have liked 200, 220 probably would have been a wining total, but we never really took the game away from them," he added.
"They bowled well and probably in the chase there was not a lot on offer for us apart from the first few overs when it swung. Once Gayle gets himself in, though, he's hard to stop."
