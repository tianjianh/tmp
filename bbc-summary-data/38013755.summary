This is the new Virtual Reality (VR) version of Google Earth, as seen through the HTC Vive headset.
The way the HTC Vive's works means that as well as moving your head around to get different views, you can walk around your surroundings, try to see into Buckingham Palace or fly up to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
But while Google Earth's coverage of many of the Earth's cities and famous landmarks look great in VR, if you just wanted to explore your street, the VR experience might not be so good... yet...
The HTC VIVE is one of the latest VR headsets on the market, and we asked Newsrounders to check some of them out.
Virtual reality is still pretty new, and scientists aren't sure how it will affect people's health in the long-term, especially eyesight.
So most VR makers have guidelines which recommend that only people over the age of 13 play them.
Some people have also reported feeling a bit seasick whilst playing on them.
