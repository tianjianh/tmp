Carl Darlington: Wrexham re-appoint coach as he leaves The New Saints

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham have re-appointed Carl Darlington to their coaching staff as the Football Association of Wales coach returns to his hometown club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darlington left Wrexham in May 2015 and re-joined Welsh Premier League champions New Saints later that year.
"I'm delighted to get Darlo in, as he's someone who can help me personally, someone I can learn from and develop," Wrexham boss Dean Keates said.
"He is a local lad, the club means everything to him."
Darlington will do the job part time, combined with his role as head of coach education for the Welsh Football Trust.
He was previously assistant manager at the Racecourse to Kevin Wilkin and was briefly caretaker following Wilkin's departure.
He left the club when Gary Mills was appointed in April 2015.
