[SN]TITLE[SN]
Death of Dafydd Tudur hit by Y Felinheli taxi 'accidental'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a man who was hit by a taxi as he walked home after a night out was accidental, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dafydd Tudur, 27, was struck as he walked along the A487 Y Felinheli bypass from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, before 03.20 GMT in March 2015.
The hearing in Caernarfon was told the dark clothes Mr Tudur was wearing would have made him difficult to see.
There was no evidence the taxi driver had seen him, the coroner said.
North West Wales Coroner, Dewi Pritchard Jones, said Mr Tudur had been out with friends watching rugby before going on to Caernarfon, and had decided to walk along the bypass because it was a quicker route home to Y Felinheli.
Taxi driver Terry Moxon told the hearing he had no recollection of seeing Mr Tudur and the first he knew of a collision was when he heard a bang and noticed his windscreen was smashed.
Mr Pritchard Jones said there were no street lights on the bypass because there is no official footpath and the collision was due to "misfortune".
Originally from Morfa Nefyn, Mr Tudur was an Aberystwyth University law graduate and worked as a solicitor Tudur Owen Roberts Glynne and Co in Bangor.
