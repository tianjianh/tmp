[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man guilty of raping sleeping woman in Edinburgh flat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of raping a sleeping woman at a flat in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Smith, 26, from Edinburgh, attacked the 30-year-old while she was asleep in a flat in Dalry following a night out on 2 August 2014.
The High Court in Glasgow heard how Smith was part of a group that had returned to the flat after a night at Lulu club in Edinburgh.
The rapist worked there at the time as a barman. Judge Lord McEwan deferred sentencing until 16 March in Edinburgh.
First offender Smith, who no longer works at the nightclub, was put on the sex offenders list.
The court heard that after arriving at the flat, Smith continued drinking while showing off magic tricks to others.
He later went to one of the bedrooms apparently planning to go to sleep, however, the woman was already sleeping in there.
Smith got into bed beside her then began molesting her and started to have sex with her.
The jury heard the woman went "ballistic" when she realised what was happening.
One witness, who knew both the woman and her attacker, recalled "screaming and shouting" coming from the room.
She told the court: "When the door was opened, Richard seemed to be cowering in the corner and she was battering him with an ironing board.
"She was hysterical and screaming 'get out, get out'."
The court heard Smith appeared "quite chilled" despite what had happened and went back to bed.
Police were forced to rouse him awake when they later attended at the flat that morning.
Smith gave evidence during the trial and claimed there had been consensual sexual activity, however denied having full intercourse with the woman.
