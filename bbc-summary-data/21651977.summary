[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He needs to take responsibility for what happens around him
New Zealand Cricket said Bracewell, 22, was hurt on Saturday in an "unfortunate accident while cleaning up", amid reports of a party at his home.
"Doug is very sorry for any inconvenience he has caused," said team manager Mike Sandle.
Seamer Ian Butler, 31, could make his first Test appearance for eight years.
Bracewell did not attend New Zealand's final training session at Dunedin's University Oval on Tuesday, and Sandle said he had been "reminded of his obligations and responsibilities as a NZC contracted player".
"We've told Doug that he needs to take responsibility for what happens around him and that he needs to do all he can to ensure his preparation for international cricket is not compromised," added Sandle.
"Doug has apologised to his neighbour in Napier."
New Zealand Cricket Players' Association chief executive Heath Mills, who has worked closely with Sandle on the matter, added: "We want to ensure that incidents like this are not repeated and that we provide ongoing support for young players to ensure they are meeting all their obligations and responsibilities."
