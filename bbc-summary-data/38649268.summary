An action group has said it will continue to push for a bypass to a Borders town despite it not featuring on initial A7 improvement works.

The Scottish government announced initial investment of about Â£240,000 on the route last week.
It did not include a number of proposals which "fell outside the scope" of the current work programme.
The A7 Action Group said it had not given up hope of a Selkirk bypass at some time in the future.
Last year Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he was "open minded" about the project and residents voted strongly in favour of the move.
A7 Action Group Secretary Marjorie McCreadie said that further talks were planned with Transport Scotland.
She added: "Although none of our big-ticket items are there at the moment, this is up for future discussion."
Ms McCreadie said small-scale efforts like cutting back vegetation could improve sightlines on the route.
However, she said she believed there was still a chance for bigger projects to take place.
"I think the main thing in this response from the minister is the willingness to keep the door open for further dialogue and we look forward to that very much," she explained.
