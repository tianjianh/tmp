Zamalek chairman Mortada Mansour rejects coach's resignation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of Egyptian giants Zamalek, Mortada Mansour, has rejected the resignation of coach Moamen Soliman and his technical staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Soliman quit after a 1-0 win over Al Masry in the Egyptian league on Friday.
Despite the victory Mansour had expressed his anger at his side's performance insisting the team did not deserve the three points.
Zamalek, who were runners-up in this year's African Champions League, have already had five coaches this season.
Soliman has been in charge of Zamalek since August and first of all guided the club to victory in the Egypt Cup.
He then offered to step down as they lost to Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in last month's African Champions League final.
However Mansour also rejected that offer and had backed Soliman, saying he would stay in his role "until the end of the season".
