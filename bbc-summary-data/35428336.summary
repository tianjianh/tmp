New Mills, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One North, had lost all of their league and cup games this season.
But on Tuesday night the Derbyshire club drew 2-2 with Witton Albion to earn their first point of the campaign.
"I just hope it can be a springboard for the rest of the season," said manager Garry Brown.
In front of a crowd of 218 at Witton Albion's Wincham Park in Northwich, New Mills twice led through Darryl Mason.
But goals from Danny Andrews and Rob Hopley earned the home side a draw as the Millers earned a point for the first time since 11 April, 2015.
"We have got rid of that duck," Brown, the club's fourth manager since June, told BBC Sport.
"The 'worst team in England' tag had driven me. I know we are not and I think we can still surprise a few people this season. New Mills is no longer a place to get easy points.
"It was a fantastic performance and just what the lads deserve."
