Scarlets boosted their play-off hopes with a stunning 30-21 comeback victory over Pro12 leaders Munster at Thomond Park.
Pivac's side are fourth in the Pro12 ahead of fifth placed Ulster, who have played two games less than Scarlets.
"It's going to be a very tight race for the top four," Pivac said.
"We don't want to get ahead of ourselves; we're in a big fight with Ulster."
"It's an old cliche but we've got to just take things one game at a time."
Scarlets win was only their second at Thomond Park and their first at the Limerick venue since 2003.
They 21-6 at the interval but three tries in six minutes from Hadleigh Parkes, Johnny McNicholl and Tom Williams completed an impressive 30-21 win.
"There's a lot of self-belief in the group," Pivac added.
"They're working very hard for each other, they're a tightknit bunch and you saw it in the second half.
"This group is very proud of the results it's achieved. They're unbeaten whilst the internationals have been away and they want to try and keep it that way.
"We've got another big game next week against Leinster away from home, we've got to back up this performance with another big win next week."
