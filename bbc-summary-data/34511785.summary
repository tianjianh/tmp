Fighting broke out in a stand behind one of the goals just before the match began in Vilnius.
Local police quickly intervened, forming a barrier between fans to prevent the violence escalating.
Some England fans appeared to have purchased tickets for sections of the ground designated for home supporters.
BBC Radio 5 live reporter Alan Green reported he had seen missiles being thrown by fans.
England won 3-0 with goals from Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, either side of an own goal from Lithuania keeper Giedrius Arlauskis.
Victory means Roy Hodgson's side have won all 10 of their qualifying matches for next summer's European Championship in France.
