Another 58 parks and green spaces were given the award by Keep Wales Tidy.
They include Bryngarw Country Park, Bridgend, Swansea Canal, Acton Park in Wrexham, Parc Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd and Aberystwyth University's Llanbadarn campus.
Coordinator Lucy Prisk said it was down to "staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to maintain the standards demanded by the Green Flag award".
There is now a total of 161 parks and green spaces with the Green Flag award.
It is judged by experts who assess sites against criteria including horticultural standards, cleanliness and sustainability.
