London Irish 'unconcerned' by Andy Goode's Newcastle move

London Irish are "not concerning themselves" with fly-half Andy Goode's decision to come out of retirement and join Newcastle on a short-term deal.

Goode cited injury problems when calling time on his career soon after joining Irish from Wasps in the summer.
But, the 35-year-old signed a three-month contract with fellow Premiership strugglers Newcastle last week.
"Andy's motivation for joining Newcastle is certainly his own," Irish coach Glenn Delaney told BBC Sport.
Bottom-of-the-table Irish host Newcastle on Sunday in the Premiership and Goode could make his Falcons debut.
The former Leicester, Saracens and England three-quarter took advice from Irish's medical staff and his own physician before initially retiring.
"Andy has explained his position pretty clearly in that Dean Richards (Newcastle director of rugby) is the only coach he would come out of retirement for," added Delaney, head of the London Irish's rugby operations.
"They've got a great affinity to each other that goes back a long time. I think Dean has probably leant on that relationship to get him to come (to Newcastle)."
Irish returned to the bottom of the Premiership on Saturday after letting a 14-6 half-time lead slip at Gloucester.
Delaney says Goode's possible Newcastle bow next weekend will not be a distraction.
"It's not something we're particularly concerning ourselves with," he said. "All we can worry about is what we're doing."
Newcastle moved above the Exiles at the weekend after picking up their first win of the season against Bath.
