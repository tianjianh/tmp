Julie Finley, 23, went missing on 5 August 1994 in Liverpool city centre.
Her naked body was found the next day in a carrot field close to the Wheatsheaf Hotel in Rainford, St Helens.
Ms Finley's parents have released family photos of her as part of the new appeal to find her killer.
Merseyside Police said the £20,000 reward would be paid for information leading to the arrest, charge and conviction of the person responsible.
Det Supt Tim Keelan said: "We are still keen to speak to a friend of Julie, called Tina, who contacted the investigation team shortly after the murder.
"Tina told officers that on the night of the murder Julie had said she was going to meet a taxi driver from Prescot. Tina promised to re-call the officers she had spoken to, but never phoned back."
Ms Finley's mother Pat, 69, said she and her husband Albie had endured "20 years of hell and torment".
"It's difficult to explain what the last 20 years have been like, but for me I still feel like it's 1994 and I'm constantly waiting for Julie to come through the door," she said.
"We want justice for Julie and would plead with anyone who has information which could help us get the justice our daughter deserves to speak to the police."
Julie was last seen alive in Pembroke Place at the back of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.
She was talking to an unknown white man, of average height and build, aged in his 20s, or 30s.
