[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 1-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton fought back from 1-0 down to win at League Two Crewe and reach the second round of the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wanderers had deservedly trailed at half-time after Chris Porter's downward header from George Cooper's cross and Porter struck the bar after the break.
But a triple change turned the game in the visitors' favour as Adam Armstrong tapped in his first goal for Bolton.
Derik Osede headed in his first in English football from substitute Filipe Morais' dinked cross to win it late on.
Crewe were on top early on and could have ended the contest before the hour mark, but Championship Bolton finished the stronger after boss Phil Parkinson's 66th-minute substitutions.
Parkinson had made 10 changes to his starting line-up, while Crewe named the same side that drew with Mansfield in the fourth tier on Saturday.
