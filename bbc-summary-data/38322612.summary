Bradley Lowery, from Blackhall Colliery near Hartlepool, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013.
More than £700,000 was raised to pay for treatment in the USA, including a donation of £200,000 from Everton.
However, last week his mother Gemma revealed his cancer had grown and treatment would only give him more time.
On Tuesday it was revealed that Bradley had been sent more than 11,000 Christmas cards from well-wishers.
A campaign to encourage people to send him the cards had been organised by an Everton fan.
