Tyler has been rewarded after he was spotted helping police tidy up after a football match.
He was helping to pick up rubbish after he'd been to watch a Newcastle United match last month.
The police posted the video on social media to try to find out who he was.
Lots of people saw it and identified Tyler as the helpful litter picker.
