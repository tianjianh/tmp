The Belfast Giants returned to winning ways on Wednesday as they defeated Dundee Stars 5-2 at the SSE Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Giants had lost 4-1 to Braehead Clan at home on Tuesday night but this victory sees them remain six points adrift of leaders Cardiff Devils.
Mike Radja (2), James Desmarais, Michael Forney and player-coach Derrick Walser found the net for Belfast, who have three games in hand over Cardiff.
Lou Dickenson and Mikael Lidhammar were the scorers for Dundee.
Goals from Dickenson and Radja saw the sides tied at 1-1 after the first period, with Desmarais and Forney on target to move the hosts two ahead by the end of the second period.
Walser scored for Belfast, Lidhammar pulled one back, but Radja completed the scoring soon after to make it a convincing triumph for the Giants.
The Giants had been on a four-game winning run, before they went down to Clan on Tuesday.
That reverse was their sixth in 12 games in Belfast, but the success against the Stars will boost confidence in the Belfast camp.
Cardiff saw off Manchester Storm 3-2 on Wednesday to maintain their advantage at the top of the standings.
The Giants will host Coventry in their next fixture in Belfast on Saturday night.
