Eva Carneiro: Mourinho treatment of Chelsea doctor on Fifa agenda

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jose Mourinho's treatment of Chelsea team doctor Eva Carneiro is to be discussed by world governing body Fifa.

Carneiro's role was downgraded after she and head physio Jon Fearn went on the pitch to treat Eden Hazard in the 2-2 home draw with Swansea on 8 August.
The move reduced Chelsea to nine men - goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois had already been sent off - and angered Mourinho, who called it "impulsive and naive".
Fifa's medical committee will discuss Carneiro at a meeting on 11 September.
The committee is expected to make clear its support of team doctors who act in the best interest of players.
Chairman Michel D'Hooghe said: "This is once again an example of the difficult situation of the team doctor.
"I want to discuss this with my colleagues and to see if we need to give a declaration from the medical side to help team doctors."
Mourinho was criticised for his comments about the medical team after the game at Stamford Bridge but refused to back down.
