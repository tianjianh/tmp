The Nigeria international reacted angrily to jeers after losing the ball and took his shirt off, storming off the pitch, only be to be talked back on by his coaching staff.
He was replaced at half-time.
Moussa Sow, who scored an injury-time winner, said: "Emenike is very worried. Our fans should raise him up."
Emenike - who is in his second spell at the club - has only scored four goals in 22 league appearances this season for title contenders Fenerbahce.
He joined Fener in 2011 but was linked to a match-fixing scandal, though he was later cleared of any involvement, joining Spartak before playing a game for the Istanbul club.
The striker rejoined the club in 2013.
Senegal striker Sow added: "Our fans should support him. We need him for the title. This season has been tough for Emenike. He would like to contribute to the team.
"He is very eager for success like us but our fans want us to win the games - they are aware of this season's importance."
