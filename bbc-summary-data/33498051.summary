The Lincolnshire Chalk Streams Partnership received the money from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to help take its work into the community.
The group, which includes the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and Environment Agency, launched in 2003.
Project officer, Ruth Craig, said events would be held to "educate" people about looking after the stream.
The stream, which runs through the Lincolnshire Wolds, is home to several threatened plant and animal species.
Ms Craig said the money would also go towards improvements work as well as running community events over the next three years.
Chalk streams are rare habitats with many under threat because of the growing demand for clear water and silt entering from fields and roads.
Head of HLF East Midlands, Vanessa Harber, said: "This project is a perfect way of raising awareness about their importance and involving an army of volunteers to help protect them for the future."
