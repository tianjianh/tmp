Guernsey Police said the tanks, ranging in volume from five to 25 litres, were taken from ramp number one after 18:00 BST on Tuesday night.
Andy Goodall, the force's crime reduction advisor, said the theft had "the potential to put lives at risk".
He said: "The crew go down there to get out to the Flying Christine in order to get to patients' aid."
Captain Peter Gill, the harbour master for St Peter Port, said the theft was "thoroughly reprehensible".
The tanks were removed from the dories which act as tenders to the Flying Christine III, the sea fisheries boat and the harbour pilot's boat.
Guernsey Police are appealing for witnesses to the theft.
Mr Goodall said a fuel tank was also taken from a private boat in St Peter Port Marina between 2 and 12 October.
He said it was important for boat owners to check their vessels regularly and lock away fuel tanks.
