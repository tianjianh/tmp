Oldham Athletic 0-2 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New manager Pep Clotet made a flying start to his Oxford career as the U's grabbed a 2-0 victory over Oldham at Boundary Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spaniard Clotet, who replaced Michael Appleton in July, saw his new team seal victory with goals from Wes Thomas and Josh Ruffels.
The Latics could have gone in front when Aaron Amadi-Holloway set up Craig Davies, but the striker's first-time shot was saved by visiting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood.
Instead it was Oxford who led after 39 minutes as Jack Payne played a through-ball and, with Oldham appealing in vain for offside, Thomas raced clear and slotted home.
Ryan Ledson went close to adding a quickfire second for the away side, with his 20-yard drive forcing a save from Ben Wilson.
Oxford, who narrowly missed out on last season's play-offs, again showed their attacking threat with a superb move which ended when Payne was smartly denied by Wilson.
Oldham squandered a good chance when Tope Obadeyi slashed off target, but the visitors doubled the lead on 71 minutes as Ruffels collected Payne's pass and fired home from 12 yards.
