[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British hospital surgeon, who was born in Nepal, is returning to his homeland to help communities devastated by the earthquake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nepal says 6,204 people are known to have died in the 7.8-magnitude quake on Saturday and 13,932 were injured.
Kamal Aryal, from the James Paget Hospital, Gorleston, Norfolk, and a team of three other surgeons believe their skills could prove vital.
Mr Aryal will travel to Kathmandu on Sunday.
He plans to spend 12 days treating a wide range of injuries.
The team hopes to save the lives of men, women and children who risk death from infected or untreated injuries.
They also expect to prevent others from becoming permanently disabled.
Many of Mr Aryal's family still live in Kathmandu and his home village of Arubas in the Dhading district.
They have now been accounted for.
Mr Aryal, who moved to Britain 15 years ago, said: "I am confident we will be able to save lives."
He will be joined by colleagues Andreas Brodbeck, an anaesthetist, Emeka Nnene, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, and Mike Flores, also an orthopaedic surgeon with an interest in trauma.
The team's costs are being funded by Nepal In Need, a Norfolk-based charity which is organising consignments of donated tents to go to Nepal.
The total mission will cost about Â£4,000.
