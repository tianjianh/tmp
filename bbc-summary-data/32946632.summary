England v New Zealand: Adam Lyth hits century but NZ fight back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Lyth scored a maiden Test century for England before late wickets dragged New Zealand back into the second Test.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lyth shared an opening stand of 177 with Alastair Cook, who made 75 and became England's leading Test run scorer of all time.
But, after Lyth was run out for 107, England lost three wickets to the second new ball to close day two at Headingley on 253-5, 97 behind.
New Zealand were earlier bowled out for 350, with Stuart Broad taking 5-109.
That represented a determined fightback from 2-2 in the third over of the match, the tourists aided by some English inaccuracy that continued on the second morning.
The Black Caps bowled with greater discipline than their hosts, but mostly in overhead conditions suited to batting, albeit on a pitch offering assistance from a good length.
They got their rewards deep into the evening, with Trent Boult and Tim Southee swinging the second new ball under dark clouds.
Boult bowled a flat-footed Gary Ballance, Southee took Joe Root's outside edge and Ben Stokes poked at a Boult outswinger to leave the match evenly poised.
Before that, some watchful batting looked set to put England in a commanding position.
They were led by Lyth and Cook, who recorded England's highest Test opening stand at Headingley and their first in excess of 100 in a home match since 2011.
Both left-handers showed good judgement around off stump and an ability to punish width, Cook with cuts, Lyth with back-foot drives.
Cook, who also displayed characteristic touches off his pads, posted the first landmark of the day, driving Southee for four to reach the 32 runs required to pass Graham Gooch's record of 8,900 Test runs.
Lyth, looking to secure an Ashes place, also flicked fine on the leg side and went to a first half-century in his second Test with a pull for four off Matt Henry.
While Cook's innings was chanceless, Lyth almost patted a return catch back to Henry on 53 and was even more fortunate to survive on 90 when he chopped Southee on to his stumps, only for the bails to remain unmoved.
It was Cook, though, who was first to go, sweeping the tidy off-spin of Mark Craig to be given out lbw when the original not-out decision was overturned on review.
Yorkshire's Lyth, on his home ground, continued to three figures, reached with a slog-sweep for four off Craig.
However, when a Ballance call for a single to point left Lyth unable to beat the throw of Boult, it began New Zealand's period of resurgence.
Four wickets fell for 32 runs, leaving Ian Bell and Jos Buttler to see England through to the close.
A disappointing end reflected a frustrating beginning to the day for the home side, whose persistent short bowling allowed the tourists to add 53 runs in seven overs to their overnight 297-8.
Broad took both wickets to fall, Henry and Boult swiping to be caught behind and at point respectively.
That completed his 13th five-wicket haul but, with an economy rate of 6.34 runs an over, it is the most expensive in Test history.
