The Princess Royal led a flotilla of about 40 boats along the Forth and Clyde canal to the giant horse-heads, near Falkirk.
Sculptor Andy Scott was on hand for the opening, along with Duke, a Clydesdale horse which was one of the models for the 30m (100ft) works.
More than 1m people have visited the Kelpies since they were completed in April 2014.
It has been estimated that the Kelpies, the centrepiece of the 350-hectare, Â£43m Helix parkland project, have boosted the local economy by Â£1.5m per year.
They have won a number of design awards, and were named "Scotland's national treasure" by the National Lottery.
A Â£1.8m visitor centre is due to open at the attraction later this year.
The pair of sculptures are made from 600 tonnes of steel and more than 10,000 special fixings, and tower over the nearby M9 motorway.
