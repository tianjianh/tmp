The Huntsman spider was spotted by staff at a manufacturing firm in Dumbarton on Friday.
They called in the Scottish SPCA amid concerns that it could be poisonous.
The animal charity contacted an arachnid specialist who helped identify the spider, which can give a painful bite. The Huntsman is being cared for while a suitable home is sought.
Scottish SPCA Animal Rescue Officer Emma Bonner, who dealt with the incident, said: "We were called to a manufacturing business on Stirling Road, Dumbarton, on Friday morning after we received reports of a large spider.
"When I arrived one of the employees had managed to get the spider inside a clear bag within a container. We didn't know if it was venomous."
The spider was passed to Scottish SPCA Ch Insp Fiona Henderson who contacted a specialist.
Ch Insp Henderson said: "An arachnid expert identified it as a Huntsman spider. We believe that due to a yellow stripe on its abdomen that the spider is female.
"It would be hard to say where it is from exactly due to the fact it arrived here in a shipping container.
"It must be a tough little spider as it has done well to survive living in a cold container for so long before arriving in Scotland."
Ch Insp Henderson added: "Because it's a Huntsman it's not native to this country so we can't release the spider anywhere in Scotland.
"If there are any bacteria or bugs that the spider is carrying that we are not aware of then it could introduce those to other species.
"The spider appears in good condition and is already an adult so we are going to try to find a specialist home for it."
