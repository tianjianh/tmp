The 40-year-old made 127 before being bowled by Gareth Batty, while Craig Overton (44) and Lewis Gregory (47 not out) added 78 for the eighth wicket.
Ravi Rampaul (5-85) took five wickets to keep the hosts on top, as Somerset were all out for 353, trailing by 110.
Bad light and rain then brought about an early close of play to prevent Surrey from adding to their lead.
Trescothick's innings, which included 20 fours and one six, was his third century in his last six first-class innings.
The former England opener lost partners regularly during his 296-minute knock, with no other Somerset batsman able to surpass 50 runs.
West Indies seamer Rampaul was the pick of the bowlers, taking the key wickets of Chris Rogers and James Hildreth on his way to his second five-wicket haul since joining Surrey in March.
But Trescothick's resistance, coupled with further delays for snow during the second session, means a draw appears the most likely result on day four.
Surrey bowler Ravi Rampaul told BBC Radio London:
"There was not much movement in the pitch, the ball wasn't swinging around.
"It was that kind of day, the weather had a big part to play. I just ran in, hit the deck and tried to test the batsman.
"We were not patient enough [as a bowling unit] in the first game. We decided we needed to build more pressure, bowl maidens, and come out today with Tom [Curran] and [Mark] Footitt.
"I've never seen weather like it in my life, it had a bit of everything. It was a good experience for me and I am glad I got wickets in those conditions too."
