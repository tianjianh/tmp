Work, which will see the track double between Rossett and Saltney junction, was meant to be finished by 2015.
North Wales AM Mark Isherwood said he was pleased, but found it "disappointing it has taken so long."
Network Rail said it had been working with train operators and local authorities to get the track access required for the project.
In November 2015, the company blamed "setbacks" for further delays which pushed the completion date for work back to 2016.
Mr Isherwood said: "The delays have been incredibly frustrating for passengers who travel between Wrexham and Chester. I will be keeping a close eye on progress, ensuring that my constituents aren't further let down."
The scheme will see 5.5 miles (8.9km) of track doubled, enabling more train services to operate every hour.
Level crossings at Green Lane, Balderton, Pulford and Broad Oak are also being upgraded.
A Network Rail spokesman said: "We will continue to update passengers, the local community and elected representatives of our progress as we work with our industry partners to reduce journey times and enable more trains to run between north and south Wales, as well as delivering significant safety improvements to four level crossings between Wrexham and Chester."
