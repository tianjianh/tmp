Heath, on his 32nd birthday, and 31-year-old Schofield won their semi-final in 31.899 seconds to qualify for their second Olympic final in a row.
"We had a really good, solid run-out," said Heath, who partnered Schofield to bronze in the event at London 2012.
Britain's Rachel Cawthorn failed to reach the final of the K1 500m, finishing sixth in her semi-final.
