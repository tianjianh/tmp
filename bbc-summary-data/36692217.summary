Women's Super League One: Sunderland rout leaves Doncaster rock bottom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland completed a comprehensive 4-0 win against bottom-of-the-table Doncaster Rovers Belles in WSL 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belles, who have lost all five of their games this season, were up against it after captain Leandra Little was sent off for a professional foul.
She brought down Beth Mead on the edge of the area, who scored Sunderland's opening goal from close range.
Hayley Sharp and Mead put Sunderland 3-0 ahead by the break and Brooke Chaplen added the fourth in the second half.
Sunderland climb a place in the table up to seventh and above Reading, who earlier lost 2-0 at Liverpool.
Doncaster named new signing Christie Murray among their substitutes. The Scotland international midfielder joined the club on Friday.
Murray finished last season with Celtic but has previous WSL experience with Arsenal and Bristol.
