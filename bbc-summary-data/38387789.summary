Callum Booth curled in the opener with a fine free-kick after 16 minutes after Darren O'Dea downed Kris Doolan.
Doolan pounced to score shortly before the break after goalkeeper Scott Bain could only block a Chris Erskine drive.
Dundee had more possession after the break, but they could not prevent Thistle leapfrogging them.
Thistle's second home league victory of the season ended Dundee's run of three wins in a row at Firhill.
The opening 15 minutes passed by without too much incident, but when Doolan tumbled to the ground on the edge of the visitors' 18-yard box, referee Alan Muir decided to award the home side a free-kick.
Despite the protests from Dundee captain O'Dea, the decision stood and Booth curled a left-foot shot around the defensive wall with Bain rooted to his goalline.
Thistle looked slick going forward and Erskine brought out a save from Bain as Alan Archibald's side continued to dominate.
A minute before the break, their advantage was doubled when Bain once again foiled Erskine, but on this occasion, Doolan followed up to knock the ball home.
Extending the contract of Ryan Edwards until the end of next season is proving to be a shrewd piece of business by Thistle.
The 23-year-old once again was the dominant character for the Jags, leaving the Dundee midfield in his wake.
His energy throughout the game was evident and his game-reading in being able to pick up second balls was a joy to watch.
By always making himself available, there was always a threat on the Dundee goal and his darting runs across the pitch brought the home support to their feet.
When any team loses the goalscoring prowess of players such as Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings without ready-made replacements, you know they are in trouble.
Manager Paul Hartley brought in Faissal El Bakhtaoui in the summer and Marcus Haber in October, but they have been unable to emulate the two departures.
Haber had two long-range headers in the second-half, but it was a fairly simple evening in Maryhill for home goalkeeper Tomas Cerny.
Only Kilmarnock have scored fewer goals this season than Dundee and, unless the strikers find their scoring boots quickly, another bottom-six spot, or even worse, could await the Dens Park side as they head towards 2017.
Partick Thistle's Alan Archibald: "Its good to look at the table. I have said before when we lost games don't be down about it and we wont get too high about it either.
"It gives us a massive incentive for the weekend against Kilmarnock. Another home game that we have to capitalise on.
"The two teams matched up with similar shapes and personnel. It can get a bit scrappy but we knew we had good creative players on the pitch with the bit of quality to give us goals. I thought we managed the game very well."
Dundee's Paul Hartley: "It's disappointing to lose the game in that manner. I didn't feel there was a lot in the game between both sides.
"I think the crucial part of the game was they took their chances and they punished us. Kosta [Kostadin Gadzhalov] makes the tackle [for the first goal] and wins the ball cleanly. We had that back at Celtic Park two weeks ago and also got punished so two good tackles, I think nowadays you just cant tackle. We ask defenders to stay on their feet but if they win the ball they win the ball.
"It's been difficult [scoring goals] but Haber has done well since coming in. He has been an excellent addition for us but we need everyone else helping."
