The family of a missing Bristol DJ have said they have received abusive messages after starting legal proceedings to have him declared dead.

Derek Serpell-Morris, known as DJ Derek, has been missing since July.
The Bristol Post reported that an application will be made under the Presumption of Death Act.
His niece Jennifer Griffiths said that since then they had been targeted by people alleging the family was trying to access his assets.
The case is still being pursued as an "active inquiry", Avon and Somerset Police say.
"[But] the police don't think he is alive, we don't think he is alive - there has to be an end to this," she said.
DJ Derek was last seen on CCTV in Bristol city centre on 11 July 2015.
His bus pass was used later that day but there has been no trace of him since.
The family have started gathering the evidence they need to be granted a certificate of presumed death.
According to the charity Missing People, the process of obtaining a certificate can take between four and six months.
Relatives need to collect evidence such as bank information, newspaper clippings about the missing person and police statements.
Ms Griffiths has hit out at speculation the family were trying to profit from the proceedings.
She said the death certificate will "give us some closure and enable us to tie-up loose ends".
"He doesn't have life insurance or a will," said Ms Griffiths.
"His flat is privately owned and the landlord wants the flat back and this is the only way we can do that.
"People have said we want the money in his bank but it's his pension and we have to pay it back once we get his death certificate."
The family are planning a memorial for DJ Derek and Ms Griffiths said she will continue looking for her uncle.
"I'm not giving up on him. I'll continue to keep looking for him until we have exhausted all avenues."
Avon and Somerset Police said they were "still very keen to hear from anyone who has information on this case and we are actively seeking new leads in the inquiry".
