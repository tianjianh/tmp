Seven counties in Wales now have their own flags

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flintshire has become the latest Welsh county to adopt a flag, and campaigners hope the standard, adopted from an ancient design, will soon be flown across the area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the seventh historical area in Wales to register a flag with the Flag Institute, a charity which manages a list of banners, with two other counties - the former Cardiganshire and Radnorshire areas - still campaigning for their own.
Dr Shaun Evans, who was one of the people behind Flintshire's new flag, said it won support from locals and the county council.
"It is primarily about celebrating and promoting an identity for Flintshire and help sell the county to the world," said Dr Evans.
