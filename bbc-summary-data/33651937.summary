Roald Dahl Plass near the Millennium Centre will be transformed into an urban beach until 5 September.
An estimated 300 tonnes of sand will be used to create the attraction, which will also have fairground rides and live entertainment.
The beach is part of the summer-long Cardiff Festival.
Norman George Sayers, of organisers Sayers Amusements, said: "The beach has been so popular since we set it up two summers ago.
"We've made some changes to last year's format and visitors can look forward to bringing their children down to a fun-filled, safe environment."
