A man who claimed to be a professional distributor of child abuse images has been jailed for 15 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Cannon of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire said he had no sexual interest in the images himself, he just wanted to sell them to make money.
The 22-year-old admitted possessing and distributing indecent images of children.
Swansea Crown Court heard the expert who examined the images described them as the worst he had ever seen.
Cannon told police he had been swapping indecent images since he was 13-years-old.
Recorder Peter Rouch, said Cannon had been, in effect, continuing the abuse of children by both seeking out such material and then passing it on to others.
Welcoming the sentence, a NSPCC Cymru spokesman said: "The shocking scale of Cannon's offending and the particularly horrific nature of these images is deeply disturbing.
"Every single image represents a crime scene and behind each is a young victim of abuse who will need support to recover from what has happened to them.
"Those who distribute this appalling material are responsible for increasing its proliferation and - inevitably - leading to more children being abused."
