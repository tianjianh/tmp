[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-0 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle's unbeaten run rolled on to nine League Two games when a second-half goal from Shaun Miller proved enough to beat Wycombe 1-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
However, the visitors could consider themselves unfortunate not to earn a share of the spoils when Matt Bloomfield and Scott Kashket saw shots strike the woodwork.
A probing ball from Macaulay Gillesphey provided an early chance for Miller but Jamal Blackman in the Wycombe goal was out quickly to win the race for the ball.
Carlisle were getting plenty of crosses into the box without finding the necessary accuracy and shots from Jason Kennedy and Charlie Wyke kept Blackman on his toes.
Wycombe were twice denied a goal in the 40th minute, first by the woodwork when Bloomfield's snap-shot had Mark Gillespie beaten, then by a great save when Paul Hayes looked certain to score from the rebound until the Carlisle goalkeeper flung himself across his line to claw the ball away.
Both sides were struggling for fluency, but Carlisle broke the deadlock in the 57th minute when Danny Grainger sent Miller clear and the striker cut in unchallenged from the left to dink his shot past Blackman from 15 yards.
For the second time in the match the woodwork came between the Chairboys and a goal when substitute Kashket wriggled free on the edge of the area but saw his left-foot shot hit a post with Gillespie beaten.
Carlisle could have added to their narrow advantage late on as Blackman saved well from close-range strikes by Reggie Lambe and Tom Miller.
