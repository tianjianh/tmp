The 23-year-old Wales international midfielder joined the Vixens in 2015.
She has previously played for Arsenal Ladies and Coventry City.
"I gave Hayley the captaincy last year, at a young age, but she has not let me down," head coach Willie Kirk told Bristol City's club website. "She has handled it with a lot of maturity."
Kirk's side will begin their 2017 league campaign against Reading at Ashton Gate on Saturday, 22 April.
