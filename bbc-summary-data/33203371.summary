Many experienced medical staff have been critical of the treatment of whistleblowers at ARI.
A letter to the minister claimed there was evidence of NHS Grampian targeting other staff.
The health board said it would not discuss matters involving individual members of staff.
Ms Robinson said: "The process in this case is underway and needs to be allowed to conclude without interference. It would be completely inappropriate for myself or any politician to become involved.
"Finally, you note there have been significant changes within the senior leadership at NHS Grampian and I welcome your view on the substance, experience and integrity of the Board's new Chairman and Chief Executive.
"I can assure you that I am satisfied the Senior Leadership of the Board has demonstrated these values in the management of the matters you raise."
A Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) review released in December warned that patient care at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary faced a "serious impact" if problems were not "urgently addressed".
It identified concerns about leadership and culture which were impacting on the quality of care, and made 13 recommendations for improvements
The review was one of three critical reports into health care in the north east of Scotland published on the same day.
A whistleblower subsequently told BBC Scotland that staff at Aberdeen Royal were being "stretched almost to breaking point".
NHS Grampian's refusal to publish in full a report In March into general surgery at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was branded a "failure of transparency" by MSP Lewis Macdonald.
BBC Scotland was given a heavily redacted version following a Freedom of Information request.
A statement issued by NHS Grampian said: "NHS Grampian does not comment on specific circumstances surrounding the employment status of any member of staff.  Our processes are full and robust and any decision about an individual's employment would never be taken lightly and only reached after a thorough analysis of the circumstances in each individual case.
It added: "Using locum doctors ensures that we can continue to provide a service to our patients and their use is driven by clinical imperative rather than by cost."
