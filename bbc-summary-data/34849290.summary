Nice fans held lit candles during the minute's silence, with French national anthem La Marseillaise played before the game at the Allianz Riviera.
The country's government announced on Tuesday that the weekend's Ligue 1 fixtures would go ahead as planned.
But Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve imposed a ban on away fans in games this weekend as a security measure.
Fans were searched as they entered the stadium, as will be the case at all games this weekend.
The Stade de France was among the venues targeted during last Friday's attacks in the capital as three attackers blew themselves up near the stadium, where France were playing Germany in a friendly.
La Marseillaise will be played before all matches this weekend in Ligue 1, Ligue 2 and the Coupe de France.
Frederic Thiriez - president of the Ligue de Football Professionnel, which governs the French league - said: "Playing football is an act of resistance in the face of barbarism.
"After the pain, after the tears, life must go on. Sportspeople, just like artists, can set the example."
There were also three Ligue 2 matches on Friday, plus two more in the Coupe de France.
Nice moved up to third in the table thanks to their win, while second-placed Lyon remain 10 points behind unbeaten leaders Paris St-Germain, who visit Lorient on Saturday.
