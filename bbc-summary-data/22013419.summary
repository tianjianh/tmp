[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After a wave of German bombers attacked the Isle of Wight 70 years ago, the life of one little girl was changed forever.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christine Pascoe was nine when the eight low-flying aircraft fired cannons and dropped their bombs on Chapel Street in Newport on 7 April 1943.
She was found under a mattress unconscious in the garden of the two-bedroom home where she was born.
The house next door in the terrace had taken a direct hit.
"I was in bed, the bomb threw me out of the house, they found me in the garden with the bed on top of me which they think saved my life," said Mrs Pascoe, now 79.
Her 36-year-old mother Eva Palmer, who had been downstairs preparing breakfast, was killed in the blast but her father had already gone to work and escaped the devastation.
Mrs Pascoe, who was at the time a schoolgirl named Christine Palmer, was taken to hospital with serious head injuries and was unconscious for a month.
She remembers waking up in hospital unable to see.
"Mortar from the bricks was in my eyes, I can remember them washing and washing my eyes out until I could see," she said.
"I know my mum by her photographs but I don't remember her."
The raid killed 17 civilians and one off-duty airman and two more civilians died later as a result of their injuries.
Chapel Street, Clarence Road and Terrace Road had the greatest fatalities.
At Moreys timber yard in Medina Avenue four workers died.
A memorial service is being held at St John's Church, at the heart of where the bombs hit, for survivors and their families to mark the date.
A remembrance plaque for those who lost their lives that morning is also planned for the area.
Mrs Pascoe said most people in the town today were unaware of that fateful day,
She said: "They don't know it even happened.
"We need to remember that civilians die in war too. We're too quick to try to sort things out by fighting.
"We all need to remember what happens in war, and those who died.
"A plaque will mean a lot to me - I do think that they have been forgotten.
"It was such a waste of life."
