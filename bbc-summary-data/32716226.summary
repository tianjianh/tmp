Announcing his decision, Dane County District Attorney Ishmael Ozanne said police officer Matt Kenny had been attacked and feared for his life.
Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson Jr, who was mixed race and unarmed, was shot on 6 March in a Madison apartment.
His death sparked protests in the state capitol building, one of a series of US police shootings to raise tensions.
More protesters with banners saying "Black lives matter" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday.
Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the "fight" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church.
Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: "This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny."
Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson.
On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports.
His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was "acting crazy" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said.
Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs.
He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him.
But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality.
"My decision won't bring him back, it will not end the racial disparities that exist in justice system," said Mr Ozanne.
"It is not based on emotion, rather the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me, guided by the rule of law."
