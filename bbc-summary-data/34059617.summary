The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had received 47 referrals from the force, involving more than 100 allegations.
So far more than 60 officers have been identified.
The complaints include allegations of neglect of duty and of corruption.
The IPCC said it was continuing to examine police conduct exactly a year on from the publication of the Jay Report, which found the abuse of 1,400 children in the town over a 16-year period had been dealt with inadequately by a range of agencies.
A spokeswoman for the IPCC said: "Analysis of all the referrals has so far identified more than 60 officers.
"Further assessments are being carried out to establish the specific allegations against these individuals to determine what further actions are needed.
"Work is ongoing to identify more than 100 officers who are referenced in the referrals but are unnamed."
Professor Alexis Jay detailed how girls as young as 11 were raped, trafficked, abducted, beaten, and intimidated, predominantly by men of Pakistani heritage between 1997 and 2013.
South Yorkshire Police said there were now over 60 officers on its team dealing with child sexual exploitation.
