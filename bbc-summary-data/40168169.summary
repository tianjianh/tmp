The victims of the "cat serial killer" died in Saint Pierre la Mer, 90km (55 miles) south-west of Montpellier.
The Society for the Protection of Animals has been overwhelmed by calls, La Depeche newspaper says.
Rodents and birds reportedly also died after swallowing the poison, amid fears children might also ingest it.
The Association of Stray Cats has reported the events to police in the hope that autopsies can be carried out.
"The atmosphere has become hateful, nobody trusts anyone," a villager named only as GeneviÃ¨ve was quoted as saying by French daily Ouest-France.
"We're all afraid a child might ingest some of this mystery poison."
