Organisers of a festival where hundreds of cars were left stranded following flooding say they will move the park and ride and reduce capacity to prevent future problems.

Vehicles were stuck for hours and people were forced to stay at a leisure centre after heavy rain at Gwynedd's Festival No.6.
Measures are also being introduced to protect the Portmeirion festival site.
Capacity is being reduced to "allow the site to breathe" and cut bottlenecks.
The new locations for the park and ride will be announced in early 2017.
Portmeirion's managing director Robin Llywelyn previously told BBC Wales "lessons needed to be learned" from the problems at this year's event.
He added there were perhaps "too many people" at the festival, which is held near Porthmadog.
In a statement on the Festival No.6 website, organisers said: "We have spent the last two months listening to feedback and working on improvements to many areas.
"We are absolutely committed to making the best festival experience for every single customer.
"We will be reducing capacity slightly to avoid bottlenecks and allow the site space to breathe.
"It is hugely important to us that the festival retains its intimate feel."
The statement also said there would be more floorings in venues to protect the ground and walkways; and work would be undertaken to "improve the access and flow of audience".
Portmeirion's historic buildings, including Castell Deudraeth, will also be better protected by limiting access to those with VIP weekend tickets, it said.
Organisers have also said they will encourage lift shares, add more shower facilities, and move some events to other venues.
The festival will also feature a new information centre, following complaints from festival-goers.
