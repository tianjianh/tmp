Thomas Shaw, 61, attacked the teenager in West Lothian between March and April 2014.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told how Shaw had been drunk at the time of the offence.
Shaw, from Armadale in West Lothian, pled guilty to rape at the High Court in Glasgow earlier this month and sentence had been deferred.
Judge Lord Bracadale told Shaw that jail was the only sentence available to the court.
