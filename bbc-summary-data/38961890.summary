Shrewsbury midfielder Shaun Whalley says they have become more 'structured' since Paul Hurst took over as manager.

Hurst, who took charge on 24 October, has helped the team go on a six-match unbeaten run which has lifted them away from the League One relegation zone.
"We're not out of it yet," Whalley told BBC Radio Shropshire.
"He's done fantastically. If I knew how he's done it, I'd be a manager too by now, because I'd know the secret formula. But it's organisation really."
He added: "You think 50 points to stay up. We're on 35. We're not there yet.
"I know we're six games unbeaten, but the gaffer's never been complacent. Every game he gets back on the mentality of not losing.
"We're a bit more structured now. We've kept a lot of clean sheets and we always look dangerous on the break."
Saturday's 1-0 win at League One leaders Scunthorpe is the highlight of Shrewsbury's inspired run since the reopening of the transfer window.
During January they brought in four new loan strikers, one of whom, Crystal Palace's Freddie Ladapo, has now hit four matchwinning goals.
That follows in the footsteps of another Palace loan man, Sullay Kaikai, whose 12 goals in 26 games kept Town up last season.
