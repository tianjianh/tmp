The Irish Open has now been staged in Northern Ireland twice since 2012.
Tourism Northern Ireland's chief operating officer, Kathryn Thomson, said such events provided a clear boost for the economy.
"One of the main reasons we host these major events is we can drive legacy around it," she told the BBC's Inside Business.
"From the Irish Open and the other golf events we'll be having, we've developed a golf tourism strategy.
"We know that golf is worth £33m to the economy now, but we also know that golfers spend a lot more money than regular tourists, and we believe that we can realistically grow that to £50m by 2020."
Inside Business is on BBC Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle at 13:30 BST on Sunday 5 July.
