Rubel Ahmed: Open verdict in Morton Hall detainee death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest jury has decided various factors led to the death of a man found hanging at an immigration centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rubel Ahmed was being detained at Morton Hall, Lincolnshire when he was found in his room two days before he was due to be deported to Bangladesh.
The 26-year-old's death in September led to a 12-hour disturbance among inmates at the facility.
Returning an open conclusion, the jury said inadequate communication was one of the factors in Mr Ahmed's death.
During the six-day inquest at Central Lincolnshire Coroner's Court the jury heard no concerns had been raised about Mr Ahmed's welfare.
Staff from the centre said Mr Ahmed did not seem angry or upset about his deportation and no-one realised that he was "at risk".
Officer Christine Stewart previously said: "Everybody did everything they could to resuscitate him. I just wish Mr Ahmed had told us something was wrong."
Following the hearing his family described him as "a very humble, gentle character" whose death had "left a real void in our hearts".
Coroner Stuart Fisher said he would now send his recommendations about detention centres to the Home Office.
In a statement, a Home Office representative said they took "their responsibilities towards detainees' welfare extremely seriously" and that an independent review is now underway.
Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service on behalf of the UK Border Agency.
Emma Mlotshwa, from the charity Medical Justice, said the jury's finding highlighted a number of issues which existed in many centres.
She said: "We are very concerned this could happen again at any time because there seems to be no system to identify vulnerable detainees and deal with that situation."
