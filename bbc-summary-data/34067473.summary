Tata Steel job losses: Call for more help after Llanwern cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones and union leaders have urged the UK Government to do more to help steelmakers compete by cutting their electricity costs.

Tata Steel is to mothball part of its plant in Llanwern with the loss of 250 jobs.
The UK Government is providing Â£35m to steel companies to help offset electricity costs.
But Mr Jones wants more of a response, saying high UK energy costs made it difficult for firms to be competitive.
"We have said this many, many times to UK government. They haven't responded effectively yet - we do need to see action," Mr Jones told BBC Wales.
Sue Lewis, regional organiser for the union Community, said it had been calling for help for years with energy prices but the support would only be in place in 2016.
"If this was brought in two years ago, maybe we wouldn't be having these redundancies," she said.
UK Business Minister Anna Soubry has said the UK Government would continue to "work closely with the sector to provide help where we can".
"My department has provided steelmakers with millions of pounds in compensation for energy costs and recently voted to extend anti-dumping measures on certain Chinese steel products.
"I will continue to meet with companies like Tata and provide support where we can."
On Wednesday, Tata confirmed some of its coil processing facilities at Llanwern would "come out of production" but added they would be retained so they can be "restarted in more favourable market conditions".
Analysis by Bran Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent
Tata has been hit by cheaper steel imports from China and the higher costs of energy in the UK compared to its European competitors.
China is no longer building like it once was but is still producing all the steel. It's now selling that steel to Europe and it's much cheaper and while some say the quality is inferior, it's good enough for use in construction here. So Tata is now deciding to concentrate on the higher quality products which can't be produced in China.
Energy prices are particularly high in the UK and this is not just hitting companies like Tata but small businesses are feeling it as well.
There is help coming from the UK Government but that won't happen until 2016. The steel industry has been calling for years for that help to come in soon rather than later. And many, including the Community union, are saying how many jobs could have been saved if the help had been brought in sooner?
The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales said it would be hard for so many skilled workers affected by the cuts to find work in the Newport area.
"The Welsh government is placing too strong a focus on attracting mobile global multi-nationals to Wales at the expense of plans to support smaller local firms."
