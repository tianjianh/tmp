[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doctor suspended over six-year-old's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor who was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after the death of a six-year-old boy has been suspended for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock, who had a heart condition, died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 hours after being admitted with sickness and vomiting.
In November 2015, Hadiza Bawa-Garba was convicted of Jack's manslaughter.
A tribunal has found it in the public interest for her to be suspended immediately from the medical register.
Following the two-day hearing before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), in Manchester, she has been suspended for 12 months.
A review hearing will then be held before that period expires.
The tribunal heard evidence from the General Medical Council (GMC) and the doctor's lawyers.
A report from the MPTS following the hearing, said: "Having considered the submissions and in the light of all the circumstances of your case, the seriousness of the tribunal's findings and the fact that you have not practised since November 2015, the tribunal is satisfied that it is necessary to protect patients and members of the public and is otherwise in the public interest for your registration to be suspended immediately."
Jack, of Glen Parva, died from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis after he was admitted to the Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011.
Bawa-Garba, was given a two year suspended prison sentence after her conviction.
She appealed against the conviction, but her bid failed in December.
