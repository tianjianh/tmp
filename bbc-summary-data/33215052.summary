Three people have died and five have been injured in a flat fire in Derbyshire.

One resident who managed to escape dropped his son into the arms of a neighbour before fire crews arrived just after 04:00 BST.
A man, a woman, and a young girl were pronounced dead at the scene, in North Street, Langley Mill.
East Midlands Ambulance Service said a member of the public told them a car fire had spread to nearby flats.
Resident Sean Needham said: "I heard my smoke alarms going off and I opened the door and saw the house full of smoke.
"One of the neighbours climbed over his garden fence and I passed my lad down to him.
"I dropped him about six feet into the neighbour's arms. Me and my wife got out down a ladder."
Mr Needham, who believes all his belongings have been lost through fire and water damage, said his six-year-old son was "traumatised and frightened".
"My main concern was for him because he was born with chronic lung disease... but he was checked out at the hospital and was shaken but fine.
"I am still shaking and... I am in shock but I am glad I am still here. I owe my neighbour my life as he saved my little boy."
Alex Clark, who helped rescue Mr Needham's son, said: "Sean passed his little lad down to me - I'm not a hero - I am just a person that has helped to rescue a family."
He added: "It is tragic. It is the sort of thing you wish would never happen."
Five people were taken to hospital - four to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham and one to the Royal Derby Hospital, the ambulance service said.
Several neighbouring properties were evacuated as the fire caused a gas leak.
Neighbour Craig McFarlane said: "There was a lot of noise and confusion - I went round and there was a car on fire.
"We went to get a few ladders and managed to get a few people out. There were about 30-40 people running around. Everyone was out there doing what they could do.
"Flames were climbing up the stairs and up the flats so fast. Nobody stood a chance."
Another neighbour Paul Barber said: "We saw people trapped in the property and one of our neighbours threw his sonâ€¦ to safety.
"There were two people hanging out of a window screaming for help but they managed to get out."
John Dunkley, a watch manager with Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, tweeted: "Terrible night shift. Thoughts with all personnel from all emergency services involved at Langley Mill this morning."
A fire service spokesman said: "Two people from the property affected by the fire, and a further three residents from adjacent flats were able to escape.
"Our thoughts and sympathies go out to the family and friends of the deceased."
Four fire engines were sent to the blaze.
A police spokesman said they were "keeping an open mind as to the cause of the fire", but said nothing had been ruled out.
