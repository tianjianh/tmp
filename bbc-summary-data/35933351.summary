The teenager is charged with supplying drugs in East Calder, where police are investigating the death of 15-year-old Dione Melville.
Emergency services were called to a house in the town on Sunday morning, but the teenager was pronounced dead a short time later.
Officers are currently treating the death as "unexplained".
Another two 15-year-old girls were taken to St John's Hospital in Livingston as a precaution.
Diona attended West Calder High School.
Acting head teacher Lisa Grubb said: "Dione was a popular girl and this is clearly a very upsetting time for her friends and family.
"She was an ambitious young lady who had plans to work in hairdressing and in the beauty industry after leaving school in the summer.
"She was very focused on her future and the thoughts of the entire school community are with Dione's family and friends at this incredibly sad time."
Dozens of tributes have been left on social media by the teenagers' friends.
One said: "Rest in paradise, my beautiful girl. You didn't deserve to get taken away from us. Shine bright, fly high and sleep tight babe. I love and miss you forever and ever my girl."
