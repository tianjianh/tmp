Dyer, who joined Swansea from Southampton in 2009, had one year left on his previous contract.
The 28-year-old returned following a season-long loan spell at Leicester City, where he picked up a Premier League winners medal in 2015-16.
"I'm happy to be back here at the club that first gave me the opportunity to show what I can do," he said.
"I had a good year at Leicester - the experience I had was unbelievable.
"Coming back, there was only one thought in my mind - impress the new manager, speak to the chairman, get into the team and play games.
"I was going into the final year of my contract, so it was nice to sign a new deal. The new deal will keep me here until I finish."
Dyer has scored 31 goals in 271 appearances for Swansea having initially joined on loan from Southampton in January 2009 before making the move permanent five months later.
He is the latest player to commit to the Swans after midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson also signed a new four-year deal.
The Swans have rejected a Â£10m bid from Everton for central defender and captain Ashley Williams and chairman Huw Jenkins said new additions to the squad were imminent.
