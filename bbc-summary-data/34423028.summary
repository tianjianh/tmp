International artists were asked to contribute works which demonstrate the impact Ikea has had on their lives.
The Dream of Modern Living? features a coffin made from a Billy Book case and a shelving unit in which a plastic explosive has been set off.
Curator Paul Carey-Kent said: "It's about the power of transformation, in which Ikea provides the raw materials."
Warrington was the location of the UK's first Ikea store, which opened in 1987.
It is said to have the highest visitor numbers of any store in the country, and allegedly the lowest spend per head.
Will Lynn, one of the show's organisers, said: "Everyone has their own personal experience of Ikea and that oscillates between frustration with quite difficult instructions through to the excitement of getting quite affordable designs."
The exhibition runs from 2 October to 14 November.
