[SN]TITLE[SN]
Somerset health and social care services to merge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health and social care services in North Somerset are to be integrated to contain costs and improve efficiency.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At present, adult and children's social care and health services are the responsibility of different departments.
Under new plans, a single integrated organisation will be responsible for running the services.
The NHS's Peter Colclough said: "Integrated care would bring a more joined-up way of caring for people."
The chief executive of Weston Area Health NHS Trust added: "It will see staff in health and social care working as a single team to make sure people get the support they need, when and where they need it, without confusion or delay."
The work towards integrated care is one of a wider group of improvements in health care planned for the area.
From April 2013, responsibility for public health services will transfer from the primary care trust to North Somerset Council.
And in the same month, the area's GPs will be being working together as the North Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group.
