Walter Palmer from the state of Minnesota is believed to have paid about Â£32,000 to hunt lions in the wild.
Cecil the lion's death has prompted a huge reaction from many on social media, with tens of thousands of people signing a petition asking for Cecil's killer to be punished for what he did.
Mr Palmer said he thought the hunt was legal and didn't know the lion was protected.
