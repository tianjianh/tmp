The Wales centre is one of eight internationals coach Wayne Pivac will give first pre-season outings.
Davies rejoined Scarlets after two years with Clermont and will play a week after seeing his brother James win a silver medal at the Rio Olympics.
"I'm looking forward to it, he's a great player coming back," said fellow centre Scott Williams.
Davies' return to the Scarlets on a dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union was heralded as a key signing for the game in Wales as well as the region.
The 2013 British and Irish Lion is one of a number of players opting to either return from playing in England and France or to stay in Wales.
As well as being a boost for the domestic game, it means tough competition for places in the Scarlets midfield with player-of-the-season Hadleigh Parkes, Gareth Owen and Steffan Hughes also in the mix.
Williams, who missed most of the 2015-16 domestic season with a knee injury he suffered playing in Wales' World Cup win over England, welcomes the competition.
"I think Jonathan is enjoying it back here with the boys - it's our second week in now so we've been straight back in the mix," he added.
"You want competition in positions it keeps you all on your toes and brings out the best in you.
"Last season maybe that's what we didn't have, just that strength in depth when some one got injured we didn't have someone with a bit of experience to come in.
"This year we can chop and change and if someone is carrying a knock we've got as-good a player to come in and fill that position."
Scarlets were beaten 45-3 by Exeter in their first pre-season friendly, but coach Pivac says the team to play Bath is being picked with their opening Pro12 game against Munster on 3 September.
He confirmed Williams and Davies will both play against Bath, along with Ken Owens, Jake Ball, John Barclay, Gareth Davies, Aled Davies and Liam Williams.
Pivac added that Jonathan Davies' recent return from Rio was not a concern because he resumed pre-season training before the other internationals in the squad.
"Jonathan came in a week earlier than the others and put in some solid work," he said.
"Those players won't be playing the entire game, it's about being smart and easing them into it.
"They've had a big break and they're in a bit of catch-up mode so we don't have a lot of pre-season matches so it's important they get a run."
The game against Bath is the Scarlets' final friendly before the Pro12 season kicks-off.
