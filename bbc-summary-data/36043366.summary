[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man jailed for £10 shop robbery in Cockenzie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for more than three years for a robbery in which he took a single £10 note.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Bollard, 25, had been freed early from prison for a similar offence when he raided a newsagent and grocery shop in Cockenzie, East Lothian.
The court was told the shopkeeper, Mohammad Ramzan was shaken but physically unharmed by the incident, in which Bollard brandished a screwdriver.
Bollard's lawyer said he felt "remorse" for the attack on 16 August last year.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Uist told Bollard: "When you committed this offence you were under the influence of drugs and alcohol."
Lord Uist said it was clear from a background report and his previous convictions that he had "a long-standing drug misuse problem".
He jailed Bollard for three years and two months, but ordered that he first serve 183 days imprisonment, which was outstanding from his previous sentence for armed robbery with a knife.
The judge also ordered that he should be kept under supervision for a further two years.
