The France international, 29, has made only nine Premier League starts in his two seasons at Stamford Bridge following a £10.5m move from QPR.
Remy played with Palace boss Alan Pardew on loan at Newcastle in 2013-14, scoring 14 goals.
"It was very important to know Alan Pardew as he is a very good manager and I am happy to be here," said Remy.
Pardew said: "Loic has been a target of mine throughout this transfer window and I'm delighted the deal has been done.
"I brought him to Newcastle so I know what he is capable of and I am convinced he will be a quality addition to our squad as we evolve.
"Loic has international and Champions League experience as well as being a Premier League title winner and is the latest example of the high calibre of players we have brought into the club during this transfer window."
It is understood that Tottenham have now ended their interest in signing Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha this summer.
Spurs had bid £15m for the 23-year-old England international but a move was blocked by Palace chairman Steve Parish.
Zaha rejoined Palace in February 2015 for £3m just two years after a £15m move to Old Trafford,
