UFC 199: Michael Bisping steps in to face Luke Rockhold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Bisping has a chance to become the UK's first UFC champion after stepping in to fight Luke Rockhold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bisping's opportunity comes after Chris Weidman was forced out of UFC 199 on 4 June in Los Angeles with a neck injury.
Manchester middleweight Bisping's last fight was a unanimous-decision win over Anderson Silva in London in February.
However, the 37-year-old lost to Rockhold in their only previous meeting, submitting in the second round of their November 2014 fight.
