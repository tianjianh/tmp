Dominic Preece, 17, fell between a platform and a train at Droitwich Spa Station on 12 May.
His partner, Tom Holford, said doctors told him his actions had saved his boyfriend's life.
Mr Preece's mother Kerry is calling for improved safety at the station. London Midland said it was investigating.

Mr Preece was chasing after a train to retrieve a bag he had left onboard when he fell.
Mr Holford was alerted by another passenger and jumped on the track to help the teenager and wrapped him in a coat.
"I didn't even think about whether another train was coming. It didn't seem real," he said.
"I found him with his arm hanging off. The doctors said I saved his life."
Mr Preece, who has learning difficulties, is still in hospital after having his left arm amputated.
His family has started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for a prosthetic limb for Mr Preece, who wants to work with horses.
"With Dom's special needs, without the use of a limb would make it harder for [him] to cope," his mother said.
"Dominic's left-handed and he's lost his left arm, so he's now struggling."
Ms Preece said she would like to see a smaller gap between trains and the platform.
"You get off the train and the gap is horrendous. You have to jump from the train to the platform," she added.
London Midland, which is responsible for the station, is looking into the full circumstances of what happened.
A spokesman added: "This was a very tragic accident and our thoughts go out to Dominic and his family"
In a statement, Network Rail said it was, "committed to looking at ways to further improve safety".
British Transport Police said under normal circumstances passengers should refrain from trespassing on the line and in the past ten years, almost 170 people have lost their lives by going on the tracks.
