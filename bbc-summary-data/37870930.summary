The e-petitions sent to government that get rejected

Flood the Channel Tunnel. Ban cats from going outdoors. Bring back fish and chips wrapped in newspaper.

The most popular e-petitions ever cover some slightly less unusual subjects.
The petition with the most signatures - over four million of them - called on the government to hold a second EU membership referendum if either Leave or Remain were backed by less than 60% of voters and saw a turnout of less than 75%.
