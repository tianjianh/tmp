One of the Middle East's largest retail chains has withdrawn Donald Trump products from its shelves after he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.

Lifestyle said it had removed Trump Home products from its stores in the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
"Lifestyle values and respects the sentiments of all its customers," parent group Landmark said.
It did not say what the contract was worth.
"In light of the recent statements made by the presidential candidate in the US media, we have suspended sale of all products from the Trump Home decor range," Sachin Mundhwa, chief executive of the Landmark Group, added.
Landmark Group is one of the biggest retail groups in the region, with 190 shops in the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan.
Trump Home - which sells items such as a "table lamp in antique brass with crystal drops" or a decorative box with a "brilliant plume of a peacock... redecorated in gold finish for an exclusive look" - is just one of a range of businesses to which the Republican presidential hopeful has licensed his name.
Other interests include luxury properties, golf courses and hotels.
The billionaire property magnate and reality TV star said on Monday he would block Muslim tourists, students and immigrants from entering the US following a mass shooting in San Bernadino, California.
A Muslim couple, believed to have been radicalised, killed 14 people at a health centre.
The remarks have caused a global outcry, while a petition calling for Mr Trump to be barred from entering the UK has now passed 100,000, meaning MPs will have to consider debating the issue.
