[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish parties are warning voters over the consequences of backing their rivals in the push for Westminster seats.

The Scottish Conservatives said any deal between Labour and the SNP would lead to "outright chaos".
The SNP, meanwhile, said it could provide a strong and progressive influence at Westminster.
Labour said SNP plans could cost the country billions, while the Lib Dems said voting SNP is "risky business".
Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has written to supporters saying the electoral choice is between the Conservatives or the "outright chaos" of Ed Miliband "propped up" by the SNP.
She wrote: "On behalf of all the people of Scotland who want to keep our UK together, I will be spelling out the consequences of this potential deal over the coming days, both for our economy and for the stability of our country.
"And I will be setting out something else very clearly - that if people want to avoid the chaos of a Labour/SNP pact, then only a Conservative government can achieve it."
But SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: "I want to make very clear, and I'm conscious of the fact that I'm speaking not just to voters in Scotland but to voters right across the UK - that I've got to persuade and convince people that the SNP in the House of Commons after the election would not be any kind of destructive force.
"We want to be constructive and get better politics coming out of the Westminster system."

Policy guide: Where the parties stand
The Liberal Democrats and Scottish Labour are both focusing on figures that they claim raise questions about SNP backing of full fiscal autonomy.
Labour leader Jim Murphy said new analysis suggests the gap in Scotland's finances could grow to Â£8.7bn a year by the end of the decade, under SNP plans.
He said: "Scottish Labour's manifesto produced fully costed policies that will bring an end to austerity and make life fairer for working class Scots.
"Now it's the SNP's turn. Their key general election policy is to cut Scotland off from UK-wide taxes, meaning an end to the UK pension and welfare state here."
Danny Alexander, for the Lib Dems, also quoted party analysis which he said revealed an Â£8.4bn "black hole" in public finances.
He said: "These devastating figures lay bare the true cost of the SNP's plans to communities across Scotland. It shows that voting SNP is risky business if you want strong public services.
"Only Liberal Democrats have put forward costed and responsible plans to balance the books by 2018."
