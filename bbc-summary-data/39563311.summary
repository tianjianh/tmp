The result leaves Arsenal behind in the race for a top-four league spot, which gets a team in to next season's Champions League competition.
Palace led through Andros Townsend's close-range finish, doubling their lead when Yohan Cabaye's shot looped in.
Luka Milivojevic clinched victory with a penalty as Palace moved six points clear of the relegation zone.
Sixth-placed Arsenal did not manage a shot on target in a poor second half.
Some travelling Arsenal fans again called for manager Wenger, who has led Arsenal to top-four finishes in each of his previous 20 seasons as boss, to leave the club.
The Frenchman's side are seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with eight games remaining.
