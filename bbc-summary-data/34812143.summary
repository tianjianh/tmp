People have until 29 November to bid for items, including a signed "Special One" shirt made for Jose Mourinho and an England top signed by Wayne Rooney.
There is also the chance to watch Barcelona train at the Nou Camp, or meet Everton boss Roberto Martinez.
The online auction is expected to raise thousands of pounds for charity.
Sir Bobby managed Fulham, Ipswich Town, PSV Eindhoven (twice), Sporting Lisbon, Porto, Barcelona and Newcastle United. He also led England to the 1990 World Cup semi-final.
His death from cancer in 2009 sparked tributes from across the sporting world.
Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson once described Sir Bobby as his "managerial inspiration" and has donated a signed sketchbook of the 1999 Champions League final by Salford-born artist Harold Riley.
A "once-in-a-lifetime" Russian football experience has also been offered by the manager of Zenit Saint Petersburg, Andre Villas-Boas.
He said Sir Bobby, who started him off on his career in management, was "a true legend of the game - a great man, a great manager and a real gentleman".
England and Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney has personally offered a Three Lions shirt commemorating his achievement in becoming his country's highest ever goal-scorer.
In addition, there are VIP tickets for next year's Champions League final in Milan, or the Ballon d'Or Awards in Zurich which will be attended by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
Other lots include a "very special Red Arrows experience", VIP tickets for the Reading or Leeds music festivals, a number of fine dining and hotel stays and the chance to record a song at the Buckinghamshire studio used by John Newman and Emeli Sande.
There are also two limited edition Beatles photographs from the Mad Day: Summer of 1968 photographic collection by Tom Murray.
The auction supports the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, League Manager's Association Charity, West Suffolk Hospital Charity and the GeeWizz charitable foundation launched by Gina Long, the Suffolk-based founder of the Sir Bobby's Online Auction.
Ms Long, a friend of the Robson family for 35 years, said: "Sir Bobby was a colossal global figure in football and the love and respect people still have for him is reflected in the unbelievable money-can't-buy prizes that we are so fortunate to receive."
Sir Bobby's widow Lady Robson said: "We're extremely lucky to receive the support we do. It's not something we ever take for granted.
"It's wonderful to know that people still think so fondly of Bob that they want to help his foundation and help us find more effective ways to detect and treat cancer."
