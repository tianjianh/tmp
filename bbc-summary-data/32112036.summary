Views from an island: If we can get Xbox to listen, why not MPs?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This small seaside town in South Essex knows it's in for a battle over the next five weeks.

It was behind the beachfront, at the old nostalgic 100-seat cinema - tickets are Â£2.50 - where UKIP swept into town last month, and launched its election campaign.
There are some signs of support - the local newsagent owner is a big fan of Nigel Farage and got him to reopen his store with a yellow ribbon at the time.
A worker on the esplanade seems incredibly bored by the whole thing.
"Bit of an eye sore that," sighs 24-year-old Mike pointing towards the shop - which is now covered by UKIP posters.
"Having said that I don't actually mind if UKIP get in. They talk sense. But in all honesty, I just can't wait for it to be over."
A group of young mums pushing their prams along the granite walkway agree.
"All these parties will suddenly start caring about us when they don't usually.
"They're all rubbish. Our votes won't really make a difference."
Well, that's not entirely true.
Commuter belt Canvey Island is part of Castle Point - which also covers Hadleigh, South Benfleet and Thundersley.
It's usually won by a Conservative candidate - passing just once to Labour in the 1997 election.
The Conservatives secured 44% of the vote in the 2010 election, UKIP came second with 27%.
Castle Point is a place where Nigel Farage believes his ex-Conservative candidate Jamie Huntman, can overturn Tory Rebecca Harris's 17% majority on 7 May.
"I just don't think immigration is that big a problem here," says Sam Dobinson, who turns 18 in a few weeks.
We meet him away from the windy beachfront and at the Canvey Youth project - an organisation dedicated to helping 11 to 25-year-olds.
"People around here think immigration and crime is a problem, but it isn't here. They still vote on that basis anyway."
His friend 23-year-old Alastair Buttifant disagrees slightly.
"I think immigration is nationally a worry," he says. "People end up voting that way, instead of thinking about it locally.
"But I think there are other issues to be thinking about like homelessness and the NHS."
Both will be voting for the first time and are encouraging their friends to do the same.
Alastair says: "If you don't vote, you can't complain. It's important this year because it's on a knife edge."
Sam reckons people his age could really make a difference if they wanted to.
"I remember that time millions of people boycotted Xbox one, everyone hated their new policies so Microsoft had to change them.
"Imagine if we could apply that mindset to politics."
