John Biggadike, 53, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, was being lifted in a hoist at Pilgrim hospital, Boston, when he fell on part of the equipment.
Lincoln Crown Court was told hospital staff were not using the equipment correctly.

Mr Biggadike was receiving physiotherapy at the hospital ahead of being discharged in April 2012.
Adam Farrer, prosecuting, said staff had not been trained to use the hoist, had been left to devise their own way of using it and were not supervised.
"The prosecution do not blame individuals," he told the jury.
"The prosecution say the trust failed to train them properly and point out the obvious risks."
Mr Farrer said it happened during a break in Mr Biggadike's physiotherapy for him to use a commode.
A knee support on the hoist was removed and he fell as he was being assisted by two members of staff.
Mr Farrer said "Almost immediately he collapsed and fell on to the post which penetrated his rectum causing catastrophic internal injuries and he died."
The prosecutor said since the fatal incident the trust had introduced training for staff to use the hoist.
United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust denies breach of health and safety regulations by exposing non-employees to risk by failing to train, supervise and monitor its employees in relation to the safe use of the lifting hoist.
The trial continues.
