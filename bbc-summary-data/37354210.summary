[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Denny Solomona set a Super League record for most regular-season tries as Castleford beat Catalans in Perpignan for the fist time in six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His double took his tally to 37 and helped Tigers to a 24-10 interval lead.
Paddy Flynn and Ben Crooks also grabbed first-half tries, with Oliver Elima and Glenn Stewart replying.
Crooks and Flynn added further tries, with the Tigers holding on to win as Eloi Pelissier, Louie Anderson and Richie Myler ran in late scores.
Solomona broke the record set by former cross-code international Lesley Vainikolo for Bradford in 2004.
And with his conversion of the former Melbourne Storm winger's first try, Luke Gale brought up 500 career points for the Tigers.
At 34-10 down with 19 minutes to play, the Dragons mounted a comeback despite the sin-binning of Ben Garcia, with Pelissier and Anderson both grabbing tries while they were a man down.
Castleford's triumph spoiled Gregory Mounis' farewell appearance at Stade Gilbert Brutus prior to his retirement at the end of the season.
