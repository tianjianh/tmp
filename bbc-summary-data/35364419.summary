Matthew Peleszon said Shrewsbury Town Football Club told him the garden he used was a memorial area when ex-steward Edward died in 2012.
But he saw a picture on the club's website of building work where a bench and plaque for his father had been.
The club said the official memorial area was elsewhere on the site and it does not know how the mistake happened.
"All we really can do with the family is apologise sincerely," said Jamie Edwards, community manager for the football club.
Memorial bricks were laid behind the Salop Leisure stand and blessed by Bishop Alan Smith and Reverend Tim Welch in 2007, he said.
When ashes were spread at this official site it was recorded and a certificate was given, said Mr Edwards.
The area of trees was a kitchen garden and there is no record of any ashes being scattered there, he added.
Mr Peleszon said: "In October 2012 we liaised with the club about [scattering ashes] on the pitch.
"They said that wasn't an option but they offered us the garden which they said they were going to make into a bit of a memorial.
"It had about 20 different trees and a herb area. We did ours by a cherry tree.
"There were other trees which had blue and amber ribbons and cards on so I know I'm not the only one.
"Ex-employees of the club have been in touch with me and said yes they [the club] did know about it."
Mr Edwards said: "The people at the club really weren't aware of this happening at all.
"It was originally a kitchen garden and for everybody currently at the club that's what we thought it was.
"Until a picture was put on social media and a family came forward that was the first that we had.
"We will be back in touch with the families to see if there's anything we can do to help them."
