The US Open champion sunk a seven-foot putt in the play-off while Watson missed from close range on the 18th.
Both men finished their rounds on six under, though Watson had held a two-shot lead standing on the 17th tee.
Rory McIlroy hit five bogeys and double-bogeyed the par-three 13th to finish on a disappointing two over par, while Jim Furyk finished on three over.
The annual 36-hole event features each year's four major champions, with Furyk invited because of Northern Ireland star McIlroy's double triumph in 2014.
Kaymer held a two-shot lead over Watson following the first round on Tuesday after carding a six-under-par round of 65.
The German hit four birdies and four bogeys in a level-par second round before holding his nerve in the play-off.
Masters champion Watson hit a run of birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th holes to take a two-shot lead, but a wayward tee shot at the next hole scuppered his chances as he dropped a shot on the par-five 17th.
Kaymer birded the same hole and both players parred the last to force the play-off.
Two nice approach shots to the 18th green set up a putting contest on the first play-off hole, and Watson was unable to follow in Kaymer's birdie, missing his attempt from five feet.
