Gun amnesty sees more than 800 firearms surrendered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 800 firearms were handed to police in a guns amnesty launched after a spate of shootings in Salford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police urged people to "give up the gun" during the two-week firearms and ammunition surrender across Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and North Wales.
Rifles, guns, air weapons and a number of imitation and antique firearms were collected.
Unusual items included a replica AK-47 and a Smith & Wesson pistol.
There has been a spike in attacks since Salford's "Mr Big" Paul Massey was killed in July 2015.
The surrender began on 4 April and ended on Monday.
As well as firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition were also handed in.
In 2014, there were 126 weapons handed in to Merseyside Police, 103 in Greater Manchester and more than 100 in Lancashire.
Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable John O'Hare said: "The surrender may be over, but our commitment to tackle gun crime is not. There will be continued efforts from GMP, our colleagues across the North West and our partners as we work together to safeguard, educate and intervene at the earliest opportunity."
Cheshire Police said the majority of weapons handed in to the force were "antiques that had been passed down through generations".
