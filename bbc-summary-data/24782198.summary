League One Carlisle dominated the first half as Sean O'Hanlon's header hit the post, before Lewis Guy forced Wood keeper James Russell into a great stop.
But after the break, home forward David Moli, on loan from Wolves, saw a strike squeeze just inches wide of the post.
Graeme Montgomery also shot wide for the Wood, who secured a trip to a side 76 places above them in the pyramid.
Montgomery came even closer in the opening period against the run of play, when he turned and struck from a long way out to produce the best from visiting goalkeeper Mark Gillespie.
Right at the death, James Berrett could have stolen victory for Graham Kavanagh's Cumbrians, but his volley hit the side netting.
