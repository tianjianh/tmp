Graeme McDowell posted bogeys on each of his final four holes to miss the cut for the third year in a row at the French Open at Le Golf National.

The Northern Irishman, who won the tournament in 2013 and 2014, carded a five-over-par 76 on Friday to lie three over, two shots short of the cut mark.
McDowell has recorded four other bogeys and three birdies before the disastrous end to his second round.
The 2010 US Open champion had fired a promising two-under-par 69 first round.
McDowell has had a best result of 13th at the Dubai Desert Classic this season and lay 92nd in the world rankings prior to the event in France.
The Portrush man will now head home to Portstewart to compete in next week's Irish Open.
Having competed at every Open Championship since 2004, McDowell must try and secure one of the three Open qualifying places available for top-10 finishers at either the Irish Open or the Scottish Open if he is to compete for the Claret Jug at Royal Birkdale later this month.
