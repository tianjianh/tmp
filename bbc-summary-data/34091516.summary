Major changes to Swansea's Kingsway road layout on hold

No major changes will be made to the road system at Swansea's Kingsway until the future of the street has been outlined, Swansea council's leader has said.

Work is due to be carried out to make the road a full one-way system.
It follows the deaths of two people and a number of accidents.
But Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said he would not consider a two-way traffic system until decisions had been made about the future of Kingsway.
The current traffic system on the road allows two lanes of all traffic to travel west on one side of the road, with two lanes of public transport - one going east and one west - on the other side.
In April, a coroner investigating the death of Daniel Foss, 37, after he was hit by a National Express bus, called for action to deal with "serious design issues" on the road.
Swansea council later installed barriers along the carriageway following the death of Sgt Louise Lucas in March, in a bid to prevent pedestrians crossing.
"We are not going to spend millions of pounds on the road until we are clear what the master plan is for the Kingsway," said Mr Stewart.
"We will do the necessary changes.
"In a few months we will release the full plans for the Kingsway and that may see the introduction of two-way traffic."
Work to regenerate the Kingsway into a business district will begin in October with the former Oceana building being demolished with the site earmarked as a possible new home for the council.
