The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have left Kensington Palace with four-day-old Princess Charlotte for their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall.

They will spend the first few weeks of the new princess's life at their recently-refurbished Georgian mansion.
Prince William is beginning two weeks' paternity leave from his job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot.
The Queen first met her new great-granddaughter this week when she visited Kensington Palace.
Princess Charlotte's brother George was with the duke and duchess for the journey to Anmer Hall, where the couple will adjust to life with two young children.
The duke and duchess are expected to be based at Anmer Hall - on the Queen's Sandringham estate - for the next few years as they raise Princess Charlotte and Prince George, who is almost two, with the help of a full-time nanny.
The couple recently undertook major renovations of the mansion, including a new roof and kitchen and the creation of a garden room and quarters for the nanny.
The majority of the renovation costs were paid for by the Royal Family from private funds.
Princess Charlotte was born on Saturday at London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg).
Princess Charlotte's grandfather, the Prince of Wales, was among the early visitors to meet the new fourth in line to the throne - as were the duchess's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and sister Pippa.
