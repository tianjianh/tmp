The hosts favoured an early draw for logistical reasons, while the leading nations preferred a later date to avoid a repeat of 2015's "group of hell" scenario.
England failed to reach the knockout stages of their own tournament after losing to Australia and Wales.
The draw for the 2015 World Cup was held in December 2012, almost three years before the tournament.
Wales' ranking dropped to ninth shortly before the draw, meaning they were drawn against England and Australia. By the time of the tournament, Wales were ranked fifth - one place higher than England.
Wales qualified as Group A runners-up, but coach Warren Gatland said it was "ridiculous" to hold the draw so far in advance.
World Rugby said: "While the draw is closer to the start of the tournament this time around compared to the previous Rugby World Cup, it is necessary to conduct it well in advance for logistical reasons and to allow for an effective ticketing programme to be implemented."
The tournament will take place between 20 September and 2 November 2019.
