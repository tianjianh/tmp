More than £60,000 has been stolen from people in Essex by scammers claiming to be computer support experts from Microsoft and other companies.

Victims were telephoned and told a fault had been detected on their machines and the problem could be fixed by giving the caller remote access.
The fraudsters charge £100 to "fix the fault" but remove up to £400 from people's bank accounts.
More than 120 people have fallen victim in the last two months, police said.
"The fraudsters claim to be from a variety of computer service companies and say they are from software tech support," said Det Insp Lee Morton from the Kent and Essex Serious Economic Crime Unit.
"If remote access is not granted, fraudsters may become aggressive.
"But once given access they will either load a fake virus on to the computer then give the impression that they have removed it, or they will gain access to bank accounts."
The force said legitimate computer companies would never make unsolicited phone calls to request personal information or to fix computers.
