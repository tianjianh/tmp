The 47-year-old man from the Isle of Man died on Tuesday night after being taken to hospital in the early hours of Sunday. His family has been informed.
A post-mortem examination is due to take place, Merseyside Police said.
John Milburn, 19, of Crosby, died on Sunday after he also became ill at Nation in Wolstenholme Square.
Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding what happened to both men.
Det Ch Inspector Andy Ephgrave earlier said: "We are exploring a number of lines of inquiry and it is unclear if both men took illegal substances. The men were not in a group together."
He added: "We would like to take this opportunity to remind people of the dangers of taking illegal drugs."
Cream, a so-called "super club" first opened its doors at Nation in 1992 and went on to become an international brand branching out into Cream Ibiza and the Creamfields festival.
Nation is closing to be replaced by a new music venue.
