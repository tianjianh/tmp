Thomas Muller and Joshua Kimmich scored in the first half before PSV's Luciano Narsingh pulled a goal back shortly before half-time.
Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben both found the net in the second half to stretch Bayern's Champions League record to 14 successive home wins.
Bayern remain three points behind Group D leaders Atletico Madrid, who won 1-0.
"We played very good from the start," said Bayern manager Carlo Ancelotti, whose side lost to Atletico in their previous Champions League tie and had drawn their past two Bundesliga games.
"We had high intensity, it was perfect."
Atletico beat Russian side Rostov and remain one of three sides with a 100% record in this year's Champions League - along with Barcelona and Leicester City.
Yannick Carrasco scored the only goal of the game for last season's runners-up.
In Group A, Paris St-Germain stayed level on points with group leaders Arsenal thanks to a 3-0 win over Basel.
The Swiss champions were unfortunate, hitting the woodwork three times, but were undone by Angel di Maria's first goal of the season, Lucas Moura's second-half strike and a late Edinson Cavani penalty.
Napoli suffered a surprise defeat at home to Bestikas as their perfect start in Group B came to an end.
The Turkish side's striker Vincent Aboubakar scored twice, including an 86th-minute winner, to seal a 3-2 victory and move one point behind the Italians.
Benfica are another point behind in third following a 2-0 away win against Dynamo Kiev.
