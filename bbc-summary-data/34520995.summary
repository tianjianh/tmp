The last airworthy Lancaster Bomber in the UK has taken part in a special flypast for a newly-unveiled Bomber Command memorial and a veteran who thought he had lost his medals.

The aircraft Thumper was grounded following an engine fire and missed recent commemorations in Lincoln.
Donald Nicholson, 93, made headlines when he lost his medals prompting a nationwide search to find them.
He attended a special event in Lincoln to see the aircraft.
Mr Nicholson, a former flight engineer from Sunderland, who flew 31 bombing missions, believed he had lost his medals either on the way to or at the International Bomber Command Centre unveiling.
Speaking at the flypast, he said: "It's all come together with a magical finish - I'm proud as punch."
"You cannot make it up," he added.

Aircrew served in Bomber Command in World War Two
364,514 operational sorties flown
55,573 aircrew killed in action
25,611 killed flying from Lincolnshire
70% of aircrew were killed, taken prisoner or injured
About 80 volunteers and RAF personnel - some wielding metal detectors - searched for his medals but they turned up when his neighbour handed them in to police.
He said he was devastated not to be wearing his medals at the unveiling of the memorial, which involved flypasts from current and historic military aircraft.
He was invited to a special flypast of Thumper, also known as the City of Lincoln, and this time was able to wear his medals.
When told he could witness the Lancaster, he said: "Get away. I have to nip myself to realise it's all happening."
BBC Radio Lincolnshire drove Mr Nicholson from his Houghton-le-Spring home to the flypast.
The plane, from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight based at RAF Coningsby, missed most of the display season after a fire damaged one of its engines. On Monday it was passed fit to fly.
