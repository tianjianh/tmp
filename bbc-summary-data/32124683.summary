Glasgow-based Page\Park Architects have been appointed from a shortlist of five companies which bid for the role.
They will now start work on a detailed plan for restoration. Work is expected to begin in spring 2016 with hopes for academic access from 2017/2018.
The art school is continuing efforts to raise Â£20m to pay for the restoration of the Mackintosh and its contents.
'Design icon'
Prof Tom Inns, director of Glasgow School of Art (GSA), said: "The team assembled by Page\Park Architects impressed us not only with their deep knowledge of the building, but of the wider work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
"They also bring an understanding of the building's particular importance to Glasgow - its people and history - as well as of its status as an international design icon.
"Page\Park Architects have ongoing relationships with key crafts specialists and artists in Scotland and wider afield, and presented exciting proposals for expanding the legacy of the restoration by working with a new generation of creative talent."
GSA said Page/Park had "an extensive track record in both restoring and reinvigorating major historic buildings".
They were lead designers for the Mackintosh Conservation and Access Project from 2007-2009.
They have also worked on Mackintosh's designs, such as the Hillhouse and at the former Glasgow Herald offices - now The Lighthouse.
Prof Inns added: "This is the beginning of an exciting journey of discovery.
"There will be many fascinating questions to be addressed as we undertake this complex restoration project.
"We are looking forward to working in partnership with Page\Park Architects and the design team to explore how we can best meet the needs of the GSA in the 21st century whilst remaining true to Mackintosh's astonishing vision."
As part of the project, Page\Park will establish an external expert advisory panel for the restoration.
The firm's head of architecture, David Page, said they were "delighted" to be leading the restoration of a "world-renowned" building.
He added: "We have, over many years, had the privilege to work on and in the context of the Mackintosh legacy, the highlight of which will now be the opportunity to bring The Glasgow School of Art into splendid re-use for its students and staff, the people of Glasgow and the huge audience beyond the city."
An investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded it was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
The report, released in November, said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector in Studio 19.
