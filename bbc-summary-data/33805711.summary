Farnsfield digester plans 'on hold' after opposition

Plans for an organic power plant in Nottinghamshire that faced local opposition have been suspended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A consortium of farmers wanted to use carrots, maize and manure to produce gas for the National Grid.
But residents in Farnsfield, as well as owners of nearby tourist attractions, had voiced concerns over potential smells, prompting 650 objections.
County council planners confirmed a request had been made to take the scheme out of immediate consideration.
Fresh Growers, the farmers' consortium, hoped it would produce enough electricity for 1,200 homes and enough gas for 2,400 homes, roughly the size of nearby Farnsfield village.
They had insisted most of the process would be sealed and the fertilizer-like by-product would be similar to other "country smells".
But the owners of amusement park Wheelgate Park and animal attraction White Post Farm, as well as those living nearby, feared odours could affect their lives and income.
A campaign group - Stop the Stink - was formed and a spokesman said: "We would also like to thank everyone who has supported the Stop The Stink campaign.
"But (the plans are) currently only suspended and not stopped so we all need to see what happens next with that."
Chair of the consortium, Bill Eastwood, told the Chad newspaper he needed to review recent changes to government policy on alternative energy and their effect on the project's viability.
He said he hoped to make a decision in September.
