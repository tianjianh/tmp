Francis Dunlop was using the Kill Weed device in his garden in Bourne, Lincolnshire, on 15 June.
He died despite a neighbour in Betjeman Close extinguishing the fire with a garden hose. An inquest into the death has been opened and adjourned.
An EU-wide alert has been issued warning there is a "serious risk" of burns or fire from using the product.
"If the gas canister is not fitted correctly this can lead to a leakage of gas and risk of fire when product is ignited for normal use," the alert says about the Taiwanese product.
Flame guns like this are typically used to scorch off weeds between paving slabs and on driveways, as an alternative to using chemical weed killers.
The instructions for the Kill Weed model say it works by "heating the weed foliage with an intense heat up to 1,300ÂºC".
It is sold by Coopers of Stortford, based in Hertfordshire, which has told customers they can return the item free of charge.
The product recall said: "We have discovered a serious safety issue with the Kill Weed product which could lead to the risk of fire during use.
"As customer safety is of paramount importance, we must advise customers to stop using the Kill Weed with immediate effect.
"Additionally, if you have bought this product for someone else please let them know about this notice urgently."
