[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 0-1 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Clarke's goal at Burton was enough to give Preston their first win in three games and lift them into the top half of the Championship table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Preston skipper collected a cross that appeared to be going out of play and scored inside the far post.
Jamie Ward could have given Burton the lead, but his close-range effort was brilliantly blocked by Bailey Wright.
Burton thought they had levelled after the break, but Greg Cunningham cleared Matt Palmer's cross off the line.
The win puts North End 11th in the division, while Burton are now just one point and one place above the relegation places after their fifth loss in six games.
Albion had the better of a tame first half and Ward tried to lob Chris Maxwell from distance early on before his tap-in from the edge of the six-yard box was blocked by Wright.
Clarke's goal surprised almost everyone inside the Pirelli Stadium as he chased down what seemed like a lost cause and scored from a tight angle.
Burton introduced new signing Marvin Sordell after the break but he could not help the Brewers fashion an equaliser.
The striker had a shot blocked before Cunningham cleared Palmer's cross, with Marcus Harness waiting to pounce for his first senior goal having come on as a substitute.
Preston North End manager Simon Grayson:
"We knew we had to be at it to win the game. It wasn't sort of free-flowing football but ultimately we have had a really professional performance from individuals and as a team.
"You have to find ways to win a match at times. We were disappointed with how it panned out on Saturday against Sheffield Wednesday but we had to go again quickly.
"There wasn't much in the first half. We were comfortable without asking many questions of Burton but ultimately we got the goal and that gives you a base to work from. When you look back on it, we should have made it a little bit easier with a couple more goals in the second half."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
"It was a poor goal to give away and we didn't have enough to get back into it.
"Preston are a very experienced side in the Championship. You look through their team and it is littered with experience that you need.
"I don't think we have the necessary Championship experience at the moment. We tried in the summer and we will try again in January to rectify that."
