"Noel truly was Lois Lane, and for many of us, she was the first working woman seen on television. Few of her fans actually knew her real name, almost always simply calling her 'Lois' to which she would unfailing answer with a bright smile and a kind word.
"It was more than a role to her. 'Lois' was someone she believed in and a character she happily and warmly embraced," he said.
Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has also paid tribute - "They say your 1st is always your favourite. I LOVED Noel Neill as Lois. She was sweet warm & wonderful in person too!" he tweeted.
