Williams, 23, on loan at Ipswich Town from Crystal Palace, landed heavily on his arm in the win at Wigan.
The injury could rule him out of Wales' World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on 24 March.
"We are looking at around 12 weeks before he is back playing again, without any setbacks," Ipswich physio Matt Byard said.
"There was significant cartilage damage and a small fracture and the shoulder joint was completely unstable,"
