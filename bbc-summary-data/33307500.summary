It will be the 31-year-old's third spell at Rugby Park, where he scored 22 goals in the 2013-14 season before leaving to play for Rangers.
He scored 10 goals in 43 appearances for the Ibrox side last term.
"This is a great club for me," said Boyd. "I feel I have done well here in the past and I am looking forward to getting fit and scoring more goals."
Boyd, capped 18 times by Scotland, began his career with the Ayrshire club, leaving after six years for his first stint with Rangers in 2006.
He has also played for Middlesbrough, Turkish side Eskisehirspor and Portland Timbers in the United States.
"As soon as I found out he was available, it was a no brainer and I was chasing him all summer," Killie manager Gary Locke told the club website.
"Kris's track record at Kilmarnock speaks for itself, he's a proven goal scorer.
"In addition to what he will do for us on the pitch this season he will also be able to work with the young strikers we have coming through. He's a great role model."
Kilmarnock have added Peter Leven as assistant coach and are also keen on a deal for Boyd's former Rangers team-mate Lee McCulloch.
Leven, 31, spent three years as a player at Rugby Park, leaving in 2007, with his career later curtailed by injury.
"I have known Peter for a long time and I am confident he will be a great addition to the team," enthused Locke.
