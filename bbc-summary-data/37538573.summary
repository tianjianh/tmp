Jenny went to look for wild African elephants on a reserve in the north-east of South Africa with a specially trained ranger.
It might be a bit smelly, but she found out there's a lot you can learn about elephants from their poo, like what they've been eating.
Remember, you mustn't ever touch animal poo - this ranger is specially trained and knows how to do it safely.
