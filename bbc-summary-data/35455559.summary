Traffic Scotland said only essential journeys should be attempted as roads, bridges and rail routes were battered by heavy rain and gale force winds.
Lorries have been blown over, trees uprooted and buildings damaged.
The Tay Road Bridge has closed to all traffic after a gust of 91mph was recorded.
The Forth Road Bridge was also closed earlier on Monday after winds reached 84mph. It later reopened to cars only but officials warned it was likely to be shut again later.
A Met Office amber "be prepared" alert for high winds covering most of the country is in force until Tuesday morning.
Forecasters said winds of 70-80mph were expected widely, with 90mph gusts possible in exposed areas, especially in the west.
Restrictions have been put in place on bridges across Scotland and a number of train services have been suspended.
All schools in the Western Isles were closed on Monday. A spokesman warned that the high winds and large waves could lead to over-topping and flooding of coastal roads.
Scottish Transport Minister Derek Mackay said the Scottish government Resilience Room (SGoRR) has been activated and it was closely monitoring events.
"Travellers are advised to take care in difficult conditions and allow extra time for their journeys," he said.
"High winds can also cause disruption to utilities like power and telecoms and key responder organisations across Scotland, including councils, utilities and blue light services, are well used to dealing with severe weather events such as these forecast," he added.
"We have ensured that they have put in place the necessary planning and response arrangements to deal with any impacts as quickly and effectively as possible, nevertheless, people should try to ensure that they are prepared, including checking on the elderly and vulnerable."
A total of 28 flood warnings had been issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) late on Monday.
Pascal Lardet, Sepa's hydrology duty manager said localised flooding was expected to affect low-lying land, roads and isolated properties.
In other updates:
Meanwhile in England, the Humber Bridge was closed to high-sided vehicles and caravans and a speed limit was imposed after a lorry blew over in 49mph winds.
Humberside Police tweeted a photograph of the overturned lorry, which appeared to have come to rest close to the edge of the bridge.
In Grimsby, residents have been evacuated from the landmark Victoria Mills building amid concerns for the structure.
A North East Lincolnshire Council spokesman said a turret on the west of the silo building appeared to have moved.
He added: "Under advice from a structural engineer, we have been monitoring the building twice per day since December.
"People being evacuated are advised to go to the nearby Fishing Heritage Centre where we will be liaising with other services to look to find alternative places for them to stay until we can better assess the situation. As a precautionary measure, the nearby road is being temporarily closed."
