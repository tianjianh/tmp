A rare Ferrari racing car worth about £10m was given a parking ticket after the owners rolled it into a Mews to take some photos.

Historic car specialists Fiskens said they placed the car for a "short time" outside their Kensington headquarters when two traffic wardens approached.
The firm said the wardens were "adamant" the 45-year-old vehicle should be given a £120 fine.
Kensington and Chelsea Council said it was "issued as it would in any case".
Acquisition specialist Rory Henderson said the company were always "super-careful" not to obstruct others who use the Mews when moving their vehicles around.
A council spokesman said the photographer agreed to move the Ferrari but "no attempt was made" within the "statutory five-minute observation period".
The car, a 1970 Ferrari 512M, is still in working condition and was recently raced at the Le Mans Classic.
According to Fiskens, it has a "remarkable history" having been raced in the 1970 and 1971 Le Mans races.
In 1977, it set a new record after Robert Horne drove the car 192mph over a flying mile.
Fiskens call it "a superb example of one of Maranello's finest sports competition cars".
