Hampshire confirmed a one-year deal for the 34-year-old, after he initially announced it on his Instagram page.
Edwards was forced to return home early last season after breaking an ankle during a football match in training.
"It's been a tough year for me after my horrendous injury," Edwards wrote. "Hampshire kept faith in me even tho (sic) I'm not 100%."
Edwards, who has played as a Kolpak signing for the last two seasons, made just two County Championship appearances in 2016 before injury.
In 2015, he took 45 Championship wickets to help Hampshire avoid relegation from Division One.
"Fidel was desperately unlucky with his injury at the start of the year," Hampshire director of cricket Giles White said.
"He's worked tirelessly to get back towards full fitness since suffering the injury and we're pleased with the progress he's made so far."
