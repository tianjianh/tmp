The 25-year-old, who has won 27 caps and can also play at centre, will join the Falcons following the World Cup.
"I'm really excited about the move. It is a big experience for me and my family, and I can't wait," he said.
Venditti made his international debut during the 2012 Six Nations and played all five games at this year's tournament, scoring two tries.
"Giamba is a strong player with quick feet and good hands who likes to attack space," said Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards.
"He is also strong in contact and is going to give us plenty of options next season with his ability to play both centre and wing."
Venditti is Newcastle's fifth signing for next season following props Jon Welsh, Taione Vea and Ben Harris, and back row forward Nili Latu.
The north-east club have only won four of their 20 Premiership games so far this season and are next to bottom of the table.
