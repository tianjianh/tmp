Pavlov's dog: Russian hits 17 on first hole at Austria Open

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many of us have had bad days on the golf course, but spare a thought for Andrey Pavlov who scored a nightmare 17 on one hole at the Austria Open - the second worst in European Tour history.

The Russian, who started the day six shots off the lead, found the water six times on the par-five first hole at the Diamond Country Club in Atzenbrugg.
Englishman Chris Gane also managed 17 on one hole at Gleneagles in 2003.
Philippe Porquier heads the European list with 20 at the 1978 French Open.
However, the Frenchman will have to doff his hat in the direction of American Ray Ainsley and the "Silver Scot" Tommy Armour, who both took 23 shots on a single hole on the American tour circuit.
Armour, who won three majors, managed the unwanted feat at the 1927 Shawnee Open, while Ainsley suffered his nightmare at the 1938 US Open.
Pavlov completed the front nine in 53, 17-over, after adding three bogeys and a double bogey to his card.
Two birdies helped restrict the damage on the back nine to 37 and an eventual completed round of 90, 18-over-par.
He was not alone in struggling - Austrian Benjamin Weilguni shot 89 after taking nine on the first.
