Detectives hunting the killer of an artist in a West Sussex village have ruled out more than 2,500 men who have had their DNA screened.

Valerie Graves, 55, was found dead in a ground-floor bedroom of a house in Bosham on 30 December 2013.
More than half the 5,000 DNA samples police hoped to collect from local men had been "taken and eliminated".
Sussex Police said officers would go house-to-house in Bosham to ask for more samples over the festive period.
The force launched the "biggest voluntary mass DNA screening in its history" in January and February when all men aged over 17 who lived, worked or visited Bosham were urged to give a sample and a thumbprint.
Det Ch Insp Jason Taylor said the investigation remained a "priority for the force" and officers were determined to find "Valerie's killer and get justice for her and her family".
"This time of year is particularly difficult for her family and friends. We are asking for people's understanding as we continue to knock on doors in Bosham and ask for DNA samples.
"I would ask any men aged over 17 who live, work or visit Bosham who haven't provided a DNA sample to contact police so we can arrange for this to be taken and for them to be eliminated.
"We are still offering a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Valerie's killer and I would ask anyone who has information to contact police."
Ms Graves is believed to have been beaten to death with a claw hammer as she house-sat for friends in Smugglers Lane.
She had been staying in the house with her sister, mother and her sister's partner.
