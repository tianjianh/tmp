Claire Riley, 23, was due to be sentenced at Northampton Crown Court over the death of six-month-old Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, killed by an illegal American pit bull in Daventry in 2014.
Earlier her family clashed with media as she arrived under an umbrella.
The child's grandmother, Susan Aucott, 55, remains at court, with sentencing due to take place later.
The pair have admitted being in charge of an out of control dog.

The court previously heard Aucott was looking after her granddaughter at Riley's former home in Morning Star Road, Daventry, when dog Bruiser attacked her.
Molly-Mae suffered severe blood loss from head wounds. The dog was put down at the scene.
Aucott, 55, of Alfred Street, Northampton, admitted being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog resulting in death in June, as did Riley, of Merrydale Square, Northampton, on the first day of her trial the same month.
Claire Riley's pregnancy halted sentencing last month after she was too unwell to attend court.
Sentencing has been adjourned until 14:00 to see whether Riley is allowed out of hospital.
The judge in the case, Justice Susan Carr, said it was preferable to sentence the pair together.
