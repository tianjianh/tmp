Ruben Oseguera Gonzalez was captured in a dawn raid near Guadalajara - the capital of the western Jalisco state.
He is suspected to be second-in-command in the Jalisco New Generation cartel, led by his father Nemesio.
The gang is blamed for killing at least 20 police officers in March-April and May's shooting down of an army helicopter in which 10 people died.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez, known as El Menchito, was arrested in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, the authorities said. No shots were fired.
This is the second time that he has been captured.
He was arrested in January 2014, but was released later that year for lack of evidence.
Mr Oseguera Gonzalez is suspected of controlling the cartel's finances and of buying drugs from South American countries.
The Jalisco New Generation cartel is involved in large-scale drug trafficking along Mexico's Pacific Coast.
It has recently increased its presence in the area, with Jalisco and the neighbouring Michoacan among Mexico's most violent states.
The Jalisco New Generation is also engaged in a turf war with the Knights Templar cartel.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.
