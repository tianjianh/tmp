Mr Zuckerberg made the announcement on his timeline, calling it "a very personal decision".
Facebook allows its US employees to take up to four months of paid parental leave - time which can be used at once or throughout the child's first year.
Mr Zuckerberg announced in July that he was expecting a baby girl with his wife, Priscilla Chan.
He did not say who would be replacing him at the company.
In his statement, accompanied by a picture of a pushchair and his dog, Mr Zuckerberg, 31, said: "Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families."
