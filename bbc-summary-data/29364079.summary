Police said Christopher Welsh Jnr and his father Christopher Welsh Snr "flooded" Glasgow with drugs with a street value of more than £100m.
The Merseyside gang leaders were jailed last year along with several other men.
At a Liverpool hearing, Welsh Jnr was told to repay £275,000 in six months or face three extra years in prison.
The 36-year-old, of Anfield, is already serving a 16-year sentence.
His 56-year-old father, of Regal Walk, Liverpool, was told to repay £150,000 or face an extra 27 months on top of his original 15-year sentence.
Det Supt Jason Hudson, of the North West Organised Crime Unit, said: "This should serve as a stark warning to other criminals operating across the North West that we will catch you, we will prosecute you and we will strip you of your ill-gotten gains".

At their trial, police revealed Welsh Jnr enjoyed lavish holidays in Greece, Spain and Holland.
Police said he paid £57,000 in cash to take 40 relatives and friends to his stag do and wedding in Mexico.
Detectives have already seized Rolex watches, platinum jewellery and cash from Welsh Jnr and Snr and other gang members.
These will now be disposed of to partly repay the court order.
