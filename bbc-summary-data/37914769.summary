The 29-year-old, who has played 12 Tests for the Proteas, will move to Hove from Cape Cobras at the end of the South African domestic season.
Van Zyl averages 42.55 with the bat in first-class cricket and has taken 52 wickets at an average of 35.07.
"He is a very accomplished cricketer and I still believe his best is yet to come," Sussex coach Mark Davis said.
Davis, speaking to BBC Sussex, added: "His ability to bowl is important as having somebody in the top-order who can bowl seam is an important part of our strategy moving forward.
"He plays all formats and is versatile, which is a great asset to us. To get someone of the ilk of Stiaan is very good for us."
Van Zyl, who played his last Test in August, joins Sussex as a non-overseas player under the Kolpak ruling.
