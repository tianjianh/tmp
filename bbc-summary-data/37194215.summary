Andy Murray should be favourite for the final tennis major of the year, the US Open, according to Greg Rusedski.

The Scot is seeded second behind Novak Djokovic for next week's event at Flushing Meadows.
But former British number one Rusedski believes the Serb's form does not live up to his ranking.
"I would say he is slightly the second favourite," he said. "If you look at his form, he lost in the third round of Wimbledon and Olympics first round."
Murray won his second Wimbledon title and went on to win a second successive Olympic gold in the singles in Rio.
Rusedski also believes the return of Ivan Lendl as the British number one's coach is having an effect on Djokovic.
"It's just a bit of doubt creeping possibly into his mind," he told BBC Scotland.
"If you look at Murray when Lendl is in his corner, he seems to win majors. Before Lendl, there was no majors. After Lendl, there was no majors.
"All of a sudden, when Ivan comes back, Murray wins Wimbledon again."
