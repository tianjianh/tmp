[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was convicted of "repugnant" sex offences against two young girls has been jailed for 13 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Myers, 52, from Glasgow, abused one girl when she was aged five and continued until she was almost 17.
He also targeted another girl when she was aged 11 or 12. Myers was caught after one victim told a friend, which led to a police investigation.
His name will be on the sex offenders' register for life and Myers will be supervised for three years on release.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Pentland told Myers: "The jury convicted you after trial of a series of extremely serious offences."
The judge told him that the abuse of one of the victims, which began when she was aged five and culminated in rape, was "sustained and calculated".
Lord Pentland said: "The effect on your victims has been serious and lasting. I note you have evinced no remorse and not the slightest concern for your victims."
The judge told him: "The sexual abuse of children is repugnant."
Lord Pentland said a background report prepared on Myers had assessed him "as presenting an imminent risk of future sexual offending against children".
Myers, formerly from the Tollcross area of Glasgow, was convicted of two charges of rape, attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent behaviour committed at addresses in his home city between 2002 and 2014.
He had denied all charges against him.
His trial heard that Myers' abuse of the five-year-old happened almost every time he was left alone with her.
The victim - now aged 18 -  gave evidence during the trial and said the abuse continued for more than 12 years.
Myers tried to rape her after she turned 13 before he finally raped her as she slept, a few days before her 17th birthday.
The teenager revealed that he was caught only after her friend asked her to share her "darkest secret" during a drinking session.
She blurted out that Myers had abusing her for years after which the friend shared the secret with one of her relatives who insisted on taking the victim to report the abuse to police.
An investigation led to a second girl, related to the first victim, being interviewed.
The second girl, also now 18, claimed Myers had raped her when she was aged just 11 or 12.
