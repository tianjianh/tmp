The 13-year-old vanished as she walked home from school in Walton-on-Thames in March 2002. Her remains were found six months later in woods in Hampshire.
At the Old Bailey on Thursday, convicted double killer Levi Bellfied was found guilty of her murder.
This is a timeline of events.
Milly is reported missing after failing to return home from school. She had last been seen by a schoolfriend in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, close to where Levi Bellfield lived.
More than 100 officers and dozens of volunteers are involved in the search for Milly. The head teacher at Milly's school in Weybridge says everyone is "in limbo".
Milly's parents, Sally and Bob, release footage showing the 13-year-old ironing and playing the saxophone at home shortly before Christmas. Mr Dowler says he believes his daughter has been abducted.
A television reconstruction of Milly's last known movements is shown on BBC's Crimewatch and an RAF helicopter is brought in to take high-resolution aerial photographs of the area where she was last seen.
Massive search for missing girl
The search is widened beyond the Walton-on-Thames area. Officers examine Milly's computer to see if she was using internet chat rooms.
Milly's sister, Gemma, says the disappearance has been like a nightmare. Police also release parts of a "friendship book" kept by Milly and her friend Hannah MacDonald in the hope whoever may be holding her contact them.
The Sun newspaper offers a Â£100,000 reward for information which results in finding the missing schoolgirl.
