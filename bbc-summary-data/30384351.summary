The council said although a final decision has not been made, Â£420,000 could be saved if children are given training in how to use ordinary buses.
The measure would be part of Â£15m cutbacks by the authority after the money it received from central government was cut by 37% over the past five years.
As BBC Midlands Today's Kevin Reide reports, parents have said they are "horrified" at the suggestions.
