Lampard, 38, played the final game of his initial two-year deal with the Major League Soccer outfit as they lost 5-0 to Toronto at Yankee Stadium.
It completed an 8-0 aggregate defeat and eliminated NYC from the play-offs.
Lampard, who signed for NYC after leaving Chelsea in 2014, has scored 12 times in 16 games this year, including a hat-trick against Colorado Rapids.
The former England midfielder had a difficult first season in the MLS - scoring three times in 10 appearances having arrived later than initially planned after a spell at Manchester City.
