The 48-year-old German guided the Cod Army to fourth last season, their highest ever finish, before they were beaten by Bradford in the play-offs.
The ex-Leeds, Wigan and Brentford boss joined on an initial two-year deal in July 2016.
"Fleetwood Town is a unique club doing things differently to a lot of other clubs," he told the club website.
"What excites me about this club is that we have a clear DNA, we make it clear what we stand for and what we are going for in players.
"I think this clarity impresses me and for me we will have to build a new team after losing some very important players - that excites me."
Fleetwood have also stated that they have withdrawn contract offers to Conor McLaughlin, David Ball and Jimmy Ryan.
Defender McLaughlin, 25, striker Ball, 27, and midfielder Ryan, 28, were all out of contract this summer.
"David Ball called me up and said he will join another club," Rosler added.
"Conor told me he wanted to play in the Championship and he has clubs lined up. He will most likely go and play in the Championship.
"Jimmy didn't report on Monday for our first day of pre-season and that indicates to me that he will not accept our offer of a new contract."
