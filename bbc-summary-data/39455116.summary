[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton's Ben Turner has been banned for five games after being found guilty of using racially abusive language towards Brentford's Nico Yennaris.

The 28-year-old defender has also been fined £8,000 and ordered to attend a Football Association education course.
Turner's charge related to an incident in a Championship match on 10 December.
Burton have the right to appeal against the independent panel's decision, meaning Turner can play against Huddersfield on Saturday.
The centre-back had "strongly denied" the charge and, in a statement, Brewers manager Nigel Clough said the club were "incredibly disappointed" by the decision.
Turner was one of four players booked in the same injury-time incident in Burton's 2-1 defeat at Griffin Park, which also involved his team-mate Jon McLaughlin and Brentford pair Romaine Sawyers and Yennaris.
Turner was found guilty of an "aggravated breach" of FA regulations as his language "included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality".
Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey received a five-game ban in December and was fined £100,000 for using racially abusive language towards Wolves' Morocco international midfielder Romain Saiss.
Chelsea's John Terry was handed a four-match ban and a £220,000 fine for racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, while Liverpool's Luis Suarez received an eight-match suspension and a £40,000 fine for his abuse of Manchester United's Patrice Evra - both in 2011.
