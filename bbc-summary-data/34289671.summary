[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of two men accused of murdering a scrap metal dealer has told a court he tried to stop a fight between the victim and his co-defendant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Fanelli, 31, was found dead at Nash Park travellers' site in Buckinghamshire on 17 March.
Addy McAllister, 34, of Charlesworth Street, Bolsover, and Jemma Price, 30, of Ridgeway, Kensworth, deny murder.
Mr Price told Luton Crown Court he had tried to help Mr Fanelli after Mr McAllister knocked him to the ground.
His account came after Mr McAllister told the jury the fight was between Mr Fanelli and Mr Price.
The body of father-of-two Mr Fanelli, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was discovered in a field next to the travellers' site in Winslow Road in Nash, near Milton Keynes.
He had 159 separate injuries and post-mortem tests showed he died from blunt force trauma to the head.
The court heard earlier that Mr Fanelli had bought drugs for both defendants in Dunstable before the three set off for Nash in Mr Fanelli's van.
Mr Price told the jury the atmosphere had been fine but the mood changed when Mr McAllister said he wanted to "exchange some blows" with Mr Fanelli.
He said the pair got out of the vehicle and began fighting while he remained in the van.
"I never thought it was going to get that serious," he said.
"I actually got out of the van because I could see it was getting nasty."
He said he tried to push them apart but Mr Fanelli fell over so he "lifted him up".
Mr Price said, when he got Mr Fanelli back into the van, he saw Mr McAllister approaching them with a knife. The victim jumped out of the van and "ran away", "hitting three fences" as he went.
He told the court Mr McAllister punctured the tyres on the van before driving off in it. When he returned he had changed his clothes.
The prosecution alleges both defendants inflicted a severe beating on the victim.
The trial continues.
