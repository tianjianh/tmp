[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Â£41m railway station has opened in the outskirts of Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Edinburgh Gateway interchange, situated between South Gyle and Dalmeny, will serve passengers from Fife and the north of the city.
The station will link the capital's northern train line to the tram network and Edinburgh Airport and offer local travellers services to Perth, Dundee and Inverness.
A combined train and tram ticket will also be available to passengers.
The station lies next to the Gogar roundabout on the A8 and will also have a link to the Gyle shopping centre.
The work is part of the Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme which will see the electrification of lines across central Scotland.
Phil Verster, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, said: "Edinburgh Gateway interchange will be a hugely convenient transport hub for a vast array of customers, bringing new journey opportunities and better connections for people travelling into and around the capital."
It is hoped the station will also be a catalyst for future economic investment and activity.
