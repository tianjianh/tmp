Thieves have stolen two minibuses from a school in Worcestershire, just months after three other vehicles were taken.

Two people broke into the grounds of Continu Plus Academy, a free school in Kidderminster, by disabling the electric gates.
Head teacher Sara Devo said the school relies on the vehicles to transport pupils and now about 45 pupils would struggle to get to school.
The thefts took place during the evening of 12 April.
The school offers alternative and inclusive secondary education to 90 pupils and its fleet of four minibuses transports all pupils to school, Ms Devo said.
The 17-seater buses, which have the school's logo, are worth around Â£20,000 each, she added. One has a pink stripe and the other a purple stripe.

"We are trying at the moment to work very hard to try and find some interim replacements, but the insurance that we got for the last three that were stolen was about a third of the value of the three minibuses that were stolen, so it's really hit us hard," said Ms Devo.
"We try and spend our money very carefully and anything like this means we can do less."
The latest theft comes after the school had three minibuses stolen in August.
Insp James Ashton, from West Mercia Police, said officers were appealing for witnesses and the "callous theft" would have a "significant impact" on the school.
