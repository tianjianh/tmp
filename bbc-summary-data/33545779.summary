[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats are preparing to announce whether Tim Farron or Norman Lamb will be the party's new leader.

Voting closed on Thursday afternoon in the race to replace Nick Clegg, who resigned after a disastrous general election that left the Lib Dems with just eight MPs.
The winner, who will be announced on social media, is expected to address a party rally later in the evening.
Mr Farron, the former party president, is the bookmakers' favourite.
The left-leaning Westmorland and Lonsdale MP has said he wants to focus on rebuilding the party from the grassroots up, and on issues such as human rights, the environment, and building a "fairer and more equal society".
Mr Lamb, a health minister under the coalition government, said he wanted the party to be a "consistent and clear voice" standing up a liberal society.
After a post-election surge in membership, over 60,000 Lib Dem members were eligible to vote.
Former Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, who lost his seat in May, used a New Statesman article to urge the winning candidate to occupy the centre ground, and not become a "sort of soggy Syriza in sandals" - a reference to Greece's anti-austerity government.
Mr Alexander said the party should not make George Osborne's Budget a "political dividing line" but instead should attack the Conservatives over civil liberties and the environment.
