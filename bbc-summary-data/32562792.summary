[SN]TITLE[SN]
Young voters question Scottish election candidates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It seems fair to say that young Scottish voters are pretty engaged in politics right now.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
So ahead of the general election, we asked them what they wanted from political coverage.
They said it was discussion. They said it was definitely not shouting. They said something unedited and full of different opinions.
So we invited representatives from each of the six main parties in Scotland - Scottish Labour, Scottish National Party Scottish, Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Green Party and UKIP.
They took it in turns to sit down with four members of the BBC's Generation 2015 for around twenty minutes.
One was a party supporter, one was definitely not voting that way, and two were undecided over how to cast their ballot on May 7.
The topics up for discussion? That was all down to our young voters.
And unlike more conventional formats - it was also down to our young voters to pull up the politicians if they didn't like what they heard.
The multi-screen view means with each answer you can watch back every smile, frown, nod of agreement - or otherwise.
Above all, Opinionated is something a bit different. And we'd love to know what you think.
