James Dasaolu took advantage of Richard Kilty's disqualification in the semis to win the 60m title at the Indoor British Championships in Sheffield.

He clocked 6.53 seconds to beat Andy Robertson by 0.01secs after world indoor champion Kilty false started.
In the women's event, Asha Philip recorded a season's best of 7.10secs to beat European indoor silver medallist Dina Asher-Smith by 0.05secs.
Andy Pozzi put injuries woes behind him to win the 60m hurdles.
Pozzi, who pulled a hamstring competing at London 2012, has suffered from a string of stress fractures of the foot, but put it behind him at the English Institute of Sport to set a season's best of 7.61 secs.
With Dasaolu claiming the only automatic place for Portland, Kilty is forced to rely on the discretion of the selectors for the second available spot for the 60m if he is to defend his crown at next month's World Indoor Championships.
He was clearly furious and questioned why other athletes who appeared to suffer similar issues with their starts were let off with a warning and also criticised the size of the blocks.
Kilty said: "I'm just a bit confused at the moment. I think it's a little bit unfair that a couple of people have got away with it and I haven't."
Asked for his message to the selectors, Kilty added: "Message is the last two times I've been to a championships I've never been defeated so hopefully that can sway them. They know who can perform when it matters and that is me."
Elsewhere at Sheffield, Dan Bramble benefited from the absence through injury of Olympic champion Greg Rutherford to win the long jump title with a personal best 7.94m.
Rutherford has a chest infection but has insisted he will be fit for the World Indoor Championships.
Lee Emanuel posted a time of seven minutes 55.61 seconds to win the men's 3,000m, while London-born Nigerian Tosin Oke jumped a season's best 16.48m to win the triple jump.
Double world junior champion Morgan Lake pipped Isobel Pooley to claim the women's high jump title with a leap of 1.9m and Sally Peake won the pole vault, clearing 4.20m.
The championships continue on Sunday with 17 further finals.
