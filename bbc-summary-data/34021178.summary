[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-All Black Mils Muliaina in court over 'Cardiff sex assault'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former New Zealand rugby player has appeared at Cardiff Magistrates' Court charged with sexual assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mils Muliaina, 35, is alleged to have committed the offence in Cardiff city centre on 7 March.
He did not enter a formal plea, but the New Zealand Rugby Players Association has previously said the full back intended to "plead not guilty".
His case will resume at Cardiff Crown Court on 7 September.
Hours before the alleged incident, Muliaina had turned out for Irish side Connacht in their away game against Cardiff Blues.
He won 100 caps for the All Blacks before retiring from international duty in 2011.
