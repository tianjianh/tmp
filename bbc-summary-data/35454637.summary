Cardiff sign Leicester and Wales striker Tom Lawrence on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City have signed Wales forward Tom Lawrence on loan from Leicester City until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old recently finished a loan spell with Championship side Blackburn Rovers.
Other Championship clubs are thought to be interested in the former Manchester United player.
Cardiff, who are only able to sign players on loan due to a transfer embargo, have also signed striker Kenneth Zohore from KV Kortrijk.
Wrexham-born Lawrence is a strong contender to be included in Wales' Euro 2016 squad.
He won his first cap against Andorra in their last qualifying match and made his first start in the friendly against the Netherlands - both games at the Cardiff City Stadium.
Meanwhile, Cardiff have terminated the contract of Romanian international defender Gabriel Tamas by mutual consent.
The former West Brom player joined on a free transfer in August 2015 and made just one appearance for the Bluebirds, last month's 1-0 FA Cup defeat to Shrewsbury.
