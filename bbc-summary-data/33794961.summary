Gloucestershire Police said they had received allegations that Opus Fine Art in Stow-on-the-Wold had been "dishonestly retaining or selling" art.
The gallery deals in works by high profile artists including Damien Hirst.
A police spokesman said investigations were ongoing to establish ownership of the seized property.
