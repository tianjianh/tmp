Work on a permanent solution to rock falls along part of the A82 in the Highlands should start next week, Forestry Commission Scotland has said.

The road between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit was closed in March after two large chunks of stone slid down from a boulder field.
FCS said part of the permanent solution will be putting in place a concrete beam.
A helicopter will be used during the work, which is due to start on Monday.
The project should be completed by mid-July.
Alex Macleod, who is managing the project, said: "Traffic management will be in place for this and other elements of the works.
"However, we anticipate that it will have much less of an impact on local traffic than our other felling operations though we apologise for any inconvenience that it might cause."
Trees have also been felled and removed from steep ground above the A82.
FCS said it hoped to have most of this work in Glen Righ south of Fort William completed by autumn.
Autumn will also see the start of tree felling along Loch Ness-side - the most difficult and extensive phase of the A82 timber harvesting operations, according to FCS.
