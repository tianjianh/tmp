Braintree Town 3-2 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Simeon Akinola scored twice as Braintree beat promotion-chasing Dagenham 3-2 in a thrilling National League game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oliver Hawkins put Dagenham ahead after 32 minutes when he headed in Jordan Maguire-Drew's cross, but the hosts levelled just three minutes later through Michael Cheek.
Akinola's penalty on the stroke of half-time put Braintree ahead at the break but two minutes after the interval the Daggers were awarded a spot-kick of their own and, while Hawkins' effort was saved, Maguire-Drew smashed home the rebound.
The away side had Scott Doe sent off for a second booking, and Braintree took advantage as Akinola scored his second.
Braintree's Manny Parry was also given his marching orders but Dagenham were reduced to nine men when Magnus Okuonghae went off injured with all three substitutions made.
