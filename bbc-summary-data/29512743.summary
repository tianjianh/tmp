[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Telles, 38, from California, flew to Britain in June to meet the 14-year-old after exchanging messages online. He took her from Launceston to a hotel near Exeter.
Telles admitted taking part in sex acts with her over a four-day period which ended when police raided the hotel.
He is due to be sentenced next month at Exeter Crown Court.
Telles, of Trenton Circle, Pleasanton, admitted meeting a child following sexual grooming, abducting a child, three offences of sexual activity with a child, and engaging in a sexual act in the presence of a child.
Judge Francis Gilbert said Telles would "be receiving a sentence of such length he will be deported automatically when he is released".
Telles was remanded in custody and ordered to sign on to the sex offenders' register.
