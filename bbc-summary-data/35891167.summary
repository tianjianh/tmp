Captain Meg Lanning (56) and Elyse Villani (53) shared an unbroken second-wicket stand of 98 as the Southern Stars got home with 14 balls to spare.
Dilani Manodara and Chamari Atapattu both scored 38 for Sri Lanka but they were pegged back to 123-8 in Delhi.
In Group B, Pakistan beat Bangladesh by nine wickets, overhauling 113-9 with 21 balls to spare.
Sidra Ameen scored an unbeaten 53 and Bismah Maroof  43 to seal a victory that leaves their side third in Group B, behind leaders England who beat second-placed West Indies by one wicket in Dharamsala.
Pakistan can still reach the semi-finals if they beat England on Saturday.
In Delhi, Sri Lanka won the toss and were well set 75-1 in the 11th over as Dilani Manodara and Chamari Atapattu both scored 38 before Australia took 7-43 to slow the scoring rate.
The Southern Stars, now second in Group A behind New Zealand, face Ireland in Delhi on Saturday.
They will definitely reach the semi-finals if they beat Ireland and South Africa fail to win their last two matches.
