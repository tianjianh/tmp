A non-league football club have finally picked up their first point of the season after a wait of 27 games.

Bashley FC, who play in the Southern League Division One South & West, got themselves off the mark with a 0-0 home draw against Mangotsfield United.
"We don't want to look back in April as this being our only point of the season," boss Tom Prodomo said.
The New Forest club have not won a league game since September 2014 and have a goal difference of -115.
The Bash are on their third different manager of the season after the departure of both David Stride, who was sacked in pre-season after just 40 days in charge and Steve Riley.
Prodomo, who took charge in November, paid tribute to his players for sticking together.
"We were really organised, which is something we've worked really hard on," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's a nice moment for the club in recent times. Not just for players and coaches, but for all the guys around the club who give up their time to prepare the pitch, sort out the bar and the clubhouse.
"I think we'll enjoy the moment for sure, but we need to make sure this is the first of many good nights for the rest of the season."
Chairman Tim Allan told BBC Radio 5 live: "It was unbelievable - it's something we've all been working for."
Bashley sit 20 points adrift of safety and have scored just nine goals all season, conceding an eye-watering 124 in the process.
Their first point of the 2015-16 campaign was watched by a crowd of just 71 and came against the same club who beat them 2-0 in the FA Cup preliminary round in August.
