Celtic's Stuart Armstrong says manager Brendan Rodgers has inspired him to produce the best form of his career.

The midfielder was named the Premiership player of the month for March having scored against Inverness, Rangers and Dundee.
Armstrong also marked his Scotland debut with a man of the match display in the 1-0 win over Slovenia.
"I'm playing the best I've ever played. I'm very lucky to be playing under Brendan Rodgers," Armstrong said.
"The influence he's had in such a short space of time is phenomenal," the midfielder added.
"I could speak for a long time about the different aspects of my game he has influenced. Not just me, for other players in the team and the team as a whole. We're a much better outfit."
After battling to earn a place in the side in the opening months of the campaign, Armstrong has become a key component of the team, playing in his favoured central midfield position.
Much of his early Celtic career under Ronny Deila was spent on the left side of midfield, and Armstrong believes the positional switch has been the biggest factor in his recent goal-scoring streak that has seen him net four goals in his last five league games.
"Playing in midfield and having that licence the gaffer gives me to go forward, goal-scoring opportunities arise and it's about taking them when they come," he explained.
"I always talked about scoring more goals. I was disappointed with my contribution last season, so to get back to scoring goals is what I enjoy most.
''I always knew I could score goals. I had done that with Dundee United. I get into a lot more goal-scoring positions naturally when I play in the middle. That definitely helps."
Talks are continuing between Armstrong's representatives and Celtic on an extension to his contract, with his current deal due to expire at the end of next season. The player stressed that he is "very happy" at the club and believes the new deal "will take care of itself".
After an impressive showing against Slovenia at Hampden, Scotland manager Gordon Strachan described Armstrong's performance as the best debut he had seen for the national team.
'It was a very nice compliment," Armstrong continued.
"It being my first appearance I wanted it to be good, to do well and to take something from the game. I managed to achieve that so it was a very nice debut."
