A film of a fancy dress pub crawl with a pedal-powered 'Del Boy' yellow Reliant Robin car has gone viral with more than six million online views.

Joiner Ian Jones and friends made the van and dressed up as characters from the BBC TV comedy classic series Only Fools and Horses for a Christmas party.
He said the response to their antics in Old Colwyn, Conwy county, last weekend has been "unbelievable".
"I always say with fancy dress it's the props that make it," said Mr Jones.
The 'van' made out of wood and metal and a "chopped up bike" complete with pedals and six gears was built by Mr Jones and friends Stuart Davies and Alex Webster.
Mr Jones, who took to the steering wheel as Del Boy, has been organising the annual fancy dress pub crawl for self employed workers from the local area for the last seven years.
And about 60 took part in Saturday's night out which, just like the sitcom, has already become a classic.
"I've got a good one up my sleeve already for next year," said Mr Jones, who aims to better this year's fancy dress fun since having friend requests from people as far flung as Mexico and India on social media websites who have seen his film.
"But blowing this one out of the water is going to be difficult."
