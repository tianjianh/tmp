Blake's Dahl portraits to go on display at British Library

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portraits of some of Roald Dahl's best-known characters are to go on display at the British Library.

The pictures have been drawn by Sir Quentin Blake to mark the 100th anniversary of the author's birth.
The featured characters in the exhibition include Matilda, Charlie Bucket and the BFG.
Sir Quentin said: "The portraits ask you to imagine that a number of Dahl's characters have been invited to come and sit for their portrait.
He added: "They are depicted, not quite as they appear in the illustrations, but more formally."
All of the portraits are new and have not appeared in any of Dahl's books.
Referring to some of Dahl's other characters, Sir Quentin joked: "The perceptive spectator may notice that one celebrated couple declined to appear together, and another formidable personality obviously disapproved of the whole venture.
"Nevertheless, I hope visitors to the British Library will be happy to see this group of well-known characters treated as though they were real people - which, of course, to many of us they are."
Quentin Blake: The Roald Dahl Centenary Portraits will open for free to the public at the British Library on 2 December.
The British Library also confirmed more details of their previously announced Harry Potter exhibition.
Harry Potter: A History of Magic will feature "wizarding books, manuscripts and magical objects", the British Library said.
They added the exhibition will "combine centuries-old British Library treasures with original material from Bloomsbury's and JK Rowling's own archives".
The exhibition will open on 20 October 2017, with tickets going on sale in April.
