Subway has suspended its relationship with its spokesman Jared Fogle after authorities searched his home as part of a child pornography case.

An employee of a charity founded by Mr Fogle was arrested in April on charges related to child pornography.
The restaurant chain said it believes the raid on Mr Fogle's home on Tuesday was related to that case.
Mr Fogle began appearing in Subway ads in 2000 after he lost a large amount of weight by eating Subway sandwiches.
The ad campaign was seen as a huge success, promoting Subway restaurants in the US as a healthy alternative to fast food rivals like McDonald's.
"Subway and Jared Fogle have mutually agreed to suspend their relationship due to the current investigation," the company said in a statement. "Jared continues to cooperate with authorities and he expects no actions to be forthcoming. Both Jared and Subway agree that this was the appropriate step to take."
Sections of the company's website featuring Mr Fogle were removed on Tuesday.
Russell Taylor, 43, worked as the executive director of the Jared Foundation, which was set up to combat childhood obesity. In May, he was charged seven counts of production and one count of possession of child pornography.
On Tuesday, federal and state authorities removed electronics from Mr Fogle's Indiana home, but would not comment on the nature of the investigation. Mr Fogle has not been charged with any crime.
"Jared has been co-operating, and continues to cooperate, with law enforcement in their investigation of unspecified charges, and looks forward to its conclusion,'' said Ron Elberger, Mr Fogle's lawyer.
