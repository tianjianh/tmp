Matthew Harding, 27, from Oldbury in Wolverhampton, was struck by a grey Citroen Picasso at midday on Monday. An engineer colleague was also injured.
His wife of one week, Danielle, was at his side when he died in hospital on Tuesday. She described him as a "hero".
Two boys, both aged 16, were held on suspicion of dangerous driving.
The second engineer suffered a broken arm and jaw and a twisted ankle. He is expected to make a full recovery.
The crash happened while the two Virgin Media employees were working on roadside cabinet at the junction of Jack Holden Avenue and Robert Wynd in Woodcross.
Mrs Harding said: "We are well and truly heartbroken. I don't know how we're all going to go on.
"Our babies are devastated because daddy is gone. Our lives will never be the same."
Offering a tribute directed at her husband, Mrs Harding said: "There is no man out there who could or ever would be as amazing, caring and loving as you.
"You truly wore your heart on your sleeve babes. I'm so honestly grateful I had the pleasure of knowing you and being your wife."
Sgt Paul Hughes, from West Midlands Police, said: "This is truly a tragic event which has left a young family devastated and also shocked the local community."
He urged any witnesses to come forward.
In a statement, Virgin Media said its deepest sympathies were with the families affected and it was assisting the police with their investigation.
