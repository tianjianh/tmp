The US Coast Guard said Fernandez was one of three people killed in the crash on Sunday, off Miami Beach, Florida.
A scheduled Marlins home game against the Atlanta Braves on Sunday has been cancelled.
The club said it was "devastated by the tragic loss of Jose Fernandez. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time".
Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Todd Garofalo told local news station WSVN: "They found a boat that was up against the jetties. They did do an initial search and they found three victims - two on top of the water, one underneath the boat and they had unfortunately passed away."
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the 32-foot vessel had a "severe impact" with large rocks that form part of the jetty.
The names of the other two individuals are being withheld until their relatives can be informed, the Coast Guard said.
Fernandez shared a picture on Instagram five days ago which appears to show his girlfriend Carla Mendoza pregnant.
The caption reads: "I'm so glad you came into my life. I'm ready for where this journey is gonna take us together. #familyfirst."
Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, shared on Twitter a picture of he and Fernandez and wrote: "I had the opportunity to meet Jose Fernandez in 2014. Our prayers are with his family and the Miami Marlins."
Boston Red Sox pitcher David Price said: "Hands down one of my favourite guys to watch pitch! He brought nothing but intensity and passion."
The Major League Baseball organisation released a statement saying it was "stunned and devastated" by the news.
Fernandez was the club's first-round draft pick in 2011 and was finishing up on his finest season in the major league, the Miami Herald reported.
He was born in Santa Clara in Cuba and attempted to defect to the US three times - once ending up in jail - before making it to Florida when he was 16. He made his debut for the Marlins in 2013.
