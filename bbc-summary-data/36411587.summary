England have called up centre Luther Burrell to replace injured Manu Tuilagi for next month's tour of Australia.

Burrell, 28, was overlooked by head coach Eddie Jones for this year's Six Nations, but scored a try in Sunday's 27-13 win over Wales at Twickenham.
The Northampton back has been selected ahead of Bath centre Ollie Devoto, who won his first cap on Sunday.
"It's a great opportunity for Luther, who I thought played really well yesterday," Jones said.
"He carried the ball well, defended with aggression and scored an excellent try.
"It was a tough selection call. Ollie Devoto has really impressed during his recent time in the England camp. We wish him a successful tour to South Africa with the Saxons."
Burrell was omitted from the first squad named by Jones in January on the grounds of being "grossly overweight".
"The beauty of Eddie is that he's a very honest bloke," he said.
"If you're not pulling your weight then he won't beat around the bush, he will tell you.
"He's been in constant contact with me. He's been brilliant with me and my development."
England, who fly out to Australia on Tuesday, play the first of three Tests against the World Cup runners-up in Brisbane on Saturday, 11 June.
Leicester centre Tuilagi has missed out on the tour with a hamstring injury.
