Trading Standards warning over 'Swedish' car sale scam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Trading Standards Service has warned potential car buyers about a scam which has left two people thousands of pounds out of pocket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scammers claim they are selling their right-hand drive car after returning to Sweden following working in Northern Ireland.
The bogus sellers engage their victims by text and email only.
A link in an online advertisement opens up a fake logistics company for delivery.
One victim, Ian, lost Â£4000, despite carrying out a number of checks during the process.
He spoke to one person, who was posing as a representative of a fake delivery firm.
He sold his own car to be able to afford the second hand car he spotted in an online advertisement for less than the price he paid the scammers.
Ian told BBC Radio Ulster's On Your Behalf programme it was a "devastating" blow for him and his family.
"It has left us penniless," he said.
He has shared details of the incident with the Metropolitan Police in London.
Bill Molloy from Trading Standards said other people have lost money in similar scams.
