The forward joined City from South West Peninsula League side Bodmin Town in the summer and has scored eight goals, including four in the last five games.
"It took him as little bit of time to settle and get used to it.
"But over these last few weeks he's starting to find his feet and with his work rate he's also adding the goals to that which is great," Hodges said.
"When things aren't going well he has to carry on doing this hard work and this never give up attitude, which is what we want at the club.
Meanwhile, Hodges says he will be looking to replace player-coach Rory Fallon after the New Zealand international left the club earlier this week.
"I'm sure something else will happen for Rory during the course of the season, I don't think he's finished with football.," he told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"We're always looking to bring in players. I don't think anything's going to happen in the next game, but over the coming weeks hopefully we'll get some more players in."
