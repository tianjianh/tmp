New roads to Peterhead and Fraserburgh 'unlikely to attract enough funding'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New dual carriageways to Peterhead and Fraserburgh are unlikely to attract enough funding to be cost-effective and the only new rail line worth opening is a re-instated Dyce to Ellon line, consultants have said.

It follows a decision by transport body Nestrans to investigate options.
A report looked at economic, social and environmental impacts.
Consultants said full dual carriageways on the A90 and A952 were unlikely to be funded in the short to medium term.
They said dualling the A90 from Ellon to Toll of Birness, and making safety and overtaking improvements on the existing roads, would most likely meet the objectives.
The consultants also said a new rail route from Ellon to Aberdeen through the Bridge of Don, and any new rail services north of Ellon, should be ruled out.
However, they said reinstating the Dyce to Ellon line should be explored further.
Nestrans board members are being asked to approve a second stage of assessment when they meet next week.
In December, the re-opening of the railway link between Ellon and Dyce was recommended by the Scottish Association for Public Transport.
SAPT said the 14-mile line would "revolutionise" transport in the area.
