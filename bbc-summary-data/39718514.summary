The Terriers beat Wolves 1-0 on Tuesday to confirm their place in the top six with two games to go.
Town have not played in the top flight of English football since 1972.
"The fans were desperate for something special and something extraordinary. I'm absolutely proud and delighted," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"The whole football club worked hard to achieve something and now we have it two matches before the end of the season. It's an unbelievable achievement.
"I read today that (Chelsea boss) Antonio Conte said that in the Premier League that money doesn't buy title and that's true in the Championship for sure.
"Everyone knows our starting point and I think this makes what the players did even bigger and greater."
Wagner is in his first full season managing in England after taking over at the John Smith's Stadium in November 2015.
The former Borussia Dortmund coach felt his side could have won more comfortably on Tuesday.
Town have now won 25 matches in the league this season, with 22 of the victories coming by a single-goal margin.
"I think we should have killed the game with a second goal to have made life easier," he added.
"It's a part of our season that we usually win matches by one goal and I heard that we have a record in the Championship for doing that, so we we wanted to extend that."
