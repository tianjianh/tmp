English not first language for more than a quarter at 21 NI primary schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than a quarter of pupils do not speak English or Irish as a first language at 21 primary schools across Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The figures were released by the Department of Education (DE) in response to an assembly question by UKIP MLA David McNarry.
Northern Ireland has 827 primary and preparatory schools.
The figures from DE relate to the 2014/15 academic year, as the 2015/16 school census is still in progress.
Many, although not all, of the pupils without English or Irish as a first language are classed as 'newcomer' pupils.
At Botanic Primary School in Belfast, just over half of the children do not speak English or Irish as a first language (122 pupils out of 221).
Other schools have up to 80% newcomer pupils.
The principal of Botanic Primary School, Paul Bell, said: "We welcome the diversity that all of the newcomers bring."
However, he added that the Department of Education funding for pupils without English or Irish as a first language should reflect the needs of each individual pupil.
Primary schools currently receive additional funding of around Â£1,000 per newcomer pupil.
"Some of the newcomers come here and don't need very much help at all, and many excel academically," Mr Bell said.
"However, other children come in and need massive amounts of help.
"I would like more attention paid to the level of need of newcomer pupils.
"A one-size fits all policy is not the answer."
The figures released by DE do not include post-primary schools.
