[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bedfordshire PCs cleared of perverting course of justice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two police officers accused of pursuing an autistic man before one beat him have been cleared of perverting the course of justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bedfordshire PCs Christopher Thomas and Christopher Pitts have denied misconduct in a public office by chasing Faruk Ali, 33, in a police car.
Mr Thomas, 33, of Welwyn Garden City, has denied racially aggravated assault.
But judge Francis Sheridan has cleared them of making false and misleading statements to senior officers.
Prosecutors have told Aylesbury Crown Court Mr Thomas and his colleague Mr Pitts, 39, were recorded laughing as they drove after Mr Ali, who was walking in the street near his home in Luton, Bedfordshire at 08:20 GMT on 20 February.
Mr Thomas, from Welwyn Garden City, is said to have got out of the car and grabbed Mr Ali, knocking over bins outside the family home in Whitby Road, before punching him in the face.
As Mr Ali tried to get into his house, Mr Thomas is said to have bundled him into the hallway and punched him again.
The prosecution said the officers followed Mr Ali for "fun" and "their own amusement" rather than any "legitimate policing reason".
The trial continues.
