Zaza's deal could be made permanent and reach £17m with £2.5m in add-ons based on the number of appearances he makes in the Premier League.
It is the Hammers' 11th signing of the summer, taking their spending to more than £60m.
Zaza, 25, joined the Turin club in July 2015 and he scored eight goals in 24 appearances.
"I have been fortunate enough to have already played at the new stadium with a different shirt," Zaza said.
"It is a beautiful stadium and I felt the warmth of the fans and this was a big reason why I wanted to join the club."
He was part of the Italy squad that reached the Euro 2016 quarter-finals but missed a penalty in their shootout defeat against Germany.
Juventus gave a lengthy tribute to Zaza after announcing his departure, with a club statement saying: "Power, instinct, class, desire and ability to score important goals. This can be an effective synthesis of the 12 months of Simone Zaza for Juventus."
