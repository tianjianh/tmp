As part of a three-year package, London and Manchester will also host legs of the World Grand Prix series in 2017 and 2018 respectively.
Steve Flynn, director of GB Taekwondo, said the events would give the sport "a chance to drive real growth".
The GB Taekwondo team includes two-time Olympic champion Jade Jones.
Rio silver medallist Lutalo Muhammad, bronze medallist Bianca Walkden and Mahama Cho, who finished fourth, are also in the Manchester-based squad.
The bid team - which beat competition from American city Houston - is also discussing the possibility of hosting the World Para Taekwondo Championships alongside the Grand Prix event at the Copper Box Arena in London next year.
