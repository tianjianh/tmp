Many of her pieces make use of recycled technological waste like mobile phones and computer parts, epoxy resins, vinyl and PVC.
Ribeiro, who has lived in both Angola and Paris, says she uses her artwork to explores the relationships between the past and present.
Her current exhibition is "an African message for the world, we can't live without humanism, without love", she says.
