Mark McCall: High tackle guidelines will see more sent off for 'accidental' challenges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens boss Mark McCall fears more Premiership matches will have players sent off as referees start to interpret new guidance on high tackles.

Sarries had Richard Barrington red-carded after 10 minutes in their draw with Exeter after hitting Geoff Parling with his shoulder in a collision.
"It wasn't a reckless challenge and it wasn't a dangerous challenge, it was just an accident," he said.
"It's luck of the draw and you're going to end up with a crazy situation."
Under new rule interpretations brought in at the start of 2017 any contact with the head in "reckless tackles" will be penalised by referees with at least a yellow card.
Barrington knocked former England lock Parling out as he supported what was a high tackle by skipper Brad Barritt - who went unpunished.
"That would have been accidental a while ago and now it's a problem, now it's red card in a match of big significance and it's 15 versus 14," McCall told BBC Radio 5 live.
"In the old days red cards were for reckless, dangerous challenges and we're going to end up with a lot of games 15 against 14 or 14 against 14 for challenges which aren't reckless or dangerous, but are accidental and just happen."
