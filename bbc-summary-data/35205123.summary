[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A disaster relief team from the Al-Imdaad Foundation, a  Muslim charity based in Blackburn, Lancashire, crossed the border because they were "heartbroken" by the devastation.
Sofian, who represents the charity, said "We were notified that the people of Scotland were really badly affected.
"We mobilised a team to come here and help out and do whatever we can".
He said the charity felt they had to help in Dumfries despite the desperate situation in their own area in the north of England.
Sofian said: "We tried to bring as many mops and buckets, and as much cleaning supplies, food, water and electrical items as possible.
"At the end of the day, if we can't do anything else we can just offer them the hope that help will always be given to those who need it in our country.
"We were really heartbroken to see what's happened when we seen the pictures."
