[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Secretary David Mundell in Peterhead fishing visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Secretary David Mundell has met fishing industry workers in Peterhead - his first public engagement since being reappointed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Mundell visited Peterhead fish market and spoke to fishermen and processors.
He told them that the UK government would do everything possible to protect the interests of the industry during Brexit talks.
Mr Mundell will later visit Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce.
Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: "I'm glad the secretary of state has chosen to visit Peterhead to hear for himself the opinions of individual fishermen and processors on the fantastic sea of opportunity that Brexit presents for this industry, which is so important to our coastal communities.
"The general election delivered a powerful message from those communities to both the UK and Scottish governments that we have to get out of the CFP (Common Fisheries Policy).
"It's clear that the message is being received by politicians and we now need them to deliver in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations on the restoration of control of our seas so that we can manage this sustainable natural resource in a practicable manner for the future."
Mr Mundell was reappointed as secretary of state for Scotland on Sunday.
He had been the lone Scottish Conservative MP, but now has 12 colleagues in the Commons following the general election.
