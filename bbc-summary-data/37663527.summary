Scunthorpe strengthened their position at the top of League One with a convincing victory at Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All the goals came in the second half with Josh Morris, Kevin van Veen and substitute Sam Mantom underlining the visitors' superiority.
Scunthorpe dominated the opening 15 minutes but Chesterfield had the first shot on target when Ched Evans fired into the arms of Luke Daniels from 25 yards.
Evans was just wide with a header from a Gboly Ariyibi cross in the 26th minute but Scunthorpe went close on the break four minutes later when Morris fired wide from 15 yards.
Ariyibi had a shot deflected just wide in the 43rd minute but Scunthorpe should have scored two minutes later when Paddy Madden raced clear but shot at Ryan Fulton.
Scunthorpe struck in the 49th minute when a Morris free-kick from the right edge of the area beat everyone and crept inside Fulton's right post and they broke in the 60th minute with Van Veen driving a low shot through the legs of the keeper.
Scunthorpe sealed victory in the 85th minute when Van Veen played in Mantom who beat Fulton from 12 yards.
