Witnesses were left "appalled" by the "disgusting" behaviour aboard the CrossCountry service travelling between Derby and Reading, British Transport Police said.
Officers met the train at Reading after passengers took to Twitter to report the incident on Saturday.
A witness appeal has been launched.
The force said it was "trawling CCTV" to try and find the offenders.
