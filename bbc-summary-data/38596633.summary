Senior Essex Police officer in IPCC bullying probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior police officer is under investigation over allegations of bullying towards another officer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Essex Police's professional standards department referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Neither Essex Police nor the IPCC would identify the senior officer under investigation or that person's rank.
The investigation involves allegations of verbal and physical abuse on three occasions in 2015 and 2016.

IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said: "It is crucial to securing public confidence in the police that allegations of this nature concerning a senior officer are independently investigated.
"We will thoroughly examine the reports of alleged bullying behaviour to determine whether or not the officer has acted inappropriately, or breached the standards of professional behaviour."
The officer, who holds a rank above superintendent, has been served with a gross misconduct notice informing them that their conduct is under investigation.
An Essex Police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment further.
