[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 1-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cauley Woodrow scored the only goal as Burton Albion moved above of Nottingham Forest in the Championship with their first competitive win over the Reds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woodrow's powerfully struck low free-kick - Burton's first and only effort on goal - went through Forest's wall and beat goalkeeper Jordan Smith.
John Brayford made a crucial second-half block to deny Forest's Matty Cash, who also wasted a late chance.
The victory was Burton's first in five games and put them 18th in the table.
Forest have now lost five in seven games, with their only win in the past month coming against automatic promotion hopefuls Brighton, and they are just two points above the relegation places, with Blackburn - in 22nd spot - claiming a point in a 2-2 draw at Norwich City.
Their first league visit to Burton - managed by former Forest striker Nigel Clough - failed to produce anything like the drama of the reverse fixture in August, when Forest overcame Albion 4-3 in what was the Brewers' debut in the second tier.
Lasse Vigen Christensen and Jackson Irvine both fired shots over the bar before on-loan Fulham forward Woodrow put the hosts ahead.
Forest's Zach Clough scuffed two chances wide for the visitors in the first half, while Brewers goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin foiled Ben Brereton at the near post.
And while Cash had two openings after the break, Burton survived to move three points clear of the bottom three.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough:
"The first goal was crucial. Whoever got it the opposition were going to struggle to break them down. We got it and looked after it.
"There were a few scares and they had a lot of possession but we saw it through. I'm disappointed that we didn't do enough on the break.
"In the first half of the season we were conceding goals late on in games which is one of the reasons we are where we are in the table, but the determination and resilience at the moment to see it through and get that clean sheet is what impressed me."
Nottingham Forest manager Gary Brazil:
"Obviously it's not the result we wanted. There wasn't a great deal in the game in terms of penalty box action and clear cut chances.
"We had to be a bit better in possession and in that top third of the pitch to give ourselves opportunities to score, and in fairness we didn't really do that.
"We felt if we could get one we would go on and get a second and win the game."
