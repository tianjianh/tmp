Legoland has apologised to people who have spent hours stuck in its car park.

The Windsor attraction has been busy during half term. One visitor told the BBC his family queued for more than two hours as they tried to leave the park.
Legoland said it had spent more than Â£10,000 in the last year developing alternative entrance and exit routes.
Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council said road signs had been altered recently to prevent traffic travelling through the centre of Windsor.
"The problem is Legoland is very popular," said councillor Colin Rayner, cabinet member for transport.
"I'll be working very closely with the park to ensure the system we've developed is working. We want to support them as it does bring a lot of employment and business to the area."
Ian Calkin, from Croydon, took his two children to the park on Wednesday.
"We left at 6pm when the park closed and were ready to go 10 minutes later," he said.
"But, we didn't get through the car park barriers to scan our exit pass until well after eight o'clock.
"It was then another 30 minutes before we hit the main roads."
Legoland said it had worked incredibly hard with the council over recent years on traffic management and would continue to do so.
"We understand a delayed exit from the car park would be frustrating," a spokesman said.
"We have employed a number of additional staff to help and provided guests with instructions to turn right out of the park to utilise the new routes."
