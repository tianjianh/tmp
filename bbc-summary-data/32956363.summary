The latest purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 52 in May from 51.8 in April.
A figure above 50 indicates expansion, but the reading was weaker than hoped.

Against the dollar it was 0.65% lower at $1.5191, and while sterling was up 0.06% against the euro at â‚¬1.3917 this was below the day's highs.
On the stock market, shares in drug maker AstraZeneca closed lower after earlier gains, ending down 0.14% despite positive news on a lung cancer treatment.
Shares in Premier Oil were the biggest major loser, falling almost 4% after the price of oil fell 1% amid reports of high stocks.
Opec is meeting this week and is expected to maintain production levels.
Shares in Lloyds Banking Group rose 1% after the government said it had cut its stake in the bank to 19%.
The government also said it would extend its plan to sell off shares in the bank to the end of the year, and that it would launch a sale to retail investors within the next 12 months.
In the FTSE 250, shares in semiconductor firm Imagination Technologies rose more than 6% on rumours that it could be a bid target.
