Defender Ryan Taylor says joining Port Vale has made him "feel wanted again".

The 32-year-old former Newcastle United and Wigan Athletic player signed a short-term deal at Vale Park after being release by Hull City last summer.
Taylor marked his debut for League One Vale with a goal in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Oxford United.
"I want to do well and show people what I can do and it's always nice to come in and feel like you've helped the team," Taylor told BBC Radio Stoke.
Taylor's strike - a 59th-minute penalty - was his first goal since August 2012 and helped the club fight back from 2-0 down to claim a point in his first appearance since coming on as a late substitute for Hull in April.
"I can't even remember the last competitive game I played, it was that long ago, but I know what I can do," said Taylor.
"Games are what I've been after and I've come in here and the manager's said 'you're on every set-play' - it's nice to feel wanted again."
After playing nine seasons in the Premier League, Taylor suffered two serious knee injuries that kept him out for over two years.
He returned in October 2014 but left Newcastle at the end of that season before moving to Hull, for whom he made 12 appearances last term in the Tigers' promotion to the Premier League.
His contract at Vale Park initially runs until January and Taylor is determined to write a fresh chapter in his career.
"The injuries are a thing of the past. I could've quit but I got back and I got back for a reason," he said. "I'm very driven and I feel like I'm missed out on a lot of football.
"All I can do is prove to people that I can still play - my contract runs until January and we'll see where that takes us, there's a good bunch of lads here."
