A sports car bought by comedian Eric Morecambe for £4,500 has been put up for sale for £150,000.

Morecambe purchased the Jensen Interceptor in 1968 and kept it in a garage at his home. It was eventually sold to an auction house in 2014.
Buyer Silverstone Auctions contracted Jensen specialists Cropredy Bridge to restore the car's engine, brakes and bodywork.
Morecambe, who died in 1984, was the car's sole owner.
It left Jensen's factory in West Bromwich on 23 September 1968.

Warwickshire-based Silverstone Auctions has documented both the history of the car and the restoration process on a dedicated website.
It includes comments from Morecambe's chauffeur Mike Fountain, who sometimes drove the comedian and his wife Joan around in the Jensen.
However, as the car was marketed as a two-seater, there was little room for a third person. Mr Fountain said Morecambe often ended up "screwed up in the back".
The Jensen was, he said, Lancashire-born Morecambe's favourite car, however not everything about it pleased him.
In 1970 he wrote to the company's managing director to complain about the bodywork.
"Whilst bearing in mind that even the best chrome does not last for ever, the car has not had much use as the mileage is now only fourteen-and-a-half thousand miles and has always been kept in a garage.
"As for the paint work, I would refrain from comment, but would say that it is not what I expect of a £4,500 motor car," he wrote.
Jensen fixed the defects.
The car, which had been kept in the garage at the comedian's home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, has now been extensively restored.
