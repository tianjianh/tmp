Woodards, 33, has agreed a deal to remain at Meadow Park until the end of next season.
The ex-Crewe and Bristol Rovers man joined Boreham Wood in January 2015 after being released by Tranmere.
"Danny is a model pro and with him also coaching at the club, I was always hopeful he'd want to stay," manager Luke Garrard said.
