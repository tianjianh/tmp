The 19-year-old, given his first professional contract in February by the Bundesliga club, was a back-seat passenger in a car that crashed into a tree early on Sunday, police said.
Two other people in the car also died in the accident.
"All of his teammates, the coaches, employees, fans and everybody around Hannover are in deep shock," a statement on Hannover's website read.
"Niklas - we don't want to and we never will forget you."
The forward had trained with Hannover's first team during the winter break before being rewarded with a contract.
He had not made his debut for the first team but had twice been an unused substitute this season.
The club statement read: "Our deepest sympathies in these difficult hours go above all to his family and friends, it hits us all very hard."
The fixture between Hannover's reserve team and Hildesheim was called off on Sunday as a mark of respect.
