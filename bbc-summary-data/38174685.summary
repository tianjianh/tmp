Cardiff City defender Bruno Ecoule Manga is set to leave the Championship club in January as manager Neil Warnock plans a revamp of his squad.

The Gabon international has not played under Warnock, who says there could also be some surprise departures.
"I'm looking to get him away. I've got to do some dealing," he said.
"When you look at how you're going to thin the squad, there may be surprises because I might have to generate money to bring the ones I want in."
Manga, 28, a Â£5m signing from French club Lorient in September 2014, is due to take part in the African Cup of Nations in January.
Warnock hopes that will not be a hindrance to a potential move, and says the player supports his plan.
"He's all for it. He understands," said Warnock. "Just because we might try and move one or two financially doesn't mean he's going to go.
"If he doesn't, he'll be part of the plans for the rest of the season. You can't write anybody off.
"The African Nations is not going to make it any easier, but we've had three or four clubs from different countries ask about him.
"He's got a very global agent so I'm sure there'll be phone calls happening all the time and people watching him in the Cup of Nations might be a good thing."
Manga is included in the squad for Saturday's visit of Brighton, a match that sees previous boss Paul Trollope return to the Cardiff City Stadium for the first time since leaving on 4 October.
Warnock, who managed Trollope as a player at Torquay, says the Brighton assistant manager has joined the "best team" in the Championship.
''It just did not work out for him here," added Warnock. "Sometimes fate has a big part to play in your life and he is in a great place at the moment.
"He's a smashing bloke, it's a wonderful club and I think they will go up this year. It's a great time to go on board.
"He will be disappointed because nobody likes getting the sack, I have had it a few times. You look back at where you made mistakes and what you could do better. He will be a better person for it. But it's not very nice at the time."
