The win moves the 17th-placed Canaries six points clear of the Magpies who are 19th but have played one game fewer.
Timm Klose gave Norwich the lead with a first-half header before Aleksandar Mitrovic nodded in after 71 minutes.
Mitrovic levelled again, this time from the spot, after Dieumerci Mbokani's superb strike had made it 2-1, before Olsson rifled in a low, angled winner.

The manner of this defeat will hurt the Magpies.
Up until the 93rd minute Serbia striker Mitrovic was set to hog the headlines. The 21-year-old - who scored the equaliser in the Tyne-Wear derby - was once again Newcastle's hero, twice equalising having entered the action in the 62nd minute.
The momentum was with the visitors, and a first win must have gone through manager Rafael Benitez's mind when he saw Papiss Cisse's header drift towards the top corner, only for John Ruddy to produce an incredible save.
The Spaniard would have been happy with a point, but that hope was snatched away from him when Newcastle's porous defence was once again found wanting by left-back Olsson, whose late gamble to get forward into the opposition's area paid off.
It has been quite a fortnight for Mbokani.
The Canaries frontman declared it was a "miracle" he was alive having been at Brussels' Zaventem Airport during the attacks on 22 March.
At Carrow Road he received a warm welcome from the home crowd and delivered an outstanding display.
The 6ft 1in DR Congo striker won eight of his nine aerial duels (89%), provided four key passes and had three efforts on goal - one of which resulted in a goal. That 71st-minute shot was a stunner.
The Canaries display as a whole was in stark contrast to the one in the reverse fixture in October at St James' Park where they succumbed to a 6-2 defeat.
It is now seven points from nine for the Premier League's youngest manager, 34-year-old Alex Neil.
Norwich manager Alex Neil: "It was a strange game but we were the better team throughout. It looked as if we were going to fail to capitalise but that's the best way to win a game.
"We went through the other side against Liverpool, conceding in the last minute of stoppage time, so huge credit to the players. We have great spirit here and we showed that in abundance.

"Football is an entertainment sport and everyone has gone home with their money's worth. We have started to turn it around, that's seven points in three games."
Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez:

"Today was a pity. We conceded in the last minute of the first half and then we reacted well but we are disappointed. We worked hard but it is not enough to win games. We have seven games to go and we have to keep pushing.
"When we scored the second goal we were on top but we make a mistake and concede. It can happen when you don't have too much confidence but we have to change it for the next game.
"Now it is more difficult but we have to keep confident that we can still do it. What upsets you more is the way that we concede in the last minute of each half.
"If we start winning games we still have time."
Will Norwich make it three wins on the spin at Crystal Palace next Saturday? The struggling Magpies are at Southampton.
