The campervan is packed and ready. Flights, ferries and trains have been booked. The Euro 2016 travel checklist has been printed.
Match tickets? Sun cream? Dreams of glory? Check, check and check.
Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland fans are about to take the trip of a lifetime to Euro 2016 - and we want your help to get a fan's eye view of all the football action.
During the tournament, we're asking those travelling across France to tell us your thoughts, views and plans for Euro 2016.
We want everything - pictures, reaction, stories and video - that will tell the fullest story of fans on the road at the tournament.
We'll include them on our Fans' Diary page - a daily look at the Gallic travels of the Green and White Army and The Boys in Green.
To help us on our way, we've enlisted two groups of travelling supporters to chronicle their Euro journey.
For Northern Ireland, the group is headed up by Ian Hughes, brother of 100-cap international Aaron Hughes who'll be on the pitch at Euro 2016.
Ian and company will be updating us on their campervan journey following the GAWA through Nice, Lyon and Paris.
On the Republic of Ireland side, we have Kevin McDaid, from Derry, who'll be travelling to his fourth major tournament to support the team.
We'll be following Kevin and crew's journey as they take planes, trains and automobiles on their way around the tournament.
But, remember, if you have emptied the bank account and are about to set off to Euro 2016 then we want to know how you are getting on too.
You can send us your photos and videos - message the BBC Newsline Facebook page, tweet it to us using the hashtag #Eurofans or send it to BBC News NI on Instagram, #EuroFans .
Whether it's larking in Lyon, driving through Dordogne or pogoing in the Parc Des Princes, keep us up to date on all your movements through the fan experience in France.
And, you never know - with a bit of luck. you could still be on the #Eurofans trail come Sunday, 10 July when the final kicks off at the Stade de France.
