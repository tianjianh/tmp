It's believed ants can work how to go in the right direction by looking at where the sun is in the sky and remembering their surroundings.
Ants can lift 20 times their own body weight and when foraging for food they travel up to 200m away from their home which is called a colony.
Researchers now hope to make mini robots that can find their way around like ants do.
