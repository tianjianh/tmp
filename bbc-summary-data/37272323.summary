Fears over how police protect vulnerable people

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior police officer has expressed concern about the way forces in England and Wales protect vulnerable people from abuse and exploitation.

Gavin Thomas, president of the Police Superintendents Association (PSA), said officers in charge of public protection should have a licence to do that job.
He called for national standards for training officers who protect people such as children and the elderly.
He will speak at the PSA's conference in Stratford-upon-Avon later.
Crimes such as domestic violence, child abuse and sexual exploitation are usually dealt with by police teams known as Public Protection Units.
These units are also responsible for finding missing people and monitoring sex offenders.
But a PSA report found almost half of those in charge of the units had no previous experience of public protection, and eight out of 10 had received no training or development for the role.
At the conference, Ch Supt Thomas will say: "We have standards, accreditation and skills to practice in firearms, public order and driving patrol cars.
"But currently there is no such requirement for protecting children and vulnerable people.
"Superintendents are carrying significant amounts of responsibility and must have the training and development to do their jobs effectively.
"It is a highly skilled specialism and should require a licence to practice."
He will also call for a common definition among all public services of what "vulnerable" means.
