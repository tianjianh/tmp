Michael Blyth, of Paignton, Devon, hid his past from the woman and abused her son in 2013, Exeter Crown Court heard.
He was jailed for seven-and-a-half-years for the assault and making indecent photos of children.
Blyth, 60, had already served an eight-year sentence for abusing boys when he was a scoutmaster in Yorkshire.
The court heard he took a job at a seaside caravan park in Torbay and befriended children, offering them sweets and toys.
Police also found 146 indecent images of boys on his computer, including three which showed very serious acts of child abuse.
Judge Erik Salomonsen said: "You are assessed as posing a high risk of further sexual offending against children and are a dangerous offender.
"You broke the terms of the order, were looking at indecent photographs, and went on to commit the sexual assault."
Mr Gareth Evans, defending, said there had been a long gap between Blyth's earlier offending and these cases.
Blyth, who was also sentenced for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, was found guilty of the sex assault on 5 April and sentenced on Tuesday for all other offences.
