The pair said they had reached the end of a three-year deal with the Academy and were moving onto new projects.
Their departure comes after the US television audience for the 2015 show was revealed to be the lowest for six years.
First-time host Neil Patrick Harris also received luke-warm reviews.
Some blamed the 16% dip in the ratings - compared to 2014's show with Ellen DeGeneres at the helm - on a lack of nominations for films with mass appeal.
Meron tweeted: "Ending 3 year deal producing #Oscars, its an honor to say 'We'd like to thank The Academy'".
Zadan tweeted a similar message: "Honored we had 3 yr prod deal. 3 yrs stress & fun. Thrilled we were asked, happy to be moving on w/ lots of great friends. Thank you Acad."
Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy, said Zadan and Meron had been "wonderful creative partners over the last three years, contributing some of the most innovative and memorable Oscar moments".
Meron told Deadline that it been his and Zadan's decision to go.
"Frankly before the Oscars this year were even broadcast, we were questioning whether or not, if we were ever asked, whether we wanted to do it again.
"The past couple of years have been incredible, but at the same time, we've also put a lot of projects on hold, and they haven't been getting our full attention."
Zadan and Meron's most memorable Oscar moments include DeGeneres taking her celebrity-packed selfie at the 2014 ceremony.
