[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow's unbeaten run was extended despite them being held to a goalless draw at home by Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]

Lindon Meikle went closest in the first half, when his corner for the hosts was swept onto the bar by a heavy wind.
Richard Bennett also threatened, but his curling effort was well saved by Dan Hanford as the game petered out into a stalemate.
Alex-Ray Harvey also hit the woodwork in a dominant first period for Barrow, but Gateshead held on to claim a point but see their winless streak in the National League stretch to six matches.
