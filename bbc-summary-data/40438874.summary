Hampshire v Somerset: Day-night match ends in a draw despite 15 wickets falling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire and Somerset's day-night game ended in a draw, despite 15 wickets falling at the Ageas Bowl on day four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Somerset began on 135-8, but were quickly out for 147 as Gareth Berg (4-28) dismissed last man Jack Leach.
With a lead of 64, the hosts tried to set up a run-chase, but they had fallen to 96-5 when rain arrived.
George Bailey declared leaving Somerset 161 to win from 31 overs, but once Steven Davies (47) fell they batted for the draw, narrowly escaping on 88-8.
There were points when both teams looked like they might win this low-scoring affair, but ultimately the overs lost to rain over the four days prevented a win for either side.
Liam Dawson (20), Rilee Rossouw (22) and James Vince (20) all made starts in Hampshire's second innings, but a second collapse of the match left it in the hands of captain Bailey to declare.
His declaration had Somerset hopeful of securing a first County Championship of the season, but batting against the pink ball was difficult under the floodlights and Berg had Marcus Trescothick and Adam Hose caught to leave the visitors 4-2.
Davies scored swiftly, but regular wickets from Kyle Abbott (2-33) and Ian Holland (2-23) undermined their chase, leaving Craig Overton and Josh Davey to survive the final over from Berg.
