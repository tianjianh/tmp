It is believed the Northumberland-born author had left the house she shared with partner Ian Stewart and his children, and had taken her miniature dachshund for a walk.
Ms Bailey left a note for her partner, saying she wanted some time on her own and was going to stay at their holiday home in Broadstairs.
Four days later Mr Stewart reported her missing, having travelled to Kent and established she had not been there.
Hertfordshire Police carried out extensive searches of the local area and checked hundreds of hours of CCTV footage in their efforts to find Ms Bailey.
Speaking a month after she went missing, Ch Insp Julie Wheatley described it as a "highly unusual case" because Ms Bailey "seems to have simply disappeared".
There was no evidence she had tried to contact friends or family, used her mobile phone or taken any money out of bank accounts.
Further searches are now taking place at both homes owned by Ms Bailey and Mr Stewart.
As well as the teenage book series, Helen Bailey wrote a blog called Planet Grief after her husband of 22 years drowned on holiday in Barbados in 2011.
