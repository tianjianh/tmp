[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robert Lewandowski ended his Bundesliga goal drought to help leaders Bayern Munich ease to victory over Augsburg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Poland striker had gone five league matches without finding the net but scored either side of half-time.
Lewandowski put Bayern ahead when he latched on to Arjen Robben's clever pass before he turned provider with a low cross for the Dutch winger to net.
Robben's intelligent through ball allowed Lewandowski to score his second before Ja-Cheol Koo's consolation goal.
Bayern's victory was emphatic although Carlo Ancelotti's side benefitted from some poor defending by the home side.
It was Bayern's second Bavarian derby success over Augsburg in the space three days following a 3-1 win in the German Cup on Wednesday.
Bayern, the defending Bundesliga champions, remain two points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, who claimed a 2-0 away win over Darmstadt.
Austria midfielder Marcel Sabitzer secured the points for Leipzig with two goals in the second half.
