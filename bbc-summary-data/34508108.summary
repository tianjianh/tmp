Surgeon David Berry faces legal action over deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two families are taking legal action against the NHS over claims their loved ones died unnecessarily following "over-aggressive" surgery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The action is being brought after surgery by liver specialist Prof David Berry in Leicester between 2003-08.
He was suspended by the NHS in Wales in 2013 and a subsequent investigation found the deaths of eight of his patients were "avoidable".
Prof Berry has not commented on the allegations.
University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said it will remain "open and honest" with the families.
The family of Dennis Setchell, 77, from Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, said they were devastated by the findings of a Royal College of Surgeons report carried out after they contacted the Leicester NHS trust on hearing of the concerns raised in Wales.
It revealed he had just a 2% chance of surviving an operation offered by Prof Berry.
His wife Jean Setchell said: "We were told on two separate occasions that Dennis' procedure had a 2% mortality risk, but in fact it was 98% and it was clearly documented there was always little chance of Dennis surviving."
He suffered "excessive bleeding" during a second operation to remove part of his liver.
The family was also told that his "liver remnant remaining was too small for him to survive".
His son-in-law Dan Waller said: "He shouldn't have had the surgery in the first place - the risks were too great. It was a very over-aggressive operation."
Mr Setchell died three weeks later in October 2008.
Anne Lovell, 66, died in August 2003 from multi-organ failure and blood poisoning after a 10-hour operation.
Her family were informed her operation was to remove her whole pancreas when she expected only a partial removal.
Her son, Andrew, said: "When I was invited back into to the hospital to discuss my mum's treatment, it was the first time I knew that Professor Berry had removed the entire pancreas and was completely shocked and angry about it.
"Leading up to the surgery, my mum commented on how pleased she was that she was only having a partial removal as I don't think she would have ever consented to the procedure she was actually given."
The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust asked the Royal College of Surgeons to review Prof Berry's work between 2003 and 2008 following a similar investigation in Wales.
Peter Rabey, the trust's deputy medical director, said the report looked at 32 cases but found none of the deaths was avoidable.
He added: "We have remained open and honest with them throughout this process."
The families' solicitors Irwin Mitchell said: "They want to know if there were mistakes made during their loved ones care and whether action is being taken to improve patient safety and prevent any further avoidable deaths."
Prof Berry's practice as a doctor is currently restricted by the General Medical Council. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, where he is employed, said he is not carrying out any clinical duties.
