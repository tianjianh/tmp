Police forces 'sleepwalking' away from communities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police forces could be "sleepwalking" back to an old model of policing where they are "isolated from communities", HM Inspector of Constabulary has said.

Zoe Billingham said officers in England and Wales were being taken off the beat to man front counters, do desk work in stations and guard crime scenes.
This meant they now had less time for "vitally important preventative work in communities", she said.
The government said police reform was working and crime had fallen.
The only force to be rated "outstanding" by inspectors was Durham, while 24 forces were rated "good", 18 were rated "requires improvement" and none was rated "inadequate".
In her report on police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy, Ms Billingham praised police forces but warned crime prevention work was "at risk if neighbourhood policing is further eroded".
"Front-line neighbourhood police officers have told us repeatedly that they are being pulled from their vitally important preventative work in communities to fulfil other duties, like guarding crime scenes, spending time in stations investigating crimes or staffing police station front counters," she said.
"Losing our eyes and ears in the community is only likely to hamper good performance in preventing crime."
She said police leaders must take heed of the warning and "make sure that neighbourhood policing - the cornerstone of the British policing model - is preserved for future generations".

In the 1960s and 70s the gap between police and local communities widened - partly, it's believed, because officers began whizzing around in panda cars and spent less time on the beat.
The Scarman report, following the Brixton riots in 1981, emphasised the importance of getting officers back into neighbourhoods, and a further push came 20 years later with the creation of Police Community Support Officers.
They, along with dedicated neighbourhood police officers, are meant to provide reassurance, gather intelligence and prevent crime.
In a 2013 review for the Labour Party, Lord Stevens warned that owing to budget cuts and a focus on being "crime-fighters" the police service was "in danger of retreating to a discredited model of reactive policing".
The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report provides the clearest evidence yet that the former Metropolitan Police commissioner may be right.
Ms Billingham said it was "disappointing" that there had not been more progress on concerns she raised last year.
"More than a third of forces are judged to require improvement in how they investigate crime and manage offenders, with backlogs and delays in the units which extract and analyse evidence from digital devices a particular concern," she said.
She also noted "relatively poor" performance in supporting vulnerable victims.
But she said most forces had been rated either "good" or "outstanding" in terms of tackling the most serious crimes and preventing crime and anti-social behaviour.
Policing minister Mike Penning said: "Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a quarter since 2010, according to the independent crime survey for England and Wales."
He said the government had made policing "more professional, less bureaucratic for officers and more responsive to victims".
"Last year we protected police budgets for the next four years, once local precept is taken into account," he added.
"Chief constables and Police and Crime Commissioners have no excuse whatsoever not to deliver at least good quality policing in their areas."
