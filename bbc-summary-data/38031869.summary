Oxford Brookes: Complaints about noisy students rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Extremely serious concerns about unacceptable noise and disruption" caused by students in Oxford have increased, according to a letter seen by the BBC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East Oxford residents have been complaining about the behaviour of Oxford Brookes students on nights out.
In the letter Andrea Siret, head of community engagement, said students could face disciplinary action.
One resident told the BBC he often heard students "screaming".
Ross Clark said: "We've had students running over cars in our street, stupid things.
"At two o'clock in the morning they're all running past in shopping trolleys, screaming. It isn't a good thing.
"When you get terrible [neighbours] you're in trouble."
The letter tells students to "show consideration to their neighbours, including students passing through residential areas to attend venues, as quite often residents are sleeping".
It reads: "We are particularly concerned about the volume of complaints we have received... we believe that the majority of these complaints are caused by students on their way to or returning from a night out.
"The university takes its responsibilities as a neighbour within the community very seriously.
"All students at Oxford Brookes University accept, as a condition of enrolment, that they will not act in a way that brings the university into disrepute. This includes students living in private-rented accommodation."
Oxford City Council has set Oxford's universities a target of no more than 3,000 students each living in private accommodation.
However, 3,747 Oxford Brookes students rented private homes last year, with many residing in the east Oxford area.
