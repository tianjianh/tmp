Tributes have been paid to one of Northern Ireland's most colourful and successful businessmen, who has died at the age of 84.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy McBurney was the founder of Belfast's Outlet Records company.
He produced music from both sides of the sectarian divide in the darkest days of the Troubles while selling records at his Smithfield Market shop.
He recorded acts as diverse as Stiff Little fingers, the Dubliners and Philomena Begley.
His biggest seller was the infamous rebel song the Men Behind The Wire in 1971.
Mr McBurney's son Martin said the song was put out by the Andersonstown Residents Association in Belfast as a protest song.
"My dad had obviously had the recording studio and recorded it and put it out and pressed it and distributed it," he said.
"It was number one in the Irish charts for several weeks, but RTE [the Irish state broadcaster] banned it and never played it.
"At the time it was a fairly massive song."
Mr McBurney said the record had to be pressed in London as his father could not get it done in Dublin.
He said the company who pressed it sent back a master copy - a silver plate -  which had engraved on it "freedom to you all".
Among Outlet's other biggest sellers were Orange band recordings and Martin McBurney said his father had no problem recording music from whatever source.
"His philosophy was sort of in the Wolfe Tone tradition, you know, Protestants, dissenters and everyone, there was no issue in that, they were all Irish men at the back of it all."
Despite this, the Troubles came to Mr McBurney.
He was shot by loyalists and a shop and a warehouse in Smithfield were blown-up, it is believed by the IRA.
Mr McBurney was also interned by the security forces.
Author and photographer Bobbie Hanvey said that led to an ironic nickname for Mr McBurney.
"He was shot by the loyalists, he was blown up by the Provos and he was put into Long Kesh [prison] by the British. His nickname was Lucky," Mr Hanvey said.
"He was in during the internment thing and his accountants and all were going into the prison and getting his books right and he was telling them what people to record. I think he was a genius really."
Mr Hanvey said Mr McBurney opened his first studio in Belfast's Bank Street in 1966, but had no artists to record.
"He went down to Kelly's Cellars [bar] one night and Tom McHale was there, he was the all-Ireland tin whistle champion," he said.
"After they had a few drinks together, Billy brought him back to the studio and they recorded him and that was Billy's first LP on the Outlet label."
Mr McBurney also distributed US acts such as Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings and promoted concerts in his early years.
"Billy was one of Northern Ireland's best businessmen, most successful businessmen," Mr Hanvey said.
"He was a lovely human being and a great Irish man."
