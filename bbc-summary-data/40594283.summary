Featherweight Selby, 30, will defend his IBF belt against Jonathan Victor Barros in Wembley on Saturday.
His mother, Frankie, died suddenly on Tuesday evening.
"I'm OK, I'm good. I'm here to do a job, and a job is what I'll do. [I'll] stay focused, stay professional," Selby told BBC Wales Sport.
"Saturday night I'm going to get a win and travel back home to Barry.
"Family comes first. In my life, that's what comes first. Family and boxing - that's all I am."
Selby had been scheduled to face Barros last January in Las Vegas.
But the fight was called off with 24 hours' notice after the 33-year-old Argentine failed to meet the Nevada Athletic Commission's licensing conditions.
Selby and Barros will now meet on the same card as Chris Eubank Jr against Arthur Abraham.
"Lee and the team have made the decision that they will proceed with the contest on Saturday," said Selby's manager, Jamie Sanigar.
"Lee is a brave young man and he's here to do a job on Saturday."
