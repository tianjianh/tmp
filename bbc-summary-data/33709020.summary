[SN]TITLE[SN]
Museum staff strike over weekend and bank holiday pay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is disruption at six of Wales' national museums this weekend as staff strike in a dispute over changes to pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public and Commercial Services Union members are against plans to stop extra payments paid to weekend and bank holiday staff.
National Museum Wales said a 4% salary rise for low-paid workers and a Living Wage of Â£7.85 an hour would mitigate the loss.
It apologised for strike disruption.
The strike is affecting six of National Museum Wales' sites, with Swansea's National Waterfront Museum, the National Slate Museum in Llanberis and the National Wool Museum, Dre-fach Felindre, closed on Saturday.
St Fagans National History Museum and National Museum Cardiff are open Saturday but with limited services.
Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon is shut both days.
