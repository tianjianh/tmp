The 3,300lb device exploded near the Arndale Centre on 15 June 1996, devastating the busy shopping area.
There were no deaths, but about 200 people were injured.
No-one has ever been charged over the blast, and Greater Manchester Police said it was now "the right time for another assessment" of the case.
Following a previous review in 2006, the force concluded there was "no realistic possibility" of a prosecution.
Det Ch Supt Tony Mole said: "The Manchester bomb affected many people which is why the case has remained open and has been kept under constant review.
"As the 20th anniversary of the incident approaches, it is now the right time for another assessment of the case in order to identify and explore any possible potential investigative opportunities.
"If new information comes to light it would be considered, and I would urge anyone with information relevant to the investigation to get in touch with police."
