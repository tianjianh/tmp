PNG court rules Australia's Manus detention centre unconstitutional

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court has ruled that the detention of asylum seekers and refugees on Manus Island is unconstitutional.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Australia sends asylum seekers to the Manus Island detention centre under its offshore processing policy.
But the five judges on the Supreme Court's bench ruled the camp breached section 42 of the constitution, which guarantees personal liberty.
The court said "all steps" should be taken to end the "illegal" detention.
Currently around 850 men are held on the island, around half of whom have been judged genuine refugees.
Papua New Guinea's constitution guarantees personal liberty for all people, except in defined circumstances relating to crime, illegal immigration and quarantine.
In 2014, Papua New Guinea's government amended section 42 of the constitution to add a paragraph that allowed for "holding a foreign national under arrangements made by Papua New Guinea with another country".
But the Supreme Court ruled this amendment was unconstitutional, as it did not meet a requirement to respect "the rights and dignity of mankind".
It said that because the asylum seekers and refugees had not voluntarily entered Papua New Guinea, the situation of illegal immigration did not apply to them.
"The detention of the asylum seekers on Manus Island in Papua New Guineaâ€¦ is unconstitutional and illegal," it said.
"Both the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments shall forthwith take all steps necessary to cease and prevent the continued unconstitutional and illegal detention of the asylum seekers or transferees at the relocation centre on Manus Island and the continued breach of the asylum seekers' or transferees' constitutional and human rights."

Australia's controversial asylum policy
Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement that the court's decision did not change Australia's immigration policy.
"People who have attempted to come illegally by boat and are now in the Manus facility will not be settled in Australia," the statement said, repeating the government's long-standing policy.
The opposition Labor party urged the government to hold urgent talks with Papua New Guinea, while opponents of hard-line immigration policy declared offshore processing of asylum seekers dead.
"The game is up. The government has got to shut the Manus Island detention camp and bring these people here," Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.
"This is an important decision and I welcome it. It shows that the Australian government has been illegally detaining refugees on Manus Island for years."
Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said the Manus Island centre should eventually close, during an address to Australia's National Press Club in March this year.
"Who is going to pay for it? Certainly the PNG government does not have the resources to resettle the refugees," he said. "We are also reassessing the numbers who are supposed to be resettled."
