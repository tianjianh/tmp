A half-day strike by teachers planned for Thursday has been deferred following Martin McGuinness' death.

The action by members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) was set to include a demonstration at Parliament Buildings at Stormont.
The strike was called over an ongoing pay dispute.
It has been delayed as "a mark of respect and recognition of Mr McGuinness's contribution to education", said INTO.
"Martin McGuiness was the first education minister of the devolved era and he made a hugely positive impact on the entire education sector," said the union's Northern Secretary Gerry Murphy.
"I want to extend the sympathies of the INTO to the McGuinness family, to his wife Bernie, his children and grandchildren and the wider family circle.
"His service as Education Minister was characterised by an intelligence and warmth that was accompanied by real investments in both the schools estate and the educational workforce.
"Martin attended a number of INTO Congresses and Northern Conferences. His contributions to these gatherings were insightful and at times challenging and was always warmly received," he added.
