Amy Simpson, 18, died when her car left the road near the village of Dalavich, on the banks of Loch Awe, on Tuesday.
Miss Simpson, from Cowdenbeath in Fife, was with four other women passengers who escaped without serious injury.
Her mother Angela Simpson said her "gorgeous girl Amy" was "my best friend, my soulmate and my rock".
She said: "She made me so proud.  One day I will make her as proud of me as I was of her.
"I am absolutely heartbroken and it's hard to find the words at this distressing time to express just how much I will miss her.
"Rest in peace Toots."
Miss Simpson's black Peugeot left the road at about 18:40 on Tuesday and the car ended up in the River Avich.
