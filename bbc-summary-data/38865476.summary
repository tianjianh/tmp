[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Burrow's fifth of the season claimed three points for Gateshead as they came from behind to beat Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Aspin's side claimed an important win in the race for promotion despite going behind to the out-of-form home side.
Elliott Durrell saw an effort well saved early on, before Danny Johnson volleyed over shortly after as the sides traded blows.
However, the hosts took the lead after a corner was not dealt with and the ball fell to Blaine Hudson, who smashed home from six yards.
Gateshead were level four minutes later as Johnson ran at the back four from deep, before poking a shot under the body of Liam Roberts.
They were ahead after 62 minutes as a long ball in behind the Chester defence was knocked down into the path of Burrow, who slotted down the middle to claim the win.
