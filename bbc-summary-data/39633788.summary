The 21-year-old joined the Women's Super League One club from Arsenal before the start of last season.
Manager Emma Hayes told the club website: "Jade Bailey has unfortunately suffered a season-ending injury.
"She had started the season so well and it's been a huge disappointment for the squad to see that happen."
Chelsea, who were knocked out of the Women's FA Cup by Birmingham City on penalties on Monday, begin their 2017 WSL 1 Spring Series campaign at home to Yeovil Town Ladies on Sunday, 30 April.
