Jeremy Clarkson has said he will miss hosting Top Gear, in his first comment since he was dropped from the BBC show.

The presenter was writing in his first column for the Sun since he was released from the show on 25 March after an "unprovoked physical attack" on a producer.
"Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear," he wrote.
"It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there."
He did not add anything more about the incident.
Clarkson had been suspended by the BBC on 10 March, following what was called a "fracas" with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon.
The decision caused an outpouring of support from Top Gear fans, with more than a million people signing an online petition to reinstate him.
The row, which took place in a Yorkshire hotel, was said to have occurred because no hot food was provided following a day's filming.
An internal investigation followed and the BBC's director general Tony Hall confirmed Clarkson's contract would not be renewed.
His weekly Sun column had not appeared in the interim but the paper had assured readers that he was on holiday and "had not been sacked".
