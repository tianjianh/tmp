A social welfare office in Dublin has banned interviewees from wearing pyjamas.

A notice has appeared at Damastown social welfare office which warns claimants that "pyjamas are not regarded as appropriate attire when attending Community Welfare Service at these offices".
It is believed the decision was made after a number of people complained.
It is not the first time sleep wear has made headlines.
Two years ago, Joe McGuinness, the principal of St Matthew's Primary School, Belfast, sent a stern letter to parents saying wearing pyjamas on the school run was "slovenly and rude".
Last year a head teacher from a school in Middlesborough, England, also asked parents to get properly dressed before the school run.
The issue gained even more prominence when a Tesco store in Cardiff, Wales, put notices up asking customers not to shop in their pyjamas or barefoot.
Speaking to the BBC's Talkback programme, image consultant Billy Dickson said he "couldn't quite understand" Tesco's decision to ban pyjamas as he claimed the supermarket continued to receive business, although he said he supported the ban at the Dublin social welfare office.
"There is a psychological aspect and pyjamas are associated with sleeping at night and comfort in the home," he said
"You have to get into the mindset of what you are doing that day. So if you are wanting to get a job, go dressed prepared to get a job."
However, he said there was "always a contrary argument".
"The fashion houses of Paris and Milan have gone into servicing in this area," he added.
"I have witnessed people walking around Mayfair in London in their pyjamas."
Columnist Joan Birnie said night wear "should only be worn in the house".
"It's slovenly, it's wrong - pyjamas are for wearing to bed. They are definitely not for outside wear," she said.
