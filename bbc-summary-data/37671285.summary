The 24-year-old was knifed in the stomach in Brierley Hill town centre at 16:45 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries, West Midlands Police said. A murder investigation has been launched.
Det Insp Jim Munro said it was thought to have been a "targeted" attack and that the two people involved knew each other.
A worker at Dixi Chicken, on High Street, told the Express & Star an injured man came into the shop.
Ahmad Sherzad, 20, told the newspaper: "He had a hand to his waist and blood was coming out.
"He came up to counter and said 'help me' before fainting.
"I went outside and called the ambulance."
The road has been sealed off while investigations take place and a nearby wood is also being searched.
Det Insp Munro added: "We have spoken to some witnesses already but I'm sure there are many more people who saw what happened, or saw the offender running away, and have not yet spoken to police."
