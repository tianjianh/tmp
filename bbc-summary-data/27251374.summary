A Broadway musical based on the best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County is to close after just 137 performances.

The show opened to mixed reviews in February. It will close on 18 May.
The New York Times said it had "the depth of a shiny picture postcard... that bears a disproportionately long and repetitive message".
The musical won four Tony nominations earlier this week, but missed out on the coveted best musical nod.
Both leading lady - Kelli O'Hara - and Jason Robert Brown's musical score were shortlisted for an award.
O'Hara won rave reviews for her role as a lonely housewife in rural Iowa, who has a brief but passionate affair with a photographer - played by Steven Pasquale. The roles were previously played by Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood in the hit 1995 film.
But in the face of sluggish ticket sales, producers took the decision to call time on the show's Broadway run at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.
A revised version of the show, which cost an estimated $8m (Â£4.7m) to stage, will begin a national tour in autumn 2015.
Jazz musical After Midnight, Aladdin, Beautiful and A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder were the four shows nominated for the best musical Tony on Tuesday.
The 68th Tony Awards will be held in New York on 8 June, with X-Men star Hugh Jackman hosting the event for the first time since 2005.
