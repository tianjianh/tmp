Faroe to Scotland cable problem hits internet connections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A problem with a subsea cable that runs between the Faroe Islands and Scotland has affected internet connections, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BT said slow speeds or a lack of service experienced by customers in parts of the north of Scotland had been traced to SHEFA-2.
The cable was laid to improve connections between North Atlantic communities and Europe.
Faroese Telecom, which owns the link, has been working on repairs.
BT said the damaged section of the fibre optic cable was where it passes through the Moray Firth.
SHEFA-2 runs from Torshavn in the Faroe Islands to Banff on the Aberdeenshire coast via Shetland and Orkney.
