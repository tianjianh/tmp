'Dumb truckers': The height of madness after Irish safety campaign?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Irish road tunnel will be partially closed for several days after a hay lorry that was too big to enter the tunnel got stuck and damaged the roof.

The vehicle became wedged at the entrance to the Limerick Tunnel at about 20:30 local time on Sunday.
It happened despite a high-profile and controversial campaign warning lorry drivers to obey height restrictions.
Irish Rail produced a video entitled "Dumb truckers" after a rise in the number of lorries hitting low bridges.
The video is a photo montage of "Irish Truckers Greatest Hits", showing the company's best pictures of lorry drivers' worst decisions.
The tongue-in-cheek soundtrack features smash-hit lyrics such as "Hit Me Baby One More Time" and "Oops! ...I Did It Again" by Britney Spears; "Bang Bang" by Nancy Sinatra and "Under The Bridge" by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
The video was a little too cheeky for some, and the "dumb truckers" jibe caused anger in the Irish haulage industry.
However, a spokeswoman for Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) was unrepentant about trying to make the maximum impact with their safety warning.
"If you'll pardon the pun, it's a hard-hitting campaign," said Jane Cregan, spokeswoman for Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail).
"But we wanted to get attention because it's the single biggest safety risk that we face for having a major railway safety incident."
There were 85 bridge strikes along the Irish railway network in 2015 but already this year, there have been 68, prompting the firm to take action.
"We do have to call into question the intelligence of these drivers who are not reading the road signs ahead of them, they're not planning their journey and they don't know the height of their vehicle," Ms Cregan told BBC News NI.
She said bridge strikes were not only a risk to safety but also caused "massive delays" and "traffic chaos".
Asked if the video was deliberately provocative, Ms Cregan said her firm "needed to draw attention" to the dangers.
She claimed there had been a "mixed reaction" from the haulage industry, with some drivers indicating their support.
"Some people may have suggested it was maybe a bit harsh, but for the vast majority of truckers who pass under and over our bridges every day - they do so in a responsible manner," she added.
The Limerick Tunnel incident is now the subject of an insurance claim, according to the boss of the company which operates the tunnel.
Declan Cahill, chief executive of Direct Route, told the BBC significant damage had been caused to specialised equipment which will take a number of days to repair.
He said there was an electronic system in place that measured the height of vehicles as they approached the entrance, and several warning signs, lights and barriers had been triggered.
The 675m (738 yd) tunnel, which passes under the River Shannon, opened in 2010 at a cost of 660m euros (£558m).
Mr Cahill said "99%" of truck drivers obeyed the height restrictions and this was the first time a truck had become stuck inside the tunnel.
The tunnel remains open to vehicles but a contra-flow system is now in place, with traffic moving in both directions on the southbound lane, at reduced speeds.
Drivers have been warned to expect delays.
