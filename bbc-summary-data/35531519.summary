[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In honour of Pancake Day, BodyPositive friend, blogger and foodie, Ella Woodward, brings you these delicious pancake recipes packed with healthy, energy boosting ingredients!

These pancakes are the best healthy spin on the classic sugar and lemon pancakes! Each pancake is just bursting with flavour - the richness from the cardamom works so well with the zestiness from the lemon and sweetness from the honey.
The drizzle is made with more lemon zest, honey and coconut oil to create the most perfect contrast in flavours! They're so delicious, you can enjoy them throughout the year too, not just on pancake day - they would make the best breakfast or sweet dessert!
Method
This blend of oats, almonds and flax makes each pancake brilliantly thick with a perfectly  warm, squishy middle - just like good American pancakes. Topped with fresh blueberries, walnut pieces, sliced banana, strawberries and a little extra maple syrup they are just divine and they literally just melt in your mouth!
They're super healthy too so now you can enjoy this awesome day of sweet indulgence without worrying about the consequences! The oats and almonds also mean they're perfectly filling, so you really can't eat a hundred - although considering how good they taste I'm sure you'll want to!
