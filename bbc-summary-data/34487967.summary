'Barbaric' snare traps advice 'futile', says animal charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Only a ban on "barbaric" snare traps can stop animals suffering and Welsh government advice on best practice is "futile", an animal charity has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
League Against Cruel Sports described a new code of best practice as "a futile attempt to do the right thing".
It said 370,000 animals, including badgers and pets, were caught in the wire traps in Wales last year.
The Welsh government said it had no legislative framework to regulate or ban the use of snares.
Advice in the Welsh government's leaflet includes checking the traps daily, only using traps where there is evidence of foxes and placing them at least 18cm (7in) from the ground to avoid badgers getting caught in them.
"Academic research and first-hand evidence shows that regulations do not reduce the suffering animals endure in snares," said Bethan Collins of League Against Cruel Sports.
"Any code of practice is only as good as the people who follow it, and Defra's research showed that few fox snare operators in England and Wales actually do."
But Charles Grisedale, who runs a game shoot in Pennant, Ceredigion, said wire snare traps were necessary for his business.
He said: "The balance in nature has gone. The apex predator the wolf that killed the foxes or kept them dispersed doesn't exist anymore and too many foxes can ruin your livelihood and the livelihood of people who rely on the shooting business such as hotels."
The Welsh government said: "At present there is no legislative framework available to the Welsh Government to regulate or ban the use of snares.
"The Law Commission is currently reviewing the regulatory framework for wildlife, which includes snares, and their final report is due to be published later this year."
