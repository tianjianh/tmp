After losing his serve in the first game against Troicki, second seed Murray, 29, went on to control the tempo of the match and says he is not feeling any pressure to win the singles title he claimed at London 2012.
"I will always keep my gold medal," he said. "That will always be there. You don't have to give it away.
"So, it's more trying to win another medal. That builds the pressure, and wanting to do something here. It's sort of the pressure I am putting on myself. I'm not thinking about four years ago.
"Having the Olympics come so soon after Wimbledon for me, it may have been easy to have a bit of a lull, but that's not going to happen with the Olympics."
Konta is hoping to cap a remarkable year - in which she has earned a career-high world ranking of 13, won a first WTA title and reached the Australian Open semi-finals - with an Olympic medal.
"It was a very tough match. She was playing inspired tennis and had nothing to lose," Konta said after winning on her Olympic debut.

The Spaniard had not played for two months after pulling out of the French Open with a wrist injury.
"The wrist needs little bit more time to be 100%," the 14-time Grand Slam winner said. "If this was not the Olympic Games, I would not be here competing."
