[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reports of racist behaviour during Carlisle United's home game against Everton are being investigated by police and the Football Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was alleged "racial remarks" were directed towards players from Brunton Park's Warwick Road End following Everton's opening goal.
Cumbria Police appealed for information, while both clubs said they would work with the authorities.
Everton went on to beat Carlisle 3-0 in the FA Cup fourth round tie on Sunday.
Carlisle manager Keith Curle said:  "It is not what we want inside Brunton Park, inside football, or inside society. It is not accepted.
"To any supporters who were next to people and heard people - please step forward to identify them."
Everton manager Roberto Martinez said: "There is no room for that sort of behaviour, but I must stress it was a very small minority and I want to believe that it was just an emotional reaction to the disappointment of conceding a goal."
The FA said in a statement: "We have received the referee's report regarding the alleged incident during today's game between Carlisle United and Everton.
"We have contacted both clubs .... and will be conducting an immediate and thorough investigation."
