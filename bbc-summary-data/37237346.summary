Clarke-Salter, 18, has played in one Premier League match, making his Chelsea debut at Aston Villa in April.
England Under-20 international Colkett, 19, is yet to play in a senior game.
Boateng, 20, has made three appearances for Palace and made 30 for Plymouth while on loan last term, helping Argyle reach the League Two play-off final.
"These are indeed exciting times for Bristol Rovers and signing more players from a Premier League club does, I believe, show that we are serious in moving the club forward," chairman Steve Hamer told the League One club's website.
