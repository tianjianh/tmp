Payne, 30, who became the first female rider to win the Melbourne Cup in November, is recovering in hospital from surgery to repair her pancreas.
She was dislodged from her mount Dutch Lodge at Mildura racecourse.
"Further tests will be undertaken over the next couple of days to determine the progress of her recovery," her family said in a statement.
"Michelle experienced a significant level of pain following the surgery, but this lessened over the weekend. She is currently in good spirits."
Payne has been ruled out of making her debut at Royal Ascot next month and taking part in the Shergar Cup team event at Ascot in August.
