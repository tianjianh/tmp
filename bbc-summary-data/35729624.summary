Chief Insp Julian Harper, incident manager for West Midlands Police, confirmed a knife was used in the incident and said one man initially went to help the woman before being joined by four other men.
He said officers were "working hard" to piece together the incidents before the assault and praised the men for intervening.
"[They] bravely stepped into what was a dangerous and volatile situation, with complete disregard for their own safety and I commend them for their actions," he said.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the woman was airlifted to hospital.
