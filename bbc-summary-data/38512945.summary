[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton winger Yannick Bolasie could be out for a year with a knee injury, says manager Ronald Koeman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bolasie, 27, injured his right knee during the Toffees' 1-1 draw with Manchester United on 4 December.
Dutch manager Koeman said on Wednesday: "It will be around 11-12 months before he is back. That is a big disappointment but he will come back."
Bolasie is due to have a second operation - on his anterior cruciate ligament - in the coming weeks.
