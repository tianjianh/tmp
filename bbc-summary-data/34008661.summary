The Red Arrows, Black Cat helicopters and others were due to fly over the town as part of the four-day event.
The night air displays have also been cancelled as the aircraft were unable to get to Bournemouth in time.
Director of the festival Jon Weaver said the site was still open with fun fairs and exhibitions for people to enjoy.
Bournemouth Air Festival posted on Twitter night air displays had had to be cancelled.
"The aircraft are unable to get into Bournemouth in time to be able to prepare for the shows and in addition the weather would make the dusk air flying conditions unsuitable.
"Concerts are still on at Boscombe and Bournemouth stages," it said.
The Red Arrows posted on Twitter: "Bad news yet again.
"The weather is below limits and forecast to get worse. We've no choice but to cancel our @BmthAirFest display today."
On Wednesday the RAF display team cancelled an appearance at Weymouth Carnival.
