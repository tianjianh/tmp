Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has called for an end to "control freakery" at party conferences.

She has promised to let Labour members choose what to debate on the Sunday of their autumn conference in October.
Ms Dugdale says Labour should not be afraid of its members' views - whether they want to debate the future of Trident or welfare reform.
The move is expected to be confirmed by the party's ruling body when it meets in Stirling today.
The executive committee has also confirmed the ballot for selecting Scottish Labour's candidates for the 2016 Holyrood election will take place in January.
Party members will vote for regional list candidates throughout the month, with the results announced in early February.
Ms Dugdale has already said that a debate on Trident is on the table following renewed splits created by UK leadership candidate Jeremy Corbyn's anti-nuclear stance.
Mr Corbyn's case has been backed by Scottish Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley.
In an email to local constituency Labour parties announcing the changes, Ms Dugdale said: "During the leadership contest, Alex Rowley and I said we want to open up the Scottish Labour Party to members and supporters across the country.
"We want people to find a home in Labour once again. The role of members isn't to just vote for a new leader, something you've been asked to do all too often in recent times.
"It should be to put forward ideas about how we can transform our country to make it a better place to live for everybody.
"We shouldn't be afraid of the views of our members and supporters. We want you to have your say. Nothing should be swept under the carpet because it's too difficult.
"The days of conference control freakery in all political parties in Scotland must come to an end."
The move came as Scottish Labour unveiled it had attracted more than 3,400 new members since the general election.
The party now has more than 28,000 people in Scotland signed up to help its campaign, made up of more than 17,000 members - almost 3,300 registered supporters and almost 8,000 affiliated supporters.
