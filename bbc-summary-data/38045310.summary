[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bwlch Nant yr Arian to have new mountain bike track

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is due to begin on a new mountain bike track in Ceredigion on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The track is being built at Bwlch Nant yr Arian visitor centre, near Aberystwyth, and will allow riders to practise their skills before taking on more challenging routes.
The work is scheduled to be complete by Christmas, weather depending.
Centre manager Gareth Owen said: "The site has been carefully selected so that it doesn't affect the view over the lake."
Once the work is complete, the area will be landscaped and trees planted.
Mr Owen added the track was a "great addition" to the other activities there.
