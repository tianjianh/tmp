The Magpies, managed by ex-West Ham man Alan Devonshire, had to match or better second-placed Ebbsfleet result on the final day to win the title.
Ebbsfleet also won their final game, 1-0 at home to Oxford City
Harry Pritchard's free-kick gave them a first-half lead against already-relegated Margate before Dave Tarpey netted his 44th goal of the season.
Fellow striker Sean Marks was credited with the third goal after a shot from Pritchard took a deflection and was finished from close-range, ensuring victory for a Maidenhead side that finished two points clear at the top with 98 points.
"The planning for the National League has already started," Devonshire told BBC Radio Berkshire at full-time.
"It's full credit to the lads for their efforts this season. We've been up the top of the table for most of the campaign and they've kept focused and kept going right to the end."
Ebbsfleet, who themselves picked up 96 points during the season, will now face Hampton & Richmond in the play-offs, with Chelmsford City and Dartford set to meet in the other semi-final.
