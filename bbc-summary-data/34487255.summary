Ice Factor Kinlochleven has been shut since 29 July when an accidental fire broke out in the sauna area of the building.
Nobody was hurt in the incident and the structure of the 119-year-old former Victorian smelter survived.
Jamie Smith, of the site's owners Ice Factor International, said he hoped to be able to reopen in December.
The clean up has involved melting and removing walls of ice and cleaning thousands individual handholds.
He said: "Over the past nine weeks considerable progress has been made by staff and specialist teams to help clean, rebuild and reinstate key facilities.
"Though the fire was contained to the back of the facility, including the sauna area, the likes of the heating, ventilation and electrical systems were badly damaged."
Mr Smith added: "It is frustrating and disappointing to have been forced to close over our traditionally busy summer and autumn months and to cancel several events.
"I am hugely appreciative of the support and understanding of our many loyal customers."
Ice Factor Kinlochleven first opened in 2003.
Ice Factor International also owns Snow Factor Braehead on the outskirts of Glasgow.
