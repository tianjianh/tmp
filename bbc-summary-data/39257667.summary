[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man in court over Paul Curran killing in Lurgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 37-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the manslaughter of Lurgan father-of-two Paul Gerard Curran.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Mr Curran, 29, was discovered when police were called to a house in Lurgan's Manor Drive last Thursday afternoon.
John McComb, from Ardnaskea Park in Coalisland, admits striking Mr Curran, but claims it was during a "playfight" and denies the killing.
He claimed another man, named in court, had fought with Mr Curran.
A detective sergeant said police were not looking for any other suspects.
A defence lawyer said a drink and drugs-fuelled party had been going on at the house for days.
A woman and two men, one of whom was Mr McComb, were arrested that evening.
On Monday afternoon, he appeared in court in Lisburn, while the other two suspects were released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
The detective told the court that there were nine people in the house around the time of Mr Curran's death and that Mr McComb and his girlfriend were the only two to leave.
Mr McComb changed his clothes, the court heard. Police searches for his discarded clothing have, so far, proved unsuccessful and the detective said he has refused to help to locate them.
Mr McComb maintains that he changed his clothes after attempting CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on his "friend" and then, deeply upset, went drinking so heavily he was unable to say what happened to his clothing.
Bail was refused and Mr McComb was remanded in custody to appear again via video link on the last day of this month.
