The weapon was found close to Cables Wynd, where the attack took place at about 23:00 on Friday.
The injured man, who is in his 20s, remains in hospital and is reported to be in a stable condition.
Following the firearm find, officers have renewed their appeal for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area on Friday evening to come forward.
Det Insp Alan O'Brien said: "A firearm has now been recovered and we believe this was the same one used in the attack.
"From the inquiries carried out thus far, we are confident that we are dealing with a single suspect and that this was an isolated incident.
"It remains my view that there is not an ongoing threat to the community, however there will be an increase in police patrols in the area for the foreseeable future in order to provide a reassuring presence.
"Today, I appeal to anyone who was in the area of Cables Wynd on Friday night and who noticed any suspicious behaviour to contact police immediately on 101."
Information can also be passed anonymously through Crimestoppers.
