About 20,000 motorcycle enthusiasts from the UK and overseas took part in annual charity event Ride to the Wall.
Convoys set out from points including Telford services in Shropshire and Strensham services in Worcestershire.
A service for remembrance was held along with a Tiger Moth flypast. Funds were raised for the arboretum.
Riders and passengers gathered at the memorial, which is engraved with the names of more than 16,000 service men and women killed since the end of the Second World War.
Major General Lamont Kirkland patron of the Ride to the Wall said: "It is a service of remembrance with this unique twist conducted by bikers, for bikers.
"But most importantly we are now attracting the families and the loved ones - fathers and son, brothers and sisters - of the servicemen whose names are on these walls."
Organisers said 200 riders were expected to the first event - but 2,000 turned up - and eight years on they estimated crowds at 20,000.
There were performances from the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team - the White Helmets.
