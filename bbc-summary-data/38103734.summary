Rory Best: Ireland team-mates laud hooker as he prepares to win 100th cap

Rory Best will not allow winning his 100th Ireland cap to deflect his total focus away from beating Australia, says team-mate Andrew Trimble.

On Saturday Best will become the fifth Irishman to reach the milestone after Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara, Paul O'Connell and John Hayes.
"He'll rise to the occasion but will be humble enough not to make the day about him," says Ulster team-mate Trimble.
"That's what you want from a leader and why he's looked up to so much."

Having played with Best, 34, both for Ulster and Ireland for over a decade, Trimble is as well placed as anybody to extol the virtues of the hooker, who made his Irish debut against New Zealand in November 2005.
"On and off the pitch, he's an example to follow for young people and even me. I'm only a few years younger and I'm still looking up to him," added the 32-year-old Ulster wing.
"He's got the ability to deliver what he has to say and be precise, specific, about the key messages that are delivered.
"As well as that, whenever you get on the pitch, you just follow him into battle. He's a guy who sets the example and sets the tone for intensity, with and without the ball.
"I've watched him develop as a captain and leader. Even in the last six months, more and more of what he says holds a lot of weight and grabs people's attention."

Flanker Sean O'Brien says the hooker's ability to welcome new players into the Ireland squad has been one of his greatest attributes, even long before he was appointed the captaincy.
"Rory is just one of those fellows who is always looking at the bigger picture," says the Leinster star, who will also line up alongside Best and Trimble at the Aviva Stadium as Ireland aim to regroup from last weekend's bruising defeat by the All Blacks.
"He has always looked after the younger guys when they have come in, myself included.
"He's a phenomenal player. A leader and someone you look to when you are under pressure."
And while Best's mission on Saturday will be all about ensuring victory over Michael Cheika's side, Irish scrum-half Conor Murray says the desire to mark the hooker's milestone with a win will be in his team-mates' thoughts.
"It's an amazing achievement for him and it couldn't happen to a better fellow," says Lions player Murray.
"Coming out on Saturday, that will be in the back of the squad's heads. We want to play for Rory and try to get a win."
