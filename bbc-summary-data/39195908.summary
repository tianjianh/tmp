Whelan, 28, joined Notts in 2015 and has won three international caps.
"Fern has been a steady rock at the back and fits in perfectly back line," said manager Rick Passmoor.
The Spring Series sees teams play each other once in a one-off, six-week transitional competition before the WSL's switch to a winter calendar.
For top-flight teams, the Spring Series runs over six weeks, from 23 April until Saturday, 3 June.
