The 22-year-old finished on 14 under par after five birdies and an eagle in his final nine holes helped him card a second-round 64 at the 36-hole event.
Rai, who will play in his first major, beat Li Haotong of China by one shot.
"It's a dream come true to play in any major, and with it being the US Open it makes it extra special," he said.
Scotland's Richie Ramsay, Welshman Bradley Dredge, Ireland's Paul Dunne and English trio Andrew Johnston, Eddie Pepperell and Matt Wallace also qualified.
Wallace, who recently won the Open de Portugal on only his third European Tour start, said: "My first major, I'm so happy.
"I just can't believe it. Six months ago I was on the Alps Tour, which is crazy. I've just had the best six or seven months of my life."
This year's US Open takes place between 15-18 June in Erin Hills, Wisconsin.
