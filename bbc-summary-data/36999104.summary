Britain's Chris Froome had to be told to register for the men's road race by two BBC journalists, minutes before the start at Fort Copacabana.

Riders must sign in before the race, but the three-time Tour de France champion was unaware his name was being called over the public address system.
BBC News correspondent Natalie Pirks and colleague Andrew Cropper told Froome, who was at the start line.
"He was very calm, relaxed, but clearly in a world of his own," said Pirks.
"We barged our way through a load of camera crews and I said: 'Chris, they're calling your name over the system.'
"He looked at me as though to say 'what's she on about?' then he spoke to the Team GB representative who was with him and it was then that he heard it."
Froome, 31, is hoping to better the bronze medal he won in the time trial at London 2012.
BBC co-commentator Chris Boardman said it was unlikely Froome would have been disqualified had he not registered, saying a fine would have been more likely.
