The national commemoration is at Cardiff's City Hall as part of a day to remember victims and their families.
There are also services in Wrexham, Newtown, Caernarfon, Neath, Newport, Mold and Aberystwyth on Tuesday.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "I am proud to reaffirm our commitment in Wales to the ongoing remembrance of those who died under Nazi persecution, the Holocaust and other genocides."
Flint High School has been chosen as one of the 70 venues across the country to light a specially-designed candle as part of the commemorations.
Holocaust Memorial Day was started by the UK government in 2001 and takes place every year on 27 January.
This year's event also marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau and 2015  is the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia.
