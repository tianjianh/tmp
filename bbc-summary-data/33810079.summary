The Tyco BMW rider set the best speed in practice at 132.23mph in the closing minutes of Thursday's qualifying session held in perfect conditions.
New Zealander Bruce Anstey also topped the 132mph mark and just 1.5 seconds separated the top six.
Isle of Man TT hat-trick hero Ian Hutchinson was third.
Peter Hickman, Lee Johnston and William Dunlop were also all above 131mph.
Lincolnshire's Martin was also quickest in the Superstock class on 129.51mph, followed by Scot Keith Amor and William Dunlop.
Diminutive Fermanagh lad Lee Johnston has made a promising start to his bid to break his Ulster Grand Prix duck, finishing the Supersport session with the best speed of 127.37mph.
Padgett's Honda pilot Anstey was second (127.15), then Martin third with 126.69.
British Supersport regular Glenn Irwin put in a flying final lap on his Cookstown BE Racing Kawasaki to move to the summit in the Supertwins at 117.99mph, just ahead of Lightweight TT winner Ivan Lintin, who lapped at 117.99.
Sam Wilson was best of the Lightweights for 250cc and 400cc machines after posting 115.30mph, some way ahead of his nearest challenger and fellow Ballymena man Neil Kernohan (115.30).
Christian Elkin came out on top in the Ultra-Lightweight category, clocking 107.70 on his Moto3 bike.
The practice sessions were punctuated by four stoppages because of red flag incidents, none thought to be serious.
