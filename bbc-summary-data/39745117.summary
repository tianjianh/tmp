Plans for a new hotel on the derelict site at the entrance to Aviemore have been given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Premier Inn wants to build the 60-bedroom facility on land which has been vacant since the closure of a filling station on the site over a decade ago.
Parent company Whitbread said it would invest Â£6.5m in the project.
Members of the Cairngorms National Park Authority's planning committee has granted Whitbread permission to build the hotel.
The committee has also approved plans for eight houses on a site west of Newtonmore. Two of the properties are to be affordable homes.
