A suicide bomber targeted the humanitarian organisation Care in the Shar-e-Naw area and gunmen then stormed the building, Tolo News TV reported.
Police were exchanging fire with the attackers, the report added.
Earlier, a series of blasts left at least 24 people dead and nearly 100 others wounded.
An army general and two senior police officers were among the dead from those attacks, a ministry of defence spokesperson told the BBC.
The Taliban, who have carried out frequent attacks in Kabul, said they were responsible for the blasts.
In the latest incident, a car bomb was detonated at the gate of the compound, officials say.
A police spokesman told the BBC that six other people were wounded, and that 31 people have been rescued from the building.
Traffic was blocked in several parts of the city and schools were closed.
