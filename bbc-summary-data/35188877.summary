The property in Penn Road completely collapsed in the blast, suspected to have been caused by a gas leak.
The woman, who was trapped for about two hours, suffered cuts, bruises and a broken ankle and was taken to hospital.
A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said the woman was "extraordinarily lucky" not to have been seriously hurt.
One man who lives nearby said: "Our house just shook - we woke up immediately and my partner was screaming and we thought there was something a lot closer. We heard sirens going off for about 30 minutes.
"It took me a second to work out what had happened, I walked down to have a look, and I could see the two other houses - but the house wasn't there. It was just rubble."
Two neighbours and a taxi driver who witnessed the explosion as he was driving past, were treated for shock.
There is debris on the street, which has been shut between Lonsdale Road and Claremont Road.
Emergency services advised the public to avoid the area.
