John Stones should stay at Everton, Romelu Lukaku says

Everton striker Romelu Lukaku believes team-mate John Stones is "on to a good thing" at Goodison Park and should not leave to join Chelsea.

Central defender Stones, 21, is a target for Chelsea who have had bids of £20m and £26m rejected.
Lukaku - who left Chelsea for Everton - said: "John is in a good situation at a good club which believes in him.
"He needs to keep on doing what he's doing. He has the Euros coming up, so why go?"
Everton manager Roberto Martinez has repeatedly said England international Stones will not be sold this summer, but the former Barnsley defender continues to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge.
Lukaku joined Chelsea as an 18-year-old but failed to break through into the first team, playing just 10 times in the Premier League without scoring before joining Everton permanently last summer.
And the Belgian believes Stones, who will be hoping for a place in the England squad for Euro 2016 in France, should stay and play at Everton rather than risk a similar situation at the Premier League champions.
"John is playing and is learning a lot from [Everton and England defender] Phil Jagielka," Lukaku said.
"He's been here two years now but this is the year where he really needs to confirm he is the top player he can be.
"This club has massive potential, with the players we have and the ambition the manager has. He is in a good place. He's on to a good thing."
