The bird, thought to be nearly 20 years old, had been guarding her nest of six eggs in Perranporth when she was savaged by a dog, it is believed.
'Mrs Swan' and her mate 'Mr Swan' have been described as 'big friends of the community' and have made national headlines for holding up traffic.
Vets tried to treat her leg wound but she had to be put down on Sunday.

Julian Tredinnick who manages the boating lake where they nest, said reports from vets suggest the bird was attacked by a dog.
"She was sitting quite happily on the nest. The eggs were due to hatch in the next couple of weeks so everyone was all happy and expectant".
Mat Judge, who also works for Perranporth Gardens Charities, which manages the land, said: "She was a big friend of the community and a lot of people are really upset. The male is going to be lost".
He said they were contacting the RSPCA to see if another female could be introduced.
