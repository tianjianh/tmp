[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 2-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green started their debut season in the Football League by giving away a two-goal lead in their draw with Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christian Doidge bagged a brace in the final four minutes of the first half but sloppy and hesitant play after the break allowed the visitors to bag a share of the spoils through Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro and Jamal Campbell-Ryce.
It had been a tight affair until a swirling corner from Charlie Cooper was nodded in from close range by Doidge in the 41st minute and Rovers doubled their lead within two minutes as Doidge lifted Liam Noble's long ball over advancing keeper James Stephens.
Barnet gradually imposed themselves after the break and when Doidge gave away the ball in his own half, Campbell-Ryce was released down the left and his shot looped up off Bradley Collins for Akpa-Akpro to bundle into the empty net.
Then, a slick exchange with Jack Taylor led to Campbell-Ryce striding forward and squeezing into Collins's bottom right corner from 20 yards with 63 minutes played.
Both sides became increasingly ragged in pursuit of a winner but clear cut chances were at a premium and Taylor picked up a second booking for a late challenge in added time.
