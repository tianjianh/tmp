The 28-year-old, gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, will take part in the race over the longer distance on 22 April.
"It's no secret that I am going to spend a couple of years racing some different distances," said Brownlee.
"I'm really looking forward to preparing for some longer distance races and competing at them."
While the Olympic triathlon distance involves swimming 1.5km, cycling 40km and running 10km, the race Brownlee will attempt includes swimming 1.9km, cycling 90km and running a half-marathon (13.1 miles or 21.09km).
