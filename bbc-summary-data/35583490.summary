The France international, 30, joined Bordeaux until the end of the season on 1 February, having lost his place in the Gunners side to Hector Bellerin.
"It would have been magnificent," he said of a move to Old Trafford.
"I discussed it with the coach, who said that obviously he couldn't help out a rival."
Debuchy told French television channel Canal+: "Unfortunately it wasn't the case. Yes, I'm a little bit annoyed with him. It's his choice."
