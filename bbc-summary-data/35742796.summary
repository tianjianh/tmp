As Turkish and EU leaders gather in Brussels for an emergency summit on tackling Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War Two, the plight of some 13,000 migrants stranded on Greece's border with Macedonia continues to cause concern.
The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
