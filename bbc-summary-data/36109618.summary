[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hertha Berlin 0-2 Bayern Munich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bayern Munich need one more win to secure a fourth Bundesliga title in a row as Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa scored to beat Hertha Berlin.

Chile midfielder Vidal struck early in the second half when his 20-yard shot was deflected past keeper Thomas Kraft.
Brazil winger Costa made sure of victory with a spectacular shot into the top corner 11 minutes from the end.
That would have made Bayern champions had Borussia Dortmund lost, but Thomas Tuchel's side won 3-0 at Stuttgart.
Shinji Kagawa, Christian Pulisic and Henrik Mkhitaryan scored for Dortmund, who trail Bayern by seven points with three games each to play.
Vidal's goal brought a redemption of sorts, after he was criticised heavily for diving in midweek.
The midfielder dived to win a penalty as Bayern beat Werder Bremen 2-0 in their DFB-Pokal semi-final on Tuesday night, with the referee who awarded the kick later apologising for his error and even manager Pep Guardiola admitting that it was the wrong decision.
Guardiola rested captain Philipp Lahm with Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg trip to Atletico Madrid to consider, but still put out a strong side.
Hertha, seeking to qualify for next season's Champions League, threatened the leaders' goal only rarely, with former Bayern forward Mitchell Weiser seeing a first-half penalty appeal rejected as his shot struck Serdar Tasci on the arm.
After Vidal's opener, Kraft made a superb save to deny Robert Lewandowski, but was helpless to do anything about Costa's effort.
