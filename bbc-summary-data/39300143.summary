The Everton midfielder took part in training on Wednesday but is still regarded as a doubtful starter.
Wales have Ben Davies available after injury ruled the Tottenham defender out of November's draw with Serbia.
Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey are also fit having been sidelined.
The Republic will be without injured duo Daryl Murphy and Shane Duffy for their crucial World Cup qualifier against Wales.
Wes Hoolahan, Ciaran Clark and Harry Arter have withdrawn from the squad while Robbie Brady is suspended.
McCarthy has not played since 5 March because of a hamstring injury and was rated as extremely doubtful for the match at the Aviva Stadium.
He warmed up with the Irish squad in front of media at Abbotstown on Wednesday morning, and was able to continue for the closed part of the session.
Manager O'Neill and Everton boss Ronald Koeman have clashed on more than one occasion over the Republic's use of McCarthy on his return from injury.
Seamus Coleman, Shane Long and Jonathan Hayes, who sat out Tuesday's training, were all able to take a full part in Wednesday's session.
This is an enormous match for both sides, but the onus is on Wales to win as they aim to close the four-point gap between themselves in third place and the Republic of Ireland at the top of Group D.
Only the group winners secure automatic qualification for the 2018 World Cup, while the eight best of the nine second-placed teams must enter the play-offs.
With three wins and a draw from their opening four fixtures, the Republic of Ireland are in a commanding position.
They can afford to approach Friday's match with caution, knowing a draw would be enough to keep a sizeable gap between themselves and Wales, but the Republic's assistant manager, Roy Keane, is not entertaining that notion.
Asked whether his team's injuries would mean they play more defensively, his response was a flat: "No."
He added: "I know from working with the manager and the staff and the group of players we have, if you think our mindset going into the game on Friday night at the Aviva is a draw, then you are sadly mistaken.
"We're here to win."
For Wales, meanwhile, this is being billed as a match they must win.
After exceeding all expectations by reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016, they entered this qualifying campaign as top seeds in Group D.
With a trip to second-placed Serbia to come in June, it would seem Chris Coleman's side would need at least four points from these two games to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for next year's tournament in Russia.
Coleman, however, is reluctant to declare Friday's encounter in Dublin a "must-win" match for his team.
"People will look at this and say it's do or die but I don't see that," he said.
"All I see is a huge challenge, a great game for us. We've always wanted to be involved in games like this, when the pressure is on for all the right reasons, which means we're competing at the right end as opposed to halfway into it and competing for nothing, competing for pride. That's not the case.
"We can't control how the game is billed by everybody else - everybody will sensationalise it. We will prepare as we always prepare.
"Once we start talking about points and the result, that's for everyone else to talk about. We need to concentrate on our performance and what we need to do to meet this challenge. That's all we've ever done and that's what we'll do."
