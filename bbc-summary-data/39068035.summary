Two men admit shopkeeper machete attack in Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have admitted a machete attack on a shopkeeper during an attempted robbery in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam McMeechan and David Allan assaulted Tahir Ahmed at his A&A newsagents in South Trinity Road on 12 August 2016 and tried to steal cash.
McMeechan, 23, pleaded guilty to assault to severe injury, permanent disfigurement and attempted robbery.
Allan, 50, pleaded guilty to assault and attempted robbery at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The court heard Mr Ahmed, 54, fought off machete-wielding McMeechan before the pair fled.
The shopkeeper was treated in hospital for a fractured skull and various lacerations to his head.
Mr Ahmed had 14 staples put into wounds to his forehead and temple and was kept in hospital for 48 hours.
He was left with permanent scarring following the attack.
Police who arrived at the shop found items on the floor along with spatters of blood. The abandoned weapon was also recovered along with a scarf.
The scarf was found to have DNA from the mother of McMeechan, who was the former partner of Allan.
Mr McGuire said CCTV footage placed the two accused together in Edinburgh that day and analysis of McMeechan's phone showed it had been in the vicinity of the crime scene at the time of the offence.
Lord Boyd of Duncansby called for background reports ahead of sentencing next month and remanded the men in custody.
