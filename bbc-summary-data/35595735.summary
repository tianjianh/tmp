Six Nations 2016: Ollie Devoto joins England as Alex Goode cover

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ollie Devoto will train with England as injury cover for Alex Goode before the Six Nations match against Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saracens full-back Goode, who has a minor ankle injury, is England's only concern following the 40-9 win over Italy on Sunday.
After winning their first two games, England now have a weekend off before facing Ireland on 27 February.
Bath back Devoto, 22, is uncapped, but was an unused replacement in the opening win against Scotland.
He was dropped from the 23-man match squad against Italy when head coach Eddie Jones opted for a six-two split between forwards and backs among the replacements, with Maro Itoje coming on to the bench and subsequently winning his first cap.
England training squad:
Backs: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Ollie Devoto (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath), Alex Goode (Saracens), Jonathan Joseph (Bath), Jack Nowell (Exeter), Anthony Watson (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester).
Forwards: Dan Cole (Leicester), Jack Clifford (Harlequins), Jamie George (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), Paul Hill (Northampton), Maro Itoje (Saracens), George Kruis (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens).
