Britain's leading female jockey is quitting the sport at the end of the Flat racing season in November.
The 32-year-old Nottingham-born rider told BBC East Midlands Today: "The time has come when I am ready to take my foot off the gas.
"I know I cannot succeed as a jockey if I carry on trying to do it."
Turner is the first female British jockey to ride 100 winners in a year, has more than 750 winners during her career and has ridden two Group One winners at the highest level in Britain.
She added: "To succeed as a jockey, you have to go all out, have your foot on the gas constantly and can't take days off. You can't pick and choose.
"It's what I have been doing for the last 15 years but I definitely feel like I have made the right decision.
"It has gone so fast. When I stop and look back it will be like 'that was a blur'."
Turner, who is based in Newmarket, will start working with the At The Races television channel before deciding on her next step.
"I have a few different things and don't want to say too much but I will see what drives me," she added.
