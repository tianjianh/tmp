Fife-based brewer and distiller Eden Mill is launching its gin range in the United States for the first time.

The move follows a distribution deal struck with California-based ImpEx Distribution.
Eden Mill is targeting key markets such as Florida, California, New York and Texas.
The St Andrews-based firm's product range includes Hop Gin and Oak Gin, as well as its Original and Love gin brands.
International sales manager Daniel Sherry said: "It's exciting to be leading the gin category in Scotland and we're ecstatic about finally bringing our gin to fans across the US.
"Scotland has a rich history of distilling and, with a pool of talented distillers and the ideal climate for botanics, it is the perfect place to distil gin. We're moving from strength to strength."
Eden Mill said it also planned to take its whisky varieties to overseas markets, with the first single malt launching "in the near future".
