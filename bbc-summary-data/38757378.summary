The 22 year-old defender, who captained Boro's under-21 side but never played a first-team game, had been on loan at Kilmarnock this season where he made 10 league and cup appearances.
Burn is League One Rovers' fourth signing in the January transfer window.
"Jonny is another highly rated young, hungry, defender looking to establish himself in the Football League," boss Darrell Clarke told the club website.
He joins Joe Partington, Joe Lumley and Ryan Sweeney who have also arrived at the Memorial Stadium this month.
