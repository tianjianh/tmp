Lancashire and South Cumbria healthcare plan aims to plug £575m funding gap

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health services in Lancashire and South Cumbria will face a projected £575m funding gap by 2021 unless extensive changes are made, a NHS report said.

It said steps must be taken to improve people's health, make better use of existing resources, and unify health and social care provision.
Amanda Doyle, who led the work on the plan, said the region had some of the "poorest health in the country".
Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron criticised the report as "vague".
The plan aims to "tackle life expectancy inequality" and make care "more person-centred and coordinated", the report said.
It also intends to "relieve the financial pressures" on local NHS providers, partly by encouraging and supporting people to "assume greater responsibility for their own good health" and reducing "over reliance on acute hospital-based services".
The report suggests "enhancing" the role of charity and voluntary organisations in supporting mainstream services.
Changes to acute and specialist services have not been ruled out.
NHS England has split the country into 44 geographic areas - called 'footprints' - each of which must soon produce a sustainability and transformation plan (STP).
Liberal Democrat Farron said it was a "vague report - vaguer than most others around the country".
"The government has asked them to make cuts of a ludicrous proportion, over half a billion pounds in the next five years - impossible to do - and they are maybe playing for time or looking for other ways out and so their proposals are very thin," he said.
Lancashire and South Cumbria's STP covers five areas: Central Lancashire, West Lancashire, Pennine Lancashire, Fylde Coast and the Bay Health & Care Partners area.
The group overseeing this change, Healthier Lancashire and South Cumbria, is asking the public for their views.
