[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stones made a fast start and were ahead after only six minutes when Joe Pigott fired home from the edge of the box.
Daggers duo Scott Doe and Fejiri Okenabirhie had attempts saved as the first half drew to a close before Pigott saw a goal disallowed midway through the second period.
Bobby-Joe Taylor hit the bar with a free-kick but the visitors, who had Stuart Lewis sent off late on, sealed the points courtesy of Delano Sam-Yorke's goal five minutes from time.
