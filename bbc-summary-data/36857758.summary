John Mousinho: Burton Albion captain says Championship experience key

Burton Albion captain John Mousinho says recruiting players who have played in the Championship will be key to their prospects this season.

Three of the Brewers' summer signings - Kyle McFadzean, Chris O'Grady and Ben Turner - have second-tier experience.
Only three other members of their squad, Callum Reilly, Stephen Bywater and Tom Naylor, have featured for Championship teams in the past.
"The more we can add to the squad the better," Mousinho told BBC Radio Derby.
"We've lost a few defenders so we're looking to strengthen there and Championship and Premier League experience is going to be huge for us."
Nigel Clough's side clinched a second successive promotion last season after finishing second in League One - reaching the second tier of English football for the first time in their history.
"We've added a few bits of real experience from the Championship and that bodes well. If you look at players who come in and they have got that experience, it's brilliant to learn from as well," Mousinho continued.
"There are always going to be things we can improve on but as things get closer to the start of the season and we start to prepare then we're going to look at sharpening our game."
