Calais strike: How roads, ferries and trains are affected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strike, which forced the suspension of Channel Tunnel services and led hundreds of migrants to try to board UK-bound lorries, is now over, but some travel delays continue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here is the latest situation on the roads, trains and ferries.
M20 in Kent is closed coast-bound between Junction 8 (A20 Maidstone Services) and Junction 9 (A20, Ashford North) because of Operation Stack Phase 2. Non-commercial traffic is being diverted on to the A20 and lorries will be directed back on to the M20 to be parked. The Highways Agency says the M20 is expected to reopen from 08:00 BST on Wednesday.
