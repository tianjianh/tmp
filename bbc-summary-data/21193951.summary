[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terry Wright has announced his retirement after 30 years with the island's prison service.
He joined as a prison officer in 1983 after a career in the Royal Marine Commandos and was appointed governor in 1998.
David Matthews, the deputy governor, is due to take over as governor from 21 March.
He has been serving as the acting governor for at least the last six months having been deputy governor since September 2011.
His appointment followed a move from Northumberland where he was deputy governor at HMP Acklington and HMP Castington.
Mr Matthews said he was delighted to be taking on the "unique challenges" of running a prison facility on an island.
He said he aimed to work closely with partner services, such as probation, education and the Health and Social Services Department, to reduce "reoffending and subsequently the associated impact and cost of harm on the community once offenders are released".
