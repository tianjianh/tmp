[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 0-0 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester had a goal ruled out and also struck the woodwork in a goalless draw with Aldershot in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts made an encouraging start at the EBB Stadium as Matt McClure set up a chance for Jake Gallagher, but his shot comfortably cleared the crossbar.
Chester responded with a quick counter-attack, Elliott Durrell pulling his shot wide, before they had a goal chalked off when Kane Richards was penalised for a foul in the 13th minute.
The visitors pushed forward again and Ryan Lloyd was unfortunate to see his long-range effort hit the woodwork, while Aldershot went close early in the second period when Scott Rendell was denied by Liam Roberts.
