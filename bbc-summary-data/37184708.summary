Sessi D'Almeida: Barnsley midfielder to miss rest of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnsley midfielder Sessi D'Almeida will miss the rest of the season after tearing his anterior cruciate knee ligament playing for the under-23 team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
D'Almeida had played three league games for the Tykes since signing for the Championship side on 11 August following a successful trial spell.
The 20-year-old has previously played for Paris St-Germain and Bordeaux.
Meanwhile, striker Sam Winnall is fit after a hamstring injury which kept him out of Barnsley's last four games.
