Subsea firm CIE Well Control Ltd calls in administrators

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another engineering firm working in Aberdeen's oil and gas sector has collapsed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
CIE Well Control Ltd, a specialist in subsea and surface operations, has called in administrators from KPMG.
The move comes after orders fell away, in the wake of the oil price collapse.
Twenty-one people have been made redundant, while two staff have been kept on to handle the administration process. A buyer for the assets is being sought.
In May, more than 50 jobs were lost at Aberdeen engineering firm Enterprise Engineering Services after the company went into administration.
During the same month oil and gas shipping company Harkand Group collapsed, with the loss of more than 170 jobs in Aberdeen and London.
Administrators at Deloitte were called in after the company was hit by the prolonged fall in global oil prices.
