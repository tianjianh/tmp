"I took the decision to leave and end my political life in 2018," he told a congress of the ruling MPLA party.
In 2001, Mr Dos Santos said he would not seek office in the next presidential elections, which were then abolished under the new constitution.

Will Dos Santos really leave? By Angola analyst Justin Pearce
I remember Jose Eduardo dos Santos saying in 2001 that he was to step down.
That wasn't the only time he's spoken of an exit, but then allowed himself to be persuaded otherwise.
The problem is there is no obvious successor. Mr Dos Santos has run the MPLA in a manner that rules out any challenge to his leadership.
With the wealth he has amassed, if he relinquishes power it has to be to someone who will keep the business interests in the family.
Since 2011, attention has turned to Manuel Vicente, the state oil company boss who was hurriedly elevated to vice-president, then to Mr Dos Santos' son Jose Filomeno, and most recently to his wealthy businesswoman daughter Isabel.
None of these people will find favour with an increasingly restless public, or with MPLA old timers, who will resent a political newcomer being appointed simply because of connections with the veteran leader.
So two years hence, the president might again present himself as the least bad option. But, aged 73, he must know the question cannot be put off forever.
