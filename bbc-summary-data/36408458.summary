London 2012 bronze medallist Heath won the individual kayak K1 200 final while Belcher took the K1W 5000 title.
"Today just came from a little bit of experience in being more confident in myself," said Heath.
Meanwhile, Britain's Olympic champion Ed McKeever finished fifth in the K1 200 A final.
Belcher medal was the British team's fourth of the weekend, and she said: "I felt comfortable and strong and I'm really pleased with how I executed the race."
Heath has only raced the K1 200 internationally three times, but has won medals on each occasion. He took bronze last week in Duisburg, Germany, and a silver at the 2014 World Cup in Racice.
Heath was a bronze medallist with Jonathan Schofield in Saturday's K2 200 final.
Both will now prepare for the European Championships in Moscow on 24-26 June before this summer's Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil.
