The Bolton comic will flick the switch at a concert on 29 August after a live performance from X Factor winners Little Mix.
The switch-on marks the start of a three-day festival of entertainment on the Tower Festival Headland including a Thriller Live show and a concert headlined by Rebecca Ferguson.
The promenade lights will shine nightly from 29 August to 9 November.
Graham Cain, Blackpool council cabinet member for tourism said: "Our switch-on line-up is now complete and it promises to be a fantastic night to launch the 2014 illuminations season."
Blackpool Illuminations attract more than 3m visitors to the resort each year to see the light display on the promenade that stretches for more than five miles.
