A sundial rescued from the demolished home of the author Enid Blyton has been restored.

Blyton's Green Hedges home in Beaconsfield was knocked down in 1973.
Nothing was heard of the sundial which once stood upon the eight-bedroom house for the next 40 years.
But in 2013, a retired builder contacted The Beaconsfield Society offering up the sundial he salvaged from the Green Hedges rubble four decades previously.
Kari Dorme, from the society, offered it to Bekonscot Model Village and Railway, the attraction for which Blyton - best known for her Famous Five and Secret Seven books - dedicated The Enchanted Village to.
The restoration has been carried out over the past two years with advice from the British Sundial Society.
Ms Dorme said: "I believe that the history and heritage of the town is very important and this sundial will be a lasting reminder of the connection between Enid Blyton and the town of Beaconsfield."
