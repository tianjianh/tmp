The 36-year-old from Queensland has also had his application for British citizenship accepted, meaning he will start this season as a domestic player.
Magoffin has taken 267 first-class wickets in 63 matches across four seasons for Sussex.
"It's great to commit again to Sussex," he said, "I've loved every minute."
Sussex will play in Division Two of the County Championship in 2016 following relegation last year.
"Hopefully we can put a good performance together as a group and move back up a division, as well as doing well in white-ball cricket," Magoffin added.
New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor will fill Magoffin's place as Sussex's overseas signing for the first half of the season. He will join up with the county for all formats following the World T20 in India.
