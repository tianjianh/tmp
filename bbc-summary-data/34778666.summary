Christopher Badman, 37, from Bridgend, had put the bag on his head before entering the Marine Hotel in Porthcawl during the town's Elvis festival.
Badman was seen on CCTV walking through the corridors but was disturbed by a guest after he broke into a bedroom and tried to steal a laptop. He was arrested a few days later.
Cardiff Crown Court heard the burglary took place on 27 September 2015 when the town was holding its biggest annual event, which sees Elvis impersonators from all around the world flock to the seaside resort.
Badman admitted burglary and was ordered to pay Â£900 costs and a Â£100 surcharge.
