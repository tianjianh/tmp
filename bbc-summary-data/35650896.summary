It uses sensors in its body and legs to balance, and even has sensors in its head that helps it work out its surroundings and avoid obstacles that could trip it up.
It walks a lot like a human does, and can even get back up quickly when it's pushed over.
The robot has been developed by Boston Dynamics, which is part of Google, to be used by the armed forces.
The 175 centimetre tall robot is designed to operate both outdoors and inside buildings.
