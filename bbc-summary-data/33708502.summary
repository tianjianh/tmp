More than 300 people have tested positive for drink-driving in a month-long crackdown by Wales' four police forces.

Police also arrested 52 people across Wales under new drug-driving offences, which came into force in March.
Police carried out more than 12,000 breath tests during the June campaign.
In north Wales, a 36-year-old woman from Holywell, Flintshire was arrested after a reading of 125 micrograms, more than three times the legal limit.
In Wales and England, the alcohol limit for drivers is 80 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath or 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres of urine.
North Wales Police said it had carried out an intelligence-led operation, targeting people who frequently drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Ch Insp Darren Wareing from the force said: "We are seeing more arrests as a result of our intelligence-led operations, however, there is still a perception out there that drivers, particularly in rural areas, believe they have less chance of getting caught drunk or under the influence of drugs behind the wheel."
He added: "I would also like to personally thank each individual who contacted us during the campaign to give us the information we needed."
This is the first time the annual campaign has been able to target drug-drivers.
Police in England and Wales have been able to use "drugalyser" devices at the roadside since March.
The device can test for cocaine and cannabis from a saliva sample within three minutes.
Police can test for other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check.
Drivers face prosecution if they exceed limits set for the presence of eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs which are sometimes abused.
Motorists who test positive can face a criminal record, loss of their licence for at least a year and a fine of up to Â£5,000.
The prescription drugs that fall under the new regulations are morphine, diazepam, clonazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam and temazepam and methadone.
The illegal drugs include cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin.
