The 2016 Olympic Games open in Rio on 5 August. The BBC will be there to bring unrivalled coverage but we also want to hear from you.

Wherever you are in the world, we'd like you to share your reaction as you watch the men's 100m final and as you watch an event you are passionate about.
If you want to get involved, simply email your name, age and Twitter handle (if you have one) to Rio2016@bbc.co.uk and we'll send you more details on how to take part.
We'll feature some of your contributions across BBC News social channels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Your content could also appear on the BBC News website, on mobile and in BBC News programmes.
We look forward to hearing from you!
Here's one we've done before, if you need some inspiration.
