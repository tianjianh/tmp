Castle Howard's owners said the auction would help secure the "long-term future" of the estate.
Old Master paintings and 17th Century Italian furniture were among the lots available to the highest bidder.
Ferdinand Bol's Portrait of a Boy sold for £5.2m - almost twice its estimated price tag and a new record for the artist.
The Hon. Nicholas Howard said: "Over the centuries, our family has had the extraordinary good fortune to be the custodians of many great treasures.
"We very much hope that those that were sold today will bring as much joy to their new owners as they have to us and to our ancestors.
"Their sale will help us to secure the future of Castle Howard as it moves into its fourth century."
Castle Howard was designed in 1699 and was the setting for the 1981 TV series Brideshead Revisited.
The house sits in an 8,800-acre estate in the Howardian Hills, north of York. The estate has more than 200 listed buildings and monuments.
