A post-mortem examination found Mr Siddall, a PE teacher, died from a head injury.
Horrobin was seen landing a single punch to Lewis's head inside the VDKA bar at around 23:00 GMT on 11 August.
CCTV and witness accounts led police and prosecutors to believe the assault was unprovoked.
Det Ch Insp Steve Handley said: "Lewis was killed as the result of an unprovoked and senseless act of violence when he was simply out enjoying himself with some friends.
"This was an avoidable death and shows the devastating effect one punch can have on the lives of the victim, their family and friends."
"This could have been entirely avoided, had Horrobin made a different decision not to lash out with his fists, Lewis would still be alive and well today."
