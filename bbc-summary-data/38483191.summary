Sean Williams was hit in Lakefield Road, Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, on Thursday afternoon.
The car driver was treated for shock in hospital and was helping police with their investigations. The boy was taken to hospital but died of his injuries.
Sean's parents Elaine and Andrew said he would be "truly missed".
In a statement released by West Midlands Police, they said: "To all family and friendsâ€¦thank you for your support.
"This is the picture we would like you all to remember of our baby boy. Anyone who knew Sean would know he was an amazing, intelligent, polite, loving little boy."
Sgt Alan Wood, from the regional Collision Investigation Unit, said his team still needed to trace witnesses, in particular the driver of a car waiting at traffic lights at the time of the collision.
He said: "It was a small, light-coloured vehicle stationary at the traffic light junction, in the right filter lane heading from Lakefield Road turning right into March End Road."
