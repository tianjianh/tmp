Young people facing postcode lottery to get work experience

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Employers in some parts of the UK are almost twice as likely to offer work experience compared to other areas of the country.

A survey of 18,000 businesses shows one in five says nothing could persuade them to offer work experience.
That's despite two thirds claiming experience is vital when it comes to hiring new staff.
The survey was carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, a government-funded organisation.
It says the problem has left many young people trapped in a cycle where they can't get a job without experience but can't get the experience to get a job.
Unemployment may be gradually falling but, of almost 2 million people in the UK without a job, 40% are under 25.
Dame Fiona Kendrick is the chief executive of Nestle UK and Ireland and is one of the authors behind this report.
"The areas where employers are least likely to offer any form of experience of the workplace are also where youth unemployment is high," she says.
Areas with the fewest opportunities for work experience include Hull and Northern Lincolnshire, Leicester, Sheffield and Cumbria.
Liverpool, Birmingham and Solihull all have a much higher number of businesses offering experience and also happen to have significantly lower levels of youth unemployment.
Almost 40% of employers who didn't offer work experience said it was because they didn't have any suitable roles to offer.
A quarter said they didn't have the time or resources.
Employers also reveal that they prefer to recruit young workers via word-of-mouth recommendations, meaning young people without connections are at a disadvantage.
Michael Davis is the chief executive of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills.
He says: "Young people are already facing increasingly difficult conditions finding their way into the workplace, and the news that these factors can be further compounded based simply on location is disheartening."
The organisation is calling for all schools and colleges in the UK to set up links with at least one local business.
UK employers are also being asked to take the lead in a new government-sponsored careers company which aims to build links between schools and businesses.
In response, Employment Minister Esther McVey told Newsbeat: "This Government is giving young people the experience they need to get the job they want and, having increased employment by 1.75m since 2010, that's what we'll continue to do.
"We've hugely expanded our work experience scheme, helping employers across the country offer almost a quarter of a million work experience placements.
"We are also working with businesses to help them create their own training and work experience schemes so more people get the chance to get their foot in the door to the career they want."
