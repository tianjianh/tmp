The 33-year-old spent 10 years with the station working as a reporter, Derby County commentator and breakfast show presenter.
His mum Alison said she was amazed and humbled at the honour.
It comes a day after the Colin Bloomfield sun shade was revealed at Alvaston Park in Derby.
Mrs Bloomfield unveiled the renamed Bloomfield House in a short ceremony a year to the day that Colin died at a Shrewsbury hospice.

His death came just 11 months after his father, former BBC Radio Shropshire editor Lawrie Bloomfield, died.
Speaking as she cut the ribbon, Mrs Bloomfield said: "That is just amazing, I think I'm going to cry.
"His father would be so proud of him. This is Colin's accolade and with bells on.
"I've felt the pressure but it's been helped by the support of compassionate Derbyshire people.
"All I can say is rest in peace. Thank you all for caring."
Many listeners were touched by Colin's openness and optimism about his diagnosis for stage four melanoma.
Before he died, he put his name to the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal, which has since raised more than Â£170,000.
The funds help to teach tens of thousands of school children about the dangers of the sun with the Sun Safe Schools programme.
It also paid for the sun shade in Alvaston as well as the UK's first public UV sun meter  - called the Colin Bloomfield Sun Meter - in Markeaton Park.
A second sun shade and UV meter is also being installed in West Park, Long Eaton, Derbyshire, this summer.
