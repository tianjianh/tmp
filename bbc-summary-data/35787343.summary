CCTV shows the white Ford Kuga pull up outside the house on Stoneymore Drive in Castle Bromwich, near Solihull.
Two men jump out and demand the keys to the 57-year-old's Audi Q7. When he refused they hit him with metal batons.
The man was not seriously injured, West Midlands Police said. CCTV of the carjacking suspects has been released in a bid to track them down.
The footage shows the man being chased by the attackers and being repeatedly hit on the ground.
One of the carjackers manages to get the Audi keys and make off in it, while his accomplice takes off in the Ford Kuga.
The CCTV shows the victim's wife trying to move her car to block the carjacker's get away route - but to no avail.
The attack happened just after the man kissed his wife goodbye at 09:00 GMT on 25 February.
