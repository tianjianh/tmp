The League One club, 23rd in the table, have also brought in much-travelled Crystal Palace striker Freddie Ladapo, 23, on loan for the rest of the season.
The former Colchester United, Nuneaton, Kidderminster Harriers and Margate forward spent the first half of this season at Town's rivals Oldham.
He became the day's second signing after the arrival of winger Rodman, 29.
The addition of loan signing Ladapo, who scored twice in 17 league appearances for Oldham, and Rodman, for an undisclosed fee, follows Hartlepool defender Toto Nsiala's New Year's Day arrival.
All three players could make their debuts for Shrewsbury, who lost all three of their matches over the festive period, in Saturday's trip to Swindon Town.
Town have confirmed that striker Ivan Toney has been allowed to return to Newcastle United following the end of his six-month loan, during which he scored seven times.
BBC Radio Shropshire match summariser Mark Elliott
"At 29 and having never played in League One, Paul Hurst will be hoping that Alex Rodman is a late developer with untapped potential. He's tall, which will help a team sorely lacking in height, but he will have to show that he has the technical ability to make the step-up.
"Town have a one-dimensional midfield, full of energetic destroyers with little creativity. If Rodman can protect the ball and bring imagination, he'll be a good addition to a team which struggles to provide forwards with enough service of any real quality. His goal record, particularly in non-league football, suggests he could add a much-needed threat from wide areas but this is a gamble.
"Freddie Ladapo is another player who has performed well outside the Football League. That earned a move to Crystal Palace at the ripe old age of 23 and he's been on loan at Oldham this season. That League One experience should see him well placed to hit the ground running. With Toto Nsiala already on board, much rests on the Shrewsbury manager's ability to unearth rough diamonds from a lower league game he knows so well."
