Police were alerted to a disturbance at the house, in the East Renfrewshire town's Beech Avenue, at about 00:00.
It was later confirmed that 39-year-old Xin Xin Liu had died and officers were following a definite line of inquiry.
The man who has been arrested is expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court on Thursday.
Forensic teams remain at the house, which has been cordoned off, and door-to-door inquiries are under way.
People in the affluent suburb, 10 miles south of Glasgow, have spoken of their shock.
BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke, who was at the scene, said: "Police say that they were called around midnight last night and that the lady who lived at this house had been attacked in her own home and died from her injuries.
"Police have not named the lady who has died but we understand that she is a young mother with two primary aged children and she has lived at this address for some years with her husband."
Aileen Clarke also spoke to a number of local people in the area who said they were shocked and saddened to hear of the woman's death.
