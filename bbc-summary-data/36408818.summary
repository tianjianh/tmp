England 27-13 Wales: George Ford 'outstanding' says Eddie Jones

England head coach Eddie Jones believes fly-half George Ford was "outstanding" in Sunday's win against Wales, despite an erratic kicking performance.

Ford, 23, missed six of his seven attempts at the posts in the 27-13 victory at Twickenham.
"Everyone has a bad day missing goal kicks - Tiger Woods misses putts," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It's just one of those things. I think he played exceptionally well for us. I thought he was outstanding."
Ford, who has started at 10 in every one of the six games overseen by Jones, was on kicking duties because of Owen Farrell's absence.
Saracens fly-half Farrell, 24, who has been used at centre for England by Jones, was unavailable to face Wales because he featured in his club's Premiership final win over Exeter on Saturday.
This was Ford's first game since his father Mike was sacked as director of rugby at Bath - the club the younger Ford plays for.
"I was very impressed with him. He's had a tough period of time," said Australian Jones.
"People don't realise how difficult it has been. To play with that aplomb today was a very good effort."
With Farrell absent and Manu Tuilagi injured, Northampton's Luther Burrell made a try-scoring start at inside centre and was rewarded on Monday morning with a call-up to the squad for next month's three-Test series against Australia.
Burrell, 28, was overlooked by Jones for this year's Grand Slam-winning Six Nations campaign.
"I need to sit down with the other coaches but he was certainly impressive today. He's probably got his name on the ticket," said Jones after the game.
Jones, whose side fly out to Australia on Tuesday, has won all six of his matches since replacing Stuart Lancaster as England boss, but will face a stern test of that undefeated record against the World Cup runners-up.
"We always looked at this as a four-Test series. We're 1-0 in the series - we want to come back 4-0," he said.
