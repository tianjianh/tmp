[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Brady, 33, accused Alistair Balfour, 68, of tampering with his car in a row in the Montgomerie Arms pub, in East Kilbride, on 8 June last year.
He punched Mr Balfour, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the floor. Mr Balfour died after suffering two skull fractures.
Brady was jailed after admitting a charge of culpable homicide.
Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told Brady that he had no other option but to imprison him.
He added: "Your conduct resulted in a man losing his life. I must impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of this offence."
Lord Turnbull also told Brady that if he had not pleaded guilty, he would have been jailed for six years.
A previous hearing at the High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr Balfour had been married for 47 years and had an extra-marital affair with Brady's mother, which ended in bad terms on Christmas Day 2012.
As a result of this, Brady and Mr Balfour fell out.
They reported each other to the police for vandalism and breach of the peace, but no action was taken because of insufficient evidence.
The court heard that Brady, who is from East Kilbride, entered the pub and accused Mr Balfour of putting sugar in the tank of his car.
He became aggressive and asked if they would take the matter outside.
As Mr Balfour put his hands in his pockets, Brady hit him with a single punch. He fell backwards and lay motionless on the floor.
The court heard that Mr Balfour suffered two fractures to his skull, bruising to his mouth and two black eyes. The cause of death was a head injury.
