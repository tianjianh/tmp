[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Royal British Legion gathered as the Last Post was sounded at the Milford Haven war memorial.
One of the members lost a great uncle at Gallipoli who was from Haverfordwest.
Events are being held in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey to remember those who fought.
Saturday marks the centenary of the landing of Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzacs) at Gallipoli on Anzac Day.
After a failed naval attack, the Allies tried to capture Constantinople (now Istanbul) via the Gallipoli peninsula by land assault, which started at dawn on 25 April, 1915.
The invasion eventually failed, with the Allied forces unable to advance more than a few miles.
A bloody stalemate ensued which lasted until Allied troops evacuated the peninsula in January 1916.
