Perfect Illusion is the lead single from the singer's forthcoming album Joanne, which is released next month.
The top four singles this week remained unchanged, with Closer by Chainsmokers holding the number one spot.
In contrast, the top four albums this week are all new entries - with Bastille's Wild World debuting at number one.
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds were placed second with Skeleton Tree, while Live at the Hollywood Bowl by The Beatles debuted at number three.
The Fab Four's album was released to coincide with the new documentary The Beatles: Eight Days A Week.
Meat Loaf's Braver Than We Are entered the album chart at number four, while last week's number one - Cartwheels by Ward Thomas - dropped to number five.
New entries on this week's singles chart include Say You Won't Let Go by former X Factor winner James Arthur.
It marks Arthur's first appearance on the singles chart since 2013, when two singles from his debut self-titled debut album made the top 20.
