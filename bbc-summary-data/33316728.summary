'Threatening behaviour' at Swansea's School of Management

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fresh allegations of threatening and sexist behaviour have been made against a father and son at Swansea University's School of Management.

The claims against professors Nigel and Niall Piercy came to light during a staff forum set up by the university.
Staff claimed to have been publicly humiliated, verbally and physically intimidated, and "told to leave if they didn't like it".
Both men have been asked to comment but neither has responded.
In staff forum meetings with university representatives, employees claimed both Dean Prof Nigel Piercy and Pro-dean Prof Niall Piercy had reduced staff to tears on many occasions.
They also spoke about how alleged sexist comments had been used in career development reviews and claimed the university's family-friendly policies had been ignored by the two men.
BBC Wales has previously spoken to past and present members of the school's teaching staff who questioned why the university's senior management team had not stepped in sooner.
The issue was raised again in the staff forums, with some workers claiming the university's senior management team had been "deafening in its silence" about what was going on at the school.
Although the majority of those at the meetings were critical of the professors, two members were positive.
One said staff had created a "them and us" atmosphere among a culture of suspicion, while another felt some employees were unwarrantedly critical of both men.
In a statement, Swansea University said it had robust anti-harassment and anti-bullying policies in place.
"Any concerns raised internally about the School of Management are being dealt with by the University Registrar," a spokesman added.
