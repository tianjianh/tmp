Tory MP Guto Bebb tells Commons website 'bullied' people

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb has claimed in the House of Commons the business partner of fellow north Wales Tory David Jones is behind a blog that has "harassed, abused and bullied" people.

Mr Bebb said a private investigator had traced the "Thoughts of Oscar" blog to a home in Deganwy and the office of David Jones Solicitors in Llandudno.
Clwyd West MP Mr Jones said he would issue a statement on Wednesday.
The website has since been closed.
Mr Bebb said it was "a rather vicious and nasty local blog", with an added interest in politics that had targeted individuals.
Opening a short debate in the Commons, Mr Bebb named local businessman Nigel Roberts and Dylan Moore, who is a director of David Jones Solicitors.
Mr Bebb said he would not name a third person identified by the private investigator.
Mr Roberts said on the blog on Tuesday that he was its sole contributor.
Former Welsh Secretary Mr Jones and Mr Moore are expected to give their response to the claims on Wednesday.
