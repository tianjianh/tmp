They have appealed for information.
The suspect made off towards the nearby Tesco store.
Det Sgt Martin McKendrick said: "We are checking CCTV at the moment to see whether he had been in the vicinity of the bank prior to the robbery but in meantime would ask anyone who was in the area at the time of the robbery - who may have seen him loitering or acting suspiciously, to contact police.
"Thankfully, no one was injured but it was a very frightening experience for the staff involved who are both women, aged 30 and 57 years, and it is imperative that we catch him."
