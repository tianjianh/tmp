[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A clothing firm which supplied BHS has gone out of business, blaming the collapse of the high street store.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derbyshire based Courtaulds, which made Pretty Polly tights, went into administration with the loss of 350 jobs.
CUK Clothing, which merged with Courtaulds in 2006, also went into administration.
They traded under the Pretty Polly brand and also made private-label clothing for retailers.
The company employed 380 staff at its Belper and London sites making hosiery, lingerie, formal and casual wear, jackets and coats for UK and interational stores.
Administrators RSM Restructuring Advisory said BHS was a major customer.
Dilip Dattani said: "The administration of BHS has added to the challenge of operating within a fiercely competitive market for seasonal products.
"This has left the directors with little choice but to place the companies into administration.
"Regrettably, we have been forced to make 350 employees redundant to align with the current order book, and we are assisting them with their claims to the Redundancy Payments Service."
Lisa Cheetham, 55, from Belper, worked at the company for 39 years but was told she had lost her job on Wednesday afternoon.
"It's awful, absolutely devastating," she said. "We've all been crying. There are people who have worked here a long time, it's a family company. I've got two sisters who work here."
BHS filed for administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs under threat.
