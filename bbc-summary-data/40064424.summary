Manchester attack: Hate crime 'doubles' after incident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A surge in the number of hate crimes reported to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) followed in the wake of Monday's attack, the force has said.

A total of 56 hate crimes were recorded by GMP on Wednesday, a significant rise on the 28 reported on Monday.
Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the force could not make a "direct link" to the Manchester Arena bombing in which 22 people died, seven of them children.
But he added it was "monitoring" the situation.
Mr Hopkins said: "Sadly we've seen an increase in hate incidents since the bomb from 28 on Monday, which is our normal average a day, through to 56 on Wednesday."
A copy of a two-hourly GMP log of reported hate crimes on Wednesday, seen by the BBC, included the following incidents relating to race or religion:
Salman Abedi, a British-born Muslim from a Libyan family, blew himself up, killing 22 men, women and children, as people were leaving an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night.
A total of 66 people remain in hospital, with 23 in critical care.
It was feared the attack might spark reprisals against Muslim people, but Mr Hopkins said the city had largely pulled together in the aftermath.
"We've seen that compassion but it is important that we continue to stand together here in Greater Manchester, particularly standing together against some of the hate-filled views that we have seen from a very small minority of the community that have no place here."
He added: "I have sent a personal message out to all the faith leaders and places of worship today and have thanked them for the support they have shown and stressed that hate crime will not be tolerated."
"It is important that people report any incidents so that they can be investigated and we can support victims and their families."
Mohammed Ullah, muslim chaplain at Manchester Metropolitan University, said he was not surprised at the figures quoted by the chief constable.
"These are just the reported figures, other people are very scared to talk," he said.
