Oxford United manager Michael Appleton has called for supporters not to panic about an absence of signings so far.

Appleton says progress is being made behind the scenes on a number of deals ahead of his side's campaign next season in League One.
"A lot of things have been agreed that can't be made public yet out of respect for the other football clubs," he said.
United have seen striker Danny Hylton depart for Luton after he rejected a new deal at the Kassam Stadium.
Appleton, who also guided Oxford to the Football League Trophy final last season, is staying calm on the progress of building a squad ahead of August.
"I'm very, very relaxed," he told BBC Radio Oxford. "We've got some fantastic talent that will be here at the club come pre-season.
"I've spoken to a lot of clubs and players over recent weeks and I've pitched what we can do for certain players."

The former Portsmouth, Blackburn and Blackpool manager hinted some of the deals could involve season-long loans.
"I think some of the bigger clubs are starting to recognise Oxford is a great platform for coming in and going back to their clubs and doing ever so well," Appleton added.
"They see it as a fantastic opportunity for some of their young players to showcase their skills and return a better player and a better person."
