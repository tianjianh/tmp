After news that a Scots nurse was being treated for the virus, Hopkins wrote: "Sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn't cricket."
Another tweet said: "Glaswegian ebola patient moved to London's Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville?"
Police confirmed they were looking into an unspecified number of complaints.
Det Insp Glyn Roberts, of Police Scotland, said: "We have received a number of complaints regarding remarks made on Twitter.
"Inquiries are ongoing into the nature of these tweets and to establish any potential criminality.
"Police Scotland will thoroughly investigate any reports of offensive or criminal behaviour online and anyone found to be responsible will be robustly dealt with."
Hopkins' comments came after it emerged that the nurse, who volunteered to help Save the Children in the fight against Ebola, was diagnosed on her return from Sierra Leone.
Pauline Cafferkey, a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire, has been receiving specialist treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.
A message posted on Police Scotland's Twitter feed on Tuesday stated: "Please be aware that we will continue to monitor comments on social media and any offensive comments will be investigated."
More than 11,000 people have signed an online petition on the change.org website for Hopkins to be charged over the "racist tweets" regarding Scotland.
