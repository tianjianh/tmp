Crowds gathered at the waterfront to watch the Queen Mary 2 appear on the horizon at about 09:00 BST.
The three queens are paying homage to the city which was once home to the company's headquarters to mark Cunard's 175th anniversary
The Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Victoria liners will arrive on Monday before all three sail down the Mersey.
The Queen Mary 2 is a classic black and white luxury liner, famous for her red and black funnels.
At Liverpool's waterfront one excited spectator said: "It's absolutely amazing and I think she's a beautiful ship, very traditional looking, different to the new cruise liners.
Another added: "It's a wonderful day for Liverpool and it's a wonderful day for us all to celebrate being a Liverpudlian."
The three ships are also due to feature in celebrations at the start of July, when Queen Mary 2 will replicate the line's first transatlantic voyage.
Cunard was founded in 1840, with Sir Samuel Cunard's mail steamship RMS Britannia beginning its transatlantic service to Halifax and Boston from Liverpool.
The shipping company moved its headquarters from Liverpool to Southampton in 1965.
An exhibition celebrating the liner era has been on display in Southampton to mark the anniversary.
