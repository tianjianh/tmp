[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Holloway began his second spell in charge of Queens Park Rangers with a win as his side beat 10-man Norwich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Canaries left-back Martin Olsson saw red in the second minute for handling on the goalline but Tjaronn Chery sent the subsequent penalty wide.
Conor Washington gave the QPR the lead midway through the first half and Sebastian Polter added a second.
Steven Naismith pulled a goal back to set up a tense finale but the visitors slipped to a fourth consecutive defeat.
Alex Neil's Norwich, relegated from the Premier League last season, were second in the table a month ago but a five-match winless streak has seen them slip to sixth in the Championship.
Holloway, who managed QPR between 2001 and 2006, returned to Loftus Road following the dismissal of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and saw his team make a bright start.
Olsson's early dismissal handed the hosts the upper hand and, after Chery screwed his spot-kick wide, Rangers took the lead through a close-range finish from Northern Ireland international Washington.
Norwich winger Jacob Murphy hit the crossbar in the second half and then set up Naismith, whose header gave the visitors hope of a comeback.
However, City were unable to find a late equaliser, allowing Holloway to end Rangers' run of three games without a win on his return to west London.
QPR manager Ian Holloway:  "We got a lot of things wrong and I could see a lack of belief after Norwich scored. We stopped passing and using the extra man.
"But I was looking for character and I know we have it. Long may that continue.
"To win games at this level you always need a bit of luck. All teams will have minutes (of pressure) no matter how many players they have on the pitch."
Norwich manager Alex Neil:  "The fans will be frustrated and annoyed and I understand that. My job is to win games. All I can say is that I am working extremely hard to turn things around and so are the players.
"I thought they worked extremely hard and kept going until the last minute. We did better in the second half.
"You're looking to stick to the task and not concede sloppy goals, and then as the game goes on maybe quieten the crowd. But once we conceded that goal it's difficult.
"The two goals we conceded in the first half made it too easy for QPR."
