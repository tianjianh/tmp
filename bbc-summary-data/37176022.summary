Arjo Huntleigh: Belfast man jailed on £1m fraud charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Belfast man who assisted his wife in a £1m fraud on her employers has been jailed for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Noel Savage, 60, of Kincora Mews -  who uses a wheelchair - was handed a two-year sentence on two charges.
Savage admitted entering into an arrangement to acquire criminal property, and converting criminal property.
His wife, Dolores Savage, was jailed earlier this year for her role in the fraud.
'No credible explanation'
The judge told Belfast Crown Court that none of the £1,044,000 stolen from medical equipment supplies company Arjo Huntleigh had been repaid.
He said there had been "no credible explanation whatsoever" given by Savage as to how the money was spent, apart from a claim it was used to clear household bills.
Savage was told he would spend a year in prison, followed by an additional year spent on supervised licence upon his release.
A previous court hearing was told that over a seven-year period from June 2006 to December 2013, Savage lodged hundreds of cheques into an account controlled by him which his wife Dolores stole from her employers.
Abuse of position
In total, 808 separate transactions were made.
Earlier this year, Dolores Savage, 59, also from Kincora Mews, pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position, and obtaining money transfers by deception.
She, too, is to serve a year in prison followed by a year on licence.
Dolores Savage carried out the fraud by making invoices identical to the ones on the company's computer system for a supplier.
The offending occurred when she worked in the accounts department of the firm's Belfast branch.
The court heard that the "prinicpal beneficiary of the dishonest conduct" was a company called Savnac, which was owned by the couple.
Prior to sentence being passed, the judge said he accepted that Samuel Savage suffered a number of serious and debilitating illnesses, and that he required the use of a wheelchair.
