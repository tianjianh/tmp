Two ex-inmates - Brendan Carey, 39, of Cathwaite, Paston, Peterborough, and Jamie Hill, 35, of Westwick Drive, Lincoln - were given unconditional bail following their appearance.
All are due before Leicester Crown Court on 6 June.
At the time, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said about 60 prisoners were involved in a "serious incident of indiscipline" at the jail.
All 120 prisoners on a wing had to be moved to other parts of the jail or other prisons.
Specially-trained prison officers were called in at about 23:00 BST before the situation was brought under control in the early hours of the following day.
