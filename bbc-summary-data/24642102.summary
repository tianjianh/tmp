Around 6,000 premises in Montford Bridge, Montford, Bicton, Ford, Shrawardine, Pontesbury, Albrighton and Minsterly will benefit during the first phase, Shropshire Council said.
It is costing Â£24.6m, which is funded by the government, the council and BT.
Details on which other parts of the county will get superfast broadband are to be released in January.
The village of Albrighton (between Telford and Wolverhampton) and business premises in Harlescott will also get superfast broadband in the first phase.
About 1,300 kilometres (808 miles) of optical fibre will need to be laid for the project, which aims to connect 130,000 homes and businesses by the end of Spring 2016.
The plans had previously been in doubt, after Telford and Wrekin Council said it could not justify the spending required and pulled out of the joint project with Shropshire Council.
The government approved Shropshire's superfast broadband plans last year.
