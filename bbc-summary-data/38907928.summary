Number eight Safi N'Diaye was the chief architect of the Scots' downfall in La Rochelle, scoring the first try and creating three more.
Shannon Izar and Lenaig Corson followed her in crossing before half-time.
And the French cut loose after the break, with scrum-half Jade Le Pesc scoring twice, while Elodie Poublan, Elodie Guiglion, Caroline Ladagnous and Camille Cabalou also touched down.
Scotland's last Women's Six Nations victory came against France in 2010, but in the seven championship matches the teams have contested since, the Scots have mustered just three points, conceding 342.
They showed fleeting first-half glimpses of the greater structure and accuracy instilled by head coach Shade Munro, who took over last year, but failed to build any meaningful phase play in French territory.
Indeed, the visitors were utterly overwhelmed by the strength, dynamism and pace of the France carriers, with N'Diaye very much the fulcrum, and against a side of such physical prowess, missing so many tackles would inevitably prove catastrophic.
N'Diaye forced her way over in the corner to open the scoring, before a neat first-phase move led to Ladagnous taking out four Scottish defenders, brilliantly slipping the ball to full-back Jessy Tremouliere, who handed Izar an easy finish.
Corson blasted between two weak tackles on the Scottish 22 and cantered between Chloe Rollie and Megan Gaffney, neither of whom committed to tackling her, to score under the posts for France's third, Christelle Le Duff converting.
Scotland's faltering resistance was well and truly obliterated after the break, with virtually the entire second 40 minutes contested in away territory.
N'Diaye battered through a limp kick-chase and offloaded to Poublan, who slalomed through the cover to begin a procession of second-half scores, this one converted by Le Duff.
Guiglion sped in at the corner, before N'Diaye's ballast and a fantastic one-handed pass sent Le Pesc haring under the posts. That combination bore fruit again minutes later, when the hulking number eight released her scrum-half for another try. Both scores were converted by replacement Cabalou.
By now, this was little more than a training run for the French, with Ladagnous then Cabalou scoring the eighth and ninth tries, and the latter converting the last.
