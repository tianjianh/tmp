[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maz Pacheco tapped in her first Belles goal to make it 1-0, but the visitors levelled when Victoria Williams' shot went under goalkeeper Nicola Hobbs.
Abbey Holmes put Sunderland ahead before Kelly McDougall's volley made it three, after Hobbs saved a penalty.
Beth Mead then provided for Maddie Hill to smash home and round off the win.
Doncaster Rovers Belles boss Emma Coates:
"That was the story of our season, the results make it look like we're not improving as a group but mistakes cost you at this level and we're just making too many of them.
"The preparation throughout the week has been fantastic, the focus is there and the vibe in the changing room was great.
"We controlled the game for half an hour and I would never have said we'd lose 4-1 at that point."
"It shows how big mistakes are and how much they cost you but we have to keep working, we know we've got to start putting the ball in the back of the net."
Sunderland forward Beth Mead:
"We showed glimpses of Sunderland from last year. We worked hard, we worked for each other and showed plenty of character to get the win.
"A lot of people have spoke about second-season syndrome but that's a game we've deserved for a long time and now we have to kick on and have a good end to the season.
"It's nice to have that team back and hopefully we can take that to Notts County and win again."
