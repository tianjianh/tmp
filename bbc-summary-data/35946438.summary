The 17-year-old from Shropshire was given a caution for using threatening words, Thames Valley Police said.
The Northern Ireland player was hit in the face by the coin during the 20 February game against Reading after he went to give his shirt to a supporter.
It is thought no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence.
A spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police said: "A 17-year-old boy has been given a youth caution for using threatening or abusive words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour, likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
"No further action was taken in relation to throwing a missile on to a football playing area."
West Brom lost 3-1 to Championship side Reading in the fifth round tie at the Madejski Stadium.
Brunt, who has played 313 games for West Brom, said he was "disgusted" and "ashamed" at being hit.
Fans held a charity collection following the incident, raising Â£4,500.
