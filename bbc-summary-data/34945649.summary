Stampy - whose real name is Joseph Garrett - will give the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Christmas lecture at the city's Caird Hall on Monday.
The creator of the "Let's Play" videos for Minecraft and other games has more than 6.7m subscribers on his YouTube channel.
The lecture will be shown exclusively on BBC iPlayer next Thursday.
BBC Scotland said Minecraft fans would, for the first time, be able to see Stampy demonstrate how he makes his videos during a session with Dundee games entrepreneur Chris van der Kuyl.
Stampy will talk through the making of his Christmas special while giving the audience an insight into his life and a career which has seen him become one of the world's most popular YouTubers.
Mr van der Kuyl said Stampy was the "epitome of the 21st Century digital native" who would inspire audiences whatever their age.
"Stampy is an inspiration to a whole new generation of young people who can clearly see that future careers will rely on a unique blend of talents, creativity, technical and design skills that can be mastered by everyone," he added.
The RSE lecture will be shown as part of the BBC Make it Digital initiative to encourage digital creativity amongst young people.
