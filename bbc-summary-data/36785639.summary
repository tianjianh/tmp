They come following several criticisms of his leadership in recent days.
It is understood his decision to allow Independent Alliance ministers a free vote on a controversial fatal foetal abnormalities bill has caused problems in the party, RTÃ‰ reports.
There was also surprise when James Reilly, who lost his seat in February, was reappointed as deputy leader.
On Monday, one member of the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) Brendan Griffin, said it was his preference to see a change of leadership before the term resumes in autumn.
Now, questions are being asked about Mr Kenny's future in office.
Ministers and backbenchers have publicly endorsed the the taoiseach (Irish prime minister), but it is understood that many believe he will have to address the timeline of his departure sooner rather than later.
The party will gather later in Leinster House, for its weekly meeting, but there are no motions about the taoiseach on the agenda.
Mr Kenny is expected to address the issues raised over the past week, and it is understood his supporters, including senior ministers, will line up to endorse his position.
