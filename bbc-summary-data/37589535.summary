New Swansea manager Bob Bradley says he is not a "pioneer" for United States football, insisting his only aim is achieving success at the Welsh club.

Bradley, 58, is the first American to manage in the Premier League after replacing Francesco Guidolin on Monday.
"I'm not an American manager, I'm a football manager," he said. "There's not one person in Swansea who could care less about America.
"I am here to give everything for the fans and the club."
Former USA coach Bradley says he is expecting to have to work hard to win over Swansea's fans.
"I could not be more excited to get the chance," he said
"With football in the US, we have always known we needed to earn respect. It's the number one thing. For a club to have any chance of being successful, you have to have connection with supporters and community.

"The first professional head coach opportunity I had was at Chicago and when I went there the first thing I said was we needed to have a connection with the city. When you have that you have something.
"I know it's more important than anywhere here. If they're angry right now I get it. I have full respect for Francesco [Guidolin] and I will do anything to earn their respect.
"If you come to the Premier League you have to earn respect. No-one gets it on a plate. You get tested. In everything I've done in life, I've fully understood you have to earn respect."
Bradley feels Swansea's difficulties in the Premier League - where they are just a point outside the relegation zone - has been influenced by a tough fixture list.
"We had a very difficult list of fixtures at the start of the season, it's had some bad luck and lost a bit of confidence. Sometimes when that happens, things slip a little bit.
"I'm not coming in with a new book, but we have to be honest that certain things have to be better."
Bradley feels Swansea's biggest asset as a club is their unique relationship with its supporters. The Swans' Supporters' Trust own a 21% stake in the club.

"I already know enough about Swansea City Football Club," he said.
"I know I'm at a club with a soul, that has real passion and real fans.
"That for me is special, as well as being in the Premier League where you get challenged at the top level."
