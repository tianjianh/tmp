Portadown's season of misery continued as they were hammered 6-0 by impressive Dungannon Swifts in the Irish Premiership game at Stangmore Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahead of learning whether their 12-point deduction will remain in place, the Port were totally outclassed
Cliftonville moved up to fourth spot after David McDaid's 78th-minute goal secured a 1-0 win over Carrick Rangers.
Jamie McGonigle's last-gasp goal earned Coleraine a 2-1 win over Ards while Glentoran drew 1-1 with Ballinamallard.
After Joe McKinney's headed goal on 69 minutes had cancelled out Darren McCauley's volleyed goal for Coleraine on 65, Ards were reduced to 10 men on 78 minutes following Emmet Friars' second yellow card.
Coleraine's numerical advantage only increased their domination of the second period in Bangor and McGonigle's late winner moved the Bannsiders above Ards and Glenavon into fifth spot in the table.
Dungannon needed only 14 minutes to take the lead against the struggling Ports as Dougie Wilson curled in a delightful free-kick over the wall and past Christopher McGaughey from just outside the penalty area.
Wilson turned provider to cross for David Armstrong to double the lead with an unopposed header on 23 minutes and any chance of a Ports fightback was ended when Cormac Burke's angled shot beat McGaughey six minutes after the restart.
Terry Fitzpatrick headed the fourth on 55 and Portadown's horror show was completed as Chris Hegarty and Andy Mitchell added further goals in injury-time.
Cliftonville regrouped from their stunning defeat by Crusaders as McDaid's late winner meant a seventh straight league loss for Carrick Rangers.
Carrick's Adam Salley, Martin Murray and Nathan Hanley all hit the Cliftonville woodwork but the home side dominated for the most part as Rangers keeper Brian Neeson kept his team in the game with some superb saves.
Neeson made a brilliant triple stop to deny two Jude Winchester efforts and a Levi Ives shot in the first half and the Antrim man produced a number of other fine interventions before the interval.
While Murray and Hanley struck the woodwork in the second period, Cliftonville continued to dominate possession and the deadlock was finally broken 12 minutes from time as substitute McDaid scored his ninth goal of the season after good work by Stephen Garrett.
Ards and Coleraine both had chances in a closely-contested first half in Bangor.
Joe McKinney's brilliant early effort was tipped away by Bannsiders keeper Chris Johns and Ards' Ian Parkhill had two efforts blocked midway through the opening period before Jordan Allan headed Coleraine's best first-half chance straight at Aaron Hogg.
As Coleraine took control after half-time, Darren McCauley volleyed the Bannsiders into the lead on 65 minutes but Ards levelled within four minutes as McKinney's backpost header looped over the impressive Johns.
James McLaughlin's introduction boosted Coleraine in the second half and the Bannsiders were given further impetus as Ards centre-back Friars was sent off after picking up a second yellow card on 78.
Ards looked set to hold on for a point but McGonigle hit Coleraine's winner in injury-time to move the Bannsiders into fifth in the table.
Ballinamallard continued their impressive recent run as they earned a 1-1 draw against Glentoran at the Oval.
Glens striker Curtis Allen tested keeper James McGrath early on but after Ballinamallard's Johnny Lafferty hit the woodwork, Adam Lecky put the visitors ahead on 42 minutes with his sixth goal of the season as he shot through Elliott Morris' legs.
Lecky missed a chance to double the Fermanagh club's lead after the restart but as Glentoran began to dominate, Ciaran Caldwell levelled on 56 minutes and Chris Lavery and Jonathan Smith went close to snatching victory for the home side.
The draw keeps Ballinamallard ninth in the table - three points above the 10th placed Glens.
