The 32-year-old former Nottingham Forest, Coventry City and Kilmarmock midfielder was sidelined last season because of a knee injury.
Clingan will join NI team-mate Roy Carroll at Windsor Park while he also played alongside Blues boss David Healy for the international team.
"Sammy brings a wealth of experience - I'm delighted to sign him," said Healy.
Clingan, who has was won 39 caps for Northern Ireland, has also played for Wolves, Chesterfield and Doncaster Rovers.
He has not played since being released by Kilmarnock in May last year.
"He's a footballer I've always admired, having played with him at senior international level and he has also represented Northern Ireland at U17, U19 and U21 level," Healy told the club website.
"The signing of Sammy adds to the competition levels within the squad and I'm really looking forward to working with him in the season ahead.
"The experience he will add to our squad will be very welcome and I know he can't wait for the new season to start."
