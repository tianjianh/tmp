The 19-year-old started his career with Kidderminster Harriers, where he played under Mariners head of recruitment Gary Whild, before joining Blues in January 2016.
He is yet to make his competitive debut for the Championship side.
A groin strain is likely to prevent him from featuring for Grimsby against Stevenage on Saturday.
