Amtrak crash: Obama makes transport funding pledge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
President Obama has said the US must invest more in its infrastructure, in the wake of a train derailment in Philadelphia that claimed eight lives.

He said he was talking to congressional leaders to secure passage of a transport bill.
It's not yet clear what caused Amtrak Train 188 to crash on Tuesday night, leaving more than 200 people injured.
Investigators said on Thursday a camera showed it was speeding up for more than a minute before the crash.
The train was going 70mph (115km/h) about 65 seconds before the video went dark, said Robert Sumwalt of the National Transportation Safety Board.
But 16 seconds before the crash, its speed had increased to 100mph and then hit 106mph as it entered a 50mph zone.
Driver Brandon Bostian will be speaking to investigators in the coming days.
He has already said he has no recollection of the accident, and it is still unclear to those investigating why the train was speeding up.
Mr Sumwalt said they have found no faults with the track, signals or the train itself.
It had left Philadelphia's 30th Street Station on time, he added.

A speed control system called Positive Train Control had not yet been installed in that area, unlike other parts of the route along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
That has sparked a row in Congress about whether funding was an issue.
President Obama's comments came as he concluded a summit with Arab leaders near Washington.
He said: "We are a growing country with a growing economy and we need to invest in the infrastructure that keeps us that way, not just when something bad happens, like a bridge collapse or a train derailment. That's what great countries do."
Amtrak is a national publicly funded rail service, serving tens of millions of people every year.
Congress has only two weeks before federal funding for transport infrastructure expires, but the cash flow is likely to be temporarily extended.
Meanwhile, an Amtrak employee injured in the derailment has filed what appears to be the first lawsuit.
A lawyer representing Bruce Phillips, who was travelling as a passenger on the train, said he was still being treated in hospital for concussion and spinal injuries, and seeks damages in excess of $150,000.
