Walter Zenga: Wolves head coach 'can play two teams' with strengthened squad

Walter Zenga says his Wolves squad is now strong enough to be rotated on a regular basis after making 10 signings since his appointment as head coach.

"I can play one team on Tuesday and one on Saturday," Zenga told BBC WM.
Since Zenga replaced Kenny Jackett on 30 July, seven days before the start of the new league season, Wolves' new Chinese owners have invested heavily.
"It's a long, competitive season. It is not just the seven games we have coming up in the space of 22 days," he added.
"It is also the games we have after that. From now to January it could be 25, 26 or 27. We need to be organised in the right way.
"To play with the same XI, then I do not need to have 23 players. But in the long term, playing with the same XI can bring problems. It depends on injuries and international calls.
"My philosophy is to involve everyone in the squad. It keeps everyone fresh with a new mentality," added Zenga ahead of Saturday's home game against Burton.
"If a coach makes a lot of changes and he wins the game, then it is the right call. If the result is not good, then he gets asked 'why didn't he play the same team?'"
Former Italy goalkeeper Zenga has taken charge of seven games, in which Wolves have eight points from five league outings and progressed to the third round of the EFL Cup.
Wolves made two summer signings prior to Fosun's takeover and the departure of Jackett - goalkeeper Andy Lonergan and Portuguese winger Helder Costa.
Defender Silvio, midfielder Joao Teixeira and Iceland striker Jon Dadi-Bodvarsson also arrived before the season started.
Seven more signed on at Molineux before the end of the transfer window, starting with Congo midfielder Prince Oniangue, followed by Manchester United defender Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Benfica forward Ola John on season-long loan deals.
Dutch striker Paul Gladon's arrival from Heracles preceded Wolves' first defeat at Huddersfield, while the club confirmed deals for Morocco midfielder Romain Saiss, Monaco winger Ivan Cavaleiro and ex-Wanderers defender Richard Stearman shortly before the deadline on 31 August.
If nothing else, Wolves' burst of spending under their new owners has given most supporters much more optimism than they've had for the last 12 months. The very large crowd anticipated for Saturday's home game against Burton is further evidence of that.
In terms of numbers, at least, they have made up for time lost when the squad became too thin to challenge last season. How much value they will get for their money will not be clear for some time.
If things go well, Wolves could have a midfield full of continental flair, but it will be a challenge to get the best out of those players in the gruelling Championship once the days grow short.
The return of a more familiar face in Richard Stearman may turn out to be as valuable as any of the other signings.
Some were slow to appreciate him in his first spell at Wolves, but by the time of his departure he was deservedly held in high regard by supporters. If Wolves do succeed this season, Stearman's influence is likely to be important.
