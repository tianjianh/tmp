Cyclist's battle to beat 77-year-old world record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist's attempt to break a 77-year-old distance record has been "much harder" than expected.

Kajsa Tylen, from Nottingham, began the year-long attempt to ride 31,068 miles (50,000km) on New Year's Day.
The 38-year-old has so far covered nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) - an average of about 89 miles a day.
Ms Tylen, who is originally from Sweden, is seeking to break the record of Billie Fleming, who pedalled 29,603 miles (47,641km) in 1938.
Since January she has cycled "where the wind" has taken her and despite "a lot of pain" and bad weather she said stopping "is not an option".
"It has been much harder than I thought - there has been a lot of pain, both in the legs and elsewhere," she said.
"I can't get this far and not do it, it is not an option. But I've never wanted Christmas to come so fast!"
Over 10 weeks during the summer months, Ms Tylen cycled through parts of Europe including Sweden, Finland and Germany.
Ms Tylen is not raising money, but asking for "Sweat Pledges" -  specific promises to start taking more exercise - and has so far received dozens.
"People are saying to me 'I can do this, I've never done it before and you have inspired me to do it'.
"And that is brilliant, because they inspire me as much as I inspire them."
