The 22-year-old, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, was beaten by Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands, with France's Laurie Berthon in third.
Archibald was a Rio 2016 team pursuit gold medallist, eight months after being injured in a motorcycle crash.
Her medal in Paris was Britain's first of this year's championships.
She said: "My legs felt good - I'm saying I'm happy with silver, but people are really only happy with gold."
Britain's men's team pursuit squad, which includes Olympic gold medallist Steven Burke, qualified in sixth place in their event, setting up a semi-final against Italy.
The women's team pursuit squad of Dannielle Khan, Emily Kay, Emily Nelson and Manon Lloyd qualified in third place and will next face Russia.
