Exeter head coach Rob Baxter praised his side for 'knuckling down' after conceding a freak try in their 26-25 Premiership win over Harlequins.

Having come back from 17-9 down, Quins' Tim Visser scored after a kick hit the corner flag and bounced back into play.
It brought them to within one point of Exeter, but the home side held on.
"The fact we didn't buckle then and knuckled down, rolled up our sleeves and got on with things, I can't credit the players enough," said Baxter.
"You're not going to see a try like that happen if you watch 100 games of rugby, the player was miles away from the ball and it bounces back and everything went wrong for us.
The victory, their fourth in a row, kept Exeter in second place in the Premiership, three points clear of third-placed Leicester and three behind leaders Saracens.
"As a team we do need to address why we started so poorly, let's get that dealt with early in the week and lets get up for Wasps," said Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
"I'd like to think today was  a little bit of a wobble without us losing it, and sometimes those can give you a kick up the backside without paying the ultimate price of losing the game.
"Let's hope that happens, at the end of the day a lot of games of rugby playing in these conditions can be tough."
