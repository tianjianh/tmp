Del Potro lost to Andy Murray in Rio having knocked out world number one Novak Djokovic en route to the final.
The Argentine is ranked 141st in the world, with Wimbledon this year his first appearance in the main draw at a major since Melbourne two years ago.
World number 283 Robson, 22, reached the fourth round in New York in 2012.
The US Open begins on 29 August and runs until 11 September.
Del Potro, who won the tournament in 2009, saw his career interrupted by a wrist injury that resulted in him missing large parts of 2010, 2014 and 2015.
But the 27-year-old knocked fourth seed Stan Wawrinka out in the second round of this year's Wimbledon and also beat Rafael Nadal in the Olympic semi-final.
Robson has also faced lengthy spells away from the court following wrist surgery, but won her first title since returning from injury last week at a USTA Pro Circuit event in Pennsylvania.
She has not progressed further than the first round at a major since making the third round in New York in 2013.
