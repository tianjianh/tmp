Lamara Bell: Funeral for M9 crash victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funeral ceremony has been held for Lamara Bell, one of two people involved in a car crash on the M9 which police failed to investigate for three days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 200 people packed out Falkirk Crematorium for the humanist ceremony led by Marjory McGee.
Ms Bell, 25, was found critically injured on Wednesday 8 July in a car that had crashed off the motorway near Stirling on the previous Sunday.
She died in hospital four days after she was discovered.
It emerged after the crash that it had been reported to police by a member of the public on the day it happened but officers only attended the scene after receiving a second call from a different person three days later.
A review into the way the police handle calls in their control centres is to be carried out.
Ms Bell and her partner John Yuill were on their way home from a camping trip when they crashed down the embankment next to the busy motorway.
Lamara, who was found drifting in and out of consciousness, died from injuries which included broken bones and kidney damage caused by dehydration.
Many people were overcome with emotion as they arrived for the service, and it was standing room only in the crematorium as the song Hold Back the River was played.
Ms McGee told those gathered that the service was a chance to "remember, pay tribute to and celebrate the life of this vibrant and spirited young woman".
Ms Bell was described as determined and carefree during her childhood - "a typical wee girl full of innocence and wonder".
She loved the music of Peter Andre, and was fascinated by the night stars - her favourite television programme was The Sky At Night.
She gave birth to her daughter Alysha in 2006 and then to her son Kieran four years later.
Mourners heard she was a young mother "in heart and spirit" who enjoyed having fun with her children by singing karaoke, playing games and telling stories.
The service finished with the song Goodbye by the Spice Girls.
Ms Bell's family, including her parents Andrew and Diane, brothers Martin and Liam, and daughter Alysha followed as her coffin was taken to the burial ground for committal.
Four doves were released as she was laid to rest.
A funeral for Ms Bell's partner John Yuill, 28, who was found dead at the scene of the crash, was held on Thursday.
Members of Mr Yuill's family were in attendance at Ms Bell's funeral.
