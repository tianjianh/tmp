Roofe, 23, scored the opening goal in the 4-2 victory at Morecambe on Saturday but picked up a groin injury.
The former West Brom midfielder has netted 19 times this season and manager Michael Appleton will make an on-the-day decision over his fitness.
"We'll listen to the player and take advice from him on how he is feeling," Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford.
Appleton stressed Roofe would not be risked just because they are facing the division's top team.
"We've got 17 games left to play and plenty of points up for grabs," he added. "It doesn't make any difference to us and we've got some other big games to come.
"Let's take care of Northampton first and see how we do against the best team in the league so far this season."
Third-placed Oxford are nine points behind Northampton, who have a five-point lead over second-placed Plymouth.
