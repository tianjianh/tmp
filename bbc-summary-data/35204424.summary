Condor Liberation's crossing had already been cancelled because of Storm Frank on Wednesday.
The belting above the water line, designed to protect the ship's hull, was damaged when the vessel was blown against its berth in Poole Harbour.
Condor Ferries said a thorough contingency plan was in place.
The cancellations are a result of the damage caused to Liberation.
The company said: "All passengers already booked to travel on these services may chose between a full refund or rerouting."
While the storm was in progress, the ship's crew worked with harbour staff to put extra protection between the ship and berth to prevent further damage.
Condor Ferries said wind speeds in Poole Harbour reached 55 knots (63mph) on Wednesday.
Capt Fran Collins said: "Like all our ships, Condor Liberation has a crew 24 hours a day, whether she is undertaking passenger services or not.
"The crew acted quickly and with assistance from Poole Harbours to put additional protection in place between the ship and the berth."
The Â£50m Condor Liberation has offered the only fast ferry between Guernsey, Jersey and the UK, since March.
