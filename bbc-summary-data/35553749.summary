[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man injured in the Bavarian train crash on Tuesday has died of his injuries, bringing the death toll from the disaster to 11.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A further 82 people are recovering from injuries, 20 of them severely hurt, after two commuter trains collided on a single-track stretch of railway.
Work to remove the wreckage from the site continues, but is proceeding slowly because of the location.
A third data recorder on board the trains has yet to be found.
Unanswered questions
In focus: Bavaria's railways
Authorities are trying to work out why two trains were on the stretch of track at the same time, despite safety mechanisms.
The trains crashed head-on while both were travelling at about 100km/h (60mph) east of Bad Aibling, a spa town about 60km south-east of Munich.
All 11 victims of the crash were men aged between 24 and 59.
Two large cranes have been brought to the site to remove the wreckage. The crash happened on a bend in a wooded area, above a canal, and vehicle access is difficult.
In case signals fail, German railways are fitted with a final safety guard to prevent crashes.
Cab signalling known as PZB (Punktfoermige Zugbeeinflussung - or "intermittent train control") will set off an alarm in the driver's compartment when the train approaches a red light. If the driver does not respond by pressing a button, the train will brake automatically.
Who operates the signals?
