Winger Jonny Hayes is also likely to miss Sunday's Scottish Cup quarter-final against Partick Thistle.
Manager Derek McInnes said:  "Mark has been struggling a bit with a groin problem and we think it may have developed into a hernia.
"We think he will be out for about four weeks. Ryan's a real worry as well."
Reynolds went off at half-time in Tuesday's 1-0 Scottish Premiership defeat by Accies, while Jack picked up an ankle injury.
"Ryan Jack, his injury, it was down to the surface," McInnes said of Hamilton's artificial pitch. "It was his ankle.
"I expect both players to be out for a period of time."
Hayes, who has a hamstring injury, and striker Jayden Stockley, who has a shoulder problem, missed the game through injury.
"We are hopeful Jonny Hayes won't be out for too long, but I think he will miss Sunday," added McInnes.
"Hopefully, we might get Jayden back for Sunday because, all of a sudden, the squad is really stretched."
