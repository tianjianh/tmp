County Championship: Brendan Taylor's first century of the season gives Notts edge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brendan Taylor's first century of the season helped Nottinghamshire fight back against Durham at Trent Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The returning Chris Rushworth struck twice early on as Notts fell to 27-3 before James Weighell dismissed Michael Lumb to reduce the home side to 93-4.
Taylor and Samit Patel (84) shared a 168-run fifth-wicket stand, as the former Zimbabwean captain reached his ton off 144 balls with 17 fours.
Weighell eventually had Taylor caught for 114 as Notts closed on 353-6.
Notts' decision to bat having won the toss looked to have backfired, as a destructive opening spell from Rushworth saw the Durham seamer bowl Jake Libby and have Steven Mullaney caught on the boundary.
Graham Onions then found Greg Smith's edge as the home side's top-order crumbled but Taylor, in need of a big a score having managed to pass 50 on just one occasion in the Championship in 2016, looked at his fluent best.
Patel, who passed 10,000 first-class runs as he hit a boundary to bring up his own half-century, kept the score ticking over at the other end before being bowled by Scott Borthwick 16 runs short of three figures.
Despite the loss of a couple of late wickets, an unbeaten 62-run seventh-wicket stand by Brett Hutton (33 not out) and Riki Wessels (46 not out) kept Notts on top.
