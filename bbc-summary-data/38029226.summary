Lancashire 'could get elected mayor' in 2019

Lancashire could have its own elected mayor from 2019 in a proposed devolution deal, a council leader has said.

Jennifer Mein, leader of Lancashire County Council, said she was "hopeful" after talks with the government.
It comes after 14 of the 15 councils in the county formed a shadow combined authority this summer.
Wyre Council leader Peter Gibson said it opted out due to uncertainty over "benefits" and "costs" of the deal.
He added: "Councils don't need a combined authority to work together."
A formal request to form a combined authority for the county was submitted in June. It is expected to be formally set up next April.
Ms Mein said: "We've been advised by the civil servants and ministers that it's not necessary for everybody to be in.
"Ideally we would like all 15, of course, and the door's always open for Wyre."
She said a shadow mayor could be appointed in 2018, while elections for a county mayor could take place in 2019.
Neighbouring areas such as Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region will be among those electing a mayor next May as part of a devolution of powers from Westminster.
Andrew Percy, Northern Powerhouse minister, said the government was "committed to... getting powers and money away from Westminster up to the north where we can make the decisions better for ourselves".
But calls for a combined authority have not always proved popular among local politicians.
Blackpool Council leader Simon Blackburn, chairman for Lancashire's shadow combined authority, said the process had been "difficult"
However, he added: ""The amount of investment this could bring - the amount of local control around policy and planning and our very future - is such that that I think an elected mayor for Lancashire is a price worth paying".
Lancashire County Council said earlier this year it would have to "find a further Â£200m of savings by 2020" in addition to Â£85m savings this financial year.
Cat Smith, Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said the Northern Powerhouse strategy was a "totally viable idea, but without funding we can't make it happen".
She said: "When we can't deliver basic public services, it would be impossible to deliver the true potential of the Northern Powerhouse."
