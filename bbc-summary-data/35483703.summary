A mother planned to take her young children to Syria to be reunited with their jihadist father, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trainee maths teacher Lorna Moore, 33, is accused of not telling authorities her husband was poised to join fighters from the Islamic State group.
The Old Bailey heard that when Sajid Aslam, 34, left in August 2014, Ms Moore kept in touch via Skype while on holiday at Butlins.
She denies a terror-related offence.
On Mr Aslam's arrival in Syria, the court heard, he sent a "triumphant" coded message to his friend Ayman Shaukat, 27, in the form of a YouTube video of a song by the band Cash Money Heroes called I Made It.
Within months, jurors heard, Ms Moore, of Glebe Street, Walsall, had booked flights to Majorca, Spain.
Prosecutors said her final destination - where she planned to take her three children - was revealed in a text from another couple heading to Syria. It said: "see you there".
In the meantime, Ms Moore had set about renting her house, selling possessions and applying for passports, the court heard.
It is alleged that Ms Moore was part of a group planning to travel to Syria to fight for IS.
Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told jurors: "The plan was for Miss Moore to take the children via an innocuous destination to be reunited with their father."
The court heard things went awry when the couple Ms Moore had texted was arrested by Turkish police. Police then swooped on Ms Moore's Walsall home.
Mr Shaukat, of Pargeter Street, Walsall, an ex-treasurer of Walsall Islamic Centre, is accused of helping Mr Aslam, a supply teacher, travel to Syria by dropping him off at the airport.
He denies two counts of preparing for terrorist acts and one charge of possession of a terrorist document.
Ms Moore is accused of failing to disclose information about her husband's planned travel to fight for the group.
The trial continues.
