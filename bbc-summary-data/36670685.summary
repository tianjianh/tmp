[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stella Downing, 37, admitted murdering 56-year-old Glyn Evans at his home in Walsall Street, Willenhall, on 28 December, 2015.
She and a friend, Martin Stokes, had gone to his home and Downing launched her attack following a row.
Stokes was jailed for a year after lying to police about how long he had been in the house.
The 49-year-old, of  St Giles' Road, Willenhall admitted perverting the course of justice at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Police were called to the house where they found Mr Evans lying slumped against a chest of drawers.
A post mortem revealed he died of stab injuries to the stomach and back.
Alcoholic and unemployed Downing, of no fixed address, and Stokes were arrested by officers near the scene the same night.
Det Insp Jim Munro said the pair had attempted to clear up the bloody scene.
He said: "Glyn was well liked in the local community and I'd like to thank those local people who came forward to assist in this investigation.
"I cannot say what exactly happened in that flat which led to Glyn's death only that evidence suggests he was at no fault whatsoever and was unarmed when attacked by Downing with a knife."
In a statement, Mr Evans' family described him as a "happy-go-lucky chap with a heart of gold".
It said: "He died in tragic circumstances and didn't deserve to die like this.
"He will be sadly missed and the family are still grieving and don't think they will ever get over it. The family are glad justice has been served."
