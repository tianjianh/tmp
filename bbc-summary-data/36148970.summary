The airline will start scheduled flights to Gdansk, Warsaw and Wroclaw this winter. Ryanair will operate two flights per week to each city.
The news comes after the airline announced seven other new routes from the airport earlier this year.
The airport's managing director, Graham Keddie, said it was "fantastic news".
"It means that this winter should be our busiest ever," he said. He added that the routes "deliver a very comprehensive network to a new and important Polish market".
Kenny Jacobs, from Ryanair, told Good Morning Ulster said there was a demand for more routes to Poland "from the business community".
"Poland, more and more every year, is becoming a popular choice for businesses to locate some of their services," he said.
Mr Jacobs added that the increasing demand for city breaks also influenced the decision.
