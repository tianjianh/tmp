It was Northern Ireland's second victory in Group 6 and keeps alive their hopes of Euro 2017 qualification.
Captain Marissa Callaghan hit the top corner to make it 2-0 at Solitude before completing her double with a low strike five minutes before the break.
Rachel Furness added the fourth in the second half to seal a comfortable win.
It completed a double over Georgia with Northern Ireland securing a 3-0 victory in their opening qualifier in Tbilisi last October.
Northern Ireland lie in fourth place with six points from four qualifiers while bottom team Georgia are still seeking a first point of the campaign.
Next up for Northern Ireland is an away qualifier on Tuesday against the Czech Republic, who sit third and ahead of Alfie Wylie's side on goal difference.
