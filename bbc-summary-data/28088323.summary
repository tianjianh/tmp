Keith Millard, 27, from Doncaster, was spotted by officers on the A1 at Norman Cross, Cambridgeshire on 14 September.
They found six-month-old twins in car seats, a girl, aged one, between them and a boy, aged two, in the footwell.
Millard was jailed for 20 weeks after admitting dangerous driving and driving without insurance.
Millard's black Mercedes was spotted by officers carrying out speed checks on the busy dual carriageway.
He was stopped later on the A14, at about 21:35 BST, when the vehicle "slowed to about 90mph (145 km/h) due to heavy traffic, allowing officers to catch up", a Cambridgeshire Police spokesman said.
Millard, of Moss Road, who also had a female passenger with him, told officers he was trying to get to Dover in time to board the last ferry to Germany after missing a vessel in Hull.
Investigations revealed the Mercedes was Millard's father's, and he was not insured to drive it.
Millard, who admitted the offences at a hearing at Peterborough Crown Court on 17 June, was banned from driving for three years and will have to sit a further test to get his licence back.
Sgt Gordon Murray said: "It is shocking to think of the danger that Millard put these young children in.
"Not only would any collision, or loss of control at such speeds have potentially tragic consequences for both the driver and other road users, but the effect on unrestrained toddlers would almost certainly have been fatal.
"It is only through sheer luck that no-one was injured or killed by his driving."
