The 26-year-old has scored 48 goals in 99 appearances for Rovers, with 28 coming last season as the club won their second straight promotion.
Oxford boss Michael Appleton says he had "shaken" on a deal with Taylor.
"It has taken me a long time to determine my future. I apologise for the time involved," Taylor said.
During protracted negotiations, Taylor hired a personal trainer to stay fit while he was out of contract.
The forward admits it was "difficult to arrive at a final decision"
"I have enjoyed being a member of an incredibly successful squad during the past two years and felt a great deal of loyalty to the gaffer and to Bristol Rovers," he said.
"Although I am still very ambitious and want to play at the highest level possible, I didn't want to leave the club under a cloud and via the back door.
"If, at some point down the line, a club comes in for me then they will have to pay Bristol Rovers a fee and I can leave by the front door, with my head held high."
Taylor was top scorer as Rovers won promotion back to the Football League in 2015 via the Conference promotion final before topping the goalscoring chart in League Two last term.
"To have a striker of his calibre in our squad gives us all a tremendous boost," Rovers boss Darrell Clarke told the club's website.
"Last season he contributed 28 goals and nine assists, which means he was involved in almost 50% of the goals we scored, and I think that demonstrates his value to the team."
The length of Taylor's new deal has not been disclosed.
