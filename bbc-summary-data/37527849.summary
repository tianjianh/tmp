[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose will partner rookies in Saturday's foursomes as Europe begins day two of the Ryder Cup 5-3 behind the United States.

Stenson will play with Matt Fitzpatrick against Brandt Snedeker and Brooks Koepka while Rose partners Chris Wood against Jimmy Walker and Zach Johnson.
Rory McIlroy and Thomas Pieters take on Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler.
Spanish duo Sergio Garcia and Rafa Cabrera-Bello also stay together to take on Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth.
Stenson and Rose played together twice on Friday at Hazeltine, and their defeat in the opening foursomes match to Reed and Spieth was their first as a Ryder Cup pairing.
However, they exacted revenge in the fourballs to hand the Americans their first ever loss.
McIlroy, who lost to Mickelson and Fowler in Friday's foursomes when paired with Andy Sullivan, also has the chance to avenge that defeat. The Northern Irishman is again paired with Pieters after they convincingly won their fourball match 3&2.
Europe captain Darren Clarke has also opted to keep Garcia and Cabrera-Bello together after their similarly dominant 3&2 fourball victory on Friday.
American captain Davis Love keeps faith with three of the foursomes pairings that dominated the opening session. The only change is Snedeker and Koepka, who won their fourball match, coming in for Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar.
The US won Friday's foursomes 4-0 but Europe hit back in the fourballs, winning that session 3-1.
