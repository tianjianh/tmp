40 staff 're-employed' by Uskmouth power station buyers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The company which bought the UK's oldest coal-fire power station after it closed says it has since re-employed more than 40 staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eighty three jobs were put at risk when Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) failed to find a bidder for the power station in Uskmouth, near Newport, in May, 2014.
But SSE confirmed the station's sale in December, 2014.
New owner, Simec Group Ltd, says it will be converted to biomass fuel.
The station, which was built more than 50 years ago, was described before its sale as the UK's least efficient coal-fired power station.
Hong Kong-based Simec said it had restarted production at the station and hopes to employ more staff as production increases.
