Folkard, 32, represented Great Britain at London 2012 and will make her fourth Olympic appearance in Rio.
Belfast-born Huston, who is ranked 39 in the world, will make his Olympic debut after finishing third in the European Championships in May.
Huston, 20, was also part of the Team GB squad that narrowly missed out on a bronze medal at the Archery World Cup.
Both will compete in the individual recurve event as Team GB look to add to their nine Olympic medals.
