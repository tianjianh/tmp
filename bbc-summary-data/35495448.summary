Francesca Dingley, 22, from north London, died in a Chengdu apartment on 10 February 2015, five days after moving in to the flat.
Education First, which arranged the accommodation, said steps had been taken to prevent similar tragedies.

The leak came from a water heater that was left running during the night, he said.
Her parents called for all travellers to carry carbon monoxide detectors.
Mark Dingley said people should carry the devices as "at least you can feel safe".
Francesca Dingley had travelled to China in January to teach with Education First.
In a statement, the company said it had "launched an immediate independent investigation" following her death.
"The priority has been to support the family", it said.
Ms Dingley's family has previously settled with the firm out of court.
Her mother Chrissy said the death was "something you never get over".
