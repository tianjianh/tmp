The men forced their way into the house in Graham Road, Brucehill, Dumbarton, at about 23:45 on Wednesday.
They threatened the 29-year-old woman and demanded money before running off with cash and some of her belongings.
Police said the gun was not fired during the robbery and the woman was not injured but was left in a very distressed state.
Det Sgt Darren Munogee said: "This was obviously a very frightening experience for the young woman who thankfully was not physically injured during this incident.
"Our inquiries are under way to establish the exact motive for this robbery, however, we believe that this was not a random attack and that the property was the intended target for the culprits.
"I'd also like to reassure the public that there will be an increased police presence in the Dumbarton area and anyone who has any information that could assist our inquiries is asked to contact Police Scotland."
