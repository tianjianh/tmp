Stranraer marina expansion bid moves forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A full business case is set to be commissioned by Dumfries and Galloway Council looking at the possible expansion of Stranraer marina.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is part of wider regeneration plans to promote the town and Loch Ryan as a marine leisure destination.
An outline business case last year estimated the scheme could create about 30 new jobs - but at a cost of Â£6m.
Consultants are set to be appointed this month to put together the full case to take the development forward.
The study is expected to take between six and nine months to complete.
It will examine the technical and financial viability of the scheme and take the proposals to the planning approval stage.
The marina is one of a series of projects which make up the Stranraer waterfront masterplan.
Another key element is the re-development of the East Pier which was left vacant after ferry operator Stena Line relocated to Cairnryan.
Last year the council entered into a partnership with an Irish property management group to examine new retail, leisure, hotel and housing opportunities for the site.
It is claimed that could lead to an investment of up to Â£50m.
In a progress report, the authority said it was currently carrying out ground investigation surveys which would help shape future plans.
