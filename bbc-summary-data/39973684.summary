Scottish law firm Anderson Strathern has reported a return to growth this year after posting a fall in turnover in the 2015-16 financial year.

The company cited Brexit as one reason for a "marginal slowdown" in its corporate and commercial property practices during the middle of 2016.
Turnover for the 12 months to 31 August was down by 3%, at Â£21m.
However, the firm said it had been boosted in 2017 by a series of clients wins.
They include the Scottish government, Glasgow City Council, National Galleries Scotland, Prestwick Airport, Avis and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
Managing partner Murray McCall said: "We are pleased to have weathered some of the political uncertainty last year and produced a very steady set of numbers in the circumstances.
"2016 was an important year for Anderson Strathern, with significant investment in our people, mergers and lateral hires, technology and a major rebranding exercise.
"At our half-year point, we're up on the previous year so we're encouraged to see the growth coming through."
Anderson Strathern has 51 partners and more than 240 employees across Edinburgh, Glasgow and East Lothian.
