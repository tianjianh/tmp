Asked about Depay, Mourinho said: "When I have the feeling and the information that the player probably has a big chance to leave, I have to care more about the others.
"If he's going to be my player until the end of the season I will help him and he will be useful for us."
The United boss said goalkeeper Sam Johnstone would be allowed to leave on loan for the remainder of the season.
Aston Villa are understood to be among the clubs who are interested in the 23-year-old.
Mourinho said: "Sam is the only player I allow to go on loan because he hasn't played one single minute and for his development, he needs to play for six months."
