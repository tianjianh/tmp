Bosses said insulation debris was left in the Paddock, but repairs can be made before a meeting at the weekend and the British Grand Prix is not under threat.
Engineers are currently assessing the damage to the Wing and the circuit was working to ensure minimal disruption during repairs.
The roof was damaged on Sunday afternoon and again on Monday night.
Sporting director Stuart Pringle said: "Although it looks a bit of a mess at the moment, the damage is largely cosmetic and the structural and functional integrity of the roof remains completely intact.
"Whilst clearly we will have to smarten the section of roof and clear the insulation debris from the Paddock, we don't anticipate any impact on this weekend's race meeting.
"It will not affect the season opener, the FIA World Endurance Championship over the weekend of 10 - 12 April."
