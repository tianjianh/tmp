Johanna Konta: British number one loses at Nottingham Open but Tara Moore through

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Johanna Konta exited the Nottingham Open in the second round to leave qualifier Tara Moore as the only British player in the competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British number one Konta suffered a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Saisai.
Konta, ranked 18 in the world, lost 6-4 7-5 to the Chinese, who is 44 places below her in the world rankings.
Zheng will now face Hong Kong-born Moore, 23, who beat American world number 67 Christina McHale 6-2 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals.
Konta needed a medical time out three games into the second set for a "niggle" on her pelvis.
But following the match, the 25-year-old said she expected to play in the Wimbledon warm-up events in Birmingham and Eastbourne.
The 25-year-old was below the form which helped her become the first British woman since 1983 to break into the top 20, making four double faults and winning just 38% of points on her second serve.
British number two Heather Watson and compatriot Laura Robson were knocked out in the first round.
