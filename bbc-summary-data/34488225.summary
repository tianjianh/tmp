[SN]TITLE[SN]
New bovine TB controls introduced in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legislation aimed at protecting Scotland's livestock from Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) has come into effect.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new rules mean specified non-bovine animals - including alpaca, sheep and farmed deer - will be subject to TB controls where incidents are disclosed.
Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said the move would ensure Scotland was fully prepared to deal with any TB outbreaks that might arise.
Scotland has been officially free of the infectious disease since 2009.
The Scottish government said it had no plans to introduce a routine TB testing regime for non-bovine animals.
It added that the new powers would only be used where a TB incident was disclosed - for example through a post-mortem examination.
Mr Lochhead said: "Scotland has been officially TB free since 2009 and we want to stay that way.
"The cattle industry is already strictly regulated for TB but those legal powers in Scotland did not specifically cover controls of non-bovine species, except deer, where TB is strongly suspected or confirmed.
"The new measures coming into force today will address that gap and ensure Scotland is fully prepared to deal with any TB outbreaks that might arise.
"The controls will also give us the powers to provide keepers of these non-bovine species with statutory compensation for animals slaughtered as a result of TB."
