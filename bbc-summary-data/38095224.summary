Amaia Erbina and Patricia Garcia scored first-half tries for the hosts either side of Rhona Lloyd's sharp finish.
Sarah Law levelled at 10-10 after the break with a clever try.
But Marina Bravo scored to seal victory for Spain, who join England, USA and Italy in World Cup Pool B in Ireland.
Shade Munro's Scotland were beaten 10-5 in the first leg at Scotstoun last Friday.
Winger Erbina crashed over on the left to open the scoring for the Leonas, with fly-half Garcia's conversion attempt off-target.
The Scots responded smartly, earning a turnover on the home 22, and a brilliant whipped pass from pivot Helen Nelson found captain Lisa Martin, who released Lloyd to out-sprint the cover defence in the corner.
Lana Skeldon failed to convert, and Spain soon reclaimed the lead, with neat handling and looping support lines from the back-row forwards culminating in Garcia diving in down the right, the fly-half unable to convert her own try.
Chloe Rollie almost levelled for Scotland before the break, when the full-back charged-down her opposite number, Barbara Pla in the Spanish 22, but her hack-through bobbled out of play off the corner flag.
A piece of predatory play from Law did haul the Scots back on terms five minutes after half-time. The ball lay static at the base of a ruck just inside the Spanish in-goal area, meaning there could be no offside, and the scrum-half dived through the bodies to press it to ground.
The decisive try was scored by centre Bravo, who powered over from a quick-tap penalty in the Scottish 22, carrying there tacklers with her, Garcia once more wayward from the tee.
