Christian Bagley, 30, was found with wounds to his arm and back near Hunderton Bridge at 22:50 BST on 21 June. He died in hospital.
The footage shows the individuals walking in the direction of the bridge at about 23:00 BST on the same day.
They may have seen something "vital" to the investigation, police said.
Senior investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Leighton Harding of West Mercia Police, said: "We have released this footage in the hope that the two individuals recognise themselves and come forward to police.
"They were seen walking towards the area where Christian was stabbed just after the incident and therefore may have seen something which could prove vital to the investigation.
"I would also like to thank the community for all their assistance with this investigation. Our enquires are ongoing and we are working to identify those responsible for Christian's death and any information from the public could prove useful."
One of the individuals is thought to be wearing light blue trousers, a light coloured jumper and a dark coloured back pack. The second person is also thought to be wearing light blue trousers, a dark blue or purple coat and a dark coloured backpack.
Earlier this month, CCTV images were released of a cyclist riding near the scene at the time of the stabbing.
