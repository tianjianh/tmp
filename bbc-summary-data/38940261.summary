[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 2-2 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton twice fought back to secure a League One draw at Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers moved into the play-off places at the expense of FA Cup fifth-round heroes Millwall, with a point at Roots Hall.
But the Cobblers dug in and John Joe O'Toole's equaliser just before half time saw Justin Edinburgh's side pick up a share of the spoils.
Southend took the lead in the 20th minute when winger Jermaine McGlashan tapped home from close range after Simon Cox had failed to make contact with Ben Coker's left-wing cross.
Northampton equalized nine minutes later when Marc Richards netted from 20 yards after Matt Taylor''s left-wing cross had been cleared into his path by Coker.
However, the Shrimpers were back in front within two minutes when Jason Demetriou's left-footed shot deflected into the path of Cox who volleyed in from close range as he netted for the sixth home game in succession.
But Northampton made sure of a point just before the break when O'Toole bundled the ball home after Taylor's 25 yard free-kick had struck the inside of the left post.
