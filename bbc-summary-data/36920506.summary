[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Climbing and skateboarding are among five sports which have moved closer to being added to the Olympics for the 2020 Games in Tokyo.

Skateboarding, surfing, karate, sports climbing and baseball/softball were all recommended for inclusion last month by the International Olympic Committee.
They have now been called "a dynamic and exciting package" by the IOC, with all five sports likely to be confirmed.
A final decision will be announced in Rio de Janeiro on 3 August.
That will be two days before the 2016 Games begin officially in the Brazilian city.
Each sport was analysed in a detailed report which said that the additions would "encompass both traditional and emerging events, all of which are popular both in Japan and internationally".
The IOC hopes to draw in new audiences by focusing on youth-oriented sports, and said in a statement that also important was "the impact on gender equality" and "legacy value".
The five added sports - which would not replace any of the 28 already on the schedule for Tokyo - would include 18 events and involve 474 athletes, the IOC has said.
If climbing is added, Britain could have a medal hope, after Shauna Coxsey became the first Briton to win the Bouldering World Cup last month.
Baseball and softball were included separately at the Olympics between 1992 and 2008, but have made a joint bid to be readmitted to the Games.
None of the other sports have been included before, though surf lifesaving was a demonstration sport at the Paris Games in 1900.
