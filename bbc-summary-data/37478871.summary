North Wales Police has released an artist's impression of a man whose remains were found in a remote Conwy forest.

The image was revealed for the first time on the BBC's Crimewatch programme as part of a new appeal to identify the unknown murder victim.
The man's remains were discovered at Pentrellyncymer near Cerrigydrudion last November.
The body is thought to have been in the forest for several years.
Forensic tests showed he had suffered a serious head injury.
It was discovered by two brothers camping in the forest ahead of the Wales Rally GB.
Police launched a large scale forensic search and were able to recover virtually an entire male skeleton.
Det Supt Iestyn Davies said the man was probably in his sixties when he died and was between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10.5in (1.73-1.78m) tall.
His nose had been fractured at some point and he suffered from arthritis.
Two items of badly decomposed clothing were also discovered at the scene.
In June 2016, police appealed for help from dentists to identify the man but have so far drawn a blank.
The new, detailed image of what the victim may have looked like was produced with the help a forensic artist and an odontologist.
"There will be a loved one, friends, family that may recognise this person," Mr Davies told the programme.
"Once we get the name, we can work on why did this person become a victim, who would be responsible for that and why would they want to have killed him."
