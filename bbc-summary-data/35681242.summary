Four miners were killed when a methane leak triggered two explosions in the mine near Vorkuta on Thursday.
Rescuers were trying to rescue 26 trapped miners when a new blast occurred, killing five rescue workers and a miner.
The rescue operation has been halted and those missing are presumed dead.
The incident is one of the worst Russian mining disasters in recent times.
"The circumstances in the affected part of the mine did not allow anyone to survive," Russia's Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov said.
"In the underground space where the 26 miners were, there are high temperatures and no oxygen", he added.
All the rescuers who were killed or injured in the operation would be given state awards, the TASS news agency reported.
