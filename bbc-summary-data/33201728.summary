A healthcare worker who stole cash and jewellery from vulnerable cancer patients has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacqueline Perry, 49, was caught after colleagues at Swansea's Morriston Hospital became suspicious about items disappearing.
Perry, from Morriston, had admitted nine counts of theft from semi-conscious patients at an earlier hearing.
She was jailed for 16 months at Swansea Crown Court on Friday.
Perry was caught after police set up a sting operation which involved placing marked bank notes around Ward G.
When one disappeared, officers searched staff and it was found in her possession.
Perry stole a total of £2,739, which included three gold rings worth £1,800 from an 89-year-old patient.
The thefts had a major impact on Perry's colleagues, the court heard.
In a statement, lead nurse Tina Smith said: "The patients were quite sick and quite vulnerable. It was busy and demanding work.
"The thefts had a massive impact on morale because staff were all under suspicion."
The court heard that Perry stole the money to pay for alcohol for her husband.
Stephen Rees, defending, said the offences were "not motivated through greed, but by financial hardship".
He also told the court a disciplinary hearing would follow the court proceedings and it was "inevitable" that she would lose her job.
Recorder Christopher Clee QC called her actions "a despicable offence".
Perry sobbed in the dock as Mr Clee told her he had no good reason to suspend the sentence.
He told her she will serve half of the sentence in prison and half on licence.
In a statement, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said it hoped the sentence would "act as a deterrent" to others.
"Theft from patients or staff in hospitals is not only a serious criminal offence, but a severe breach of trust, which ABMU health board will not tolerate," the statement said.
"We can only apologise to the victims of these thefts, and the distress this former employee's actions have undoubtedly caused."
Perry's victims included:
