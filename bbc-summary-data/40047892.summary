Young was out of contract at Torquay, who he joined from League Two side Plymouth in June 2014.
The 24-year-old has played in 87 league games for the Gulls, and won their player of the season award in 2016-17.
"Last season he got stronger and better with each game," player-manager Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
