Airtricity Premier Division: Derry City 1-0 Bohemians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Patterson's early goal proved enough to give second-placed Derry City a home victory over Bohemians in Friday night's Premier Division clash.

The win keeps the Candystripes two points behind leaders Dundalk who won 2-0 away to Shamrock Rovers.
Former Plymouth striker Patterson scored his sixth goal of the season in the 14th minute at the Brandywell.
He shot into an empty net after the ball broke to him when keeper Dean Delany thwarted Barry McNamee.
Kurtis Byrne should have netted a speedy equaliser but the son of former Celtic player Paul Byrne completely missed his kick in front of goal.
That was the one big scare for Kenny Shiels' men on a night when both keepers had a quiet night.
Derry City have won six and drawn two in the eight games they have played since losing to Finn Harps on the first day of the season.
