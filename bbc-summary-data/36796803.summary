[SN]TITLE[SN]
Men jailed for murdering James Chadwick in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who murdered a man by punching, kicking and hitting him repeatedly with a dog lead have each been jailed for 18 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of James Chadwick, 37, was found at an address in Holland Street in Aberdeen last September.
Following a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, a jury found Ryan Gibb, 30, and Cameron Laurie, 31, guilty of murder.
The two men, prisoners at HMP Grampian, denied killing Mr Chadwick.
Passing sentence, judge Lord McEwan told the men, who have previous convictions, that given the jury's decision he had no other option but to sentence them both to life imprisonment.
Lord McEwan also handed them a 12 month sentence for their attempt to defeat the ends of justice. This term will be served concurrently with the murder sentence.
The judge said: "You have been both convicted of a brutal murder of a man in his home. This gentleman had done you no wrong or expressed ill will towards you.
"As far as the evidence has shown this was a motiveless crime.
"I cannot distinguish between you. Neither of you is of good character. I will therefore set the punishment part of your sentences at 18 years."
The court heard that Gibb and Laurie, who were both described as alcohol dependent, had spent 31 August last year drinking before arriving at Mr Chadwick's property.
The pair then attacked Mr Chadwick before trying to destroy evidence linking him to his death.
