[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport RFC shareholders have overwhelmingly voted in favour of a Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons.

81.09% voted in favour of the takeover, which also includes the Rodney Parade ground.
The WRU and Dragons both approved the deal before the vote took place on Tuesday, which needed to be passed by at least 75% of shareholders.
The Union already owns 50% of the region, which was formed in 2003.
A new company free of debt will now be formed, owned by the WRU, and all employees of the Dragons will now be taken on by the WRU.
The union has targeted a completion date of 1 July for the deal to be finalised.
Shareholders were informed of "additional provisions" before the vote, which include opening a club museum and keeping profits from bar sales on match days.
"We will be doing everything possible to ensure the long-term success of the Dragons, but the hard work starts now," said WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips.
"All parties recognise that, from a Dragons perspective, significant improvement is required on and off the pitch and that now is the time for a new approach.
"Our investment is equally designed to safeguard Newport RFC and its rich history at Rodney Parade."
League Two football club Newport County agreed a 10-year lease to use Rodney Parade in 2013 and were reassured they have a future at the ground, despite the WRU saying they view it as a "rugby venue".
"We have committed to safeguard the future of the game in the region and we will be doing everything in our control to not only provide continued stability for players, supporters, employees and everyone with an interest in the game in the region, but we will also be looking for rugby to thrive at Rodney Parade," WRU chairman Gareth Davies added.
"We want Gwent to have a Dragons team to be proud of, a team which becomes synonymous with success both on and off the pitch for the good of the whole game in Wales and we will be utilising all of the resources and the expertise we have available to make sure that happens."
Newport Gwent Dragons chief Stuart Davies said before the vote: "The decision will shape how both teams fare going forward,"
Davies, a former Wales back-row forward, had previously warned a 'no' vote could lead to liquidation for the club and region, and the end of 140 years of rugby at Rodney Parade.
"A yes vote sees Rodney Parade continue as a venue with immediate investment from the Welsh Rugby Union into the pitch and the facilities at large with both Newport and the Dragons continuing to play there," Davies added.
"The intent is to make it a success, a fresh and exciting start for the Dragons and to make the Dragons far more competitive and successful than we are now."
