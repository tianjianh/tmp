The 23-year-old centre-back is one of the club's longest-serving players and made 41 league appearances this season.
"We'll struggle to keep him moving forward as he has the ability to play two or three leagues above this one," said player-boss Kevin Nicholson.
"It is up to us to match his talent by fighting for promotion and he is going to be a key figure for us."
MacDonald, who previously played for Salisbury, joins Luke Young, Ben Gerring, Sam Chaney, and Will Hancox in agreeing new Torquay deals.
