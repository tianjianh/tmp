[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham boss Slaven Bilic would not be interested in becoming England coach, insists Hammers co-chairman David Gold.

Bilic, 47, has been in charge at West Ham since last summer and guided them to seventh place in the Premier League.
Coach of Croatia from 2006 to 2012, he has been mooted as a replacement for Roy Hodgson, who quit on Monday.
But Gold said: "I don't believe he would be the slightest bit interested in taking on England. I don't believe he will be tempted away by anything."
Gold, who took charge at West Ham with David Sullivan in 2010, added: "I don't believe either the FA will come for him, as they have been down the foreign manager route and it hasn't worked.
"England is simply not part of Slaven's mission. We have backed him 100% and he us. Our commitment to each other is total.
"This is his club and he is on his way to great thing at the Olympic Stadium."
Bilic coached Croatia to a 3-2 victory at Wembley in November 2007 that ended England's hopes of qualifying for Euro 2008 and led to Steve McClaren's dismissal.
Hodgson resigned after England were knocked out of Euro 2016 by Iceland.
