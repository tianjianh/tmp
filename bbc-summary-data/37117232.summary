[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old former FC Basel and Hoffenheim midfielder has joined the Royals on a free transfer after leaving Swiss top-flight side FC Thun.
Wieser played with current Reading player Danny Williams at Hoffenheim.
In 2015, Swiss state prosecutors fined Wieser for a tackle on an opponent in a Swiss league game, ruling the challenge "was negligent and an assault".
Wieser later apologised for the tackle while playing for Aarau against FC Zurich which left Gilles Yapi-Yapo with extensive knee injuries.
He was also banned for six matches by the Swiss league for the challenge.
