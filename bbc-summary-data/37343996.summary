West Ham have asked E20, which owns the club's London Stadium home, to ensure there is a police presence in the ground after recent trouble.

The Hammers moved to the venue at the start of the season, but there have been unsavoury incidents involving their fans at the past three matches.
The club confirmed that 10 fans were ejected from the stadium during the 4-2 defeat by Watford on Saturday.
West Ham have also requested more experienced stewards.
Stewarding at the stadium is provided by LS185.
At the first Premier League match at the venue - against Bournemouth last month - some fans arrived with tickets for seats that did not exist, while fighting broke out between rival supporters outside the stadium.
Some of the disturbances are believed to be over persistent standing during matches and West Ham confirmed they had received seven complaints about standing following Saturday's game against Watford.
"E20 confirmed that immediate action is being taken on the issues raised," said a West Ham club statement.
"The club will work tirelessly with them to ensure London Stadium continues to be the inclusive and family-friendly environment that all parties have worked so hard to achieve.
"This includes a more robust and secure line of segregation between the home and visiting fans as specified by the club. We have been assured this will be in place ahead of the next match."
The Hammers have also appealed to supporters to report any incidents to the club.
Analysis - BBC sports editor Dan Roan:
"A blame game is now developing over the violent scenes at West Ham's new home.
"The club says the stadium's owners and matchday operator need to bolster policing, stewarding & segregation.
"However, it has also been suggested that West Ham could have done more to plan segregated family and singing sections, rather than prioritising the sale of season tickets, with the mix of traditional supporters and thousands of new fans thought to have led to tension."
