British Basketball League side Plymouth Raiders have parted company with head coach Jay Marriott.

He will be replaced by Australian Daryl Corletto in a player-coach role.
The club are currently bottom of the table after losing all three of their matches and were knocked out of the BBL Cup in the first round after an 88-77 loss to Bristol Flyers.
Marriott was in charge of the Raiders for two years having replaced Gavin Love early in the 2013-14 season.
"If we are serious about making a run at a respectable league position this season, something had to be done now," said Raiders chairman Bob Widdecombe.
"We have only played three league games, which is one of the fewest of any of the teams in the league.
"We didn't want to sit back and allow half of the season to slip away.
"We now have to turn to Daryl and give him the support that he needs in order to lead this team back towards the top of the table."
The Raiders failed to make the play-offs in either of Marriott's years in charge.
Under his leadership, Plymouth did, however, reach the semi-finals of the 2013-14 BBL Cup and the same stage of last season's BBL Trophy.
Corletto joins the Raiders from Australian side Melbourne United, having won four titles in Australia.
"I want to work with the club's owner and management team to change the culture around the team, get the support back from the fans and sponsors and make the Raiders the team to challenge the dominance of Leicester and Newcastle in recent years," he said in a statement.
