Kayleigh, 15, was found dead in a field near Ibstock in November after a huge police search across the county.
The so-called Peace Light is carried from Bethlehem to locations around the world in a tradition which began in 1986.
A 28-year-old man has been charged with her rape and murder.
Another 27-year-old was charged with grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child.

The flame arrived at St Laurence Church in Measham on Tuesday evening, in time for a short service led by the Reverend Linda Cox.
"A candle was lit for the family and another two candles were lit for churches in Ibstock as well as several for our church, which will remain lit until after the Christmas period," she said.
"The service was a chance for people to come together to receive some comfort and hope," she added.
Kayleigh lived in Measham and a vigil attended by her family was held after her body was found.
