Lorry driver spared jail over Wiltshire crash death

A man whose lorry hit a broken down car in Wiltshire, killing a 53-year-old woman, has been given a suspended jail term.

Paul Bradley, 53, was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for 24 months after admitting causing death by careless driving.
Mariola Martin from Swindon died on the A303 Mere Bypass in July 2014.
She had stopped on the inside lane where her Mazda MX-5 was struck from behind by the articulated lorry.
At a Winchester Crown Court hearing, Bradley - from Cullompton in Devon - was also disqualified from driving for 30 months from his original suspension date.
