A man has died after being Tasered by police who were called following serious concerns about his welfare and behaviour, a watchdog has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said officers were called to Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, to deal with the man, who appeared to be injured.
He became unresponsive after being stunned with a Taser on Tuesday evening and was later pronounced dead.
Dyfed-Powys Police referred the case to the IPCC, which is investigating.
Emergency services were called to the Morfa area of the town by a concerned member of the public.
The IPCC said police officers "engaged with the man" before it is understood a Taser was discharged.
"The man became unresponsive and was subsequently pronounced dead," a spokesman added.
A spokeswoman for the force said: "A full investigation has commenced, and Dyfed-Powys Police referred the matter to the IPCC, who will now conduct an independent investigation.
"We are fully co-operating with them. Our thoughts are with the family of the man."
