[SN]TITLE[SN]
Animal welfare worry over Brighton and Hove City Council cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Complaints over dangerous dogs or the mistreatment of animals may not be investigated under cost-cutting plans considered by Brighton and Hove City Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animal welfare team on the council could be cut to such an extent it would only fulfil its statutory obligation to round-up stray dogs.
More than 2,000 campaigners have signed a petition against the plans.
The council said it will discuss the proposal at a meeting in February.
If the cuts go ahead it would also mean the council would stop policing people who refuse to pick-up after their dogs.
The authority said it has to save Â£68m from its total budget over the next four years.
The proposals will be discussed at the full council meeting on 25 February.
