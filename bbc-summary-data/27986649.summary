The midfielder, who joined Manchester City in the summer on loan from New York City, played his final England game as captain in the 0-0 draw against Costa Rica at the World Cup in June.
The former Chelsea man, 36, was capped 106 times in a career dating back to October 1999 and follows Steven Gerrard into international retirement.
"It has been a very tough decision for me to make," Lampard said.
"That is why I have given it so much thought since the World Cup.
"I have always been exceptionally proud and honoured to represent my country and have to say looking back I have enjoyed every minute of wearing the England shirt."
Former captain Gerrard announced his retirement in July.
The new England captain is expected to be announced by Roy Hodgson at an England press conference on Thursday.
Lampard was released by Chelsea at the end of last season.
He says his decision to move to America, and the MLS, is a key factor in his decision to end his international career.
Lampard added: "Due to my club career now going in a different direction, it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first and also to concentrate on how I can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football.
"It is now the time to move forward and I feel very confident that with Roy Hodgson in charge, the young players that we have coming through, and the changes that are being made throughout the development of the youth system in this country, that we will have success in the future and a team that this country deserves."
Lampard played in five major tournaments and scored 29 goals and joins Sir Bobby Charlton as the sixth most-capped player in England history.
The midfielder, who began his career at West Ham, left Chelsea at the end of last season after 648 appearances and 211 goals for the Stamford Bridge club.
Hodgson paid tribute to the midfielder and said: "Frank Lampard has been a superb representative of the English game, both as a player on the pitch and an ambassador off it.
"To reach in excess of 100 international caps is something very few professionals achieve and he is in exalted company.
"He has served the national team quite brilliantly during his 15-year international career.
"It is with regret that I accept and understand the decision he's made."
