Roy Deeming's yacht, Desiree, was found drifting off La Corbiere, off the south-west coast, on Christmas Day, prompting a major search operation.
He has been missing from his home in St Brelade since late on Christmas Eve.
Searches were called off on Friday and were not restarting on Saturday, Jersey Police said.
