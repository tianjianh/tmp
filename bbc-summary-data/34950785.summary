Tory 'bullying' claims: Cameron promises 'proper' inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservative Party will hold a proper inquiry into allegations of bullying within its youth wing, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.

It follows the apparent suicide in September of activist Elliott Johnson, who had claimed he was bullied by party youth organiser Mark Clarke.
Number 10 said the PM was awaiting the results of an internal investigation, but Mr Johnson's father has called for an independent and external inquiry.
Mr Clarke denies all the allegations.
Allegations of bullying, sexual assault and intimidation have engulfed the party since 21-year-old Mr Johnson was found dead in September.
Mr Cameron said it was a "tragic loss of a talented young life".
He said: "I feel deeply for his parents it is an appalling loss to suffer... There needs to be and there is a proper inquiry where we ask all the questions, interview all the people who've come forward - that will take place.
He said an independent lawyer was overseeing the whole process to "make sure it reaches clear conclusions from the evidence that comes through".
His father, Ray Johnson, called for an external inquiry to be set up saying he believed the current investigation was "a cover up" and that he had no confidence in current party chairman Lord Feldman, who is conducting the inquiry.
He also called on Lord Feldman and former party chairman Grant Shapps to resign over claims they ignored repeated warnings about Mr Clarke - who was in charge of a campaigning initiative which bussed young volunteers around the country.
"I can't see how their inquiry can have any veracity at all... I complained that an inquiry run by themselves without independent oversight can't possibly be considered to be valid," he told BBC Newsnight.
"I want to get to the bottom of what happened to my son and I will fight for justice for him and for the other activists."
The Conservative Party has said that it received no written complaints until this summer about Mr Clarke's behaviour.
However, former chairwoman Baroness Warsi says she wrote to Mr Shapps, her successor, in January asking for action to be taken against Mr Clarke.
Lady Warsi has published the letter containing her concerns in the Guardian. In it she complained that Mr Clarke had sent a tweet which implied she had offended a Jewish member of a local Conservative Party.
Mr Clarke has said Lady Warsi is pursuing a personal vendetta against him.
The BBC's Newsnight programme has also seen an email written by a young Conservative activist, sent to the party in July last year, that complains of threats at the hands of Mr Clarke. The activist says nothing was done with the complaint.
Earlier this month, Mr Clarke was banned for life from the Conservative Party.
He says he strongly refutes all allegations of bullying, harassment, assault or attempted blackmail.
"I believe that these false allegations and this media firestorm are related to the events surrounding Elliott's sad death," he said.
"As such I will be co-operating with the coroner and providing him with the fullest information. This is the proper process. After the inquest I will look to take legal action for defamation in respect of these allegations."
The Conservative Party said it would not comment until it could "establish the facts".
