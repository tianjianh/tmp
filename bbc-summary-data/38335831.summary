[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gemma Gibbons & Ashley McKenzie: Olympic judo pair have funding ceased

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Commonwealth champion Ashley McKenzie and 2012 Olympic silver medallist Gemma Gibbons will stop receiving British Judo funding towards Tokyo 2020.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McKenzie was beaten in round two at the Rio Olympics, while Gibbons did not qualify and declined a funding offer.
Athletes without funding can still qualify to represent GB at competitions but must fund themselves.
Sally Conway and Natalie Powell are the only two top-tier funded podium athletes for the 2020 Tokyo Games.
Conway won bronze in Rio and Powell qualified ahead of Gibbons and was Britain's only seeded judoka at this summer's Games.
