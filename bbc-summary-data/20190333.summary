Indonesia Poso: Police kill terror suspect in raid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anti-terror police on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi have shot dead one suspected militant and arrested another in the district of Poso, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspects allegedly resisted arrest by throwing home-made bombs at the police when they swooped before dawn in the jungle village of Kayamaya.
Two policemen were killed in the area last month while investigating an alleged Islamist training camp.
Poso was notorious for violence between Muslims and Christians a decade ago.
On Wednesday, police killed another suspected militant, arrested two and found explosives in Poso.
Security forces have been battling Islamist militants since the 2002 bombings in Bali which killed 202 people, many of them foreign tourists.
