Connor Mahoney: Blackburn's Tony Mowbray expects Nottingham Forest move for winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers manager Tony Mowbray is resigned to losing Connor Mahoney and expects the out-of-contract winger to join Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old made 18 appearances last season as Rovers were relegated from the Championship.
Mowbray told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Let's hope he plays a lot of football and becomes a star and helps Forest get to the Premier League.
"That's where I hear the rumours might be, but let's wait and see."
