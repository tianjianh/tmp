Scott Boden's 14th goal of the season eased Newport County's League Two relegation fears to dent Wycombe's play-off hopes.

Boden tapped home unmarked following good work from John-Christophe Ayina.
Wycombe came back strongly in the second half and debutant Rowan Liburd's effort rattled the Newport crossbar.
But Warren Feeney's side held on to secure their third successive home win to move 11 points clear of the relegation zone.
Wanderers are ninth and one point off the play-off spots following their second successive defeat.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales:
"It was a hard fought win. I told the players that it's not about performances, it's about results.
"Wycombe are very direct and get balls into the box but I thought we handled it very well and I'm pleased with the win.
"We're doing OK at the moment but we've got a lot of games coming up. We've just got to take each game at a time."
Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties:

"It's not a nice week with two away defeats, against Cambridge and this today.
"I thought we could nick something in the second half and get something from the game, but we didn't deserve to win.
"I thought the one bright spark was Rowan Liburd. He looks like he is going to score goals - he wants to shoot, he wants to turn defenders and get his shots away.
"I thought there were some individual battles lost today, some wrong decisions made. We all need to look inside ourselves, including me, to see what we could have done better and get it in place for next week. That is the only way you grow."
