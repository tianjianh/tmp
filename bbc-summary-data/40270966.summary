The midfielder, 30, has two years to run on his Carrow Road contract, having joined the Canaries in 2015.
He scored six goals in 24 appearances for the English Championship club last season.
Dorrans, who won the last of his 12 caps for Scotland in 2015, began his career at Livingston before moving to West Brom in 2008.
Rangers, who finished third in the Premiership, have been busy reshaping their squad.
Manager Pedro Caixinha has already made five new signings, with HJK Helsinki striker Alfredo Morelos in Glasgow on Monday for talks.
Mexican midfielder Carlos Pena and his compatriot, striker Eduardo Herrera, are awaiting the outcome of a work permit hearing by the Scottish Football Association and are also expected to join the club.
