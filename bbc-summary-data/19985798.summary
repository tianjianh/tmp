The photographs form part of an exhibition at the University of Cambridge's Polar Museum.
Curators said A Century On looks at Scott's legacy to science, exploration and art.
Scott and other team members died returning from the Pole in 1912 after being beaten to it by a Norwegian team.
The '"lost" photographs, thought to be missing for much of the 20th Century, were acquired by the Scott Polar Research Institute in the spring.
About 110 photographs, all taken by Scott, are being shown 10 at a time and changed fortnightly to avoid light damage.
The photographs give an insight into the team's Antarctic journey and portray the harsh conditions Scott's team faced.
Heather Lane, keeper of collections at the institute, said: "The staff of the Polar Museum wanted to end this centenary year by bringing Captain's Scott's story right up to date.
"We hope that the exhibition will let visitors get a real sense of Scott's impact on British culture and the ways in which his reputation has changed over the past century."
The exhibition runs from 17 October to 12 January 2013.
