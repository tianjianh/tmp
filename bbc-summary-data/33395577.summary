The company said recent incidents have included a father teaching his son how to "tombstone" - jumping from height into water- and drunk teenagers leaping from towers.
United Utilities said the reservoirs are "deep, freezing and deadly - no place for a quick dip".
The warning comes ahead of the school summer holidays.
United Utilities has more than 180 reservoirs which it said frequently attract risk-taking swimmers when the weather heats up.
Hazards include submerged objects, underwater currents and cold water.
Steve Hardcastle from United Utilities' Health and Safety team said: " The last thing we want is for a fun day out to turn into a tragedy.
"While teenagers are statistically the most likely to put themselves in harm's way, we've seen adults and even parents with young children taking the plunge, not realising just how much danger they are in.
"We're not trying to be killjoys or to prevent people from enjoying the summer.
"The risks of reservoir swimming are very real - and we want to people to stay safe."
