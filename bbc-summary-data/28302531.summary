Germany is to issue a stamp celebrating its team's victory in the football World Cup. Five million were  printed before the final match was even held.

The stamp was ordered by Germany's finance ministry which holds a large stake in Deutsche Post.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he had "dared to hope very early on" that the national team would win.
If Germany had lost to Argentina on Sunday the 0.60 euro (Â£0.47) stamps would have had to be pulped.
"It's wonderful that the team turned this dream into a reality," Mr Schaeuble said.
"I hope that this stamp will remind many citizens of the immense joy the team has given us."
The stamp will go on sale on Thursday after the first commemorative copies are presented to the coach, players and team staff.
Graphic designer Lutz Menze told German news agency DPA that the image does not show individual footballers in order to honour the whole team.
He said that producing a stamp usually takes six months but he had been contacted by the government after the tournament had already started.
It was Germany's fourth World Cup title after 1954, 1974 and 1990.
