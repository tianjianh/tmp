[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man borrowed computer to get 1,000 child abuse pictures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man banned from using computers borrowed a device to download 1,000 indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Bawn was found with almost 100 category A images - the most serious - when police seized the device in October.
The 21-year-old admitted six charges, including three counts of making indecent images of children.
The judge at Carlisle Crown Court sentenced him to a 20-month jail term, suspended for two years.
He was also ordered to complete a rehabilitation requirement and made subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.
Bawn, of Main Street, Frizington in Cumbria, was prohibited from using any computer equipment not fitted with police monitoring software after a similar conviction in 2014.
The latest offence came to light when a woman complained he had borrowed her computer but refused to give it back.
