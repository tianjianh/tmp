Andy Carroll: Bad refereeing calls cost West Ham against Leicester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham striker Andy Carroll says referee Jonathan Moss tried to "even things up" when he awarded Leicester City an added-time penalty on Sunday.

Moss controversially penalised Carroll when Leicester's Jeffrey Schlupp went down in the area, with Leonardo Ulloa converting the penalty to make it 2-2.
Carroll says Moss, who also sent off Foxes striker Jamie Vardy, gave "bad decisions" throughout the game.
"It's not acceptable. Week in, week out we've had bad decisions," said Carroll.

"I mean, it is a bad decision - it is bad decisions he has given all game. It's not the first time and probably won't be the last.
"I think he's trying to even it up and I think a lot of people have said that."
Vardy, having opened the scoring for the Premier League leaders, was shown a second yellow card when Moss ruled he dived in the area.
Carroll levelled from the spot following Wes Morgan's foul on Winston Reid, but after Aaron Creswell gave the visitors the lead it was substitute Carroll who conceded a late penalty.
The 27-year-old insists officials need help in making big calls and claims the Hammers could be occupying a Champions League spot had decisions this season gone their way.
"Whether they've got the camera, whatever you need - something needs to happen," added Carroll, who scored a hat-trick against Arsenal last weekend.
"We could have been third in the league now if we had eight points. Third - and now we're still fighting for fourth, fifth spot and we're slipping down by losing these points.
"We could be third and flying, and probably could still be in the cup. It is just disappointing and there's nothing we can do about it when others are making the decision."
