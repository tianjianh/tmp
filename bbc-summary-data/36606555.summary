Jersey skipper Luke Campbell hit a penalty over the bar before Scott Linton netted with a spot kick of his own to put the visitors ahead.
The hosts were level before half-time though through midfielder Cav Miley.
David Gormley's dipping effort after the break was fumbled by Jersey keeper Ryan Le Couteur but the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line.
Martin Cassidy and Paddy O'Toole took charge of the island side after former Aston Villa boss Brian Little stepped down from the job earlier in the month.
They had to watch on as Campbell blazed his penalty over after substitute Rupert Murray was pushed over in the box by Clyde defender Michael Oliver.
Linton's low penalty at the other end just about found the back of the net despite Jose Figuero getting a hand to it.
Jersey were not behind for long as good work from Murray set Miley through one-on-one with goalkeeper John Gibson and the Jersey midfielder kept his composure to slot the ball home.
The hosts found it harder to clear their lines after half-time, playing into a strong wind, and Clyde went closest to a winner when Gormley's awkward effort was fumbled towards his own line by Le Couteur but his blushes were spared by the referee and his assistant.
O'Toole and Cassidy had been assistants under Little, but remain unsure of their future roles, with the Jersey FA expected to name a new manager in the next few weeks.
Cassidy confirmed after the final whistle that he will hold talks with the JFA this week and is keen on the job.
