[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cowes 'floating bridge' ferry halted over 'weather'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Isle of Wight's troubled new "floating bridge" was suspended from service earlier over "weather conditions".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isle of Wight Council said the vessel was halted "as a precaution due to anticipated high winds and low tides".
A launch was used to ferry foot passengers from 05:00 BST with the ferry resuming service from 07:00.
The vessel has had a bumpy launch: it broke down a day after starting service on 14 May leading to its suspension and has also grounded since its re-launch.
The council said a build up of silt that caused the first grounding when the new Â£3.2m service was resumed on 7 June had been cleared.
The re-launch followed its suspension due to "training issues" on its second day in service on 15 May by the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA).
What caused the grounding on 10 June is yet to be revealed by the authority.
The chain ferry, which operates between Cowes and East Cowes, was brought after its predecessor was retired in January and cuts a 10-mile road diversion for drivers.
On Friday more than 130 campaigners who have nicknamed the chain ferry "Floaty McFloatfarce" protested against a range of design faults on the ferry.
