Harry Kane may have suffered a repeat of the ankle injury that kept him out for five Premier League games earlier this season, his Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino fears.

Kane had to be replaced after seven minutes of the 6-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Millwall on Sunday.
He was hurt when defender Jake Cooper blocked his shot close to the byeline.
"It looks like last time against Sunderland, it was the same ankle," Pochettino told BBC Sport.
"We need to assess some more and after tomorrow [Monday] we will see."
Kane, 23, left White Hart Lane on crutches and with his right foot in a protective boot. The striker has scored 24 goals this season, including eight in his past five games.
Spurs dominated League One Millwall despite the loss of their top scorer, with Son Heung-min netting a hat-trick, Vincent Janssen scoring his first goal from open play for the club and Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen both on target.
Kane's Spurs and England team-mate Alli said: "It is always horrible to lose a player like Harry but when he went off everyone stepped up a gear.
"We wish him a speedy recovery. It was an important win for us. We were hungry for goals."
Kane was named the Premier League Player of the Month for February and his tally of 19 league goals this season has only been matched by Everton's Romelu Lukaku.
England manager Gareth Southgate is due to name his squad on Thursday for a friendly with Germany on 22 March and a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania four days later.
Kane missed five league games and two EFL Cup matches earlier this season after twisting his ankle while tackling Sunderland's Papy Djilobodji in September.
