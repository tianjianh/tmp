Phil Sayer, 62, whose voice was heard on most of the automated PA systems on railway stations across the UK, died on Thursday.
Mr Sayer presented a daily show on BBC GMR - now Radio Manchester - in the 1980s and also read regional TV news.
He and his wife Elinor Hamilton later set up a company as voice-over artists.
Writing on their Facebook page, she said: "Phil Sayer - voice of reason, radio, and railways. A dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend.
"We are sorry to announce that this service terminates here."
Mr Sayer's website announced in March that he was retiring from voicing "due to a sudden decline in health".
Former BBC Radio Manchester colleague Mike Sweeney, said: "He was very, very funny and always made me laugh.
"I remember trying to have a serious conversation with him and it was difficult to do.
"He was always trying to make something humorous but in a very pithy sort of way."
