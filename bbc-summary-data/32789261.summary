The interactive 3D renderings are assembled from photos of the objects, sourced from tourists who visited them before the destruction.
So far the project has received more than 700 photos and produced 15 3D images of artefacts, mostly from the ransacked Mosul Museum.
The archaeologists who established the project hope to widen its scope to include objects lost at other sites, to violence or natural disasters such as the recent Nepal earthquakes.
