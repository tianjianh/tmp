[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shepperton waste plant approved after plans change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planned waste plant in Surrey has been approved by county councillors after earlier proposals were altered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Waste firm Sita already has permission to expand the facility in Charlton Lane, Shepperton, but has made "minor" amendments, a planning report said.
Changes include revised gasification technology, three new sub stations, alterations to buildings, and a minor reduction in waste tonnage at the site.
Surrey County Council's planning committee approved the changes.
Spelthorne Borough Council has always opposed the plans.
The report said new material considerations had emerged since the committee approved the plans on 17 March.
But it said officers did not consider any change was warranted to the overall conclusions.
In March, officers said there were a number of factors that outweighed harm to the green belt, including a lack of alternative sites and the need to increase recycling.
