Murray, seeded second, won 6-1 6-2 and will next play Belgian David Goffin - a warm-up for this month's likely meeting in the Davis Cup final.
British number two Aljaz Bedene earlier lost 6-3 7-6 (7-3) to American 13th seed John Isner.
Rafael Nadal beat Lukas Rosol 6-2 6-2, with Roger Federer also progressing.
The Swiss world number two cruised past Italian Andreas Seppi 6-1 6-1.
Murray was playing for the first time since losing to Novak Djokovic in Shanghai 19 days ago, and wasted little time in seeing off Coric.
The 18-year-old is the highest-ranked teenager at 46 in the world but could not fashion a single break point as he went down in under an hour.
Murray, 27, broke serve twice in each set as he made amends for a shock defeat by Coric in Dubai earlier this year.
The Scot has a busy schedule over the next few weeks, with the ATP Finals in London getting under way on November 15, followed by Britain's first Davis Cup final for 37 years from November 27.
He will take on Goffin for the second time when they meet at 09:30 GMT on Thursday, with Murray hoping to pick up valuable information he can take from the Paris hard courts to indoor clay in Ghent later this month.
"Any time you spend time on court with opponents you can learn about their game," he said.
"It's good to play against him but I will obviously, before the tie, watch matches of him playing on clay to learn and understand his game better on that surface."
Bedene found the 6ft 10in Isner's serve too tough an obstacle to overcome as another encouraging week came to an end for Britain's number two.
The 26-year-old was born in Slovenia but gained UK citizenship in March, and he could yet feature in the Davis Cup final as he awaits an ITF ruling over his eligibility to represent Great Britain.
Bedene came through two rounds of qualifying in Paris before beating Spain's Marcel Granollers in the main draw, and his ranking is set to reach a new high of 46 next week.
