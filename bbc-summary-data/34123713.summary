The victim, who is in his 70s, was left critically ill after being cut several times and beaten by a gang of men while he was in bed at his home at Clogharevan Park at about 02:40 BST on Monday.
Police believe a sum of money was stolen during the incident.
Parish priest Father Sean Larkin said the community was in shock.
"He's a very kind man, appreciative, grateful for the help he got," he said.
"Talking to people this morning, they're all in a state of shock and outrage that such a thing should happen to an old, frail man who lived on his own."
The man was taken to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
Police have appealed to anyone who noticed anything suspicious around the time of the attack to contact them.
