Chloe Jasmine: My online trolls should get a job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chloe Jasmine has told Newsbeat she was "gloriously unprepared" for the abuse and death threats she would receive while on the X Factor.

She became the fourth contestant to be eliminated from the live shows on Sunday.
When referring to the messages she had received from internet trolls, Chloe said: "I just don't understand why they don't have jobs.
"Why are you not writing about the war? Or recent epidemics? Or politics?"
However, despite the online abuse, Chloe has insisted giving up social media would be the "worst thing she could do".
She has also complained about stories written about her in the media, claiming she has felt like a "target".
"The press allegations were horrible," she said. "I don't understand how things can be printed if they have no verification or sources."
There was one story which particularly offended Chloe.
"Apparently I attend orgies on a regular basis," she explained. "I had never heard of an orgy before. I thought that was an abbreviation for organic food.
"I was waking up every morning, thinking, 'what horrible story will be printed about me?'
"Every time someone writes something derogatory or cruel or unkind, which has no factual basis, why don't they donate Â£1 to charity?"
Chloe has insisted she has "no regrets" about going on the X Factor because it made her a "stronger person".
While her time on the reality show is over, the model believes she will remain in the public eye.
"I did have a career before this which I had to put on hold and I will be returning to," she said.
"I really want to say you haven't heard the last from me."
