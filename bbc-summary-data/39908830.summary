Lee Congerton has worked with some of the biggest names at some of the biggest clubs in European football.

The Welshman was as a coach with Liverpool, chief scout at Chelsea and held director roles at Hamburg and Sunderland.
Congerton, who worked with Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, was appointed Celtic's head of recruitment in March.
For now he is celebrating  Celtic's historic first unbeaten Scottish top-flight season for 118 years.
But having built up his career outside Wales, the 43-year-old hopes one day he will get the chance to work for his country.
"I do feel I've got something to offer for the national team at whatever age group or in the future," Congerton said.
"I've been fortunate to be involved with the national under-18s before as a coach and I played for Wales at younger age groups.
"But at the moment I'm happy to be at Celtic and we will see where my journey takes me.
"I never forget that I'm Welsh. Me and my two daughters are always telling everyone we are Welsh not English.
"It's pleasing to see our national team doing so well.
"That's great for Chris [Coleman] and his staff there, they've done a marvellous job and I hope it continues for many a year. "
For now, as Congerton insists, the focus is on Celtic where he heads up the recruitment of players and the scouting network, domestically and abroad.
He has been reunited with Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, whom he worked alongside at Chelsea.
Congerton describes the former Swansea and Liverpool boss as "a great guy".
"He's a real football guy and he's a terrific coach, he's passionate about that and he's developed into a good manager," he added.
"He's approachable and a communicator and he wants to have fun along the way.
"But he's also fully focussed on winning trophies and that's why he's at a marvellous, big club like Celtic."
Congerton's playing career included spells with hometown club Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Weymouth and Crewe before injuries forced him to turn his attention to coaching.
He held coaching positions with Wrexham and Liverpool before joining Chelsea as a youth coach before progressing to chief scout.
Spells as technical director at German side Hamburg and sporting director at Sunderland followed before the move to Celtic.
"I've been fortunate to work in some fantastic cities," Congerton told BBC Wales Sport.
"You don't realise how big a club Celtic is until you become part of the family. Everyone has been so positive.
"It's easy because obviously I have a good relationship with Brendan from the past. All the senior staff have also been marvellous with me.
"They've made me feel a part of it and my family too. I've really appreciated what they've done for me in the short time I've been here.
"Hopefully I'll remain part of it for years to come."
