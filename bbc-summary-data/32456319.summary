A 50-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident in Pontypridd.
A police officer discovered the body at a flat at Andrews Court, Rickards Street, at 15:00 BST.
Areas of the town have been cordoned off, including near Pontypridd Rugby Club where officers conducted a search.
Det Supt Paul Hurley said: "We would like to speak to anybody who thinks they may have information that can help our investigation. No matter how insignificant the information may seem, we would like people to contact us.
"In particular, we want to speak to anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the vicinity of Andrews Court, Rickards Street, were the body was found, and also to anyone who may have seen something suspicious near the rugby ground on Sardis Road in the past couple of days."
Police said investigations were ongoing to confirm the identity of the body.
In a statement, Pontypridd Rugby Club said: "Supporters, partners and neighbours of Pontypridd RFC are advised that the Sardis Road stadium is currently not accessible. This is due to a police investigation into a major incident in the vicinity.
"The club will keep all concerned informed regarding access to the Sardis Road stadium as further information is received from the relevant authorities."
