[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 1-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stoppage-time free-kick from Andy Taylor snatched a point for Blackpool in a draw against Cambridge at Bloomfield Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took the lead after 17 minutes thanks to a brilliant 20-yard free-kick from Luke Berry, curling the ball past Dean Lyness and into the top right-hand corner.
Blackpool passed up a golden opportunity to equalise after 33 minutes when Danny Philliskirk's cross hit the hand of Harrison Dunk in the area.
Philliskirk took the penalty and placed it down the middle but goalkeeper Will Norris saved with his legs.
In first-half stoppage-time, Kyle Vassell's thunderous strike from 12 yards was met by a superb reflex save from Norris.
When Blackpool did finally get the better of Norris the woodwork denied them as a thumping 20-yard volley from Kelvin Mellor cannoned back off the crossbar after 73 minutes.
But in the first of seven minutes of injury-time, Taylor curled home from 20 yards to snatch a point and end Cambridge's run of three successive League Two wins.
