The feud broke out between several gangs at a shopping district in Waco.
What started as a fist fight, soon descended into a battle with knives, clubs, chains and eventually guns.
One witness described the scene as "a war zone", while a Waco policeman called it the most gruesome scene he had encountered in his career.
The incident happened shortly after midday on Sunday at the Twin Peaks Sports Bar and Grill in a shopping area called the Central Texas Market Place.
Up to five rival gangs got into a fight, apparently over parking space near the restaurant.
In addition to announcing the large number of arrests, Waco police department said on Monday they had temporarily closed the Twin Peaks restaurant for at least a week "due to the ongoing danger it presents to our community".
The authorities have increased security in the area to prevent further outbreaks of violence amid fears some of the gang members might return.
