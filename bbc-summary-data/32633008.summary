What the parties said
BBC expert analysis:
Nick Robinson, political editor:"No pollster, no pundit, no political leader saw it coming - not even David Cameron himself. Governing parties don't gain seats. Parties that have implemented painful cuts and are promising more certainly don't. Until that is the Conservative Party did - achieving what had seemed to be Mission Impossible - a Tory majority."
BBC Scotland correspondent James Cook: "Is this the end of the union? That is the question many people will be asking after the party which has fought for Scottish independence for 80 years swept to victory. The answer from the jubilant Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is a firm "no". She insists that her MPs will speak for all of Scotland, not just for the 45% who voted for the country to leave the United Kingdom last September. 'This changes nothing,'
Norman Smith, assistant political editor: "This has been an election which may have more profound consequences than almost any in living memory. "We now face a generational decision about our future in Europe, with an EU referendum in two years time almost certain. There will also be serious questions about the future of the Union, following an SNP landslide that has turned Scotland into a virtual one-party state. David Cameron's victory also represents a colossal achievement."
James Landale, deputy political editor: "After an extraordinary night, some brief conclusions: With a small majority or slight minority for David Cameron, Tory MPs will be much empowered. As such, Mr Cameron will need support from other parties to get business through. The PM will also need a better whips office to handle rebellions."
Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent, Newsnight: "For Labour the story of their terrible night is rapidly turning into the search for a new leader. So who will that be? Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, is almost certain to run. Even before this election, both he and another almost inevitable candidate, Chuka Umunna, had raised eyebrows inside the party at the work they had put in, preparing the ground with members and the unions for potential bids."
Robert Peston, economics editor: "Sterling is up (the most for seven years against the euro), share prices are up (especially bank shares like Lloyds and RBS, and energy shares such as Centrica), government bond prices are up. To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory. There are a few reasons."

The number of women in Parliament has risen by a third - the largest increase since 1997.
