Network Rail is getting £10m for "further planning" on how to protect a key coastal line which was destroyed in storms in 2014.

The government announcement came as Network Rail consults on options for the line left dangling in the air at Dawlish, Devon.
They include moving the line seawards and strengthening the cliffs above the line.
The line connects Devon and Cornwall with the rest of the UK.
More on the railway line cash, plus more Devon and Cornwall news.
The closure of the line was estimated to cost the South West economy more than £1bn.
The government money comes on top of £5m awarded earlier this year to Network Rail and £3m of Network Rail's money which has been spent on the project so far.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: "It is vital that we do all we can to prepare our transport system for extreme weather.
"Never has the impact of nature been better demonstrated than at Dawlish and it is important that we make our railways strong enough to weather any storm.
"The further funding we have today announced will help to make sure that this vital link remains open."
Mark Langman, Network Rail's managing director for the Western route said: "Keeping the South West connected to the rest of the country by rail is vital to the economy of the region."
