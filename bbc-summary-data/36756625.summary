The 25-year-old winger completed his move following a medical with the Athens-based club.
Panathinaikos confirmed that Wakaso would be at the club until the "summer of 2019".
Wakaso had been with Rubin Kazan since 2013 but spent periods on loan at both Celtic and Las Palmas during that time.
He played a key role in helping Ghana reach the Africa Cup of Nations final in Gabon next year, as well as the group phase of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
