In quotes: Reaction to the Autumn Statement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some of the reaction so far to Philip Hammond's first Autumn Statement as chancellor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chancellor Philip Hammond:
Setting out the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment of Brexit: "Its current view is that the referendum decision means that potential growth over the forecast period is 2.4 percentage points lower than would otherwise have been the case."
Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell:
He said the country had "expected a change in direction after those six wasted years" of a Conservative-led government. "Instead we have seen further cuts to earnings for those in work through cuts to Universal Credit and a living wage increase that is lower than expected under the previous chancellor. This is a new Conservative leadership with no answers to the challenges facing our country following Brexit, and no vision to secure our future prosperity."
SNP economic spokesman Stewart Hosie:
"The chancellor did give us plenty of information today but with no more than a kind of glib reference to being 'match-fit' at the beginning and a bit of deflection, very little actually on the elephant in the room which is Brexit. It's not as if the Treasury don't know what the consequences will be."
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron:
"We've seen the gap between what we could've had and what we will have is a quarter of a trillion pounds over this Parliament. Can you imagine the number of nurses, doctors, social workers, teachers, police officers and soldiers we could be paying for if this government hadn't headed for a hard Brexit that nobody voted for?"
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg:
Claiming the OBR forecasts are probably wrong, the Leave campaigner said: "They assume that we will apply tariffs on the same basis inside the European Union, which the chancellor will know he will be able to remove. And secondly, they're particularly gloomy on the prospects for financial services. I wonder, therefore, if we might be able to take a little bit more of an optimistic tone, and indeed with the freedoms we have outside the customs unions and the single market, the ability to solve the productivity problem."
Conservative former minister John Redwood:
"The OBR are probably still quite wrong about 2017 - their forecast probably is too low, their borrowing forecast is far too high, and we'll get good access to the single market once we're out of the EU."
Conservative former Chancellor George Osborne:
"The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has given us a very sobering assessment of the economic and borrowing challenges that Britain faces and the chancellor is right to keep his powder dry."
Conservative former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke:
"Would you finally confirm that wherever you hold your cards that you will continue, inside the government if necessary, to spell out the economic reality of the long-term benefits to this country if you want to develop a modern competitive economy, of retaining the access to our most important market in Europe, by retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union, and that no amount of short-term political pressure should allow you to be deflected from that?"
Labour former leader Ed Miliband:
Referring to the OBR's forecast that £58bn of the worsening in public finances "is due to the Brexit decision", he said: "Isn't this a salutary warning to us about the decisions we take in the coming months and years? And isn't it a very strong argument for us  remaining as close as possible to our largest trading area, the single market, and inside not outside the customs union?"
Conservative former minister Anna Soubry:
"Yes, there's some bad news there - this is the reality of Brexit - so we need now to make sure we do everything we can to mitigate the damage that it undoubtedly will cause."
London Mayor Sadiq Khan:
"I'm delighted that we today took the first steps towards a major new devolution deal for London. London has a bigger population than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined, but we have far less control over how our city is run. Today marks the first step in our journey to give the capital a greater voice so we can protect jobs, wealth and prosperity and provide an extra incentive for economic growth."
Green Party co-leader and MP Caroline Lucas:
Criticising the chancellor for failing to mention climate change, she said: "With Trump's election this could have been a moment for Britain to become a world-leader in the fight against catastrophic climate change but, instead, we see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of our times. Indeed, it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention climate change in his speech."
Unite general secretary Len McCluskey:
"What is clear is that the Conservative party owes the UK people a huge apology.  With debt set to soar, yet more promised targets missed and living standards still dropping, the truth is that Tory policies were a massive fraud.  Six years of pain for the poorest, six years of sustained assault on our public services - and with more to come - have taken our economy and country backwards."
Unison general secretary Dave Prentis:
"Hopes were raised the chancellor would conjure up extra cash for social care, and ease the burden on the NHS and local councils struggling to keep a lid on the growing crisis. Instead the government has chosen to ignore social care, preferring to look the other way as a growing number of elderly people are getting no care at all."
Adam Marshall, British Chambers of Commerce director general:
"Philip Hammond has delivered a responsible, solid and focused package that will reassure both business and markets."
CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn:
"The government is right to accept the independent Low Pay Commission recommendations, as firms want to see affordable rises in the minimum wage that protects the low-paid and avoids damaging job prospects. The chancellor should keep a watching brief on the challenges created by higher inflation and uncertainty weighing on near-term business investment."
Mike Cherry, Federation of Small Businesses' chairman:
"Our members are pleased with the confirmation of plans to remove £6.7bn from the business rates system, and the decision to make rural rate relief fairer for small firms, but there will need to be stronger fiscal interventions to boost the economy next year, with the prospect of weaker longer-term growth looming."
Simon Walker, Institute of Directors director general:
"The chancellor's attempts to increase productivity by investing in transport infrastructure, broadband and housing are welcome, but businesses would also have liked to have seen measures to encourage them to invest now. The OBR predicts that next year will be the low point for growth, so we are surprised that amidst all of the political and economic uncertainty there weren't many measures to help 'just managing' businesses now."
Mark Serwotka, Public and Commercial Services union general secretary:
"It is pure hypocrisy for the chancellor to talk about wanting to help struggling families but continue to hold down the wages of the government's own workforce who have suffered years and years of pay cuts. We will be talking to other unions in the coming weeks about taking action together to bring the pay freeze to an end, so we can put money back in people's pockets and help revive our flagging economy."
Gareth Stace, UK Steel director:
"Today's lack of any tangible announcements either on energy or business rates represent a blow for the steel sector. The crisis UK steel producers have faced in the last year highlighted the impact uncompetitive energy prices were having and we were looking to the Autumn Statement for a decisive response."
Michelle Mitchell, MS Society chief executive:
"We're deeply disappointed the Autumn Statement has failed to address the crisis facing social care. At a time when social care is in dire need, its absence from the chancellor's statement spells tough years ahead for the thousands of people, including the vast majority of people with MS, who need care and support."
Martin Tett, LGA transport spokesman:
Responding to the announcement of £1.1bn to be spent on improving Britain's local roads and public transport, he said: "The backlog of repairs on existing roads currently stands at £12bn and it would currently take 14 years to fix the backlog of potholes.... This gulf in funding puts the country's businesses at a competitive disadvantage and provides poor value for money."
Lord Porter, Local Government Association chairman:
"Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers have been clear about the desperate need for the chancellor to take action to tackle the funding crisis in social care. It is unacceptable that this has not been addressed."
Sarah McMonagle, Federation of Master Builders' director of external affairs:
"The chancellor's commitment to double annual capital spending on housing by 2020 demonstrates that he understands that house building and economic growth are intrinsically linked. For every £1 invested in construction, £2.84 is generated in the wider economy and therefore the best way to protect ourselves from an economic wobble as we leave the EU is to invest in our built environment."
Neil Broadhead, PwC's head of UK infrastructure:
"The chancellor's commitment to allocate £1bn to small 'shovel-ready' schemes like local road improvements is a much-needed and welcome move... However, this represents only one stage on the UK's long journey to achieve an infrastructure base fit for the 21st century."
Matthew Reed, The Children's Society's chief executive:
"There's been plenty of talk of helping the just-about-managing families -  the Jams - but sadly the chancellor's cake is half-baked. Unlike last year's Budget, he [the chancellor] hasn't introduced major new cuts for low-income families, but that won't offer much comfort to millions for whom today's announcements will have a very soggy bottom."
Bronwen Maddox, Institute for Government director:
"The government still has a huge number of commitments to deliver on top of Brexit. Despite emergency funding for prisons, today we saw little indication of how the chancellor will address the ticking time-bomb in other public services, like health and social care."
Charlotte Holloway, techuk policy director:
"A Match-fit Britain must be a Tech-fit Britain, and today the Chancellor gives UK tech a series of welcome announcements... However, there was a real gap when it came to additional support for boosting the UK's digital skills. Similarly, there was a missed opportunity to ensure that the benefits of digital are at the heart of the government's devolution ambitions. We will be looking to the government to reconsider these areas in the next Budget."
Quentin Willson, TV motoring journalist and FairFuelUK lead campaigner:
"I'm disappointed the chancellor didn't instantly put money into everyone's pockets by cutting duty. There's an immediate benefit to the economy. I'm surprised too given the Centre for Economics and Business Research has said cutting duty by 3p wouldn't change net tax receipts. This is a lost opportunity from a government still afraid of supporting drivers and roads."
Matt Sutherland, chief operating officer of business mobility specialists Alphabet:
On the chancellor's decision over cars gained through salary sacrifice, he said: "The government should consider the impact this will have on a large number of hard-working employees across the country. Salary sacrifice, in relation to company cars, is not just the preserve of upper-middle class workers; it's an important part of the employment package that many 'Jam' workers enjoy, both in the private or public sector."
