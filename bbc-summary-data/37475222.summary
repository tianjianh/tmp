Scottish Cup: League Two sides face tough second-round ties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At least two League Two clubs will exit the Scottish Cup at the second-round stage after the draw paired four of the senior clubs joining at that stage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Annan Athletic will host East Stirlingshire while Edinburgh City will entertain leaders Forfar Athletic.
Clyde, Elgin City, Montrose and Stirling Albion all have away ties against teams outside the Scottish Professional Football League.
Cowdenbeath host Lowland League leaders East Kilbride.
The visitors recorded the biggest win of the first round, thumping Vale of Leithen 9-1.
Barry Ferguson's Clyde will also be particularly wary of facing Brora Rangers, who are second in the Highland League, having lost to non-SPFL sides - Spartans and Formartine United - in the last two seasons.
Lowland League sides Preston Athletic and Gala Fairydean Rovers, plus East Superleague outfit Linlithgow Rose, will also be hoping to cause cup shocks when they host League Two outfits Montrose, Elgin and Stirling respectively.
Highland League champions Cove Rangers will host either local rivals Turriff United or juniors Bonnyrigg Rose, who sit second in the East Superleague and are at home for their replay.
This season's Highland League leaders, Buckie Thistle, who hammered Inverurie Loco Works 6-0 in the first round, are at home to Lowland League side Gretna FC 2008.
West Superleague side Beath Juniors, who won last season's Scottish Junior Cup and were also 6-0 winners over Highland outfit Strathspey Thistle after beating Auchinleck Talbot in the preliminary round, are away to Lowland League side BSC Glasgow.
