The 24 year old collapsed on the pitch on Tuesday night during a pre-season friendly. He was pronounced dead in hospital on Wednesday.
Speaking in Parliament, sports minister Tracey Crouch, praised Italy's system of screening athletes.
Mr Dian had been was on trial at the Ryman Premier League club.
Ms Crouch said: "I know in Italy, for example, they screen all athletes, amateur and professionals, for heart conditions and this has resulted in a drop in the death rate of 89% since it was introduced.
"It's an important area and one that I'll be looking at in some detail in the forthcoming sports strategy."
A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Dian's heart stopped while he was playing football. Further tests on his heart are due to be carried out.
His brother, Prince, said the death had still "not sunk in".
He said: "[In] days to come... where it's just going to be me and my mum in the house and I'm going in his room and not seeing my brother - that's when it's actually going to hit me."
