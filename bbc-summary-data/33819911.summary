The 24-year-old defender has come through the ranks at St James' Park and made 32 first-team appearances so far for the Premier League club.
He has won 18 caps and also had loan spells at Birmingham City and Rangers.
"We're delighted to have Shane on board, he has natural left-footed ability," Millwall manager Neil Harris told the club website.
"He can provide terrific deliveries into the box and is equally comfortable playing at left-back as he is on the left-wing, that kind of versatility will be very important to us."
Ferguson will be with the squad for Millwall's opener away at Shrewsbury Town.
The Lions have also signed 19-year-old defender Christian Mbulu from Brentwood Town on a one-year professional contract.
