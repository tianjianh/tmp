The 29-year-old, who scored 10 goals for the Bees last season, was injured in Saturday's 2-0 win over Accrington.
"He has been an outstanding player for me and doesn't always get the plaudits he deserves," Barnet boss Martin Allen told BBC Radio London.
"He is great to have in the dressing room and we are planning his surgery to get him in as soon as possible."
