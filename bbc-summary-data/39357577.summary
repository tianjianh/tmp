Harlow is celebrating the 70th anniversary of being designated a new town.

It became one of the UK's first post-war settlements in 1947 following the previous year's New Towns Act.
It is credited as having the first modern high-rise residential tower block, The Lawn, which opened in 1951.
Designed for 60,000 by English architect, Frederick Gibberd, the town also included the first all-pedestrian shopping precinct.
In April 1964, councillor Reginald Ward, chairman of the Harlow Urban District Council, showed off Harlow to visiting Italian prime minister Aldo Moro, from the roof gallery of the Town Hall.
Today, Harlow is a thriving town with a population of 85,500, which includes residents from a wide range of countries.
A mural featuring Harlow citizens, including its MP Conservative Robert Halfon, was created by Polish artist Jola Kudela for the book festival this month.
The artwork, called "We're all the same boat", was created after a Polish man was killed in the town.
The artist Ms Kudela said: "The message is just relax guys and let's live together peacefully and quietly."
A large number of events are being planned to celebrate the town's 70th birthday and more information is available on the Harlow 70 council website.
