Pooley Bridge collapse: £300,000 temporary crossing in place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final sections of a temporary river crossing have been put into place to replace a 300-year-old bridge which collapsed during Storm Desmond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original 18th Century stone structure across the River Eamont at Pooley Bridge, Cumbria, was washed away by floodwater in December.
The damage effectively cut off the village from the south.
Cumbria County Council said the £300,000 temporary crossing would be open to the public by Easter.
Funding for the project has come in part from a £40m government aid package to flood-hit areas.
Plans for permanent replacement have been approved in principle, although no construction date has yet been set.
