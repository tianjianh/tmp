Investigation launched into death during police car stop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a 25-year-old man six days after he was stopped by police in east London is being investigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edir Frederico Da Costa was travelling with two others in a car when he was detained in Woodcocks, Beckton, at 22:00 BST on 15 June.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched a probe and is appealing for witnesses.
Mr Da Costa was taken to hospital in a "critical condition" and died on Wednesday.
An IPCC spokesman said it was believed the police officers used force and CS gas during the incident.
But a post-mortem examination suggested there were no injuries to suggest severe force was used.
The IPCC spokesman said: "Mr Da Costa became unwell, first aid was administered, an ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital.
"Tragically on Wednesday 21 June, Mr Da Costa died."
