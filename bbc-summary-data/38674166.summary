The house fire which the crew was on its way to was put out by another team, Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
The county's chief fire officer, Roy Wilsher, said the crash was a "tragic incident".
"Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service is working with the police to establish exactly what happened and why," he added.
The fire engine has been removed from the scene and is to be examined as part of the investigation, a Hertfordshire Police spokesman said.
