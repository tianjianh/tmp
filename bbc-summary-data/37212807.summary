The 28-year-old from Wrexham won silver in the double sculls at Rio 2016 alongside Katherine Grainger.
She is the first Welsh woman to win an Olympic rowing medal, but Thornley is debating whether to continue rowing.
"I haven't made my mind up for sure yet, I just need a bit of time to come back down to earth after the whirlwind [of Rio]," she said.
"I'm going on holiday on Wednesday with my boyfriend so I'm looking forward to that. It should be nice to get back to normality and then see how I feel.
"Of course after the Olympics you watch back the race and you're like: 'Of course I want to do that again, it's amazing.'
"But you have got to think about the dark days in the winter and everything like that.
"Even though I love the training aspect I've got to think about it properly before I make the decision to carry on or not.
"But if I do carry on, I want time just to enjoy normal life for a little bit."
Thornley's achievement in Rio was all the more remarkable as her partnership with Grainger was dissolved earlier this year.
The pair were dropped from the double sculls but reunited for the Olympics just six weeks prior to winning their medal.
