Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning admits abusing boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has pleaded guilty to a string of historical sex offences against boys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 73-year-old admitted 29 charges of abuse against boys aged between nine and 16, at Southwark Crown Court.
He denied 12 further charges and will face a trial beginning on 24 November at the same London court.
Denning, of Basildon in Essex, was charged as part of Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.
The offences Denning admitted were committed between 1967 and 1984.
They were made up of 26 counts of indecent assault and three of indecency with a child.
The charges he denies include indecent assault, indecency with a child and more serious sexual offences.
Denning, who was first arrested by Yewtree detectives in June last year, was remanded in custody until his trial, which is expected to last up to two weeks.
He was one of the original line-up on BBC Radio 1 when the station launched in 1967.
He was also the first announcer heard on BBC Two when it took to the air in 1964.
