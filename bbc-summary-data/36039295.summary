Structural problems close Deerness Bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bridge in County Durham has closed after inspectors identified "issues with its structural integrity".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Traffic and pedestrians have been banned from Deerness Bridge, between Ushaw Moor and New Brancepeth.
Durham County Council said the closure would last at least a month and signed diversions were in place.
Alternative arrangements were being made for buses, including services to Durham Community Business College and St Leonard's School.
John Reed, the council's head of technical services, said: "We are now assessing whether we can undertake any temporary measures to address these issues and enable the road to reopen.
"At this stage we anticipate that the bridge will be closed for at least a month but we will have a better indication of timescales once this assessment has been completed."
