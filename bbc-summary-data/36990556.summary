The Ignition event will feature exhibitions and driving displays, in what organisers say is the most ambitious and complex motor show to be staged in Scotland.
The three-day event includes stunt driving performances and exhibitions.
A special track has been constructed on the banks of the river Clyde.
It is a mile long and snakes around the SECC, Clyde Auditorium and the SSE Hydro, making it Glasgow's first ever street circuit.
Former racing driver David Coulthard will take to the track on Saturday in a Formula 1 car.
Five-time British Rally Champion Jimmy McRae will complete the first lap of the riverside track to open the event.
He will be driving a car that belonged to his son, fellow rally driver Colin McRae.
The Stig, from Top Gear, will be undertaking a series of power laps in some supercars while the world famous Top Gear Live Stunt Team will also perform.
The festival finishes on Sunday 7 August.
