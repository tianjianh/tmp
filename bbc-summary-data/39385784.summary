A candlelit vigil has been held in Cardiff to pay tribute to the victims of the London terror attack.

The vigil, on a smaller scale to the one held in London on Thursday, took place on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay.
Four people were killed and dozens injured after Khalid Masood drove a car on a pavement and stabbed a policeman before being shot dead on Wednesday.
Masood's mother's house in Trelech, Carmarthenshire, has been searched.
Police said nobody living at the house was a suspect and are appealing for information as they try to establish whether Westminster attacker Masood acted alone.
His fourth victim has been named as Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham, south London - one of three people killed by Masood's car on Westminster Bridge.
Fifty people were hurt in the attack - six are still in a critical condition while two have life-threatening injuries - and nine people remain in custody.
The Welsh vigil was organised by the Cardiff branches of Stand Up To Racism and the Muslim Engagement and Development charity.
Religious leaders, faith groups, assembly members and the public attended.
"After watching the terrible attack in Westminster on Wednesday, Wales want to show we stand united," said Joe Redmond, joint secretary of the Stand Up To Racism Cardiff branch.
A minute's silence was held at the start of the vigil.
