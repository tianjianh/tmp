[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a 3,800-plot cemetery in Caerphilly have been submitted to help address a shortage in the county borough.

Proposals for the site next to Old Nantgarw Road, Groeswen, include 2,000 burial spaces and 1,800 cremation plots.
The council said it would ease pressures on dwindling plot spaces.
If agreed, the cemetery would serve residents living in the Aber Valley area and Caerphilly town centre.
Concerns have been raised over the lack of pedestrian access and poor public transport links to the site.
But the council said it was in discussions with bus operator Stagecoach to divert some of its services to stop nearby.
A report to the council said the cemetery would be open from 08:00 BST to 19:30 Monday to Saturday and 09:00 to 17:30 on Sundays and would hold no more than two funerals a week.
The plans also include an office building, public toilets, a car park, a new access road and walking paths.
A decision on the plans is expected on Wednesday.
