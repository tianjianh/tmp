Brash, who was part of the team that won jumping gold at the 2012 London Olympics, finished with 38.63 points after a clear round on Hello M'lady.
His Olympic team-mate Ben Maher took second place while Belgian Nicola Philippaerts came third.
Briton John Whitaker, riding Ornellaia, finished in fifth place at Olympia.
"It's nice to get a victory because she is an exceptional horse and she was really switched on to her job," Brash said.
Brash missed the Rio Olympics, where Team GB failed to qualify for the show jumping final, after injuries to his top two rides.
