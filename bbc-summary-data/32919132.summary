[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Newcombe, 35, of Llansamlet, Swansea, drove a stolen car into the front of Mond Valley Golf Club in Clydach near the city in May last year.
Swansea Crown Court heard he then made off in a van, which was later found to contain stolen golf equipment.
He admitted burglary, theft, dangerous driving and handling stolen goods.
During his getaway, Newcombe was pursued by police and drove off-road on to waste ground, where his van got stuck.
He was then arrested for the golf club burglary and other thefts.
Speaking after the case, Det Con Craig Earley of South Wales Police described Newcombe as a "prolific offender" who had led police on a "dangerous pursuit".
