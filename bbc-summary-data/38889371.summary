[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 0-0 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury earned another point in their battle for League One survival as they drew 0-0 at home to MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There was only one shot on target in a fairly even first half, and although mid-table Dons went closest to winning it after the break, neither side did enough to merit the three points.
That meant fourth-bottom Bury, who have the league's worst defensive record, registered back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since April but still slipped two points from safety.
Chuks Aneke curled an early effort wide for Dons before Cameron Burgess headed over for Bury.
Dons replied with Harvey Barnes testing Joe Murphy while Ben Tilney curled a free-kick just wide.
Bury's George Miller replaced the injured James Vaughan at half-time and moments after the restart the youngster had a shot from a tight angle saved.
Strike partner Tom Pope then headed over while Aneke fired straight at Murphy.
Andrew Tutte's half-volley stung the hands of Dons keeper David Martin but the visitors should have broken the deadlock as Stuart O'Keefe side-footed over from a Barnes cut-back.
Murphy then pulled off a smart save to turn over Tilney's close-range strike and ensure the game ended goalless.
