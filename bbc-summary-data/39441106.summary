Samantha Baldwin, 42, from Newark, was last seen in Nottingham city centre on Monday and is believed to be with Louis Madge, 9, and Dylan Madge, 6.
Police said the case was being treated as abduction and confirmed Ms Baldwin did not have legal custody of the boys.
There have been several sightings and police are "open minded" over whether they had left the UK.
A 62-year-old woman and another woman, 36, both arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been bailed.
