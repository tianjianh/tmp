General election 2017: What you need to know in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tomorrow Wales and the rest of the UK goes to the polls in 2017's general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales elects 40 MPs to the House of Commons in 40 constituencies.
All 40 Welsh MPs from the last parliament are standing again - with a total of 213 candidates taking part.
Here's what you need to know ahead of Thursday's poll.
WELSH LABOUR
Welsh Labour is standing in 40 seats in Wales. It is defending 25 of them.
Its focus has been on defending what it holds - with the party playing down the chance of gains.
But it has said it has run serious campaigns in Gower, the Vale of Clwyd and Cardiff North, where the Conservatives have small majorities.

Early on in the campaign BBC Wales produced a list of seats to keep an eye on on the night - seats which could spell out the story of this election.
They include Bridgend, the backyard of First Minister Carwyn Jones, that is being eyed-up by the Conservatives. The challenge for the seat was explored by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.
Other key seats to watch, include:
It may also be worth keeping an eye on Blaenau Gwent, which is held by Labour and is also being targeted by Plaid Cymru.
Voters elect MPs through a system known as first-past-the-post - the winner of the poll is the candidate with the most votes.
Polling stations open at 07:00 BST on Thursday and close at 22:00.
The ballot paper will list all the candidates standing in your constituency. Put a cross in the box next to the candidate you want to vote for.
The deadline to register to vote was 22 May. It is now too late to do so.
If you need an emergency proxy vote - if you are called away unexpected for work or you suffer a medical emergency - you can apply by 17:00 on polling day.
