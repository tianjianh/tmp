[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 175th Royal Highland Show is to open at the Ingliston showground in Edinburgh later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The event, which showcases Scottish farming, food and drink and rural living, will run until Sunday 21 June.
The event will include the showcasing of thousands of livestock, equestrian shows, forestry events and cooking competitions and demonstrations.
In 2014, the show attracted nearly 180,000 visitors, and had an estimated economic impact of Â£47m.
The show, organised by the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, has a particular focus on food production this year, to tie in with 2015 being Scotland's Year of Food and Drink. There will be live tastings and cooking demonstrations designed to educate both children and adults on how the food they eat is produced.
Meanwhile, the show serves a practical purpose for those working in the agricultural sector, as the trade show gives farmers a chance to look into the industry's latest technologies and developments.
The first Royal Highland Show was held in 1822 in Edinburgh's Canongate, on a site now occupied by the Scottish Parliament. Until 1960, it moved location every year.
It has been held at Ingliston every year since 1960 - except in 2001, when foot and mouth disease meant the show was cancelled.
