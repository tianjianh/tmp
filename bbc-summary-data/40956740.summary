Loch Ness lifeboat has busiest-ever day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loch Ness RNLI have attended three separate incidents on their busiest day ever.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first call, shortly before 11:00, was to assist an 8.3m yacht which had run aground near Glenmoriston.
Before returning to base, they were called to Temple Pier to help with a motor cruiser which had a rope caught in its propeller.
Shortly after returning to base at 14:45, the lifeboat was called out to a yacht drifting near Urquhart Castle.
A statement from the RNLI Loch Ness lifeboat station said: "A memorable day for the volunteers at Loch Ness boathouse in a year that is shaping up to be their busiest yet."
A lifeboat on Loch Ness was first introduced in 2008.
