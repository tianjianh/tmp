[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Virgin Trains has announced an increase in weekday trains between Edinburgh and London on the east coast main line.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There will be eight new journeys a day from 16 May.
The company said the four new services in each direction offer journeys every half-hour for most of the day.
The additional services between the two capital cities from May means seat capacity has been boosted by 22,000 on the route - an increase of almost a third.
Two additional services will also be added on Sundays.
The company is releasing thousands of Â£25 fares for the new timetable as part of the launch. It will also extend the time possible to book tickets from 12 weeks to 24 weeks.
David Horne, managing director on the east coast route, said: "This is a major boost for our customers travelling between Edinburgh and London who will be able to catch a train every half-hour for most of the day.
"We have seen how increasing capacity and frequency adds to the popularity of train travel and we're confident that customers will respond positively to these changes."
