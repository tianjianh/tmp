The US-based star sent a heartfelt video message of thanks which was screened at the Brangwyn Hall for the Lord Mayor's award ceremony.
Zeta Jones said she "truly loved" Swansea and would always call it her home.
Other honours went to singer Bonnie Tyler and broadcaster Huw Edwards.
Zeta Jones said in the video: "There's no place like home - and what a wonderful place to call home.
"I believe it's not what I have done for Swansea, but what Swansea has done for me."
She added: "I truly love Swansea. I fly the flag wherever I go, and will always call Swansea my home."
The inaugural Lord Mayor's Honours have raised money for local charities as well as honouring stars of screen, sport and stage and local communities.
Zeta Jones' parents Pat and David were at the ceremony to accept the award on her behalf.
Swansea City coach Alan Curtis and rugby union former Wales international Geoff Wheel were honoured for services to sport, while four Swansea poppy sellers received recognition for services to military and defence.
Swansea City FC also won the honour for services to Swansea's global reputation.
