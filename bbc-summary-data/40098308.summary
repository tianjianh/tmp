Madine, 26, who has scored 16 goals in 78 appearances for Bolton, has signed a new two-year deal.
Wheater, 30, has made 167 appearances for the Trotters and has agreed a new one-year deal with an option.
"Hopefully, we will have another season like last and I don't see any reason why not with the quality we have in the squad," Wheater told the club website.
