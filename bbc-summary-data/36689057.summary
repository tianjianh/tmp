Crystal Palace have made a £25m bid to sign Christian Benteke from Liverpool.

The 25-year old striker is at Euro 2016 with Belgium but has fallen out of favour at Liverpool since boss Jurgen Klopp took over last October.
The forward joined the Reds for £32.5m in July 2015 under former boss Brendan Rodgers and has scored 10 goals.
He has started only eight league games under Klopp and last month said: "I'd like to stay if I remain in the coach's plans. If not, it'll become difficult."
Palace, who completed the signings of England winger Andros Townsend from Newcastle and France international goalkeeper Steve Mandanda from Marseille on Friday, were also reportedly interested in Benteke's Belgium team-mate Michy Batshuayi.
But the 22-year-old forward has been linked with a £33m move to Chelsea.
