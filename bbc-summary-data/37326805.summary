The veteran striker opened the scoring on 52 minutes, slotting home a low strike, before firing a second into the top corner.
Dean Brotherston added a third 10 minutes from time, just moments after coming off the bench.
Jean Yves Mvoto headed in a late consolation for Raith Rovers.
Dobbie was denied a hat-trick in the closing stages with his effort coming off a post.
But it was smiles all round at Palmerston when news of Hibs' surprise home defeat to Ayr filtered through, meaning Gavin Skelton's men take over at the top.
