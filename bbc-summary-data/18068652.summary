[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both people - a man and a woman thought to be in their 70s - are reported to have been hiking on the Spanish island when they collapsed.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed that two British nationals died on 13 May.
A spokesman said: "We are providing consular assistance to the families."
Spanish media report
 that the female pensioner was among a group of British tourists walking in the south of the island when she suffered a cardiac arrest.
She was one of a number of holidaymakers affected by the extreme heat during the trek near Presa del Salto del Perro in the Mogan district.
Meanwhile, the male pensioner is thought to have fallen into a ravine during a trek with his wife at the beauty spot Barranco de Azuaje in the north of the island.
Temperatures have been reaching 40°C in parts of the Canary Islands in recent days, when the average temperature for this time of year is about 20°C.
The World Meteorological Organisation has issued an orange weather warning for "extreme high temperatures" covering Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, and for parts of Gran Canaria and Tenerife.
