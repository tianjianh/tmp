Megan Hurley, 15, from Merseyside, was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing on 22 May.
The bells of St Nicholas Church, in Halewood, rang 22 times for the victims as mourners arrived, some wearing Megan's favourite colour orange.
Michael and Joanne Hurley described their daughter as "fun-loving, sincere, caring and beautiful".
Around 250 friends and family gathered at 11:45 BST at the church, where a vigil was held in memory of Megan last month.
Many wore colourful ribbons and carried bright flowers in memory of the teenager.
Mourners filed silently into the church including Megan's brother Bradley, 20, who was badly injured in the attack.
An instrumental version of Somewhere over the Rainbow was then played as those lining the streets moved closer to hear the service, broadcast via loudspeakers outside the church.
The bells rang out 22 times as the white carriage carrying Megan's coffin arrived at the church, pulled by horses with plumes of orange.
Flowers reading "Queen" and "Meg" were laid out as crowds wearing orange bows gathered in the churchyard to hear the service.
The Revd Gedge read an emotional tribute from her brother Bradley, who attended the service in a wheelchair saying he had lost his "best friend".
Carol Thomas, Megan's head of year, became emotional as she remembered how she "had lots of friends and was true to them all."
"She had a warmth about her that could not be imitated. She was proof of how fine a young person can be".
School friends huddled together in groups, supporting each other as they left the service to Ariana Grande's One Last Time.
There was a sorrowful mood as mourners left in tears before the family followed the cortege to a private ceremony.
Megan's parents said their daughter had "waited so long" to attend the Ariana Grande concert and had been given tickets as a birthday surprise.
Carole Thomas, Megan's head of year at Halewood Academy, read a eulogy, which she described as coming "from my heart".
She said Megan was "a quiet, lovely, hard working student."
As the funeral came to a close the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful was sung.
The service concluded with the Lord's Prayer and people left the church to an instrumental version of One Last Time by Ariana Grande, as friends and family left to attend a private ceremony.
