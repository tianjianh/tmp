McIlroy is going for his third career win at the tournament, having also won it for his maiden Tour win in 2009.
"I have some great memories and I get a lot of support here," said McIlroy.
The Northern Irishman will face some stiff competition from the likes of former Dubai resident Henrik Stenson, who won the Desert Classic in 2007.
Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen and Graeme McDowell are also in the field at the Emirates Club.
"Leaving any tournament without a win is sort of disappointing, but you try to put a positive spin on it," said McIlroy, who is a combined 81 under par for his last six appearances in this event.
"I think golfers, that is what we usually do. We are disappointed for a bit and then we try to put positive spins on it, and the nice thing is there's always a next week in golf.
"I'm sort of going for three in a row in Dubai with winning here last year and then winning the DP World Tour Championship at the end of last season, so it seems to bring out my best golf.
"There are a couple of little things that I took from Abu Dhabi (where he finished third) and worked on last week.
"So hopefully you will see my game just a little bit sharper and I will be trying to win for the third time to join Ernie Els as the only people to win three times."
