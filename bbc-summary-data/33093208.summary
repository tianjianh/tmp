Aberdeen Airport traffic 'hit by oil sector cuts'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen International Airport managers have attributed a sharp fall in passenger numbers to cost-cutting measures by oil and gas companies.

The airport reported that traffic fell year-on-year by 8.1% to just over 300,000 in May.
Helicopter numbers were down by 13.1% and fixed wing traffic by 7.2%.
Airport managing director Carol Benzie said passenger traffic fell across all three sectors - helicopters, international and domestic.
She added that the drop was due to "the impact of the cost efficiencies currently being driven throughout the oil and gas sector".
The figures contrasted with strong numbers reported by both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports.
Glasgow Airport recorded its busiest May in seven years after 785,063 passengers travelled through its doors - an increase of 13.3% on the same period last year.
International traffic grew by 17%, while domestic traffic increased by 9.1%.
Glasgow Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "May has been a show-stopping month with the launch of 10 new services, including a number of firsts for Glasgow, Scotland and the UK.
"Following our busiest April on record, we've also been recognised as one of the fastest growing airports in Europe this year by ACI Europe.
"Our growth in 2015 has been truly unprecedented, reflected in the fact we've enjoyed consistent double-digit increases in our passenger numbers every month since November."
Edinburgh recorded more than one million passengers last month, making it the airport's busiest May on record.
The airport said growth had largely been driven by new routes launched within the last year.
