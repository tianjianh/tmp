[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who posted "degrading" pictures of two women he knew on a porn site has been given a six-month suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oliver Whiting, 37, of Eastbourne, took the photos from social media accounts.
He posted the images on adult websites, where he invited other users to join him in posting lewd comments.
The judge at Hastings Magistrates' Court said his violation and degradation of women required punishment in order to deter others.
Whiting had admitted 11 offences of making offensive posts at an earlier hearing.
Six offences related to one victim, and five to the other.

Whiting, of Langdale Close, was ordered to attend a sex offenders' treatment programme and banned from using social media.
He was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.
Next to a picture of one woman he knew, which featured her young child, he labelled her a "slag" and a "whore".
Prosecutor Elizabeth Green said the victim was left "distressed" at being unable to get the US-based website to remove the image, and it still remains on there.
In a statement, the victim added: "I felt alone and that no-one would help me."
Ms Green said a second young woman known to Whiting was left "physically sick" and "shocked" after she discovered he had also posted a picture of her next to offensive comments he had written.
Whiting was charged after previously being cautioned for similar offences involving four other women, an earlier court hearing was told.
Defending, Noelle Magennis said Whiting had shown "genuine heartfelt remorse", been the subject of a "public witch-hunt" and had contacted the website to try to get the images removed.
Sentencing him, district judge Teresa Szagun said: "What you used those photographs for defies belief.
"You uploaded them to a website that encourages other men to masturbate then capture that activity and upload those photographs on that site.
"The accompanying comments that you posted were vile, aggressive sexual fantasies.
"The impact to the victims has been far-reaching, ranging understandably from fear, disgust and extreme humiliation."
