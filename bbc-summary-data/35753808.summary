The 24-year-old missed the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction last month in order to concentrate on his international future.
Vince has played three T20 matches so far for England, scoring 125 runs, with a strike-rate of 119.04.
"If it's a platform to go on and play other formats for England, then that'll be ideal," he told BBC South Today.
"First and foremost, I'm going to try and help England win the World Cup and try to learn off some very good players when I am out there.
"It will be a good experience and one I cannot wait to start."
County team-mates Liam Dawson and Reece Topley have also travelled to Mumbai with the England T20 squad.
All-rounder Dawson, 26, was included despite head coach Trevor Bayliss admitting he had never seen the all-rounder play competitively, while left-arm paceman Topley was preferred to Chris Woakes.
Led by captain Eoin Morgan, England's first match will be against the West Indies on 16 March, with Sri Lanka and South Africa and a group winner from the first-round qualifiers their other Super-10 opponents.
"I think having it in the unofficial home of cricket is massively exciting," said Topley, 22. "It's going to be brilliant and it's definitely going to be testing."
"Everybody talks about the size of the grounds being a little smaller. They talk about the heat and the dew at night having an effect. It will be a great occasion."
