[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An election count has been completed six days after the polls closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Broadland District Council in Norfolk postponed its town and parish count on Friday because staff had worked through the night for the general election and its council election.
Returning officer Phil Kirby said: "We fully understand the disappointment... but we felt a delay was necessary to ensure accurate results."
The count was held on Wednesday to ensure candidates could attend.
The council said 35,314 votes were cast in the elections for 14 town and parish councils.
"We have received 223,000 papers which we have had to count for all three elections," said Mr Kirby.
"If you just take the parish council elections, we are just short of 35,000 which is the most we have ever had to count."
Conservative Keith Simpson was re-elected as the Broadland MP with 26,808 votes on Thursday.
The Tories also retained leadership of the council.
