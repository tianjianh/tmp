Conservative chairman involved in Guto Bebb row resigns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of a local Conservative association who had a row with his MP during the election campaign has resigned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Burchett is standing down from the helm of the Tories in Aberconwy, citing personal and business reasons.
During the campaign he argued with Guto Bebb, re-elected as the area's MP.
Mr Bebb called Mr Burchett an "idiot" and "a disgrace" for accusing him of not doing enough to support the local party.
Mr Burchett had told Mr Bebb he had "spent the last 18 months making excuses" for him.
The row had broken out in a series of emails leaked to the Golwg360 website and seen by BBC Wales.
