Officers were called to reports of a "break-in" at the property in Pemberton Way in Shaw, Oldham, at about 03:15 BST, police said.
Two children, aged one and six, who were in the house have been released and are now safe with family.
A number of nearby residents have been evacuated from their homes "as a precaution", the force added.
Negotiators have been speaking to the man and the one-year-old child was released after about an hour.
A second child, aged six, was released at about 06:00 BST. The children are being looked after by family members.
Ch Supt Neil Evans said: "At this moment in time we are dealing with a situation where one lady is being held against her will.
"A smell of gas was also reported... We don't know the source of that... so as a caution we are isolating supply at the moment.
"We are continuing in our efforts to bring this situation to a safe resolution.
"Our number one priority is the safety of all those involved, as well as other members of the public."
