The majority of TT fans who found themselves stranded after ferry cancellations on Tuesday have now travelled home, said operators.

Hundreds of people were affected after high winds cancelled sailings to and from the Isle of Man.
The Steam Packet Company said: "it had no choice" but to halt Tuesday's 19:45 sailing from Douglas to Heysham and the return journey at 02:15 on Wednesday.
A spokesman said most passengers "have now travelled on alternative sailings."
The decision to cancel the ferry sailings was taken as winds in the Irish Sea were gusting in excess of 60mph (50 knots).
Chief Executive Mark Woodward said: "We had 540 passengers booked on Tuesday's 19.45 sailing to Heysham, and by midday on Wednesday more than half that number had already been accommodated on scheduled Ben-my-Chree and Manannan services.
"There were 469 motorcycles on Wednesday morning's Manannan sailing, which is a record".
TT fans Rich Clover and Andy Smith from Gloucester told the BBC they were trying to get an alternative sailing.
"What can you do about it? Absolutely nothing," added Mr Clover.
"We know some of the lads who are racing so we might be able to stay with them tonight. If not there's the good old Sea Terminal floor.
"We'll get through it, it's not the end of the world".
Rob Jarvis from Middlesex said he was eager to get home to his wife who was recovering from an operation.
"There's a lot going on at home right now and I need to get back soon.
"The communication hasn't been good so I thought I'd get down here to the Sea Terminal to try and sort it out. Obviously, everyone else had the same idea".
A Facebook page called the TT and Manx Grand Prix Helpline was established to offer free help to all TT visitors.
