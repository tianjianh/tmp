The DUP's Gary Middleton saw poppies burning on one bonfire in the Creggan area and said offensive materials on all bonfires "must be challenged".
Police said they were investigating "flags and symbols" on the bonfire.
Meanwhile, officers have sent a file to prosecutors over symbols burned on a loyalist bonfire in Antrim on 11 July.
The loyalist bonfire in the Ballycraigy estate attracted criticism after effigies of republican politicians and Irish tricolours with sectarian and racist slogans were displayed.
The Irish News reported that police are bringing a "landmark prosecution" over the Ballycraigy bonfire.
A spokesperson for the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) told the BBC that prosecutors received a file from the police "in relation to allegations connected to activity at a bonfire in Antrim on 11 July 2014".
"That file was received last month and remains under active consideration," the PPS statement said.
In relation to the Creggan bonfire on Saturday night,  Mr Middleton told the BBC's Nolan Show: "There was a poppy wreath placed on it, with a board in behind it [saying] something along the lines of 'blood-stained poppies'.
"Obviously it has caused concern within the community and I'm not going to be hypocritical.  I understand too well that there is offensive material put on all bonfires across Northern Ireland, but at the same time we feel that it cannot go unnoticed and it needs to be challenged."
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Kevin Campbell said he wanted to see an end to all bonfires because they encouraged anti-social behaviour and on-street drinking.
"Once the bonfires are lit they attract negative elements within the community," Mr Campbell said.
"It just becomes a hate-fest. I think they are absolutely wrong, the community has rejected them."
Ch Insp Tony Callaghan told the Nolan Show: "We are investigating the placing of flags and symbols on the [Creggan] bonfire.
"Inquiries are continuing and where there is evidence of an offence, we will consult with the PPS with a view to prosecution."
Bonfires are traditionally lit in many loyalist areas on 11 July, to commemorate the victory of the Protestant William III over his Catholic father-in-law, James II at the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.
On 15 August, some nationalist communities light bonfires to mark the Catholic feast of the Assumption, commemorating the Virgin Mary's death and assumption into heaven.
