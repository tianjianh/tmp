Sarah Crilly scored the opener after 10 minutes from six yards out before Savannah McCarthy headed City's second.
Claire Shine wrapped up the title when she volleyed home on the rebound, with Siobhan Hunter getting a late consolation for second-placed Hibs.
"This is a massive accomplishment for the club," said Glasgow City head coach Scott Booth.
"The amount of people who have been involved in 10 in a row is incredible and something so many great people have made happen.
"For me, I am delighted to be a part of it. There was huge pressure on us this season given the significance of what we could do, but these players continue to rise to every occasion and I am very proud of everyone."
City will be officially presented with the SWPL trophy next Sunday after their league match against Rangers and could make it a league and cup double when they face Hibs again in the Scottish Cup final on 6 November.
Elsewhere, Rangers beat Forfar Farmington 3-0 and Celtic beat Spartans 1-0.
