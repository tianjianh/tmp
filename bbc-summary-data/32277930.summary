Carwyn Scott-Howell, from the village of Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, fell to his death in the French Alps on Friday.
Special support is to be offered to school children and staff at Ysgol Y Bannau in Brecon on Monday.
A family tribute said Carwyn was  an "adorable, caring person".
Head teacher Emyr Jones said: "We are all grieving.
"Normally, children would be coming back full of excitement about what's happened with their families over the two weeks [Easter holidays].
"Unfortunately, I'm sure many of them will have heard the sad news of losing Carwyn over the weekend."
Mr Jones added: "Our role as a school will be to support the children to come to terms with what has happened and to respond to their needs during the day.
"We are all grieving and Powys [council] staff will be in to support not only us as members of staff but also here to support the children as well."
The Foreign Office said the accident happened in Flaine, 38 miles north west of Chamonix.
Police said Carwyn fell 160ft (49m) after straying off the piste.
Michel Ollagnon, police commander for the south-eastern town of Bonneville, said the family were making their last descent of the mountain when Carwyn's mother stopped to help his sister who had fallen.
It is thought he wandered off from the rest of the family who then lost sight of him.
Local authorities in France are investigating the accident.
The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to the family.
