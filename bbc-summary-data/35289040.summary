Zander Diamond conceded a penalty after a foul on Dean Bowditch, which allowed Ben Reeves to score from the spot.
Moments before Reeves' strike, the Cobblers had put the ball in the back of the net but the goal was disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper David Martin.
Josh Murphy doubled the lead, while Simon Church scored a late penalty.
Murphy, who made a real impact after being introduced at half-time, had clipped a shot against the post before he scored after being put through by Samir Carruthers.
With just a minute remaining of normal time, goalkeeper Adam Smith brought down Robert Hall and Wales international Church converted.
The Championship side will now prepare to face reigning Premier League champions Chelsea - who won the FA Cup during current interim manager Guus Hiddink's first caretaker spell - on 31 January.
MK Dons manager Karl Robinson: "We've ridden our luck with decisions that have gone in our favour. The initial contact for the first penalty was outside the box and there was more contact on the line itself.
"Then Adam Smith has made a good save and the referee has given another spot kick. I say it when decisions go against us, so I'm being fair.
"I took a bit of a risk with the changes I made - I would have been criticised had it gone wrong for us and we hadn't won through to play Chelsea.
"It was a solid seven out of 10 performance from the lads all round - instead of a few eights and nines and some threes and fours as in other games."
Northampton Town manager Chris Wilder: "We're disappointed with ourselves because we didn't give them enough problems, but for a couple of key decisions on the night it could have been a different result.
"We felt the goal we scored should have stood and for their first penalty the foul was outside the box.
"MK Dons were the better team but from looking like we had gone 1-0 up we were then 1-0 down and that made it difficult for us."
