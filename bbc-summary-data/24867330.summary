[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Their former home, Don Valley Stadium, closed in September and is set to be demolished at the end of this month.
The Eagles played their first ever fixture at Owlerton in 1984, before moving away five years later.
The club's chairman Ian Swire said: "I'm sure all of our spectators, old and new, will enjoy the amenities that the stadium has to offer."
The stadium also hosts greyhound racing, stock car racing and is home to the Sheffield Tigers speedway team.
