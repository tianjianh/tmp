There had been speculation that Alex Salmond might seek the position.
However, the BBC's Norman Smith said Mr Robertson would be re-elected unopposed and had received the private support of former SNP leader Mr Salmond.
Elections for the position of SNP leader at Westminster will take place on Tuesday.
The new intake of Nationalist MPs arrived in London for a photo opportunity with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
On the prospects of retaining his role, Mr Robertson said: "It has been an honour to lead the Westminster SNP group for the last eight years and it would be an honour to continue as group leader of the record-sized SNP parliamentary party.
"I am grateful to have the support of deputy SNP leader Stewart Hosie MP, former first minister Alex Salmond MP and the encouragement from colleagues across the newly-elected SNP group.
"The SNP is now the third party at Westminster and we have a huge responsibility to stand up for Scotland.
"As third party we will be called at every Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), every debate and also serve on a wide range of committees.
"We will use these opportunities to oppose the Tory austerity agenda, press for the delivery of more powers for Scotland and seek to block the renewal of Trident."
All 56 MPs will take up the seats normally reserved for the Liberal Democrats in the Commons.
They will also take over the third party whips office which had been run by the Lib Dems for almost a century.
Norman Smith said it was understood that the SNP would be removing all the old photos of Gladstone and other Liberal leaders.
The Conservative Party was in coalition with the Lib Dems between 2010 and 2015.
However, the election on Thursday saw the Tories win a majority.
In Scotland there is now just one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and one Conservative MP.
