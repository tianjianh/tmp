[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 0-2 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood slipped closer to the National League relegation places with defeat by Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors broke the deadlock when Jordan Williams crossed in to Ben Tomlinson who firmly headed home.
Andy Cook doubled Barrow's advantage on the stroke of half time when he rose to nod home Michael Donohue's inswinging corner past Wood keeper James Russell.
It was a poor afternoon for the hosts who failed to register a shot on target in the whole 90 minutes.
The result means Boreham Wood fall a place to 20th in the National League table and are outside the relegation zone by virtue of a better goal difference than 21st-placed Altrincham, who have a game in hand.
Barrow move up two places to 15th.
