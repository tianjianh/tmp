CHAN 2016: Mali into quarter-finals after draw with Zambia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zambia and Mali are both through to the quarter-finals of the African Nations Championship after they played out a goalless draw in Group D.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local Chipolopolo side had already booked their passage before the game and Mali sealed their spot by claiming a point.
In the other match in the group Zimbabwe were denied a victory over Uganda by a 93rd-minute equaliser.
William Manondo opened the scoring only for Geofrey Serunkuma to level.
Uganda had needed to beat Zimbabwe and for Mali to lose to qualify for the next stage.
