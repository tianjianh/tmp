Portsmouth manager Paul Cook says his side's hopes of earning automatic promotion are over after their 3-0 home defeat by Newport County.

Cook's side are sixth in League Two and six points adrift of third-placed Plymouth in the last remaining automatic promotion place.
Saturday's loss at Fratton Park was Pompey's first in five matches.
"We have had too many inconsistencies this season, in my opinion, to be promoted automatically," Cook said.
Talking to BBC Radio Solent, Cook continued: "We are League Two players and I am a League Two manager and with that you get inconsistencies.
"The bigger teams that end up promoted have less inconsistencies. We have not put the teams above us under enough pressure.
"It summed our season up in one game. We promised so much, but we failed to deliver."
