Isle of Wight's troubled new "floating bridge" ran aground just hours after re-launching.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ferry had returned to service earlier - although cars were heard scraping the ground as they were driven off the vessel.
Eye witnesses said the ferry ran aground and was suspended at about 15:00 BST.
It comes after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency suspended the service on 16 May over "training issues".
Video footage taken from the re-launch showed cars still struggling to disembark without striking the ramp on to the slipway.
Isle of Wight Council said there was "nothing mechanically wrong" with the floating bridge.
A spokeswoman said: "The floating bridge is currently grounded at East Cowes. While the crews continue to get used to the dimensions of the new bridge, and when tides turn rapidly, this is a known and normal operational risk."
Eye witnesses said schoolchildren were "stranded" after the new chain ferry service was suspended and people were having to use a temporary launch.
The ferry resumed service at 19:42 BST.
