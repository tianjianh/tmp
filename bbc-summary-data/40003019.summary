The Green Party has launched its manifesto, the Green Guarantee For a Confident and Caring Britain. The full document is available online. Here are the main things you need to know.

A programme providing "big, bold ideas to create a confident and caring Britain that we can all be proud of".
The manifesto opens with the words:  "Imagine a government that trusts in our common humanity and our capacity to govern ourselves. Imagine a government that believes that the best way forward is by working with each other, rather than against each other... That's the kind of government we would work for."
The Greens chose central London to launch their 2017 manifesto, with co-leaders Jonathan Bartley and Caroline Lucas sharing the stage to promise a universal basic income, a four-day working week and a final say for the public on Brexit.
Mr Bartley said his party's "Green Guarantee" contained "big and bold ideas which are possible", saying the Greens were "committed to redistributing wealth and power", reflecting Britain's place as the fifth largest economy in the world.
Caroline Lucas, the party's only MP, said: "The Green Guarantee is about hope and we need hope now like never before.
"I can't remember a time in my own lifetime where the future has felt more uncertain - with Brexit, with accelerating climate change, with an NHS in crisis. We face challenges that we can't possibly pretend to fix in the next 100 days, or the next 1,000. Threats to our economic future, threats to our security, threats to our planet.
"But ours is a message of hope because we believe if we stand together for what matters, we can change the course of history."
