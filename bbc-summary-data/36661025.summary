[SN]TITLE[SN]
Heart of Midlothian 2-1 Infonet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts had to come from behind to take a vital lead to Estonia for next Wednesday's second leg of their Europa League first qualifying round tie.

The hosts' display was uncertain and their opponents took full advantage when Jegveni Harin volleyed home.
But Hearts swiftly levelled, Prince Buaben converting  a penalty after Vladimir Avilov handled in the box.
They went ahead via an Andrei Kalimullin own goal before half-time, but Infonet spurned chances to level.
The victory was accompanied by a clear sense of relief for Robbie Neilson and his players.
Infonet are midway through their league campaign and in second place. They looked organised and athletic, so the victory provides Hearts with an important advantage.
Raggedness dogged the home side throughout and there was never any sense of them being in command.
They set out to build on their lead in the second half, but struggled to play through a stubborn Infonet defence, while the visitors continued to threaten on the attack.
Jack Hamilton had to make a series of second-half saves, but also watch in relief as Harin's driven shot from the edge of the box, having skipped inside from the right flank, was deflected onto the roof of the net.
Harin was one of several Infonet players to cause problems for the Hearts defence.
They were enthused by his opening goal, but also by the agility of towering centre-forward Vladimir Voskoboinikov and the energy of Dmitrij Kruglov, who drew a superb diving save from Hamilton in the first half and another late on with a 40-yard free-kick.
Hearts had to overcome periods of alarm, but familiar traits were at least to hand.
Sam Nicholson was bright, inventive and full of dangerous running, while Faycal Rherras, too, looked athletic and technically composed on his debut at left-back.
Having conceded the opening goal, Hearts refused to buckle. There was an element of good fortune to the equaliser, with the penalty awarded for handball, but the link-up play between another debutant, Conor Sammon, and Juama was sharp in the build-up. Buaben was composed with his spot-kick.
The goal signalled a spell of pressure as Hearts began to find their rhythm and when Jamie Walker slung a corner towards the back post, Paterson turned the ball back across goal, where Kalimullin awkwardly turned it into his own net.
Uncertain, and occasionally last-gasp, defending was a feature of Hearts' play, although Hamilton remained assured in goal.
Still short of match sharpness and dynamism, the second leg - a 1645 BST kick-off in Tallinn next Wednesday - is unlikely to be a formality.
