Mount Stewart: Refurbished estate an artistic 'treasure trove'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From prime minister to poet, Mount Stewart has hosted some of history's most famous people, and it is a paradise full of fascinating stories.

Located in Strangford Lough, County Down, the neo-classical house is in the care of the National Trust, who bought the estate earlier this year.
It had belonged to the 7th Marquess of Londonderry and her family since 1740 and over the years visitors to the residence included members of the royal family, top politicians including Winston Churchill and hundreds of artists, aristocrats and writers.
'Wonderful'
The property is home to some of the finest pieces of art in Europe, and has just reopened its doors after a three-year restoration project costing Â£8m.
The manager at Mount Stewart, Jon Kerr, said it was "the most incredible treasure trove - stuffed full with the most wonderful things you wouldn't see outside a national gallery".
Having thrown the doors of the estate wide open to the public once more, it is impossible not to be wowed by the sheer decadence of the place.
The National Trust said it has kept all of the furnishings styled exactly how they looked when the house was occupied by the late Lady Mairi Bury, the youngest daughter of the Marquess.
She had plenty of friends in high places, and decorated the house to the highest standard to show it off to all those who came to stay.
Thanks to her fine tastes, it is still impeccably stylish with thousands of the finest portraits available to view.
One of the paintings, Hambletonian Rubbing Down, by George Stubbs, has been reframed and hangs at the top of the ornate staircase in the main hallway.
Mr Kerr described it as "one of the most important equestrian paintings of the world".
Another masterpiece is the portrait of the Marchioness of Londonderry and her son, Charles. It was painted by the finest artist of the Georgian period, Sir Thomas Lawrence.
Eleven of his pictures hang in the newly restored drawing room along with the very finest of furnishings.
The Arts Show was able to get a special preview of some of the other treasures waiting to be explored in Mount Stewart, including a loaned collection of marble statues and heads, among them Helen of Troy, carved by the sculptor Antonio Canova.
One of Ireland's best-known poets, WB Yeats, was a frequent visitor to the estate and was a great friend of Lady Bury.
To celebrate his 150th birthday, Belfast-based poet Alice McCullough joined the Arts Show at Mount Stewart to perform a piece inspired by Yeats and the grounds of the estate.
Mount Stewart is not just loved by tourists because of its fine art collection. It also houses a rich series of literature in the library, and there is even a little treasure left by Yeats inside one of his collections - a special inscription written to Lady Bury.
It is a fascinating place to see, with a wealth of history to delve into and it is all here on our doorstep once more, ready for new generations of visitors to explore and cherish, just as Lady Bury and her many guests once did.
The Arts Show is on BBC Two Northern Ireland on Thursday at 22:00 BST
