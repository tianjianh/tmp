The 23-year-old Nottingham-born folk and indie rock singer is one of 10 sponsors who have agreed month-long deals during the 2017-18 season.
Commercial operations manager Simon Fotheringham told the club website: "To attract someone of Jake Bugg's stature is a major coup.
"Add in the fact Jake's a massive Notts fan and it's a match made in heaven."
Each sponsor will see their logo appear on the front of the players shirts during their chosen month.
Bugg, who owns two platinum discs for his self-titled debut album from 2012, has released three albums so far, the last of which 'on my one' was in June 2016.
Earlier this month, BBC Radio 5 live presenter Darren Fletcher was one of six appointments to Notts County's new board of directors.
