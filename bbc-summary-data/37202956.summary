Portsmouth 3-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Curtis Main scored a first-half brace as Portsmouth eased past Crawley in their League Two clash at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The goals were the summer signing's first in the league this season with fellow striker Gary Roberts also finding the back of the net to take his tally to four.
The first chance of the game fell to Crawley's James Collins in the second minute as he shot just wide after clever play on the wing from Enzio Boldewijn.
However, in the ninth minute Pompey left-back Enda Stevens' cross found Main in the box and the former Doncaster striker's effort soared into the roof of the net.
It was not long before the home side made it 2-0 as Roberts pounced on sloppy defending from Alex Davey in the 12th minute to place the ball into the top left-hand corner.
Pompey's third goal and Main's second of the game came in the 37th minute after Milan Lalkovic had his shot deflected by Mark Connolly which Crawley's goalkeeper Yusuf Mersin parried into the feet of the striker who smashed it in from six yards.
