Police say they will never give up trying to identify a woman whose body was found in Manchester about 30 years after she was killed.

The skeletal remains of the woman were found by workers at a building site in Angel Meadow, near the city centre, in January 2010.
She had a fractured neck and jaw and suffered a violent death, police said.
The head of Greater Manchester Police's cold case review unit said they would "never give up hope".
"I think she was strangled and beaten about the head and then unceremoniously wrapped in a carpet and dumped on a derelict building site. No-one deserves that," Martin Bottomley said.
"She deserves a proper burial, which she's now had, and she also deserves justice."
He appealed for people to help identify the woman who, despite facial reconstruction by forensic experts in 2011 and DNA and isotope testing, remains unknown.
"This lady might have [been] put out of somebody's mind temporarily but she will never be forgotten.
"There will be a family member out there somewhere who knows who she is and who can unlock that key and identify her and perhaps that will lead to the murderer.
"We are determined to get a just outcome for the victim, and for any family member out there, and we will never give up hope."
Post-mortem tests revealed fractures to her neck and jaw and that she may have been sexually assaulted.
Her body was found alongside a green pinafore dress with large buttons, a jumper, bra and a pair of stiletto shoes, and a Guinness sign. Three different carpets - orange, blue and dark blue - were also found.
Tests have established she was aged between 18 to 35 and is most likely European but could have come from the Middle East or Indian subcontinents.
