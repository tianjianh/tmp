BBC Radio Norfolk's Nick Conrad made the comments during a phone-in about the ex-Sheffield United footballer.
The comments provoked 46 complaints and the BBC and the presenter apologised.
Watchdog Ofcom said his comments "were offensive" and "not justified by the context of the show" but the BBC had taken steps to limit the offence.
Evans, a Welsh international, was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman at a North Wales hotel.
Speaking on his mid-morning programme last November, Conrad said he thought women "need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire" and "it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm".
"If you don't wish to give out the wrong signals it's best probably to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him," he said.
Ofcom investigated the comments that "victims of rape could be 'partially responsible' for the crime committed against them", in relation to news about convicted rapist Ched Evans.
"Having carefully reviewed all the material, Ofcom found Conrad's comments were offensive and weren't justified by the context of the show,"  a spokesman said.
He said the BBC "took steps to limit offence" in the programme by including a "significant" live contribution from a representative of the End Violence Against Women Coalition.
Conrad apologised later making it clear "women and victims were in no way to blame".
After Ofcom announced its decision, a BBC spokesman said: "We note the findings." At the time, a spokesman described Conrad's comments as "very ill-judged".
Evans was released last year after serving half of his sentence.
He apologised "for the effects" of his actions in 2011 shortly after Oldham Athletic withdrew their offer to sign him as a player in January.
The club decided against the deal following threats made to sponsors, staff and fans.
Evans continues to maintain his innocence over his rape conviction.
