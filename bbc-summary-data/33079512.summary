PMQs: Harriet Harman attacks 'gloating' David Cameron

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harriet Harman has accused David Cameron of "gloating" after his election win and told him to "show a bit more class".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
During Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Labour's acting leader said the PM was "sneering".
Mr Cameron said he was sorry if she though he was gloating and quoted her saying Labour supporters were relieved the party did not win the election.
He also defended his EU referendum plans.
Mr Cameron said he did not believe 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to take part in the vote, promised by 2017, but said a Commons vote would be held to decide.
He also defended plans to scrap the usual purdah restrictions preventing the publication of promotional material by Whitehall before the referendum.
Otherwise, he said, there was "very real danger" ministers would be barred from commenting on matters like the EU budget and European court judgements.
He added: "When the negotiations are complete and the government has a clear view I do not want us to be neutral on this issue. I want us to speak clearly and frankly on this issue."
But the answers got an angry response from Ms Harman, who said he was gloating after the Conservatives' election win.
"Frankly he should just show a bit more class," she said, adding: "Perhaps we can have an answer rather than a gloating session for the next answer... go right ahead and gloat".
Mr Cameron replied: "It must be the first time someone has ever been accused of gloating whilst quoting the leader of the opposition."
The acting Labour leader also asked how the PM could guarantee people will benefit from the expansion of free and tax free childcare, and not be hit by fees elsewhere.
Mr Cameron said families would have "far greater choice on childcare".
