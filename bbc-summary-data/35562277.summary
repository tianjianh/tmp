[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who fled the country following the death of a university graduate has been found guilty of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anton Levin, from Dagenham, was stabbed at a house in St Anns Road, Southend on 19 November 2014.
Abdulfatah Suleiman, 28,  was arrested in Norway and extradited back to the UK where he was convicted by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Three others were convicted for their parts in Mr Levin's death in June.
Danielle Russell, 27, from Southend, and two teenage boys were found guilty of manslaughter, conspiracy to commit GBH on another man and conspiracy to commit robbery.
Russell was jailed for 11 years, and the teenagers, who can't be named for legal reasons, to ten years, four months with a five-year extended licence.
Investigating officer Det Con Jo Cane said Suleiman had "stabbed Anton Levin and then fled the country".
A warrant was issued for his arrest and on 19 June he was arrested in Norway and extradited back to the UK.
"While the other defendants had been found guilty of manslaughter the person who actually stabbed Anton had evaded capture," Det Con Cane said. "Now his trial has been completed. the verdict cannot bring Anton back, but gives closure enabling the family to grieve for their losses knowing that he will be jailed alongside the others also found guilty."
Suleiman is due to be sentenced in March.
