[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers 1-0 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Idrissa Sylla's second-half goal earned Queens Park Rangers a narrow victory over Bristol City at Loftus Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Guinea striker slid home Massimo Luongo's cross 15 minutes from time after the hosts had missed several chances to take the lead.
Northern Ireland forward Conor Washington fired against the bar and volleyed over as QPR had 21 shots.
England Under-21 striker Tammy Abraham went close for City in the first half, but powered his effort wide.
Following an even first half, which also included Lee Tomlin's low strike for the visitors being tipped wide by Alex Smithies, QPR dominated after the break.
After only one win in their past seven league games, boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink made changes, and it was two of the men who came in - Washington and Sylla - who pulled the strings for the hosts.
Washington's strike from 20 yards took a deflection before smashing against the crossbar, shortly after Tjaronn Chery's shot was saved by Frank Fielding.
Bobby Reid almost put City in front after racing onto Tomlin's through-ball, but his effort was blocked by Smithies.
And moments later Sylla broke the deadlock, getting between two defenders, to poke in from close range.
QPR manager Jimmmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "In the first half we were the better team and should have scored.
"It's always difficult when you've played that well and are not in front at half-time, but we were persistent and did the same in the second half.
"We went for it. It was always going to be a battle in midfield and about winning the physical battle. Whoever won that could then create, and we did that particularly well.
"We deserved the three points. It's always important to win at home and obviously it was in the backs of our minds. We have been unfortunate in the last few games but we cannot look back. What's important is what is now in front of us."
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: "Bobby Reid is a good player but he has missed a very good chance. But you have to say it was a very good save. Sometimes you just have to give credit to the opposing goalkeeper.
"It was a key point in the match really because it got their tails up and made them believe they could go on and win it. It was a good game. It had quality in sporadic patches, and had aggression.
"I've got a good group of lads and we've got a lot of players now back fit, so our squad looks strong and healthy."
