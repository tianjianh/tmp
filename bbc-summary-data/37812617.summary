Scottish League Two: Elgin move closer to Forfar as Clyde are held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elgin City moved to within a point of Scottish League Two leaders Forfar Athletic with victory over Cowdenbeath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City were 3-1 winners at home while Forfar came back to salvage a draw at home to bottom side Edinburgh City.
Third-placed Clyde also drew, against Stirling Albion at Broadwood Stadium, with Barry Ferguson's side still four points off top spot.
And the division's third 1-1 tie of the day was between Berwick Rangers and Arbroath at Shielfield Park.
First-half strikes by Brian Cameron and Archie MacPhee put Elgin in control against Cowden and Shane Sutherland added a third before Brian Ross converted a late free-kick as consolation.
Leaders Forfar fell behind to Ouzy See's shot, but Edinburgh were denied their first win since being promoted to the division for the first time when Danny Denholm headed home midway through the second half.
Clyde also trailed when Marc McKenzie fired in, but Peter MacDonald nodded the Bully Wee level before the break.
Steven Thomson's set-piece goal early in the second half got Berwick level against Arbroath, who had led through David Gold's 20th-minute shot.
Annan Athletic and Montrose were not in league action due to the former's Scottish Cup replay win over East Stirlingshire.
