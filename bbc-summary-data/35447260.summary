[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City beat fellow strugglers Charlton in front of new manager Lee Johnson to climb out of the Championship relegation zone.

Johnson was appointed Robins boss earlier on Saturday afternoon but watched on from the directors' box.
The visitors won it thanks to Lee Tomlin's 21st-minute penalty after the Bournemouth loanee had been pushed by Johann Berg Gudmundsson.
The Addicks created openings but never came close to levelling.

This defeat, coupled with Bolton's win over Rotherham, means Jose Riga's men have dropped to the foot of the table.
Meanwhile, Bristol City have gone up to 20th in the Championship and are now three points clear of the relegation zone.
It could have been more comfortable for the visitors but Addicks keeper Stephen Henderson, who perhaps should have kept out Tomlin's spot-kick, made fine saves from two Luke Freeman efforts.
Charlton's clearest chance fell to striker Zakarya Bergdich but he shot tamely at keeper Richard O'Donnell.
Charlton boss Jorge Riga:
"The main reason we avoided going down last time was my positivity. But I'm also realistic, I'm not a dreamer.
"There are lots of games still left to play."
Bristol City joint stand-in manager Wade Elliott:
"We defended well, limited them to few opportunities and we looked lively on the counter.
"It's credit to the players, they are a really good bunch.
"The manager coming in has inherited a good group of players, there are some great characters and he has come into a good place."
