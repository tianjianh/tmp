John Tory won 40% of the vote, ahead of Doug Ford, whose brother Rob admitted problems with alcohol and crack cocaine use during his four years in office.
Rob Ford announced last month that he would not seek re-election as he undergoes treatment for a rare cancer.
However, he did win election to a council seat in the Etobicoke district.
"In four more years, you're going to see another example of the Ford family never, ever, ever giving up," he said, hinting at another run for mayor.
The results of the mayoral election were announced on Monday night after more than 90% of the votes had been counted.
Doug Ford congratulated Mr Tory on his victory and said he was proud of his brother.
"I still believe he's the best mayor ever," he said.
Earlier this year, Rob Ford began rehab for drugs and alcohol problems after a slew of newspaper reports and videos that depicted him under the influence.
In 2013, the mayor admitted he had smoked crack cocaine in a "drunken stupor".
He was stripped of many of his powers by the city council.
John Tory - 40%
Doug Ford -  34%
Olivia Chow - 23%
