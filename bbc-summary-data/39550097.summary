[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham Town gave their League Two survival hopes a major lift with a home win over Grimsby Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Will Boyle and Harry Pell put the Robins on course for victory before the visitors pulled one back through James Berrett.
The Mariners were reduced to 10 men 11 minutes from time when Gavin Gunning was sent off for a tackle on Danny Wright.
Cheltenham were reliant on goalkeeper Scott Brown's superb save to keep out ex-Robins left-back Danny Andrew's free-kick from 20 yards in the opening minute.
Billy Waters then forced James McKeown into a fingertip stop at the other end as the hosts took control.
Defender Boyle opened the scoring in the 34th minute, nodding in James Rowe's corner from the right, before Pell added the second with a fine finish from Dan Holman's pass five minutes later to put the home side firmly in control.
Grimsby gave themselves hope when Scott Vernon set up Berrett, who fired in after bringing the ball down on his chest.
But Gunning was shown a straight red card for his challenge on Wright, ending the visitors' hopes of claiming a point.
