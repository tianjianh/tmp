Quigg, 28, will meet Romanian Viorel Simion at featherweight on the bill headed by Anthony Joshua's heavyweight bout with Wladimir Klitschko.
Simion, 28, has only lost once in 22 fights, a points defeat by IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby.
"The fight catapults me in the mix for a world title fight," said Quigg.
The meeting with Simion will be a second at featherweight for Quigg, who moved up a division after his 2016 defeat by Carl Frampton, the only loss of his 35-fight career.
The Bury-born fighter joined Roach - who has trained the likes of Manny Pacquiao, Amir Khan and Miguel Cotto - after splitting from Manchester-based trainer Joe Gallagher in February.
"The switch to Los Angeles has been a breath of fresh air," he said.
"The change of environment working with Freddie and the quality of sparring has really freshened things up."
