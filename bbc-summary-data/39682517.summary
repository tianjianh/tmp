A 21-year-old man has also been charged over the alleged attack at the Mangle E8 club in Hackney on 17 April.

Twenty people were hurt - including two people each blinded in one eye - after being doused with a substance at the club.
The Metropolitan Police said a man and a 22-year-old woman both lost their sight in one eye.
Other people were treated for severe burns following the alleged attack.

Mr Collins was arrested at an address in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
