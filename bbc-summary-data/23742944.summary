World Athletics 2013: Usain Bolt aims to be 'sporting great'

Usain Bolt said his ambition to be regarded as one of the "sporting greats" helped drive him to victory in the 200m at the World Championships.

The 26-year-old Jamaican, who has won six Olympic golds, ran 19.66 seconds to land his seventh world title.
"This year I said I wanted to be one of the greats like footballers Pele, Maradona and basketball legend Michael Jordan," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Usain doesn't need to go for fast times unless he really wants to. For him it's about the victories, but perhaps in 2015 we'll see him run world records. He needs a pressure-free season when he can just run for fun.
"He will return to Beijing in 2015 where he started his career and that could be his last World Championships.
"He needs to shake off all his injuries. It's been an intense time for him the last six years so he just needs to relax, enjoy his track and field, and chose what competitions he wants to go to to make an impact."
"If I want to be remembered I have to pile the golds on."
Bolt, who also clinched 100m gold this week, can add an eighth title to draw level with American greats Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, if he helps Jamaica to victory in the 4x100m on Sunday.
His 200m time of 19.66 seconds on Saturday was somewhat slower than the 19.19 world record he set at the 2009 championships. Bolt also holds the 100m record, which stands at 9.58, which was also set four years ago.
Asked whether he had the ability to break more records, Bolt added: "I think the door is getting tighter. Next season I have to try my hardest to stay injury free.
"My goal is to defend my titles at the next Olympics as it hasn't been done before by anyone, and this World Championships is a stepping stone towards that goal."
He stressed that any idea of him participating in the long jump at the 2016 Rio Olympics had been shelved.
"I have to be focused," he added. I can't mess around and get injured during the long jump. It's been decided I'm not going to do it."

The world champion admitted he was tiring as he reached the final 50m of the final.
"I was slightly tired," he added. "I came out to run as fast as possible. I ran 150m good and then my legs started getting tired. My coach said that if that happens then I should back off or I could damage muscles."
Former American sprinter Johnson, who was speaking on BBC Sport, also noticed that Bolt was suffering as he approached the line.
"Bolt ran pretty well on the curve and made a nice transition on the straight and controlled this," said the 1991 and 1995 200m world champion.
"He was running out of steam at the end though - his speed endurance wasn't quite there. He will be very, very relieved that he has been able to hold off these guys this time. He basically had it won after 100m."
