Sri Lanka will play two games against the Irish in June while the two matches against Pakistan are set to take place in August.
"These are exactly the type of fixtures we have been crying out for," said Ireland captain William Porterfield.
Sri Lanka visited Ireland last year, when they won the first one-day international by 79 runs.
"We want to be playing regularly against top sides and these fixtures are a welcome first step," added Porterfield.
Ireland play Australia at Stormont on Thursday and Porterfield said the news of next year's big games would give his side a lift.
"The players relish these opportunities to take on the top sides, but we will only continue to improve if they become a regular feature," he added.
Ireland's most recent meeting with Pakistan came during the World Cup in Adelaide, when they lost by seven wickets despite a brilliant 107 from Porterfield.
On their last visit to Ireland in May 2013, a Paul Stirling century and an unbeaten 84 from Kevin O'Brien saw Ireland claim a dramatic tie in the first ODI.
Ireland looked on course to win the second ODI after Ed Joyce scored 116 not out as they posted 229, but Pakistan recovered from 133-7 to win by two wickets.
