Challenge Cup winners Hull would have finished top themselves with a victory, but their hopes of winning a domestic treble this season were ended.
Ex-Hull winger Tom Lineham scored two tries for the Wolves, who started the game one point clear at the top of the table, while Kevin Penny also crossed.
Carlos Tuimavave replied for Hull, who will face Wigan in the last four.
Wigan's victory over Catalans on Friday pushed the Black and Whites down to third in the final table and earned the Warriors home advantage in their semi-final contest.
Declan Patton kicked 11 points for Warrington, who had missed the opportunity to clinch the League Leaders' Shield seven days earlier, losing at home to 12-man Wigan.
But they avenged their Wembley defeat by Hull in August to win the trophy for the second time.
Their other success came in 2011 and Tony Smith's side will now attempt to become domestic champions for the first time since 1955.
Warrington host neighbours St Helens in the first of the two Super League semi-finals on Thursday, 29 September.
The Wolves were not involved in the play-offs last season, finishing sixth at the end of the Super 8s stage, but have recent history in Grand Finals - losing to Leeds in 2012 and Wigan in 2013.
St Helens have been in more Grand Finals than any other team, winning five and losing five. Their last title came in 2014.
Warrington head coach Tony Smith told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "It was nice. It was tough.
"We've probably been a bit underrated at times and to come out with the League Leaders' Shield - it's a nice achievement along the way, but it's not the main one.
"There's a big one in a couple of weeks that both of us would like a good crack at."
Warrington winger Tom Lineham: "It's a big achievement for the club, after the upset of Wembley, to come here and beat a formidable Hull team.
"After the season I've had - my performances have been poor and I haven't really played well - to come back in and get the win with this group of players is priceless."
