In a meeting on Thursday, cabinet members voted unanimously to look at joining with councils from Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country.
It will also consider the feasibility of a referendum on the idea, in response to a 3,000-signature petition.
Conservative group leader John Blundell said he wanted "there definitely to be" a referendum on the possible move.
"I think the decision is too important to be left to local councillors alone.
"All of the citizens of Coventry should be engaged in the referendum," Mr Blundell said.
The £250,000 would "facilitate engagement" with residents, local businesses, universities and other key partners, a council statement said.
The authority's recommendations said this engagement would include "whether or not" a referendum was feasible.
Rachel Bermingham, who organised the petition demanding a referendum, said: "I'm absolutely stunned and delighted that they are looking at a referendum.
"It really means that the people of Coventry who've spoken so far have been quite persuasive in their arguments."
Coventry City Council said it would like to see councils in Warwickshire and Hinckley and Bosworth become a part of any future combined authority.
In 2011, Manchester City Council teamed up with nine neighbouring councils to form the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA).
The GMCA was the country's first statutory "super-council" with power to co-ordinate the region's regeneration, economy and transport priorities.
In the Queen's Speech on Wednesday, the government announced plans for a Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill, giving regions greater powers over housing, transport, planning and policing.
