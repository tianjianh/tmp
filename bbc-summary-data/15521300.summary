Philippines country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 7,000 islands make up the Philippines, but the bulk of its fast-growing population lives on just 11 of them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Much of the country is mountainous and prone to earthquakes and eruptions from around 20 active volcanoes. It is often buffeted by typhoons and other storms.
The Philippines - a Spanish colony for more than three centuries and named after a 16th century Spanish king - was taken over by the US in the early 20th century after a protracted rebellion against rule from Madrid.
Spanish and US influences remain strong, especially in terms of language, religion and government. Self-rule in 1935 was followed by full independence in 1946 under a US-style constitution.
The US is a close ally and has provided military aid to help combat Muslim and communist insurgencies.

President: Rodrigo Duterte
Incendiary politician Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as the Philippines' 16th president in June 2016.
The former mayor of Davao City won a landslide victory at the polls following his foul-mouthed populist tirades that exposed deep voter anger at the political establishment.
His stunningly successful election campaign focused almost entirely on the scourges of crime, drug abuse and corruption, with voters seemingly undeterred by his pledge to have tens of thousands of offenders killed.
During his 22 years as mayor of Davao City, Mr Duterte denied any involvement in the running of vigilante death squads, which human rights groups say have killed more than 1,000 people since the late 1990s.
His incendiary rhetoric has alarmed many of his critics. In his inauguration speech, Mr Duterte conceded that his methods may appear "unorthodox and verge on the illegal" but the former prosecutor conceded he knew right from wrong and would abide by the rule of law during his six-year term.
Powerful commercial interests control or influence much of the media.
The lively TV scene is dominated by free-to-air networks ABS-CBN and GMA. Some Manila-based networks broadcast in local languages. Cable TV has extensive reach.
Films, comedies and entertainment shows attract the largest audiences.
There are more than 600 radio stations. With around 100 outlets, Manila Broadcasting Company is the largest network.
The private press is vigorous, comprising some 500 newspaper titles. The most popular are Filipino-language tabloids, which can be prone to sensationalism.
