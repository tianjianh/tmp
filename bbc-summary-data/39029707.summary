Lewis Siddall, 24, from Skellow, was found dead in his bed the day after he was hit by Blue Horrobin in the VDKA bar, Doncaster, in 2015.
A post-mortem examination revealed he died as a result of head injuries.
Horrobin, 23, of Askern, Doncaster, was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court after being found guilty of manslaughter.

Mr Siddall, who worked at Copley Junior School, in Sprotbrough, had been socialising with friends on 11 August.
CCTV footage from the VDKA bar showed Horrobin barge into a friend of Mr Siddall's several times before attacking the teacher.
Horrobin - who claimed during his trial he was acting in self-defence - was then seen stepping back to launch the fatal punch at Mr Siddall, who sustained a fractured skull and ruptured arteries in his head.
Following the attack, Mr Siddall went home complaining of a pain in his head and went to bed at 00:30 GMT. He was found dead at 05:00.
The court heard that after suffering an injury like this, "it would be normal for the victim to carry on walking and talking".
Jailing Horrobin, Mr Justice Holgate said: "I am sure that Lewis Siddall did nothing whatsoever to give you any reason to think that he was being intimidating or aggressive.
"This was a completely unprovoked assault on an innocent member of the public enjoying himself with friends in the town centre."
The judge said shortly after the attack, Horrobin was captured on CCTV "bragging" and re-enacting the punch with a friend in a nearby car park.
Horrobin was jailed for eight years with an extension period of three years.
