Three Burns penalties put Tigers 9-6 up at the end of a drab first half, with Nick Evans replying for the visitors.
The hosts dominated after the break in wet conditions and Owen Williams' try gave them control, with Burns adding 11 points to his personal tally.
Tigers lock Mike Fitzgerald saw yellow for a tip-tackle on James Chisholm, who was then sin-binned for his reaction.
Leicester's win was built on their dominance in the first 15 minutes of the second half, as Burns kicked a penalty and a drop-goal before chipping over the Quins defence to set up Williams to score.
England fly-half Burns could have added to his personal tally but knocked on just yards out from the try-line following a good team move.
John Kingston's Harlequins rarely threatened the Tigers line and have won only one of their last 11 league games away from home.
Leicester flanker Tom Croft made his first Premiership appearance of the season after overcoming a back injury but his return was curtailed when he failed a head injury assessment.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill: "The first half was a bit flat. We were playing within ourselves and we needed to up the ante a bit.
"In the second half we took the game to them and controlled Quins well and they did not look like posing a threat.
"The forwards were better and we carried the ball better.
"There was more urgency and if we can get that every week we will be in the mix because we have some good players."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston told BBC Radio London: "Our intensity levels dropped slightly at the start of the second half.
"A few key battles went against us and we gave away a few penalties and that meant the game was being played in our half.
"Two penalties put the game to more than one score and they backed it up with the try. Then we were chasing the game in difficult conditions.
"Unfortunately it dribbled away from us and we couldn't get anything going."
