Oxford United 2-3 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Sharp struck his 25th and 26th goals of the season as League One leaders Sheffield United stormed back to beat Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium and stretch their unbeaten run to seven games.

Trailing 1-0 at half-time, Sharp turned smartly to fire home an equaliser, with the aid of a deflection, from a corner on 55 minutes.
Kieron Freeman then finished beautifully with a calm side-footed shot from 12 yards into the far corner to put Blades in front on 72 minutes.
And five minutes later, Sharp completed his double by blasting home a penalty, straight down the middle, after Freeman was tripped by Marvin Johnson.
It was an impressive comeback by Chris Wilder's team, after his old club Oxford had gone in front in the 22nd minute.
That came when centre-half Chey Dunkley headed home Chris Maguire's powerfully driven corner at the near post while Blades defender Jake Wright was off the pitch with a head injury.
Wright was unable to play on, making it an unhappy return for the 30-year-old who had made more than 270 appearances for the U's.
Toni Martinez made it 3-2 with a low angled drive in stoppage time, but the play-off chasing home team had no time to draw level.
Dunkley was Oxford's most threatening player, and twice went close apart from his goal, as he stabbed Johnson's cross over the bar from six yards, and later fired into the side-netting.
Kane Hemmings passed up a good opportunity in a crowded six-yard box, taking too long over his shot, when the match was evenly poised.
But Sheffield United ultimately showed their class as they extended their lead at the top of the table to eight points.
