The Tories won 38 out of 62 seats - a reduction of three from their previous figure of 41, captured in the last poll in 2009.
The Liberal Democrats also saw a decrease in seats, dropping by four to nine.
Labour has seen an increase of three seats and now holds seven wards; UKIP have won four seats on the authority after fielding candidates in 61 wards.
The Greens took one seat and independents took three.
Council staff said that the countywide average turnout was 32.9%, down from 43.9% in 2009.
Conservative leader John Hart, who held his Bickleigh and Wembury seat, said he was "delighted" with a "good working majority".
He said: "It shows that our local policies and our manifesto - where we said we would look after the people of Devon - has been listened to by a lot of people."
However, UKIP said national interest in the party showed that people were taking it seriously.
Devon UKIP chairman Steve Crowther said: "I think the people have spoken.
"What I'm finding is the more people call us clowns and fruitcakes, the more people are inclined to give us their vote."
Nearly 600,000 residents were eligible to vote for a total of 313 candidates.
