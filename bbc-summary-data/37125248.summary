Phillips was involved in a crash before a collision with another rider pushed him off the track in the first of a three-race heat at the Rio Games.
The 2013 world champion, 27, was competing at his second Olympics.
British Cycling tweeted: "Sad to confirm that Liam Phillips has been forced to withdraw from #CyclingBMX at #Rio2016 after that crash."
Fellow Briton Kyle Evans, 22, also went out at the quarter-final stage after finishing fifth and seventh twice in his three races.
