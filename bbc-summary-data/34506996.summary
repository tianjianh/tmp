Football referee Joel Richards, 19, of Wednesbury, died along with uncle Adrian Evans, 49, grandfather Patrick Evans, 78, and 35 others near Sousse.
The hall is part of Sandwell council's Â£8.1m leisure centre complex, which is due to open this year in Wednesbury.
Mr Richards' mother Suzy said she felt "very honoured" the council chose to name the sports hall after him.
A University of Worcester student and Walsall FC fan, Mr Richards used to attend Wednesbury's Stuart Bathurst and Wood Green schools.
His mother said the family felt "very honoured and proud that they have chosen to name the new sports centre after Joel".
She added: "Joel was a very talented and inspirational young man who had the world at his feet.
"He spent a lot of time volunteering within the community, encouraging and teaching young people all types of sports."
She said she also saw the move as a "fitting tribute" to her father, Pat Evans, and brother Adrian Evans "who supported Joel with all that he had achieved at such a young age".
The naming of the sports centre will take place as part of an official opening ceremony later this year.
The new Â£8.1m Joel Richards Sports Hall complex includes a 25m pool, a learner pool, two dance studios and a fitness suite.
From the 38 killed in the beach attack on 26 June, 30 were from the UK.
