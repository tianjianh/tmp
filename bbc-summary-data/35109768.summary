[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of ex-world athletics chief Lamine Diack is one of four officials facing a disciplinary hearing this week over an alleged doping cover-up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Papa Massata Diack, a former consultant for the IAAF, and ex-IAAF anti-doping director Gabriel Dolle are charged with breaches of the IAAF's code of ethics.
Former All-Russia Athletic Federation chief Valentin Balakhnichev and coach Alexei Melnikov are also in the dock.
None are expected at the three-day hearing, which starts on Wednesday.
The charges relate to the payment of about Â£435,000 that Russian former London Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova allegedly made to have her doping violations covered up.
Her 38-month ban from track and field was reduced by seven months after she turned whistleblower for the World Anti-Doping Agency.
A decision from the hearing, which will be held in London, is expected in early January.
Russia have been banned from international athletics competition after a report by Wada's independent commission alleged they were guilty of "state-sponsored doping".
