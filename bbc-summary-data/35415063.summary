East Kilbride v Celtic: Scottish Cup tie to be staged at Airdrie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Airdrieonians' Excelsior Stadium has been chosen to host the Scottish Cup fifth-round tie between East Kilbride and Celtic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows an emergency meeting between Lowland League club East Kilbride and the Scottish Football Association.
A new venue was required after Hamilton Academical said they were unable to host the game on Sunday 7 February.
East Kilbride had been told their K Park, which has a 500 capacity, was not suitable for the tie.
The SFA initially said that it should be played at Hamilton's New Douglas Park, which has a capacity of 6,000, as it was the closest suitable stadium.
However, it was East Kilbride's seventh choice of venue in an order of preference submitted to the governing body and Accies then announced that they were not willing to alter a schedule of community events planned for that weekend.
The home of League One club Airdrieonians has a capacity of 10,200, while the tie will be broadcast live on BBC Scotland.

East Kilbride chairman Mark Horner said:  "We've been in talks with various stadiums all day and put forward the Excelsior as the best, nearest and most suitable stadium to host the game against Celtic and we are delighted the SFA have agreed.
"The stadium is modern, a great size and the surface is similar to K Park which [manager] Billy [Ogilvie] and the players are delighted about.
"The stadium also has great disabled access, which is another plus point as we are planning to take hundreds of children from East Kilbride with ASN (Additional Support Needs) to the game.
"We are all really look forward to what will be a great occasion for the club and the town."
