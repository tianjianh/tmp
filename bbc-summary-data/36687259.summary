The 24-year-old missed more than six months of the Cherries' first Premier League campaign because of a serious knee injury.
In May, Bournemouth rejected West Ham's combined bid of Â£20m for Wilson and midfielder Matt Ritchie.
"After being injured for nearly the whole of last season, I feel like I want to establish myself even more," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"Committing to the club was an easy decision. Hopefully I'll be here for many years to come"
News of Wilson's new deal was announced on the day Ritchie, 26, joined Newcastle.
