Dundee Utd 5-1 Kilmarnock: Dillon backs Terrors to beat the drop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United captain Sean Dillon is convinced his club can avoid relegation after a heartening win over Kilmarnock.

The defender scored in a 5-1 victory that leaves United 11 points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership.
"I've said it for a long time, I believe we will do it," Dillon told BBC Scotland.
"I know people outside won't give us a chance, that's fine, I understand that. But, from inside I truly believe we will do it."
United have 15 league games remaining to extract themselves from the bottom spot.
The one-sided triumph against Kilmarnock was just the third win of the season for Mixu Paatelainen's side, with Blair Spittal (twice), Mark Durnan and John Rankin joining Dillon on the scoresheet.
"It's obviously easier to talk about it after a win so it's important to keep our feet on the ground," added Dillon, who insists his team-mates are committed to the cause.
"When things aren't going well, everything gets magnified," he said. "The players have always been together and individuals show it in different ways.
"It's always much easier when things are going well.
"No player goes out thinking 'I don't care'. Everybody cares, of course they do. But sit down and actually think about what you're doing. Are you giving 100%?
"Everybody works hard but we can all improve. When all the little things add up, you can see the difference.
"We got a couple of breaks with the goals and we haven't had that, but it's only one win and one game.
"We've many games to go and many wins to get."
United now take on bottom-six rivals Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Motherwell in their next three league fixtures.
And manager Paatelainen shares his captain's enthusiasm for the challenge ahead.
"I thought we played with very good intensity, the work-rate was unbelievable and we scored goals - that made it easier for us," said the Finn.
"It is only one match but we believe we can get out of this situation. Maybe we're daft but we do.
"We do have it in us to win matches and we showed that today. We will keep fighting until it is over."
Kilmarnock boss Gary Locke described his side's performance as "unacceptable" and wants to add to his squad this month.
"We were second best in too many areas of the pitch," he said. "At this level you have to win your individual battles and credit to United - they won everything.
"United said it was a cup final but it was a cup final for us as well. In a game of that magnitude it's disappointing.
"We can't afford to be like this again. We need a couple of players because we are light in certain areas. We need a bit of experience, a couple of leaders on the pitch. But that's not an excuse."
