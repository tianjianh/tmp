The plaque in Dudley will mark where Edwards grew up before signing for Manchester United as a teenager.
Sir Bobby told the crowds Edwards had been "like a brother" to him ahead of the unveiling.
The plaque was unveiled on what would have been Edwards's 80th birthday. He died from injuries sustained in the 1958 Munich Air Crash.
The tribute at Priory Park will mark where the player "honed his skills" near his childhood home on the Priory Estate,  said Dudley North MP Ian Austin.
Mr Austin, who helped organise the event, said Edwards was "the greatest footballer that ever played".
Sir Bobby has described Edwards as his "hero".
He previously told BBC Sport: "I feel terrible trying to explain to people just how good he was, his death was the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football.
"I always felt I could compare well with any player - except Duncan. He didn't have a fault with his game."
Sir Bobby replaced ex-England manager Sam Allardyce to unveil the tribute.  Allardyce left his role as England manager after The Daily Telegraph claimed he offered advice on how to "get around" transfer rules.
Mr Austin said Sir Bobby, who survived the Munich plane crash, had been Edward's best friend and he was "delighted" he was to unveil the tribute.
Edwards was one of the eight Busby Babes who died in the air crash in which 23 of the 43 passengers on board died.
