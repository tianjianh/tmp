The 21-year-old singer said the track was called Someday Maybe but said she wasn't sure about if or when it would be released.
Speaking to Nick Grimshaw on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, she said: "Yes, I wrote a song with Harry.
"It was unbelievable he's a very, very talented songwriter I was very impressed."
Harry Styles also recently worked with Kodaline on the band's fourth album, while One Direction bandmates Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne were pictured in the studio with US rock band Good Charlotte during a writing session.
In March last year, Niall Horan tweeted about a writing session with Danny Jones, Dougie Poynter and Tom Fletcher from McBusted.
Meghan Trainor is up for record of the year with All About That Bass at this year's Grammy Awards.
She said: "It was a little bit of a surprise but All About That Bass is so out of control and has a world of its own, so I guess I understand.
"But it was a dream come true, it's the last dream I had on my list."
All About That Bass spent four weeks at number one in the UK and was the first track to top the Official Singles Chart on streams alone.
