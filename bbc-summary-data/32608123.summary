The former senior IRA figure was shot dead near Belfast city centre on Tuesday.
The man was arrested in Belfast on Wednesday morning and was released that evening.
A 27-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday evening in Belfast and is being questioned about the shooting.
Police searched a property in north Belfast on Tuesday night as part of the overall investigation.
Police do not believe dissident republicans were behind the attack.
Appealing for information, Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said: "This was a cold-blooded murder carried out in broad daylight in a residential area and it has no place in the new Northern Ireland."
"We have detectives in the Markets area making house to house enquiries and seeking to identify witnesses.
"I would appeal to local people to co-operate with them and give them any information they have."
