The Airlander 10 nosedived during its second test flight from Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire.
The craft's cockpit was effectively destroyed when the Â£25m craft experienced a "heavy landing", although no-one was injured.
Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) said the new cockpit will be painted over the Christmas period.
The crash happened just before the vehicle came in to land after a 100-minute flight on 24 August.
A spokesman for HAV said: "The early part of 2017 will consist of a series of rigorous tests before Airlander continues its flight test programme."
Christened the Martha Gwyn, the aircraft was first developed for the US government as a surveillance aircraft, but the project was shelved amid defence cutbacks.
HAV launched a campaign to return the Airlander 10 to the skies in May 2015. It claims it could be used for a variety of functions such as surveillance, communications, delivering aid and even passenger travel.
It says the huge aircraft will be able to stay airborne for about five days during manned flights.
The company hopes to be building 10 Airlanders a year by 2021.
