[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Caldwell's first game in charge of Chesterfield ended in a goalless draw at home to AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spireites remain in the League One relegation zone after collecting a point from a match which did not produce a shot on target until the 51st minute.
Chesterfield enjoyed the bulk of play in the first half but Wimbledon's stubborn defence restricted the hosts to a series of long-range shots from Dion Donohue, Dan Gardner, Ched Evans and Jay O'Shea which all flew wide.
They first tested James Shea from Jon Nolan's snap shot while the visitors' first on-target effort came in the 73rd minute when Dominic Poleon's shot was saved by Ryan Fulton.
The Dons, losers at home to non-league Sutton United in the FA Cup in midweek, were on the back foot for most of the game and have not scored away from home in the league since 22 October.
Chesterfield almost nicked it at the end when Gboly Ariyibi flashed the ball across the face of the goal but no-one was able to get on the end of it.
