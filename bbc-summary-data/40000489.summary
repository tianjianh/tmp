The devices were briefly left on the main concourse at about 13:00 BST, a man watched this happen and he walked over to the bag and picked it up, police said.
He walked out of the station "right past the victims" and the machines were "not easily" replaceable, a spokesman added.
Police said a family had been "left distraught".
Investigating officer PC Jason Walters said: "Thieves may think that they're not harming anyone when they take things like phones or laptops - but in reality, it can cause untold upset and disruption to a person's life."
BTP said it believed the man on the images, with a "distinctive tattoo" on the back of his head, had information that could help the investigation.
