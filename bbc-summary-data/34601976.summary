[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers of a man killed fighting for the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria have been convicted of terror offences after a retrial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuhin Shahensha, 27, and Mustakim Jaman, 23, were found guilty of helping others to travel to fight in the war-torn country.
The pair, both from Portsmouth, were convicted of offences relating to the preparation of terrorist acts.
Their brother Ifthekar Jaman died in 2013 shortly after he spoke to the BBC.
He told the Newsnight programme it was his "duty" to go the country because Muslims were "being slaughtered".
Kingston Crown Court heard Shahensha and Jaman, both from Hudson Road, Southsea, provided assistance to others and made their bank accounts available to facilitate the transfer of money for terrorist purposes.
Police said Shahensha also purchased equipment and clothing and made plans to travel to Syria.
Jurors had failed to reach verdicts in the first trial in May.
Det Ch Supt Richard Humphrey, head of the south east counter terrorism unit,  said: "It was clear that Shahensha and Jaman had intentions to travel to Syria to fight for a proscribed organisation.
"At no point did Shahensha or Jaman plan to attack the UK, however due to the intention of travelling to Syria and the potential of radicalisation taking place, we needed to intervene."
The brothers will be sentenced in November.
