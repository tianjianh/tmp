Beverley's Lakeminster Park emptying ahead of eviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to half he residents of a chalet park in East Yorkshire have moved out ahead of an eviction deadline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Retrospective planning permission for people to live all year-round at Lakeminster Park, near Beverley was refused in 2012 by East Riding Council.
Following appeals, the decision was upheld and residents were given 18 months from September 2014 to move out.
Six months on, 30 units have been removed, vacated or are soon to be empty.
Pete Ashcroft, the council's head of planning and development management, said: "The council understands the difficulties being faced by the occupants of Lakeminster Park, but is encouraged that so many have already complied with the enforcement notice and well ahead of the deadline of March 2016.
"We understand the concerns of those living on the park and, if they have not yet done so, we would strongly advise them to seek independent legal advice on this decision and what options are now open to them."
