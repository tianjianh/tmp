Tomer Hemed had a great chance to put the league leaders ahead but his penalty was saved by on-loan Arsenal keeper Emiliano Martinez.
Wolves striker Adam Le Fondre had a shot cleared off the line before Conor Coady saw red for a poor tackle.
Beram Kayal, Liam Rosenior and Jamie Murphy had efforts late on but the Seagulls were unable to find a winner.
Brighton are now three points clear of second-placed Middlesbrough at the top of the Championship, with Wolves sitting 18th, two points above the relegation zone.
The first real opportunity of the game came after Wolves defender Scott Golbourne fouled Murphy inside the area, but Martinez pulled off a brilliant double save from Hemed's effort and then the striker's follow-up.

The hosts should have been ahead when James Henry's free-kick was headed into Le Fondre's path by Ethan Ebanks-Landell, but his touch towards goal was stopped by Hemed.
After Coady was dismissed for his poorly-timed tackle on Rosenior, the Seagulls pressed forward and Kayal and Rosenior had shots saved, while Murphy nodded wide.
Wolves struggled to create when they were a man down, with Benik Afobe's pulled shot their best effort in a second half with few chances.
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett: "It was a very well-earned point against an impressive side. Brighton were good today, moved the ball very well and got a high number of crosses in.
"We had to work hard for the clean sheet in the dying minutes. When they put Bobby Zamora and Elvis Manu on, you wonder how the dynamics of the game are going to change.
"But the young centre-half pairing (Kortney Hause and Ethan Ebanks-Landell) stood very firm and showed a lot of promise."

Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "I couldn't fault the commitment of the players and I thought they had a real go.
"We had a midweek game and Wolves hadn't and there were little periods in that first half when they maybe looked a little fresher than we did.
"So it is difficult to be too disappointed but, of course, we did have a really good opportunity with the penalty."
