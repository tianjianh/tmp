Tags give insight into basking shark behaviour

Scientists say satellite tagging basking sharks off Scotland has given valuable insights into the behaviour of the world's second biggest fish.

Several sharks arriving in Scottish waters during summer in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were tagged in an effort to track their movements.
A new report analysing the information gathered has identified a key "migratory corridor" for the fish.
Some sharks were also found to remain close to Scotland and did not migrate.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) working with University of Exeter tagged and tracked the animals.
Basking sharks are the world's second biggest fish - the whale shark is the largest - and can grow to 11m (36ft) and weigh up to seven tonnes.
They have no teeth and feed on microscopic plankton by opening wide their huge mouths.
Every summer the sharks gather in large numbers around small islands between Skye and Mull off Scotland's west coast.
The tagging project involved sharks found off Coll, Tiree and Hyskeir.
According to the SNH report, the Irish and Celtic Seas represent an important migration corridor for basking sharks moving between the Sea of the Hebrides, the Isle of Man and southwest England.
In autumn, tagged sharks were found to move away from the Scottish islands and towards the west of Ireland, the Bay of Biscay, Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.
Some of the sharks spent winter off Madeira and the Canary Islands off west Africa, but others remained "relatively close" to Scotland throughout the winter.
The report added that new research was planned into the microscopic creatures that the giant fish feed on.
Other organisations have an interest in the sharks.
Three years ago, the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT) reported an increase in encounters with basking sharks.
Fifty sharks were counted over just nine days.
Up until 19 years ago, basking sharks were hunted in the seas off Scotland for their liver oil.
