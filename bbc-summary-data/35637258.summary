Mid-table Rochdale fell behind when Shaun Whalley drilled a low shot past Josh Lillis from just inside the area.
The hosts doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time when Whalley's corner was headed in at the far post by skipper Nat Knight-Percival.
Jayson Leutwiler saved a long-range Ian Henderson drive to help Shrewsbury to a third clean sheet in four league games.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"We've not won enough games here over the course of the season. It was important that we started to do that and it was a thoroughly deserved win.
"The players were anxious to do well. We could feel that. We changed the shape a little bit and it probably allowed us to freshen it up in different areas.
"The lads that have come in have added to the energy levels and got us going. The crowd, who we asked to get behind us, were terrific. They've helped as well."
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We didn't start on the front foot. I don't think we can concede ground to Shrewsbury like we did in the first 20 minutes or so.
"I don't feel as though we've been anywhere near the way that we started the last four games. Both goals are sloppy.
"I feel as though we rode our luck in the first half. Every player has got to turn up individually and say 'right, I'm going to win my battle'."
