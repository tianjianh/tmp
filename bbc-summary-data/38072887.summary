William Smith will receive Â£10,000 and the chance to develop his work called Residue with BBC Cymru Wales, BBC Writersroom and National Theatre Wales.
Judges described Smith as a "wonderful storyteller" whose writing is "compelling".
He beat 250 others to the prize.
Born in Swansea, Smith, who now lives in Cardiff, graduated with a film studies degree from University for Wales, Newport, in 2010.
He later went on to write the short film King of The Castle, about the relationship between two brothers and their father's death, made as part of the It's My Shout scheme and broadcast on BBC2 Wales in 2011.
His other works include the 2014 short film Lift Jockeys, about a lift which takes people to heaven or hell, and he has also worked as a producer and presenter for Radio Cardiff.
Anne Edyvean, from BBC Writersroom, said Smith's writing "keeps you turning the pages, while Kully Thiarai, artistic director of National Theatre Wales, said he was a "wonderful storyteller" who was "undoubtedly a talent to watch".
Bethan Jones, executive producer for BBC Drama, added: "This award is a way to ensure writers are able to afford to carve out time to write and have support to develop their work.
"It's great to be able to support William Smith's huge potential."
The three other finalists were Hardey Speight, Jonathan Jones and Bethan Marlow.
