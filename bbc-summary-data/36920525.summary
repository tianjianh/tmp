Man sought after armed police raid in Smallfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is being sought on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences after an armed police raid on a house in Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One woman was held on suspicion of drug-related offences and two men were detained for allegedly obstructing police during the 06:00 BST operation.
Officers had believed another man with a suspected firearm was inside the house in Careys Wood, Smallfield, but no-one else was found during a search.
Surrey Police later said they were looking for 57-year-old Paul Hodge.
A number of suspected firearms were recovered from the house during the pre-planned operation which saw a police cordon put in place around the property and roads sealed off.
Paramedics were on standby, and local residents reported seeing a drone being sent up.
Det Insp Paul Burrill, senior investigating officer, urged anyone who knew of Mr Hodge's whereabouts not to approach him but to call 999.
Police are currently making enquiries in the wider Redhill area to trace him, they said.
Warrants were also executed at 15 other addresses across east Surrey as part of an operation to dismantle the supply of Class A drugs.
Ten people were arrested.
