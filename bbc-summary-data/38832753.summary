Scott Hogan has thanked Brentford supporters and the club for "sticking by him" during his protracted move away from the club.

Hogan, 24, joined fellow Championship side Aston Villa on Tuesday for a fee that could rise to £12m.
In a statement posted on Twitter by former team-mate Harlee Dean, Hogan apologised for how the move unfolded.
"Thanks for everything, it's been a couple of years which I will never forget," Hogan said.
Hogan was the centre of speculation for much of the January transfer window, with West Ham the initial favourites to secure his signature.
Brentford boss Dean Smith was forced to admit the striker had had his "head turned" by the speculation.
"I understand the last few weeks haven't been ideal and I can only apologise," Hogan added. "It was out of my hands and all I wanted to was play football and score goals."
Hogan joined Brentford from Rochdale in the summer of 2014 for £750,000 but two cruciate knee ligament injuries saw him miss 18 months of action.
"Brentford will always be a club close to me as they helped get my career back on track," he said. "For this, I will forever be grateful to you all."
