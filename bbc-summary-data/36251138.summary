Samuel Garner, 17, died on 1 May after being hit by a stolen BMW on Welford Road, Leicester, three days before his 18th birthday.
The Leicester City fan had spent the afternoon watching his side's 1-1 draw with Manchester United.
Reece Webster will appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.
Mr Webster, of Wensley Rise, has also been charged with driving while disqualified, failing to stop after a road accident, having no insurance, handling stolen goods and possession of cannabis.
An 18-year-old man arrested in connection with the crash has been released on bail.
Mr Garner sustained serious injuries following the collision with the stolen vehicle and died at the scene.
The vehicle was stolen from Blaby, Leicestershire, on 29 April, Leicestershire Police said.
It was found burned out on 2 May on College Road, Whetstone.
During an emotional appeal for information on Thursday, Samuel's parents, Scott and Tracie, said the family had been due to go to Prague to celebrate his birthday.
One of his Samuel's friends described how she tried to pull him away from the BMW.
A teenage girl also suffered injuries, but these were described as minor.
