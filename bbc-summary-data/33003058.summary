[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Health England (PHE) said the confirmed case of psittacosis, which is normally an infection of birds, can cause severe health issues in humans.
The birds were taken to a pet shop when the owner was unable to look after them.
Symptoms in humans include fever, chills, cough, fatigue, muscle and chest, pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Other symptoms include headaches, sweating and abnormal intolerance to light.
Sick birds may show signs of sleepiness, shivering, weight loss, breathing difficulties and diarrhoea but not all will show these signs.
PHE said psittacosis is caused by the bacterium chlamydophila psittaci and spread either by airborne transmission or by handling infected birds.
It is found particularly in parrots, parakeets, budgerigars and cockatiels but can affect other birds and some poultry.
As a precaution, people with concerns relating to birds they have purchased between 28 May and 3 June are advised to contact their vet to discuss their birds' health.
Between 25 and 50 cases of psittacosis are laboratory confirmed in England and Wales each year.
But Mike Wade, from PHE, said instances of people suffering severe illness as a result of infection from this bacteria are rare.
He said in humans symptoms usually appear after 10 days but can take up to 30 days to present themselves.
