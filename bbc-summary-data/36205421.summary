[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clinicians' concerns had been raised at a meeting of NHS Grampian's board last month after the Scottish government announced the decision to have four such centres was under review.
Ms Sturgeon said: "There is no dubiety, there will be a major trauma centre in Aberdeen."
She said there would be also be centres in Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
In response, Labour said the "apparent U-turn" had come at the last minute.
The Conservatives said voters may ask why it had taken until the final days of the election for the "unequivocal commitment".
And the Liberal Democrats said no-one in the north east would believe what was being said until the trauma centre was "actually in placeâ€Ž".
