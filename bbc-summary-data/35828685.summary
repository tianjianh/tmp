The Blues, who won the FA Cup tie against Rovers by the same score last Sunday, were in rampant attacking form.
Carney scored from the penalty spot and, despite Claire Rafferty's own goal, headers by Beth England and Chapman earned a 3-1 lead.
Aluko's fine strike sealed victory.
Carney's opener, after Millie Bright was fouled by Rhiannon Roberts, came at the end of a typical Chelsea break in a first half full of good movement, intricate passing and goal-scoring threat.
Rafferty's own goal from Courtney Sweetman-Kirk's teasing cross did little to interrupt the flow.
But despite two goals from corners making it 3-1, Doncaster responded impressively in a feisty second period.
Sam Tierney almost pulled a goal back after a fine move, but Aluko's calm finish settled the match.
Chelsea Ladies manager Emma Hayes told BBC Sport:
"Karen Carney was at the heart and the core of everything, especially in the first half, and she looks like she's been playing at Chelsea for years.
"I thought she was instrumental in everything we did, whether she was on the left side, down the middle, or on the right.
"We're a group that's got a lot of confidence going forward. Being reigning champions helps with that belief in the way that we play. I was concerned defensively for the team but that's something for us to work on."
Doncaster Rovers Belles forward Courtney Sweetman-Kirk:
"I think as a side we're obviously disappointed. You never want to lose any matches and I know they're the champions but we still fancied ourselves, so it's disappointing in that respect.
"But we won't let it knock us. We've got a month now until the next game so we're go back to the drawing board and see where we're at. They're champions for a reason and as Glen Harris likes to say, Chelsea are two years in the making and we're two months.
"The Belles have always been renowned for and the gaffer made sure that the players he brought in were very aware of that and he's bringing in not just good players but good people."
