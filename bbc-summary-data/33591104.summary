A BMW collided with a Hyundai on the B1102 Freckenham Road in Worlington, near Mildenhall.
A couple in the Hyundai i30 have been named as William Dyal, 77, and his wife Helen, 75, from Prickwillow, near Ely, Cambridgeshire.
Earlier, police identified the driver of the BMW M3 as Matthew Grant, 24, from Mildenhall.
William Dyal was known by his middle name of John and was a retired art teacher, while Helen Dyal was a fashion and graphic designer.
The Dyal family said the couple would be "hugely missed by all their family and friends".
"It is with greatest sadness that we have lost our dearest parents, grandparents and siblings today in this tragic accident," a statement said.
"Our hearts also go out to the families of the other casualties."
Mr Grant was a much-loved son, brother, uncle and boyfriend, his family said.
"Matthew led a very outgoing and sociable life surrounded by friends and family. His passion in life was motocross and music," they said.
"He was well known and loved by all, he has left a massive gap in our hearts and lives that can never be filled.
"We as a family are deeply saddened by our loss, but will continue to keep his memory alive with our lovely times together.
"Our thoughts go out to all other families involved in this tragic accident."
A second man killed in the BMW - a 28-year-old also from Mildenhall - has yet to be named by the police.
Investigators said they did not believe any other vehicles were involved in the accident, which happened at about 20:15 BST.
