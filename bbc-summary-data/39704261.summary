Antoine Griezmann: Man Utd express 'most concrete' interest - agent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United have expressed the "most concrete" interest in signing Antoine Griezmann, says the Atletico Madrid striker's agent.

Eric Olhats told French television programme Telefoot that United had discussed the possibility of meeting his 100 million euro release clause.
"United were the first to come and see us and the most concrete in their wishes," said Olhats.
Griezmann, 26, has scored 25 goals in 46 games for Atletico this season.
United's top goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored 28 times in the same number of games, but, at 35, is yet to agree an extension to a contract that expires at the end of this season. He is also facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after injuring his cruciate knee ligament.
United's next most prolific players this season are Juan Mata, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford, all of whom have scored 10 goals.
Manchester City are set to launch a rival bid to try and buy France international Griezmann, according to recent speculation, and Olhats suggested that other European clubs may yet show an interest.
"There is an unavoidable 100 million euro clause so that restricts the number of candidates," he added.
"You have United, City, Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid."
Griezmann seemed to distance himself from a move in February, saying that he "felt great at the club and in Madrid."
