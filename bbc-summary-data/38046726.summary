Saracens' George Kruis has been added to the England squad after recovering from ankle surgery.

The second row had been an ever-present part of Eddie Jones' England side in 2016 before being ruled out of autumn Tests wins over South Africa and Fiji.
Kruis, 26, was part of a 32-man training squad that gathered at England's training base on Sunday.
Fellow England lock Joe Launchbury was cited on Sunday night for an alleged kick in Saturday's win over Fiji.
England's autumn Test series continues against Argentina at Twickenham next Saturday.
Kruis, who missed Saracens' win at Sale on Sunday which sent the champions back to the top of the Premiership, has won 18 caps since making his debut against New Zealand in 2014.
He was an integral part of the side which won the Six Nations Grand Slam earlier this year, and started all three Tests in the series whitewash against Australia in the summer.
England's four-Test autumn series concludes against Australia on 3 December.
