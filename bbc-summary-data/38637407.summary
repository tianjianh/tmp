You can clearly see the planet's "Great Red Spot" which is actually a mega-storm.
It's been going for several centuries and is even bigger than the Earth!
The image was captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft, which set off on a journey to learn more about Jupiter in 2011 and arrived in 2016.
Juno has been sending back images which the public can view and edit to give an idea of how Jupiter may look if you were seeing the planet with your own eyes.
Juno was about 285,100 miles from the massive gas giant when it snapped this picture.
The image was then edited by a member of the public called Roman Tkachenko
