Premier League predictions: Lawro v Stereophonics star Kelly Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is Stereophonics  frontman Kelly Jones.
Jones grew up in the south Wales village of Cwmaman and became a Leeds United supporter "on the basis that my elder brothers were fans".
He told BBC Sport: "I was born in 1974 so I was brought up with lots of itchy Admiral Leeds kits handed down to me from the Don Revie era, and with my brothers basking in the glory of the Revie days. I took on that role with them."
The Stereophonics are Wayne Rooney's favourite band, and the England captain has the name of their 2001 album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm.
Rooney let Jones use his executive box at Old Trafford when Leeds beat Manchester United in the FA Cup in 2010.
"That was probably the best Leeds game I've ever seen," Jones said.
"Wayne had been winding me up all week saying we had no chance but, fair play to him, he came up to the box afterwards and gave me the shirt he was wearing that day. It takes a big man to do that I think."
Make your predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got four correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one perfect score.
His score of 70 points saw him beat England cricket star Stuart Broad, who picked three correct results with one perfect score, for a total of 60.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
