The NWA biopic, produced by Dr Dre and Ice Cube, took £2.49m in its opening weekend.
The movie made a surprise opening at the top of the US box office with takings of $56.1m (£35.8m) in it's first weekend two weeks ago.
It had only been expected to make half that figure.
The film tells the story of the band's rise to fame and takes its title from their debut album, released in 1988.
Another new release Hitman: Agent 47, a video game adaptation starring British actor Rupert Friend as an assassin, entered the chart in third place taking £961,411.
Critically acclaimed drama 45 Years starring Charlotte Rampling and Sir Tom Courtney debuted in tenth position, taking £331, 196.
The film about a couple in the days leading up to their 45th wedding anniversary has won awards at the Berlin Film Festival and Edinburgh International Film Festival.
Disney Pixar's Inside Out remains at the number two spot in the UK box office, taking £1.19m. It is in its sixth week in the top ten.
Last week's top film Pixels has fallen to fifth place taking £664,728.
