Relatives of the students will accompany them on the flight.
On Saturday, a joint funeral mass was held in Sonoma, California, for cousins Olivia Burke, 21, from Dublin, and Irish-US citizen Ashley Donohoe, 22.
Four of the families issued a statement thanking everyone, in Ireland and the US, for their sympathy and support.
The families of Eoghan Culligan, LorcÃ¡n Miller, Niccolai Schuster and Eimear Walsh boarded a Dublin-bound Aer Lingus flight on Saturday night to bring their children's remains home.
"As we leave Berkeley and return home to Ireland with our beloved sons and daughters, Eimear, Eoghan, Lorcan and Niccolai, we would like to thank everyone in America and Ireland for their sympathy and support, which has been a tremendous comfort to us at this tragic time," the families said.
"Particularly we thank the local authorities, emergency services, medical staff, parishes and communities of Berkeley.
"In addition we are forever grateful to the Irish Consul, Philip Grant, and his local team, and also the amazing service and support received from Aer Lingus, the Department of Foreign Affairs, US Ambassador Anne Anderson, and a special appreciation to Minister Deenihan.
"We cannot thank enough the students that were in the apartment and apartment complex that night.
"The manner and speed at which they reached out to our families, to our Consul, and to each other was faultless. Our children were extraordinarily blessed in their friends and we are enormously proud of them."
Olivia Burke's family will return to Ireland with her remains on Monday.
After Saturday's joint funeral, their families issued a statement through a friend.
"We will fight to make changes so that no family will ever have to go through what we have gone through in the last five days," they said.
"Our daughters and the rest of these students were responsible young adults that were celebrating their friend's 21st birthday in what they felt was a safe environment.
"Unfortunately that turned tragic through no fault of their own."
Mourners at the funeral heard how the two cousins were kind, fun-loving young women who shared a close bond.
Monsignor Daniel Whelton said that that growing up, Olivia and Ashley would dress alike to try to fool their parents into thinking they were twins.
The apartment balcony collapsed during a 21st birthday party in the early hours of Tuesday in the city of Berkeley.
Five of the six people who died were Irish students based in the US as part of a work exchange programme.
Meanwhile, the conditions of two of the people who were injured in the Berkeley balcony collapse have improved.
Conor Flynn and Jack Halpin are being cared for at the John Muir Medical Centre in Walnut Creek.
Hospital pastor Fr Michael Gillen described the pair as inspirational and said they should make a full recovery.
Investigations continue into why the fourth-floor balcony collapsed.
Engineers say water damage may have caused the structure to give way.
Authorities said 13 people were on the balcony when it collapsed.
A book of condolence is to be opened at Belfast City Hall on Monday.
