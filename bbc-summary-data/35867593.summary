Five family members died on Sunday when their car went off Buncrana pier in County Donegal and into Lough Swilly.
Davitt Walsh was on the pier and said he took off his clothes and swam to the family as fast as he could.
He said he "could see the distress in the family" as they tried to escape from the car.
Those who died were Ruth Daniels, 57, her daughter Jodie Lee Daniels, 14, Sean McGrotty, 49, and his sons Mark, 12, and Evan, eight.
They were the mother, sister, partner and two sons of Louise James, from Londonderry.
"The father had the window half ajar and started hitting it with his elbow to break it," he told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰.
"When the window was broke, the father... handed me the baby and said: 'Take the baby.'
"The water started to come into the car and he just looked at me and said: 'Save my baby.'
"I took the baby, I held it above my head and I swam back to shore.
"The father could have saved himself because he was out of the car, but he went back in to save his family.
"I think deep down the father knew I was only going to be able to save one person."
Mr Walsh, a footballer who has played in the top divisions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, said the car sank "instantly".
"My girlfriend was waiting at the shore, she took the baby off me," he said.
"I was exhausted on the pier, I just lay there on the algae.
"I just feel really, really terrible that I couldn't do any more for the family."
The baby, Rionaghac-Ann, was taken to hospital and police said she was recovering well.
Mr Walsh, from Kerrykeel in County Donegal, has been praised by the family of the victims for saving her.
Jim McGrotty, a brother of Sean, said Mr Walsh was a "brave man".
"Words cannot express the enormity of the tragedy which has befallen our family," he added.
"If there is anything good which has come out of it is the fact that baby Rionaghac-Ann has been saved."
