[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An armed civilian shot the two 14-year-old assailants, who have been taken to hospital.
It happened at an Israeli-controlled industrial zone market near Ramallah used by settlers and Palestinians.
Since October, 30 Israelis have been killed in stabbing, shooting or car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs.
More than 160 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have been killed in the recent unrest.
What is driving the violence?
The victim has been identified as 21-year-old soldier Tuvia Weissman, who was off duty at the moment of the attack, the Israeli army said.
A second Israeli was also stabbed and was reported to be in a moderate condition in hospital. They were both hit on their torsos, medical sources said.
One of the attackers was in a serious condition and, the second was in a moderate to serious condition, being treated for gunshot wounds, a spokesman said.
Palestinian medical sources said one of the attackers was from a village near Tulkarm and the other from the Ramallah region, the Haaretz newspaper reported.
The Shaar Binyamin industrial zone will be closed to all Palestinians on Friday, except for those with work permits, officials said.
The recent rise in violence is blamed by Palestinians on the continued occupation by Israel of the West Bank and the failure of the Middle East peace process.
Israel accuses Palestinian leaders and Islamist groups of inciting the violence.
Several of the most recent incidents have involved Palestinian teenagers.
The assailants who have been killed have either been shot dead by their victims or security forces as they carried out attacks. Some attackers have been arrested.
Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops amid spiralling violence.
