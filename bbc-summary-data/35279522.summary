I'm A Celebrity... will not be investigated over an episode that saw contestant Ferne McCann eat a live spider, TV watchdog Ofcom has said.

Reality star McCann was seen eating the spider as part of one of the ITV jungle endurance show's Bushtucker Trials.
As a result, Ofcom and ITV received 1,448 complaints following the show which aired on 6 December.
A watchdog spokesperson said they believed the incident was "in keeping" with audience expectations of the show.
"We received a number of complaints about a contestant on this programme eating a live spider as part of a challenge, but won't be taking the matter forward for investigation," the spokesperson said.
"In our view, this task was in keeping with the well-established format of this reality series and was unlikely to have exceeded audience expectations.
"We also took into account that ITV had taken steps to limit any offence resulting from the inclusion of this task."
McCann is a star of another reality TV show, The Only Way is Essex. She was seen eating the live spider in a Bushtucker Trial in order to earn as many stars - or points - as possible to earn food for herself and fellow contestants.
Bushtucker trials are considered a highlight of the reality show, which sees a group of celebrities "stranded" in the Australian jungle with the bare minimum of supplies  to survive.
Over the weeks, they are eliminated by the public voting for who they want to stay so that the camp member with the least votes is the one to leave. How the celebrities fare in the trials is not the only way to earn the camp food but it is considered a major contributor to audience opinion of individual contestants.
Eating insects and other unusual animal body parts has become one of the established and most-anticipated form of Bushtucker Trial.
Ofcom said it was satisfied with ITV's explanation of the steps taken to mitigate offence when showing the task with the spider-eating incident, including footage selected and avoiding any vertebrate creatures.
An ITV spokesman said at the time: "I'm A Celebrity complies with all regional and national laws concerning the use of insects in the eating trials, which have become a well-established part of the show over the past 15 years."
McCann came third in the competition last year, won by Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison.
Complaints over the eating of animals on the show have been made before. The most notable was in 2009, when winner TV chef Gino D'Acampo and actor Stuart Manning faced charges of animal cruelty by the RSPCA in New South Wales, Australia, after cooking and eating a rat on the show.
