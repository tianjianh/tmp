Christina Overton detailed her husband's struggles in a Facebook post on his 34th birthday on Sunday.
"After several months off due to a herniated disc, Jeff underwent a minimally invasive procedure in hopes of improving the area," she wrote.
"Through the procedure he acquired a life-threatening infection in his spine, forcing an emergency surgery."
Overton, who was part of the US Ryder Cup team that lost 14½ to 13½ to Europe in 2010, last played on the PGA Tour in February.
"After a month in the hospital and acute rehab centre, many nights of excruciating pain and uncertainty, two months of IV antibiotics and home health care, we are finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel," added his wife.
Overton tweeted: "These last few months have been surreal and it certainly makes you appreciate life and health."
