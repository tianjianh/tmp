[SN]TITLE[SN]
Durham University rape victim was 'broken and lost'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student who claims she was raped by an undergraduate was "broken, shaken and lost", according to a friend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The alleged victim claims Durham University's Alistair Cooke followed her home from a party in June last year, Durham Crown Court has heard.
Mr Cooke, 22, a third-year geography student, from Perranarworthal, Truro, Cornwall, denies three counts of rape.
The male friend of the woman told the jury she sent him a text saying: "Something happened last night."
He said that she added: "I was really drunk. I cannot completely remember, but what I do was not good."
He told the court they then spoke on the phone for an hour.
"I remember her being broken, she sounded lost, shaken and quite confused," he said.
"I had never seen her in such a state before, when she was so upset and so lost."
She described Mr Cooke as violent and rough, the witness said.
"She used the word forceful a few times," he told the court. "I believe she used the word 'dismissive' in the way he was with her."
The trial has previously heard Mr Cooke held the woman down "like a ragdoll" as he raped her.
The court also heard Mr Cooke was a volunteer with the Nightline student advice service and, during his training, he role-played being accused of raping a drunken woman after following her home.
He said the sex was consensual.
The trial continues.
