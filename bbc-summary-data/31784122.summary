Members were asked to take part in a vote to allowing terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, in which doctors believe an unborn child will die before of shortly after birth.
The event was picketed by anti-abortion protesters.
During the conference, Sinn Féin leaders also spoke of their ambition to become the biggest on both sides of the Irish border next year, the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.
