The pair produced a near perfect dive to take the bronze medal in a tense finish.
They were the last team to dive, meaning they knew what they needed to do to overtake Germany, who were sitting in third place.
With a score of over 84 points needed, the British duo waited nervously before leaping into the pool when the score of 89.64 came up.
China's Lin Yue and Chen Aisen, won gold and United States pair David Boudia and Steele Johnson claimed silver.
Daley and Goodfellow's bronze medal brings Team GB's Olympic medal tally to four and puts them 10th overall in the medal table.
There was another bronze for Team GB on day three, in the men's trap shooting for Ed Ling, who's a farmer from Somerset.
"It was third time lucky for me (after Athens 2004 and London 2012) but shooting is a funny sport where sometimes you can go out there and things can go really well and other times you can't hit a barn door," said Ling.
"It is a great sport and I really love it."
