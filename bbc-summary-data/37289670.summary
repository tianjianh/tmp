It means the visitors win the two-match series 1-0 thanks to their 40-run victory at the same venue on Monday.
The umpires decided ground conditions were unsuitable for play following a pitch inspection at 14:30 BST.
Nizakat Khan of Hong Kong was named player of the series, while his skipper Babar Hayat was presented with the trophy.
Ireland are next in action when they play South Africa and Australia in Benoni on 25 and 27 September.
