The Thinking Schools Academy Trust (TSAT) said Denise Shepherd had been suspended after it received "an allegation from an individual".
TSAT said it could not give details of the allegation for fear of prejudicing its investigation.
It added Ms Shepherd's suspension would not affect pupils' education.
The trust runs both primary and secondary schools in Strood, Chatham, Rochester and Portsmouth.
It said Stuart Gardner, the previous executive head of Chatham Grammar School for Boys and The Victory Academy in Chatham, had assumed the role of TSAT's director of secondary education.
He will be supported by Claire Stevens, director of primary education.
"The trust, which is duty bound to investigate any allegation, took the decision to suspend Ms Shepherd whilst it investigated the substance of the allegation," it said in a statement.
"Whilst this investigation is being undertaken we are unable to make any further comments about the detail of the allegation so as not to prejudice the outcome for either party."
