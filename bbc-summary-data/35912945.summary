The children, aged between eight and 12, were discovered in the vehicle by officers on Aberdeen's Beach Esplanade last Thursday.
Insp Jon Barron, of Police Scotland, said: "This is another shocking example of someone blatantly putting children's' lives in danger.
"Please wear a seat belt at all times."
He added: "Had there been a collision, or had the driver to brake harshly for whatever reason, the possible consequences could not be clearer.
"Wearing a seat belt will massively reduce these risks.
"Please ensure all passengers and children carried in your vehicle are properly restrained. Please keep them safe."
