[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sandwiches and salads are returning to the menus at a cash-strapped hospital trust after it found a new supplier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust was struggling to pay its bill for patients' sandwiches and had asked some external suppliers to accept later payments into the next financial year.
Its sandwich supplier refused, leaving the trust looking for a new one.
The trust has apologised for the inconvenience and said sandwiches will return by Wednesday.

Simon Wright, chief executive at the trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, said: "I am delighted we have been able to address the issue quickly so that our patients, their families and our staff will once again be able to enjoy the full range of meals we have on offer at our hospitals.
"We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused over the past three weeks."
The trust said patients on wards will be offered sandwiches and salads from 1 February and they are expected to go on sale in the hospitals' restaurants next week.
They continue to be on sale from the hospital's League of Friends shops, they said.
