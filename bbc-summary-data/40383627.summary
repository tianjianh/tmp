Andrew Dobson jailed for 'child-like' sex doll import bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for trying to import an "obscene" child-like sex doll, in what police say is the first case of its kind in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Dobson, from Crewe, was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail and has been put on the sex offenders register for life.
Following the discovery of the doll - at East Midlands Airport - searches found indecent images on his computer.
The 49-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts at Chester Crown Court.
He admitted importing an indecent object, possessing indecent images of children and two counts of making indecent images of children.

Police said border forces identified a parcel labelled as a mannequin, which was found to contain an "obscene child-like doll,"
The package, addressed to Dobson of Merrivale Road, Wistaston, was ordered online and shipped from Hong Kong, police said.
Det Con Andy Kent said: "Knowing child sex dolls exist and are available for sex offenders to buy is sickening.
"For Dobson to go to great lengths to import one for his own sexual gratification shows the extent of his paraphilic interest in children."
Hazel Stewart, from the National Crime Agency Child Exploitation and Online Protection Specialist Operation Team, said: "Importation of the life-like dolls is a relatively new phenomenon and there is no offence of possession, only importing an obscene article.
"We know their purchase can indicate other offences against children."
