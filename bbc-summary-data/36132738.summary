Shaun Lee Nicholas, 22, from Wrexham, caused more than Â£10,000 damage to the crossing and the car was later found abandoned, crashed into a garage door.
Mold Crown Court heard glass fragments were later found on his clothing and his fingerprints were in the vehicle.
Nicholas pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving while disqualified.
Jailing him for 13 months, Judge Rhys Rowlands said: "Mercifully, no one was seriously injured or killed but that was sheer good fortune."
He added: "The reality is that you got away simply because of the manner in which you drove. You drove at speed and took serious risks by ignoring two red traffic lights."
The court heard the chase on 25 September 2015 started after the black Ford Mondeo Nicholas was driving triggered an automatic number plate recognition camera in Wrexham.
During the chase, the car approached the Croesnewydd level crossing which had its barriers down and red lights on due to the on-coming train, but Nicholas drove through them.
Police had little option but to stop and watch the car continue on its way.
Philip Tully, defending, said Nicholas that his client had not at the time taken his medication for ADHD and that affected his decision making.
