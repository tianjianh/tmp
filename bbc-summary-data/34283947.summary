The band will be joined by Idlewild and Honeyblood in an all-Scottish line-up for the Concert in the Gardens.
Organisers said it was a "real coup" that Biffy Clyro would make their only live UK performance of the year at the event which they last headlined in 2010.
Tickets for the concert go on sale next week.
In a statement, Biffy Clyro said: "We are so happy to come out of musical hibernation to kick off 2016 with the show on Hogmanay.
"We want to rock off the cobwebs and prepare for the year of da biff. Nothing can compete with Edinburgh's celebrations and we hope to make it a special night for everyone."
Pete Irvine, director of Edinburgh's Hogmanay, said: "Their stand-out performance two years ago headlining T in the Park reminded us that they are one of the most exciting live bands ever to come out of Scotland.
"Biffy have built a big international following and headlining an impressive Scottish line-up at Concert in the Gardens will please both the Scots and our audience who come from over 70 countries."
Full details of the street party line-up and other events will be announced in October.
