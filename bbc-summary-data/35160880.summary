Coventry City's teenage forward James Maddison says he is confident his best form will return now he is back in first-team contention after injury.

The 19-year-old played his first competitive game since fracturing his ankle in August, in the Sky Blues' 1-1 draw with Oldham at the Ricoh Arena.
"I think the physios are sick of me nagging them to get back," Maddison told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire.
"It'll take me a few games but I'm confident I'll get back in that form."
Maddison was injured in Coventry's 2-1 defeat by League One promotion rivals Walsall and it was feared he would be out until January with the problem.
But he has returned ahead of schedule and says he is raring to get his season back on track with Tony Mowbray's side sitting fourth in League One.
"It's been a frustrating three or four months but it's a great feeling to be back on the pitch - I'm feeling good," Maddison added.
"All the best teams have a good run over the Christmas period and we've got games coming up that I think we should be winning if we want to challenge at the top end of the league."
Meanwhile, the Sky Blues should find out the severity of on-loan defender Ben Turner's ankle injury over the next 24 hours.
Turner was hurt against Oldham and is to see a specialist on Wednesday.
