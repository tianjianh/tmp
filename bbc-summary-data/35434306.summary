Premier League predictions: Lawro v Maccabees guitarist Felix White

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for the midweek Premier League games is Felix White, guitarist in indie-rock band The Maccabees.
Felix is a Fulham fan who was taken to Craven Cottage for the first time when he was 11.
He told BBC Sport: "I don't remember much about the game, but I remember thinking I will probably do this for the rest of my life."
Fulham are currently 19th in the Championship but White has fond memories of better days, including their recent forays into Europe.
He added: "If they were there, I imagine any Fulham fan would tell you beating Juventus 4-1 in the Europa League in 2010 was the most magical thing Craven Cottage has ever seen.
"Especially because the week before, we had been beaten 3-1 by them in the first leg in Italy and then we went 1-0 down in the first five minutes of the second leg.
"So we had to score four against Juve, and we did it - I still don't think a bigger fairy-tale than that has happened in football and Clint Dempsey's chipped goal for us in that game is still etched in my brain.
"With what we are going through now in the Championship, I have got to hold on to those moments."
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
On FA Cup fourth-round weekend, Lawro got 11 correct results from 16 ties, including three perfect scores.
His score of 200 points saw him beat indie-rock band The Libertines, who picked six correct results with no perfect scores for a total of 60 points.
The scores from those FA Cup ties do not count towards the totals for Lawro and his guests (below).

Everton boss Roberto Martinez is under a bit of pressure because of their league form, especially at home - they have not won at Goodison Park in the Premier League since 21 November.
I think the Toffees will put that right on Wednesday, though.
Newcastle went for it in the transfer window because they were buying to stay in the league but their new signings will take time to settle in.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1.
Felix's prediction: I love Roberto Martinez so I'm going for Everton here. 2-1.
Chelsea drew with Watford in Guus Hiddink's first game in charge but the Blues look like a different team now.
Players like Eden Hazard have come back into form and seem to have the spring back in their step - I can see them going on a really good run and John Terry is bound to be a part of that.

Following his announcement that he is going to leave Chelsea in the summer, and with the uncertainty over whether he might actually stay, you just know that he is going to be very impressive from now until the end of the season.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2.
Felix's prediction: It is nailed on that Watford will win this one. I am not a Fulham fan who takes real joy in seeing Chelsea lose because I have got a lot of mates who support them, but I think it has been good for the league. 2-0.
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)
