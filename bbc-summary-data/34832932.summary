Wasps will not get carried away by their impressive start to the European Champions Cup, says director of rugby Dai Young.

Wasps, in a tough pool with holders Toulon, Bath and ex-champions Leinster, beat the Dublin side 33-6 on Saturday.
"This competition's all about mixing it with the best and we've certainly beaten one of the best," Young said.
"It puts us in a strong position now but it doesn't mean anything going into next week."
Wasps' victory was Leinster's heaviest-ever European home defeat and Young said he could not have wished for a better display from his players.
"Everything I asked of the boys before the game, they delivered," Young added to BBC Coventry & Warwickshire.
"We deserved to win but the scoreline far exceeded our expectations coming in."
Wasps secured their place in the competition after finishing sixth in the Premiership last season and Young is keen for his squad to make the most of their opportunity to play against the best sides in Europe.
"Let's look forward to these games and enjoy playing them - we've earned the right to be there.
"It's taken 22 games in 10 months to get there and we need to make sure we enjoy the experience."
