Left-back Kitching has yet to make a first-team appearance for Boro, but played in two EFL Trophy games for their Under-21 side this season.
The 21-year-old, who had a loan spell with York last season, is out of contract at the Riverside in June.
"He played for us in a behind-closed-doors game on Tuesday and I was really impressed," manager Keith Hill said.
"He's a good player, he meets our DNA and I think once he warms up with respect to meeting the demands of the team and the environment, then I'm sure that we've got a very good young player."
