The girl remains in a "critical condition" in hospital after the incident at a house in Danube Street, in the Stockbridge area, in the early hours of Wednesday.
The 48-year-old woman appeared in private at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with attempted murder.
She made no plea or declaration and was detained under an assessment order.
Det Insp Paul Grainger said the eight-year-old was recovering well in hospital.
"I want to take this opportunity to commend staff at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children for their tremendous medical efforts so far," he said.
"Thankfully, the girl is now described as being in a stable condition and specialist detectives continue to support her family.
Det Insp Grainger added: "A 48-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with this incident and we're not looking for anyone else as part of our enquiries.
"Our thoughts remain with the young girl and her family, who have asked that their privacy is respected at this incredibly difficult time."
