Michael Hoey finished in a share of 41st place at the Nordea Masters in Sweden after taking a quintuple bogey eight at his penultimate hole.

A par, par finish would have seen the Belfast golfer finish in a morale-boosting share of 20th after ending a run of 11 missed cuts on Friday.
Hoey's other 17 holes contained 15 pars, one birdie and one bogey.
His cheque for just over Â£7,000 moved him from 231st to 211th in the Race to Dubai standings.
The Galgorm Castle touring professional's last previous cheque came when he was joint 66th at the Abu Dhabi Championship in January.
Hoey has won five European Tour titles during his career with his last victory coming at the Russian Open in 2013.
Overnight leader Matthew Fitzpatrick clinched victory as a closing 71 left him on 16 under par, three ahead of Denmark's Lass Jensen.
The other Irish weekend qualifier Peter Lawrie finished on four over after a disappointing closing 78.
