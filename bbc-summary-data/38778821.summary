[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-1 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High-flying Bolton were held to a draw by MK Dons as their winless run extended to four games in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieran Agard's third goal in as many outings midway through the second-half cancelled out Jay Spearing's opener for Bolton as MK's unbeaten league run extended to five games under new boss Robbie Neilson.
Neither side could get a foothold in the opening exchanges, but it was the visitors who were the first to really threaten when Filipe Morais swung in an inviting cross for fellow new signing Chris Long inside the box but his delicate header skimmed just wide.
And Phil Parkinson's side took the lead seconds before the break after Spearing's free-kick from the left flew untouched past the bodies of a flooded MK penalty area and keeper David Martin before nestling in the bottom corner of the net.
But the Dons drew themselves level 15 minutes after the half-time break as Agard's emphatic strike from the edge of the box flew past Ben Alnwick in the Bolton goal and into the bottom corner for his 11th goal of the campaign.
