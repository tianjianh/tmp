[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a lawyer crushed by three window frames that weighed more than half a tonne could have been prevented, the Old Bailey has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda Telfer, 43, was killed when the frames fell on her as she walked past a building site in Hanover Square, Mayfair, London, on 30 August 2012.
Four people and three companies deny a total of 13 charges over her death.
The frames had been left unprotected and unrestrained leaning against a wall after being delivered the previous day.
Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said builders were not ready to install the frames but that they were delivered anyway.
He said it was "obvious to anyone" that the heavy frames, which together weighed 1,444lb (655kg), carried a "clear and serious risk of death", including to those walking past.
Mr Atkinson told the court: "There were a series of obvious and, in many cases, straightforward steps that could have been taken to avoid that risk, ranging from cancellation, delay, refusal of delivery on the one hand, to the storage, the use of straps and barriers.
"None were taken by any of the defendants and Amanda Telfer died as a result."
Damian Lakin-Hall, 50, from Cobham, Surrey, Claire Gordon, 36, from Leeds, and 64-year-old Kelvin Adsett - also known as Kelvin Schultz - from, Slough, Berkshire, deny manslaughter and health and safety breaches.
Steven Rogers, 62, from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, pleaded not guilty to a single charge of failure to take reasonable care for safety while at work as an employee of Westgreen Construction.
IS Europe of Slough, Westgreen Construction, of Richmond in Surrey, and Drawn Metal of Leeds, also deny health and safety charges.
