Operation Pallial: Child abuse probe to stop investigating

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation into allegations of abuse in the north Wales care system is to stop investigating new accounts from victims and survivors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Operation Pallial began inquiries in November 2012, with 340 people making contact, and there are currently 84 complaints being investigated.
Eight men have been convicted, including care home owner John Allen, who was jailed for life in 2014.
North Wales Police will look into allegations made after 31 August.
Operation Pallial, operated by the National Crime Agency, will remain active, supporting victims and survivors through future trials and giving advice in relation to 27 suspects.
While this work is expected to last "many months", a dedicated team at North Wales Police will deal with all new allegations from September.
