Marr, 53, spent two months in hospital, which was followed by months of physiotherapy to help him walk again.
BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show has since been presented by a series of guest presenters, including Jeremy Vine and Sophie Raworth.
Marr will also be returning to  present Radio 4's Start the Week later in the year.
As the Andrew Marr Show prepared to take its summer break, Vine said: "We're back on the first Sunday in September which this year is September the first. And I'm delighted to say that Andrew will be back in the hot seat presenting the show himself."
In a statement, Marr said: "I'm hugely looking forward to coming back and want to give it my all but recovering from a stroke does take time.
"We've taken the decision to start with the Sunday show in the autumn and I'm delighted to be returning to present Start the Week on Radio 4 later on in the year."
Economics editor Stephanie Flanders will continue to present Start the Week, along with other guest presenters, until Marr returns.
Three months after his stroke, Marr gave an interview to his own programme, in which he said: "I'm frankly lucky to be alive."
He blamed the stroke on overworking and intense periods of exercise.
He said his voice and memory had been unaffected by the illness but the left side of his body was weakened.
