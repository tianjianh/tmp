[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pope Francis has canonised a "gaucho priest" from his homeland Argentina, making him the country's first saint.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jose Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, often pictured in a poncho worn by cattle herders, travelled by mule to minister the poor in remote areas.
He was among seven saints declared in a Mass in St Peter's Square in Rome, which was attended by thousands.
He is credited with at least two posthumous miracles, the minimum requirement for sainthood.
Brochero, one of Argentina's most famous Catholics during Pope Francis' youth, suffered leprosy that left him blind until his death in 1914.
He was moved closer to sainthood with his beatification in 2013. At the time, Pope Francis wrote a letter to Argentina's bishops praising Brochero for having had the "smell of his sheep".
"He never stayed in the parish office. He got on his mule and went out to find people like a priest of the street, to the point of getting leprosy," Pope Francis wrote.
Brochero is credited with a number of miracles, including the rehabilitation of a baby whose head was crushed in a car accident.
Also canonised were French nun Elizabeth of the Trinity and martyr Salomon Leclercq; Italian priests Lodovico Pavoni and Alfonso Maria Fusco; Mexican martyr Jose Sanchez del Rio and Spanish bishop Manuel Gonzalez Garcia.
Portraits of the new saints were placed on display among the columns of Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.
Pope Francis, who celebrates his 80th birthday in December, is the first Latin American to lead the Roman Catholic Church.
Earlier this month he named 17 new cardinals of the Catholic Church, mainly from developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
