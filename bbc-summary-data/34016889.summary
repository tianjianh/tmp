The wolf was taken after the owner, believed to be the granddaughter of Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, returned from a night out in Soho.
The "snarling" specimen was brought in to a west London police station undamaged and will stay in police possession while enquiries continue.
There have been no arrests at this stage, the Met Police said.
The Evening Standard has reported that the taxidermy piece belongs to Charlotte Watts.
Three men, who are being sought by police, were invited back to the Chelsea home and reportedly left at about 05:00 BST on 3 August.
The newspaper said Ms Watts and a woman friend met the men at a club and invited them back to the flat.
The men left but it was only when the two women woke up later in the morning that they realised the wolf was missing.
All three suspects are white and believed to be in their early 20s.
The wolf was bought six years ago from a taxidermy shop and has yellow glass eyes and white fur with black speckles on its back, shoulders and ears.
