Community payback order for driver in fatal crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted causing the death of his friend in a car crash, two days after passing his driving test, has been given a community payback order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benjamin Waterfield, 17, died after Calvin McRobb, 20, lost control of his Citroen C2 on the A947 Dyce to Newmachar road in March last year.
McRobb, of Cove, admitted causing his friend's death by driving carelessly.
He was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for three years.
McRobb must resit the driving test if he wants to drive again after the end of the ban.
Sentencing him at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, Sheriff Graeme Napier told McRobb that he had driven "without due care and attention and without reasonable consideration" for others.
The sheriff said: "It is important to recognise that whilst the charge is not one of causing death through dangerous driving, nonetheless you have accepted that you drove at excessive speed for the road conditions."
McRobb lost control of his car and collided with another vehicle, causing "significant injuries" to himself, a 16-year-old passenger in his car, the driver of the other vehicle as well as the fatal injuries to Mr Waterfield.
Sheriff Napier said: "I have already expressed my condolences to the family of the deceased, but they may be of little comfort to them in the grief they feel and always will.
"Nothing I do as far as sentence can alter that fact."
Outside court, Mr Waterfield's family criticised the sentence given.
His stepfather Gerard Broere, whose brother Teo Broere was killed in a road crash almost 30 years ago, said: "Is this what a human life is worth?
"How are the young people that drive going to learn that there is consequences to pay. They are not going to learn from this.
"This is the second tragedy to hit our family.
"We're very upset - and very disappointed."
