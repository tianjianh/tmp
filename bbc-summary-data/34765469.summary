Ross Gibson, 20, of Aberdeen, was charged following a Parkhead match between Celtic and Aberdeen in March.
He admitted causing fear or alarm, during a trial at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
Sentence was deferred until January for reports and Gibson was released on bail.
Sheriff David Hall said at the conclusion of Monday's case: "The charge that you plead guilty to is a serious one and an unpleasant one."
