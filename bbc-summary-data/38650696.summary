[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Doig, of skills, standards and workforce body Opito, was from St Andrews and was based in Dubai.
He suffered a heart attack in December and died in hospital on Saturday.
Opito chairman John Taylor said: "David was a respected industry leader, firm advocate of social responsibility, and trusted colleague and friend to many."
He added: "His straight-talking approach, determination and passionate belief that all oil and gas workers regardless of their job role, their employer or their nationality should be able to travel to work and return home safely at the end of the day, helped drive positive change in countless countries around the world and inspired great loyalty among those who knew him.
"His loss is sorely felt by us all. Our thoughts are with David's wife, Gillian, and his family at this difficult time."
Mr Doig had an early background in engineering and worked on major offshore projects in the North Sea for more than 25 years before moving onshore in 1994.
He joined Opito in 1999 and was appointed chief executive in 2005.
