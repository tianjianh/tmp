[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 1-0 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green claimed their first win of the new National League season and ended Gateshead's 100% start as a late Dale Bennett strike gave them a 1-0 victory at the New Lawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohamed Chemlal and Drissa Traore both had early chances as the hosts looked to get back to winning ways but neither was able to trouble Gateshead goalkeeper Sam Johnson by finding the target.
The Tynesiders went close through Wesley York's driven cross but that also zipped wide during a tense first half.
After the break it looked like both sides would continue to be frustrated, until Bennett's cross from the right bounced in off the far post in stoppage time.
