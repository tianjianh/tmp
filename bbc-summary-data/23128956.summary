A woman who was filmed shouting racist abuse on a London tram in a video watched by 11 million people has been given a community sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emma West, 36, of New Addington, admitted racially-aggravated disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment or distress at Croydon Crown Court.
West was filmed shouting racist abuse at passengers travelling on a tram between Croydon and Wimbledon.
She was bound over to keep the peace and handed a 24-month community order.
A judge said West was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst.
She received a mental health treatment order for assaulting a constable in a separate incident.
The court heard she was "reeking of alcohol" when she carried out the verbal attack.
Prosecutor Julius Capon said: "She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse."
The things she said included "you're not English", "none of you are English" and "get back to your own countries".
Mr Capon said many of the passengers were "upset" by West's behaviour.
"Some of them described themselves as being disgusted, shocked and horrified," he said.
David Martin-Sperry, defending West, said the defendant's offending was out of character, she was taking anti-depressants and she does not harbour any racist views.
Mr Martin-Sperry said she had unwittingly taken two and a half times the recommended dose and drunk a large glass of wine before launching the tirade.
