South Africa's Richard Murray was disqualified from second position for unsportsmanlike behaviour, after officials decided he had overreacted to a time penalty he was given at the end of the race.
Murray's disqualification meant that Jacob Birtwhistle and Fernando Alarza completed the podium.
On Sunday the team relay event takes place in Hamburg with coverage available from 13:30 BST on the Red Button. There's also highlights of the men's and women's races on Sunday at 12:30 BST.
