A go-kart worker has been convicted of growing a large cannabis farm in a concealed area near the kart track.

Paul Costa, from Falkirk,  produced and supplied the drug from more than 100 plants grown at the Emotion Karting centre in Ayr between 2013 and 2015.
The 35-year-old was caught after police raided the site and found high powered lamps and other "gardening equipment".
He was convicted following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow and will be sentenced next months.
The court heard that the large crop of cannabis plants had a value of up to Â£100,000.
Costa had denied being responsible - despite police finding numerous cannabis related web searches on his computers.
Police also found his fingerprints in the area where the drugs were and his DNA on a juice can.
When they searched his computer, they also discovered a number of YouTube videos had been watched - including "how to properly dry cannabis".
A leaflet for a hydroponics company was also seized.
He claimed it was him who found the farm and was in the process of trying to catch the culprit when detectives raided the complex.
However, jurors rejected that and convicted him of producing and supplying the drug between February 2013 and February 2015.
The court heard Costa was effectively "second in command" at Emotion. His boss Manoj Deo had also faced the same allegations, but prosecutors dropped the accusations during the trial.
