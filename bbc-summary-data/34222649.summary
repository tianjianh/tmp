Stormont crisis: Health charity 'deeply concerned'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The charity, Women's Aid, that works to end domestic violence in Northern Ireland has said it is deeply concerned at the Stormont crisis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First Minister Peter Robinson stood aside and three DUP ministers resigned after the party's bid to adjourn the assembly failed.
The resignations include Health Minister Simon Hamilton.
Women's Aid has told the BBC that the absence of a health minister may now put years of hard work on hold.
They are concerned that the crisis will jeopardise a joint strategy due to be published between the departments of justice and health.
Louise Kennedy from the charity said it is the victims who will lose out.
"We need the government to be working together," she said.
'Life and death'
"Ultimately if this work is not done, the losers are going to be the many men, women and children who are victims of domestic violence in Northern Ireland.
"To put that in context, last year alone, our 24-hour domestic and sexual violence helpline received 55,000 calls."
The impact of Thursday's DUP resignations is now beginning to sink in.
Some of Northern Ireland's health charities have asked what will happen to work they have been carrying out with the support of the health minister.
While it is civil servants who keep the health service ticking over, it is the responsibility of Simon Hamilton to sign off on major pieces of work.
This includes strategies which will eventually become policy. One such piece of work is  the Stopping Domestic and Sexual Violence and Abuse strategy.
"We need that strategy in place, we need the departments to work together," said Ms Kennedy.
"It is, after all, a matter of life and death for those victims."
