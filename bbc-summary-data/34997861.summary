[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who died on a holiday to Egypt might have had his drink spiked with heroin, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Aaron Edwards, 31, was found in another guest's hotel room in Sharm el-Sheikh on 7 March 2014.
A pathologist said the cause of death was linked to heroin use, but a friend insisted he had not taken drugs.
The coroner recorded a narrative verdict and said it was possible the drug had been put in his drink.
"It is not known how Aaron Edwards came to have heroin in his his system," said coroner Anne Pember. "It was possibly administered by a spiked drink."

The inquest heard Mr Edwards had gone to the resort with three friends.
Daniel Gregory said the group had gone for food and he and Mr Edwards had then gone out for drinks.
He said they went back to another woman's hotel room to drink vodka, but while there Mr Edwards fell asleep and Mr Gregory began to feel unwell.
He said he left his friend sleeping and returned to his own apartment, where he was sick.
In the morning, he said he was informed by the resort's security team that Mr Edwards had died.
He told the coroner he "had no experience of him [Mr Edwards] taking any drugs whatsoever".
He added: "I felt my drink had been spiked. I was dizzy and felt really ill."
The Edwards family were initially told by Egyptian authorities that Mr Edwards died of coronary problems, the inquest heard.
Dr Kevin West, the pathologist who examined Mr Edwards once his body had been repatriated, said: "There is no polite way of saying it. What they suggested was nonsense."
He found Mr Edwards died as a result of heroin use and said it was possible for drinks to be spiked with the drug.
