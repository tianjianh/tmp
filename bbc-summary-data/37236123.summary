Cavaleiro is Wolves' second signing of deadline day, after defender Richard Stearman returned on loan from Fulham.
Morocco midfielder Romain Saiss joined on Tuesday from French Ligue 1 club Angers for an undisclosed fee on a four-year deal, while Wolves are also reported to have had two bids rejected for Derby County striker Chris Martin.
