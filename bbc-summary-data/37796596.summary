The Welshman joins the Olympic gold medallists on a four-year deal and will take take up the post early in 2017.
He replaces Englishman Ben Ryan, who stepped down after coaching Fiji to a 43-7 victory over Great Britain in the final of the sevens in Rio this summer.
"As a coach, this is an incredible opportunity to work with the present world and Olympic champions," he said.
"I want to strengthen my knowledge of the game and the competition level that Fiji operates at will provide that."
Hong Kong narrowly missed out on a place at the 2016 Olympic Games under 44-year-old Baber, losing to Japan in the final of the Asian qualifying tournament.
Fiji won a first-ever Olympic medal when they thrashed GB in Rio as rugby union rejoined the Olympic programme for the first time since the 1924 Games.
