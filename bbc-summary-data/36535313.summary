Coach Erik Hamren looks set to stick with Marcus Berg up front, ahead of fellow misfiring forward John Guidetti, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's strike partner.
Belgium midfielder Mousa Dembele is unlikely to be risked after suffering an ankle injury against the Republic of Ireland, so Radja Nainggolan may start.
Defensive duo Jan Vertonghen and Thomas Vermaelen will both start the game a booking away from a suspension.
Belgium only need a point against Sweden to secure qualification as runners-up. They would go out if they lose and the Republic of Ireland win.
Sweden will qualify as runners-up if they win -  as long as the Republic of Ireland don't beat Italy by at least three goals.
If Sweden and Ireland both claim victories and the Irish win by at least a three-goal margin it becomes possible for Sweden to drop to third - but four points would guarantee they qualify as one of the best third-placed sides.
Defeat would eliminate Sweden - as would a draw coupled with an Ireland win. If Sweden end third on two points they are unlikely to go through as one of the best third-placed teams.
Euro 2016: Who will qualify for the last 16?
It's a tale of two strikers in Nice. Romelu Lukaku put a disappointing outing in Belgium's opener behind him with a two-goal display against the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is yet to score at Euro 2016 and is goalless in his last four games for Sweden.
The 34-year-old will retire from international football after the tournament and is still hoping to bow out in style. "To finish with a disappointment - never," he said on Tuesday.
Lukaku's goals were vindication for Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, who opted to stand by the forward despite calls for him to be dropped after their opening game defeat.
The situation could not be more different for Ibrahimovic. The Swede entered the tournament to much fanfare, yet he is still to test an opposition goalkeeper as indeed are any of his team-mates. Sweden are the only country yet to have a shot on target.
