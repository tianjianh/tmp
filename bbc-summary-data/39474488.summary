Goals from Stacey Hutchison and Ashley Carse gave Hearts a 2-0 win at home to battling Jeanfield Swifts.
Forfar Farmington shipped three goals in the last 10 minutes to Motherwell, but held on to win 5-3 and keep hold of top spot on goal difference.
Glasgow Girls beat Buchan 1-0, while Edinburgh University Hutchison Vale won 3-0 against East Fife.
All SWPL 1 games were postponed due to the number of players involved with the Scotland U19s squad, who were taking part in the Uefa Championship Elite round in Ireland.
Hearts were made to fight all the way against a determined Jeanfield Swifts side who dominated the opening period.
The visitors could have been ahead when Danielle McGinley found space, but appeared to slip as she took her shot.
McGinley had another opportunity shortly after but shot wide as Swifts continued to pin Hearts back.
However, Hearts really should have been ahead after 12 minutes when Kara Kidd rounded Jeanfield goalkeeper Corrie McIlravey-Davidson only to knock the ball off the post before hitting the rebound wide.
Hearts' Carse and Jeanfield's Rachel Todd shot wide at either end before, right on half-time, the home side broke the deadlock.
Jenn Dodd's free-kick found the unmarked Hutchison at the back post and she had the simple task of knocking the ball over the line.
While Hearts may have been fortunate to have had the lead at that stage, they looked a different outfit in the second half.
Hutchison should have doubled her tally when Kidd raced down the right and cut back to her on the edge of the box, but she lifted her shot over the bar.
Jeanfield's best chance of the game fell to Ellie Cowie wide on the right on 63 minutes, but her shot lacked enough power to trouble goalkeeper Ashley Watson.
And Hearts doubled their lead with a well-worked goal 10 minutes later; Carse and Kidd exchanging passes before the former curled a right-foot shot into the far corner.
It could have been three in the dying seconds, but Demi Summers hit the bar from close range.
Hearts head coach Andrew Enwood was delighted to make it three league wins in a row, and believes Jeanfield will cause a few problems for their promotion rivals this season.
"I don't think we created as many chances as we've had in the last two home games, but you're not going to create chance after chance in every game," said Enwood. "It's about taking them when they come along.
"One of Stacey's roles is to be in and around the box and score goals and that's two on the trot now for her. And everybody knows that Ashley Carse scored so many goals last year for us. The second goal was fantastic."
