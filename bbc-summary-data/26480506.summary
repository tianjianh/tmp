David Laurence Bishop, who goes by the name of Lord Biro, stood as a candidate for the Bus Pass Elvis Party.
He received 67 votes in the by-election in Clifton North, Nottingham, with Lib Dem candidate Tony Marshall coming last with 56. Labour won with 1,174 votes.
Taking the news in jest, a national Lib Dem spokesman said: "We are all shook up by the result."
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said he was not embarrassed by the result, but added: "It is a new one for us to be competing against the Bus Pass Elvis Party."
Mr Bishop, who has stood for election as a councillor in Nottingham at least six times, said he was "shocked" by the result.
"I thought there was a chance I could beat the Lib Dems because they are not very popular in this area," he said.
1997 general election He stood for Neil Hamilton's seat in Tatton as "Lord Biro Versus the Scallywag Tories".
2001 general election He stood under the Church of the Militant Elvis Party for the first time, against Eric Pickles in Brentwood.
2005 general election He stood in Erewash in the same seat as Robert Kilroy-Silk, promising to give him a job as "keeper of the Royal stool".
2008 He stood in the Haltemprice and Howden by-election, triggered by the resignation of David Davis.
2010 general election He stood in Kettering under the Bus Pass Elvis Party. Policies included "All shook-up about dog-muck everywhere? Bring back the dog licence".
2011 He stood in the Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election as the candidate for the Bus Pass Elvis Party.
2011 He stood in the Feltham and Heston by-election for the Bus Pass Elvis Party campaigning against McDonald's sponsoring the Olympics.
2012 He stood in the Corby by-election, under the Elvis Loves Pets party.
"I was hoping I would beat UKIP because it was the first time they had stood, but I didn't."
As part of his manifesto Mr Bishop had pledged to tighten laws on hand gun ownership and legalise brothels with a 30% discount for OAPs.
He also said he wanted to scrap the high speed HS2 train because it would destroy Nottingham's greenbelt and pledged to stop any more tram routes being constructed in the city.
In the last 15 years Mr Bishop has stood for eight different parties, including the Elvis Loves Pets Party, Grumpy Old Elvis Party and the Elvis Turns Green Party.
He said being a pensioner himself, he always tries to fight for older members of the community, which inspired the name for his party.
"If Elvis was still alive he would be on his bus pass, and most of the original fans are pensioners now so I thought it was a good name," added Mr Bishop.
"I always think I'm going to do well when I stand but I never do. But there is always a chance."
Mr Bishop said he had not yet thought about standing for next year's general election but may consider running for Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire.
"I have always fantasised about finishing my career on the seaside - it sounds sort of romantic."
Labour's Pat Ferguson won the seat with a majority of 154 over her Conservative rival. UKIP received 536 votes in third place.
