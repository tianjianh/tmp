The mother of a baby found dead in a water-filled pit almost 27 years ago has been traced using DNA taken from the boy's body.

The newborn was discovered at Windmill Pit, in Weasenham St Peter, near Fakenham, Norfolk, on 5 June 1988.
His body was buried at the local church but exhumed last April for tests to be carried out.
Norfolk Police said the woman was initially arrested on suspicion of infanticide.
When interviewed, they said, she told officers she had delivered the stillborn baby alone after concealing her pregnancy from family and friends.
She has since been released on police bail.
A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said it was discussing how to proceed with the case but "all options were open".
Charges including failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial could be considered, she said.
Det Insp Andy Guy said it was "pleasing" to make progress in a 27-year-old case.
"But one can only feel for the lady involved who has had to carry this enormous burden in secret for all this time," he said.
Police were satisfied no-one else was involved in the incident, he added.
