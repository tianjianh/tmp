Under the scheme, Glasgow City Council will sell 20 sites for development by housing associations in the next year. Sites will also be sold for self-build.
Other measures will see empty shops turned into houses.
The 10-point plan also includes helping first-time buyers secure mortgages and investigating options for a new private rented housing supply.
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "While there have been tremendous examples of new housing developments in Glasgow in recent years, such as the Athletes' Village and Laurieston, the city needs to accelerate house building to meet changing and growing demand.
"The huge scope of housing activity that the council will be enabling, supporting and investing in over the next decade will truly transform Glasgow.
"The building of these homes will bring tremendous economic and social benefits for the city, with the huge number of jobs and apprenticeships required to deliver new housing on such a scale."
