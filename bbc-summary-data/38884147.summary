[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby-shaking father sentenced in absence for causing brain damage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who inflicted "catastrophic" brain injuries on his baby by shaking him has been convicted in his absence after absconding during his trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zsolt Lakatos, 31, from Hungary, admitted shaking his son on two separate occasions in 2015, but had denied intending to cause harm.
Liverpool Crown Court was told the four-month-old suffered bleeding on the brain and would need life-long care.
Lakatos, who had been living in Walton, was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
The 31-year-old, of Ashdale Road, gave evidence to the court on Friday but failed to return to court for sentencing.
During the trial, the court heard that the first time Lakatos shook his son in what he said was "a moment of frustration" when the baby would not stop crying, the boy suffered bleeding on the brain and four fractured ribs.
Those injuries only came to light when Lakatos shook him more forcibly, two to six weeks later, the jury was told.
The boy suffered further bleeding on the brain, a fractured right shin bone and retinal haemorrhaging.
The court was told that although there had been some improvements in his condition, the child - now 22 months old - has significant visual impairment and can only roll over with help.
Sentencing Lakatos, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the boy would "require nursing care for the rest of his life".
He has "a cocktail of complicated physical and emotional health needs", he said, and was "unlikely to... pursue any form of independent and properly mobile life".
A warrant has been issued for Lakatos' arrest.
