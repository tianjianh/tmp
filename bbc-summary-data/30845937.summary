Shirley Towers: Firefighter deaths lead to wiring safety change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colleagues of two firefighters who died tackling a tower block blaze have welcomed a change in wiring regulations designed to prevent a similar tragedy.

Jim Shears and Alan Bannon were overcome by excessive heat in Shirley Towers, Southampton, on 6 April 2010.
An inquest found they had become entangled in fallen cables.
A change is being made to the British Standard regulation requiring electrical cables to be mounted in metal trunking instead of plastic.
The change was recommended by coroner Keith Wiseman following an inquest into the firefighters' deaths in 2013.
Hampshire and a number of other fire and rescue services, supported by charity Electrical Safety First, had been lobbying for the change.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service chief officer Dave Curry said: "While we cannot undo what happened at Shirley Towers, or other fatal fires where cables have been a factor, this small but vital regulatory change will help protect both the public and firefighters, and prevent them facing similar dangers in the future."
The change relates to regulation BS 7671, which covers electrical installations in the UK, and will apply to cables in escape routes fixed to walls and ceilings, when it comes into force in July.
Warwick Payne, cabinet member for housing at Southampton City Council, which owns Shirley Towers, said: "For some time now, all our new wiring projects in communal areas have included fire resistant clips in their specification.
"In addition - whilst the change in regulations won't be retrospective - we are planning to install such clips in Sturminster House, Albion Towers and Shirley Towers later this year as part of some wider refurbishment work."
Martyn Allen, of Electrical Safety First, said: "Past experience has shown that where cables supported by plastic cable clips or trunking are installed at high level in corridors, stairways and other escape routes, particularly in high-rise blocks, they can pose a significant risk during a fire."
Fallen cables were also highlighted as a factor in the deaths of firefighters Michael Millar and Jeff Wornham at Harrow Court in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in February 2005.
Andy Reynolds, of the Chief Fire Officers Association, said the regulatory change was "a significant life-saving improvement".
