The former Wakefield, Huddersfield and Castleford three-quarter has been a regular for Salford since he joined from Batley in June 2014.
He has scored 11 goals in 13 games for Ian Watson's side in 2016.
"I want to play in big games in front of big crowds and hopefully push for an international spot," Griffin told the Hull FC website.
"I believe Hull is the best club to help me do that."
Airlie Birds coach Lee Radford said: "He's a player we have had to put a lot of focus on when coming up against Salford over the last couple of seasons because of his physical presence both in defence and attack and his ability with the ball in hand."
