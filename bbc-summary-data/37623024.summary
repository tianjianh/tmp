Speeding drivers in Birmingham choose points or 'Kids Court'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Speeding motorists have been given the choice of accepting a fine or facing a Kids Court made up of schoolchildren.

Drivers caught exceeding the 20mph limit outside Montgomery Primary School, in Sparkbrook, Birmingham, were faced with the tough choice.
The shamed motorists were grilled by a panel of children, who asked why they were speeding and if they were aware they could have hit a child.
Of 20 people stopped on Tuesday, 18 opted to face the panel.
The remaining two will be prosecuted.
Abdul was one driver who chose to face pupils rather than accept points on his licence or a Â£100 fine.
"You do see the harsh reality of speeding and the effect it could have on somebody's life if you do have an impact or collision with one of them," he said.
Mel Jones, of Birmingham City Council, said a child is injured on the city's roads daily, and one is killed or seriously injured each week.
There have been 33 serious collisions with children in the last three years in Sparkbrook, she said, and she hoped getting motorists to speak to potential victims would help raise awareness.
