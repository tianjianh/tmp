Josh Kendal got the only goal for the Sarnians after 20 minutes.
Kendal missed a penalty flick 10 minutes later and Guernsey had a second goal disallowed just before half time  after a short corner shot was too high.
Jersey almost equalised in the final two minutes, but Guernsey goalkeeper Jake Le Marchant made a good save.
Guernsey are the reigning EH Trophy champions and have made the final for the past five years.
Guernsey are in good form, having secured a tie with Premier League side and former European champions Reading in the third round of the EH Cup.
"We're delighted, that was a tough game, especially in the second half," Guernsey player-coach Andy Whalley told BBC Radio Jersey.
"Jersey came into the ascendency in certain parts of the second half, the last five or 10 minutes we were hanging on."
Jersey's Tom Millar said: "We're disappointed with our performance, especially in the first half, we didn't carry the threat going forward that we might have done."
