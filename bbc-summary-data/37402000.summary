The "Well House" in Gotham fell into disrepair but has now had a renovation costing more than £30,000.
Until 1933, the only source of fresh water to the village was a through a pump. It is the only one of its type and period in the county.
The village has a historical connection to the fictional Gotham City.
Poor access to water in the mid-19th Century led the first Earl Howe to arrange the piping of water from a spring a mile-and-a-half south of the village.
He built the Well House in 1862 to house the cistern, but it was not until 1933 that Gotham was connected to the mains water from Nottingham.
Now referred to locally as "The Pump", it has been returned to its original appearance with stanchions of seasoned oak and a repaired roof with a new finial.
Information boards on village history and local walks have been placed inside the roof.
Councillor Gill Hutter, project co-ordinator, said: "For decades, villagers would walk or ride to the pump for their water.
"Now visitors interested in our history, especially the link with New York and Batman, can read all about it on the information panels."
The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) awarded £26,000 to the renovation project.
John Everitt, of HLF, said: "The Well House is a much-loved local landmark for Gotham and it's great to see it restored."
