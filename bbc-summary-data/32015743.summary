[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The family of Dafydd Tudur said he gave them "wonderful years of happiness" and his death would leave "a huge gap".
Mr Tudur, 27, was walking on the A487 Y Felinheli bypass when he was hit by a car at 03:20 GMT.
Police appealed for witnesses to the incident, which saw three people travelling in the vehicle taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd with minor injuries.
Mr Tudur was an Aberystwyth University law graduate who worked as a solicitor at Tudur Owen Roberts Glynne and Co in Bangor.
Originally from Rhandir, Morfa Nefyn, he later moved to Y Felinheli.
In a family statement, his father Gareth Tudor Morris Jones said: "This has been a huge shock to us all. There will be a huge gap in our family after Dafydd Tudur, but we also give thanks for twenty seven wonderful years full of happiness that we had with him."
