Lecturers in three-day strike at Ayrshire College

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ayrshire College lecturers have begun fresh strike action in an ongoing dispute over new working patterns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Further Education Lecturers Association, within the EIS union, started three days of strike action on Tuesday at the college's Kilwinning and Nethermains campuses.
They accuse the college of trying to make changes without consultation.
The college said it was disappointed by the strike and both campuses affected would remain open.
The college said "38 of 77 union members balloted had voted to reject a proposal to resolve the industrial dispute".
It said the proposal, "which supported the principle that session lengths would be agreed jointly with staff, was negotiated with the trade union in a series of constructive meetings in the days leading up to the festive break".
A college spokesman said: "It is very disappointing that a small group of lecturers has chosen to continue strike action which may impact negatively on some students' learning experience.
"All campuses will be open as normal this week and the college will work hard to limit the impact of the strike on students."
A spokesman for the EIS said: "While some progress was made during recent discussions, the programme of industrial action has now been reinstated due to a failure to agree a negotiated agreement with college management.
"A further negotiating meeting is scheduled for the end of the week where further discussions will be held to attempt to reach agreement."
