Woman found buried in Luton garden 'unlawfully killed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman whose remains were found buried in a back garden was unlawfully killed, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of mother-of-three Natalia Doherty, 50, was found in a garden in Luton in December. She was last seen in April 2003.
Ampthill Coroners' Court heard dental fillings were used to identify her. A pathologist report also confirmed she had suffered a serious skull injury.
Two men have been charged in connection with the discovery of her body.
Brothers Joseph Doherty, 72, of Port Glasgow and Daniel Doherty, 67, of Icknield Way are accused of obstructing a coroner and perverting the course of justice.
Joseph Doherty is also charged with preventing a lawful burial.
Mrs Doherty, who was also known by the surname Wilkanowska, was last seen on 15 April 2003 in Eastbourne, where she was living at the time.
Detectives believe she travelled to Luton to stay with her ex-husband Gerald Doherty.
Her remains were discovered in the back garden of Daniel Doherty's house in Icknield Way.
It is alleged the accused pair committed the crimes alongside Ms Doherty's now deceased spouse.
