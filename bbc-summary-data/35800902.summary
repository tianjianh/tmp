The brother of a Strabane man whose body is believed to have been found in the River Mourne has thanked the public for helping to search for him.

Sean Diver, 39, was last seen in the Townsend Street area on 27 January.
His body was found in the Newbuildings area on Saturday after a six week search.
The police are not treating Mr Diver's death as suspicious. Sean's brother Mark said he hoped no other family will go through what he has.
"The people of Strabane have been amazing, out everyday searching along with other rescue organisations and the police," said Mark.
"It was the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life. We're just glad to get him home.
"We want to thank everybody in Strabane, Derry, Omagh and even England and further afield," he said.
Earlier this month, the Strabane and River Mourne area received its first permanent rescue boat.
The Diver family said they hoped the boat would never have to be used again.
