[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prisoner on day release killed himself by jumping in front of a lorry on a dual carriageway, an inquest jury has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Samuel, 22, died in January 2011 as he was returning from day release to Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk.
He was with his girlfriend in a lay-by on the A14 near Felixstowe when he got out of the car.
Ipswich Coroner's Court heard he was "a broken man" after being jailed for killing a pedestrian in London.
Samuel, a hip-hop MC from Dagenham, was serving a five-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving while riding a motorcycle.
The two-week inquest had earlier heard a statement from his girlfriend Carla Fuller that he could not cope with the thought of going back to the jail and had also tried to take his own life in prison.
Jurors heard Samuel had asked Ms Fuller to drive him to a multi-storey car park on 15 January because he wanted to jump off it, but it was closed.
They then parked by the side of the A14 at Levington.
The court heard he took two jumps into the road in front of an articulated lorry. He died from multiple injuries at Ipswich Hospital.
