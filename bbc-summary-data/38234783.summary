FA Cup: Plymouth Argyle hope for Liverpool cash boost after third round draw

Plymouth Argyle chief executive Martyn Starnes says a potential FA Cup tie at Premier League giants Liverpool would greatly boost the club's finances.

If Argyle win their second-round replay at Newport County, they will earn a first-ever FA Cup trip to Anfield.
"Potentially it's very lucrative, whether it's on TV or not," he said.
"Obviously it would enhance it if we're selected, but one would expect the gate at Anfield to generate a fairly significant return for us."
Argyle's local rivals Exeter City drew Liverpool at the same stage last season and forced a replay after a 2-2 draw at St James Park.
Both games were shown live on television and the club was thought to have made well over Â£700,000.
But Starnes has urged Argyle supporters not to get caught up with the thought of a trip to Liverpool yet.
"I don't think we should run away with ourselves at the moment from the financial advantages of getting to Liverpool, we've got to beta Newport and they're going to be a difficult nut to crack," he said.
"We're always looking to improve things we're doing at the club, whether that's strengthening the team or improving facilities for the fans, so any additional funds that come in are really important."
