Exeter and England centre Henry Slade could be in line for a surprise early return from a broken leg and ankle ligament damage this weekend.

The 22-year-old has been sidelined since December and was not expected to be fit until the play-offs.
Slade was stretchered off during his side's 41-21 victory against Wasps.
"Henry is very close. He is out there now and he has done a full week's training this week," head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Sport.
"I suppose with the amount of running he has done, he has done a lot more, but what you would say is that this is the first time he has started a week and he has been selectable as a full-on player.
"So he is there and we would now class him as fit for selection and whether that means we select him this week, or it is a little early still, we will decide and announce the team later in the week."
Exeter host Newcastle Falcons in the Premiership on Saturday.
