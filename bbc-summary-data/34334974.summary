The 45-year-old Australian has also previously coached the Adelaide Strikers in the T20 Big Bash.
And he was part of the coaching team as Rajasthan Royals won the inaugural Indian Premier League in 2008.
Essex have been looking for a head coach since Paul Grayson left by mutual consent on 2 September and want to complete shortlist by mid-October.
The county, who currently have Chris Silverwood in charge until the end of the season, then hope to make an appointment in late December or early January.
Essex, currently third in Division Two and without silverware since 2008, saw the first day of their final County Championship match of the season against Lancashire rained off on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, young fast bowler Aaron Beard has signed his first professional contract with the club that will keep the 17-year-old at Chelmsford until at least the end of the 2017 season.
