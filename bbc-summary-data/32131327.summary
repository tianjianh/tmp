Lincoln Castle has re-opened following a £22m renovation.

The work, which has taken four years, has seen a vault built to house one of the original copies of the Magna Carta, ready for its 800th anniversary in June.
A new wall walk has been installed and the Victorian prison will also reopen to visitors.
The work was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, Heritage Lottery money and private donations.
The high-security underground vault will house the 1215 Magna Carta, alongside an original copy of the Charter of the Forest, which was signed two years later.
Castle manager Rachael Thomas said the Lincoln Castle Revealed project has given the document "the home it deserves".
"Not only is Magna Carta a cornerstone of our justice system, but it has served as an inspiration to other nations around the globe," she said.
The county council, which runs the castle, said it hopes the vault will make the castle an attraction for international visitors.
Built by William the Conqueror in the 11th Century, it has been closed for the last three months while finishing touches were made to the refurbishment work.
Work was disrupted when a Saxon skeleton was found in 2013 and more recently when adaptations had to be found to accommodate bats on the site.
Cash for the improvements came from the council, Heritage Lottery Fund, European Regional Development Fund, David Ross Foundation, Garfield Weston Foundation and private donations.
