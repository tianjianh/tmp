Rory McIlroy hit an eight-under-par 64 which included a record-equalling 29 on the back nine to surge into contention at the Players Championship.

The world number three started the second round on level par and had five birdies and an eagle in his opening seven holes after starting on the 10th.
The Northern Irishman's effort equalled the tournament record at Sawgrass set in round one by Ireland's Shane Lowry.
McIlroy is two shots behind clubhouse leaders Jonas Blixt and Alex Cejka.
The 27-year-old was one of the early starters and began his round nine shots adrift of overnight leader Jason Day, but took advantage of one of his favourites stretches of holes, sinking a 25-foot putt for birdie on the 10th.
He got up and down from a greenside bunker on the par-five 11th, before making it four birdies in a row on the 12th and 13th.
After a first par of the day on the 14th, the four-time major winner holed from six feet on the 15th for birdie.
From 50 feet across the green he eagled the 16th, only to leave another long-range putt just inches short on the famous par-three 17th island hole.
He managed two further birdies on the front nine but hit a bogey six on his last hole, the ninth, his only dropped shot of the day.
McIlroy's brilliant run of scoring means he has now played the back nine in 44 under par since 2013, compared to 12 over par for the front nine.
Portrush golfer Graeme McDowell is two under after a two-under par round of 70.
Meanwhile, American Will Wilcox made the first hole-in-one on the 17th at Sawgrass since 2002.
