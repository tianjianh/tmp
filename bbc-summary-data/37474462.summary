Salford Red Devils prop Adam Walne will miss the Million Pound Game against Hull KR after being handed a one-match ban for a dangerous throw.

He submitted an early guilty plea for the Grade B charge in Salford's 14-42 win against Batley Bulldogs.
Hull KR's Jamie Peacock has also been charged for contact with a referee but the club say he will not face a ban.
The Grade A charge was issued against Peacock following the 23-22 defeat against Huddersfield Giants.
The winner of Saturday's Million Pound Game will retain their Super League status and secure their place in English rugby league's top flight for 2017, while the loser will drop to the Championship for next season.
