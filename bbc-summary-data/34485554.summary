Eddie Jones: England have lacked bulldog spirit at World Cup

England have lacked their traditional "bulldog spirit" since winning the 2003 World Cup, says Japan boss Eddie Jones.

Jones, whose side can still qualify for the last eight of this year's tournament, added that he would discuss the England role if it was available.
"There are definitely issues in the English game," Jones, who was Australia coach when England beat them in the final 12 years ago, told BBC Sport.
"England teams usually have a strong set-piece, a strong defence."
Jones' Japan side caused the shock of the World Cup so far when they beat two-time champions South Africa in their opening match of the tournament.
His appointment as head coach of South African Super Rugby side Stormers was confirmed shortly after he humbled the Springboks - but he says he would consider an approach from the Rugby Football Union if it decides to replace current England head coach Stuart Lancaster.
"You speak to anyone," the Australian said.
"I have not indicated that I want to coach England or desire the job, but certainly if the RFU came knocking at the door I would chat to them."
On England's struggles, he added: "Clive Woodward's side in 2003 was built around a very strong set-piece and defence.
"Over the six years Woodward had them, they built a very good all-round attacking game. That is the basis for every successful international team."
Jones also believes captain Chris Robshaw does not justify his place in the number seven shirt.
"I just don't think that Robshaw is an open-side flanker, he is more a six and a half," he said.
"If you can't find a proper open-side flanker that is playing in England - which seems to be the case - then there has to be some sort of structural problem."
Leicester coach and former England hooker Richard Cockerill agrees that something needs to change in the wake of a World Cup campaign that ended in the Pool stages after defeats to Wales and Australia.
"Clearly the one thing you can't do is nothing, because it's not worked for whatever reason," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I've seen it at Leicester myself. Last year we had trouble in getting the message across, so I made changes.
"There were people who left the club who were my friends and who I had worked with for a long time.
"Sometimes you have to make tough professional calls."
