Jonathan Davies: Scarlets only option for Wales centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales centre Jonathan Davies says he could not have joined any Welsh region other than Scarlets when he decided to return to his homeland.

Davies rejoins Scarlets from Clermont Auvergne for 2016-17 on a national dual contract in which the Welsh Rugby Union pays 60% of his wages.
"If I was going to go back that would be the club," said 27-year-old Davies.
He now hopes fellow Wales centre Scott Williams will stay at Parc y Scarlets beyond the end of the season.
Williams, out of contract in May, is currently sidelined by a knee injury suffered in Wales' 2015 World Cup win over England at Twickenham.
"Scott's world class and I think he was showing before he got injured how lethal he is in the back-line," the 2013 British and Irish Lion told BBC Wales' Sport Wales programme.
"I enjoyed playing with him when I was at the Scarlets and hopefully he can stay and we can build a partnership back together again."
Davies, who left for France in 2014, missed the whole World Cup after suffering a knee injury last summer.
He said the thought of joining Ospreys, Cardiff Blues or Newport Gwent Dragons did not enter his head.
The Ospreys, in particular, were deemed unsuitable because of a comment from Davies' mother.
"My mum said I didn't look good in a black Ospreys jersey, so she was making the decision, really," said Davies.
He says travelling after Wales games back to France "gets to your body sometimes".
And he believes the dual contracts, which include rising stars as well as established Test players, are positive for Welsh rugby.
"The union paying the salary for some of the internationals will help increase the quality of the squads throughout them, with the regions having more money to spend on other players," said Davies.
