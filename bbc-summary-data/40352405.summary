The Exiles should then have hosted Crewe Alexandra the following Saturday, but because of work on the Rodney Parade pitch that contest will now be played at Crewe's Gresty Road.
The first home game is set for Saturday 26 August against Chesterfield.
Mike Flynn's side are at Wycombe Wanderers on Boxing Day and home against Exeter City on New Year's Day.
They will now host Crewe on Saturday 24 March.
Newport finish the regular league season at Carlisle United on Saturday, 5 May, hoping that they will not need a repeat of last season's dramatic last-day win to avoid relegation.
