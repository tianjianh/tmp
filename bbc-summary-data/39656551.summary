Celtic v Rangers: Pedro Caixinha has no problems with Celtic's Scott Brown appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pedro Caixinha does not blame Celtic for appealing against Scott Brown's red card and thus allowing the midfielder to face his Rangers side on Sunday.

The case will not be heard until next week, allowing Celtic's captain to play in the Scottish Cup semi-final.
Manager Caixinha thinks his Glasgow rivals "are taking the right decision".
"If I had one player who was in my starting 11 or match-day 18 who I really counted on and had conditions to appeal, I'd do the same," he said.
Referee Don Robertson sent off Brown for a lunge on Ross County striker Liam Boyce during Sunday's controversial and stormy 2-2 Scottish Premiership draw in Dingwall.
Robertson had minutes earlier given County a penalty after Alex Schalk went down in the box for a dive that led to the striker receiving a retrospective ban from the Scottish FA.
Former Celtic striker John Hartson has criticised the decision to appoint Robertson as one of the additional assistant referees helping out Willie Collum.
But Caixinha insists he is happy with the officials in Scotland - even after a recent game against Kilmarnock when "you could say we should have had three handballs".
"I've had some very good chats with the league officials, so we have fantastic relations with all of them and fantastic relations with the fourth officials," he said. "So I have nothing to complain about.
"Sometimes they take good decisions, other times they don't. It's part of the deal and you need to respect it.
"It could be one decision that goes for me or goes for Brendan [Rodgers] this weekend. The refs are human like us."
It will be Caixinha's first taste of an Old Firm derby from the dugout after observing March's 1-1 league draw at Celtic Park the day after his appointment.
Having already retained the league title for a sixth time and won the League Cup, Celtic, unbeaten domestically this season, are on target to complete the treble.
However, Caixinha stresses that even the best teams have their flaws and it was up to him and his team to exploit Celtic's.
"All teams have weaknesses - even the best teams in the world at this moment," he said.
"It's difficult to pick out one from the Champions League semi-finals, but if you say maybe it's between Real Madrid and Juventus, they all have weaknesses.
"The only question is can you identify them? Can you get your team to expose them and then exploit them?"
