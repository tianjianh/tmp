Amir Ali, of Ridge Road, Crouch End, north London, tried to set fire to the Imperial pub in Crawley, West Sussex.
He broke a window while another man threw a petrol bomb which hit Ali and burst into flames in May 2008, Hove Crown Court heard.
The 28-year-old panicked and hit his head on a lamppost as he fled.
Ali, who was linked to the attack by police when he sought treatment for his head injury, was found guilty in August of criminal damage.
Sussex Police said he had consistently denied being involved in the attack despite it being caught on CCTV.
Police are still trying to seek the identity of the second man involved.
