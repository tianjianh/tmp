Police review Cheshire East Council physio contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheshire Police are to review the awarding of Cheshire East Council contracts to the council leader's physiotherapist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leader Michael Jones resigned last week after facing criticism over his links with the owner of a fitness company.
He denied any wrongdoing and said he stood down to avoid infighting within the Conservative group.
Cheshire Police's Economic Crime Unit will "review the available material" to see if an investigation is needed.
The council waived its financial rules when it granted three contracts to Core Fit Ltd, collectively worth Â£156,000.
The company, which is owned by physiotherapist Amanda Morris, runs fitness classes in schools.
