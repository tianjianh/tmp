Lee Angol: Peterborough United striker joins Lincoln City on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough striker Lee Angol has joined National League leaders Lincoln City on loan to the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old has only made eight starts in 17 appearances for Posh this season, scoring once.
Angol, who found the net 11 times in 38 matches for the League One side last term, has moved to Sincil Bank after forward Dayle Southwell returned to Wycombe at the end of his loan.
He is cup-tied for Lincoln's FA Cup quarter-final trip to Arsenal.
