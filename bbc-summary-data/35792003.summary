Luke Wilkinson met two Dean Parrett corners to score his first two goals for Stevenage, putting them 2-0 up.
A James Collins header and John-Joe O'Toole's stabbed finish either side of half-time brought the Cobblers level.
Fraser Franks was sent off for pulling down Sam Hoskins before Ricky Holmes' sensational 95th-minute strike from the edge of the box won it for Northampton.
Northampton are 17 points clear of fourth-placed Plymouth with just nine games left to play, while Stevenage are just seven points clear of the drop zone in 22nd position.
The goal ended a turbulent week for striker Collins, who apologised after being photographed appearing to relieve himself into a glass on a racecourse balcony at the Cheltenham Festival.

Stevenage caretaker manager Darren Sarll told BBC Three Counties Radio: "I think you always get what you deserve unfortunately in football. If you don't defend set-pieces properly, you don't win games.
"The first one was the absolute killer in the game, at the time it was.
"I've said already inexperienced players make inexperienced errors. They've not meant, they're not, they're just inexperienced."
