Tesco wins £1.50 compensation over spilt milk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Supermarket giant Tesco has won £1.50 compensation from a customer who spilt a bottle of milk in one of its stores.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shopper Cornelius Price, 40, threw the six-pint bottle in a temper, Llandrindod Wells Magistrates' Court heard.
It was claimed he was verbally abusive and escorted off the premises.
Admitting criminal damage, Price said he threw the milk towards the store manager saying "catch it" but it accidentally spilt.
"He was told to return the milk he was holding and leave the store and he threw it at the floor in temper," said Julie Sullivan, prosecuting.
"£1.50 compensation is requested for the milk."
Phil Sherrard, defending, said: "This is minor criminal damage. He knows he should have been more careful with the milk."
Price was told to pay £1.50 compensation to Tesco, fined £75, ordered to pay £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs. The money will be deducted from his benefits at £10 a fortnight.
