Manchester's war memorial is to be moved as part of a re-design of the city centre.

Plans for the move from its site next to the tram station to a more prominent position in St Peter's Square have been approved by the city council.
The proposal arose from a competition to re-design the square and the proposed Metrolink extension.
English Heritage and the War Memorial Trust opposed the plans, fearing damage to the Grade II-listed memorial.
Other veterans' groups had supported the move.
Lt Col Richard Jordan, of 103 Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers), said: "I believe its new location will provide a fitting and peaceful place in which members of the public, service personnel and veterans can continue to pay their respects to the city's fallen soldiers, sailors and airmen."
The cenotaph will move from its current site between the St Peter's Square Metrolink platform and Mosley Street to a spot opposite the Cooper Street entrance to the town hall.
City council leader Sir Richard Leese said: "The cenotaph is a tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our city and our country and respect for what it represents is, and will remain, our paramount consideration.
"Now the planning committee has approved the proposals, we will continue to liaise closely with veteran's groups, church authorities and heritage bodies throughout the process."
