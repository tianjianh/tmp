Adults in the UK are some of the worst sleepers in the world, according to a survey.

In the survey of 1,000 people aged 18 and over, more than a third (37%) of Britons said they did not get the right amount of sleep.
People in India scored the best in the survey, carried out by Aviva, with 9%.
Twenty-nine per cent of families said they prioritised improving their sleep over reducing sugar intake and eating more healthily.
The survey of 13 countries also found that 25% of Britons list getting a better night's sleep as a priority.
It is the second most common health ambition, beaten only by wanting to lose weight or improve BMI.
Only half (51%) of parents said they ensure their children get the right amount of sleep with 49% admitting to using going to bed later as a reward for their children.
Dr Doug Wright, Medical Director for Aviva UK Health said people feeling like they are running on empty were "not alone".
He said: "The importance of getting a decent night's sleep should never be underestimated. Sleep plays an important role in mental and physical health, with your body using this time to renew and repair."
