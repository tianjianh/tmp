[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Barr, 34, was killed in the Sunset House pub on 25 April. Hundreds attended his funeral Mass at St Mary's Church on Thursday morning.
About a dozen people dressed in paramilitary-style uniform led the cortege to the church.
Mr Barr was known to gardaí (Irish police) for involvement with dissident republicanism.
Mr Barr was killed in the same north inner city pub where he worked as a barman.
Two men, described as skinny and wearing masks, entered the pub and fired a number of shots.
They escaped with another man in a Silver Audi that was later found burnt out in Drumcondra.
Detectives investigating the murder had raided Mr Barr's home several days before the fatal shooting.
Gardaí said at the time that they were keeping an open mind about who was responsible for Mr Barr's murder but were not ruling out the possibility that the killing was linked to a feud between two criminal gangs.
Several hundred mourners joined the cortege as it left his father's home in the village of Clady for requiem Mass in Melmount.
Black flags were placed on lampposts along part of the route. The coffin was draped in a tricolour with a black beret and gloves on top.
There was a noticeable PSNI presence in the area with a police helicopter circling overhead. Gardaí also mounted checkpoints over the border in County Donegal.
