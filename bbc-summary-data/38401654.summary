[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 16-month-old boy born with "numerous" heart defects is facing a race against time to find a new heart.

Stanley Scarratt, from Staffordshire, is in Birmingham Children's Hospital waiting for a donor.
The youngster, who has needed a pacemaker since he was born, went into cardiac arrest last week and is now on a ventilator.
His father Marc said the only thing that will give Stanley a long-term future is a heart transplant.

Mr Scarratt, from Kidsgrove, said the "wheels were set in motion" for a transplant months ago, but four weeks ago Stanley picked up a respiratory virus and was admitted to the Royal Stoke Hospital.
After three weeks on the ward, on the day he was discharged he suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to the car park.
"His mum had to grab him out of his car seat, run him to the main entrance and they ran him into intensive care, performed CPR and managed to resuscitate him.
"Since that has happened we've been transferred to Birmingham and he has been in intensive care ever since on a ventilator," he said.
While a transplant was "probably always going to be the case", Mr Scarratt said "it's become much more of a rush since this has happened".
He said the family lives "a day at a time" and hope to get Stanley, who he said has an "amazing personality" to a position where he can come off his ventilator.
He added: "He is such a fighter, we are so proud of him. He doesn't give up."
