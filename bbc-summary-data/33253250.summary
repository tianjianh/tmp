The guest had been jailed, Brajesh Srivastava, additional superintendent of police in the town of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC.
Police said the gun owned by the guest was illegal and had been confiscated.
The song the guest is said to have wanted played is called Tamanche pe disco, which translates from Hindi as "dancing with an illegal firearm".
The victim, identified as Arun Valmiki, had been hired as a disc jockey for a private party organised at the residence of a local businessman, one of his relatives told the BBC.
The man who shot Mr Valmiki is a relative of the host and, armed with a revolver, fired in the air several times while on the dance floor, the victim's relative added.
In the video for the song, which is from a film called Bullett Raja, the hero is seen flaunting a revolver while dancing in a discotheque.
Mr Valmiki had been taken to a government hospital but was declared dead on arrival.
