Torquay boss Kevin Nicholson hit out at his side's performance after their 3-1 loss at Woking in the National League.

Giancarlo Gallifuoco gave the Gulls a half-time lead but Woking took control after the break.
"That was nowhere near the standards that we've set," 35-year-old Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"We were five yards off everything and we got beaten by the better team on the night, and I expect us to react, and react positively."
The Gulls slipped to 15th in the division, having beaten York City 2-0 in their previous game.
Nicholson feels that his side's win over the Minstermen may have taken the edge off his side physically.
"I take responsibility in the sense that we train them, we prepare them, and maybe last week we worked them a little bit too much and it took a lot out of them beating York," he said.
"But I back those boys with everything that I've got because I think they'll react from that."
