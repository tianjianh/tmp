Father-of-two Darren Mark Harvey, 25, of Portsmouth Road, Woolston, died on Saturday at about 23:00 BST.
Police said the accident happened on the A337 close to the Holland Wood Campsite near Brockenhurst.
A family statement said: "His untimely death leaves a void in his loved ones' lives, that no words can describe."
"Darren was a popular young man, who had a cheeky smile.
"A proud dad, a loving son, brother and grandson who recently married and was taken from us far too soon. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him. A mother's love is eternal.
"Darren was a truly dedicated and loving husband and father, as well as a passionate car enthusiast.
"He lived for his wife Becky, and his two young boys, liking nothing better than to spend time with them and make them laugh.
"A kind young man, Darren would do anything for anyone, and was much loved within his family."
Police said a file was being prepared and will be passed to the coroner.
After the crash a fire crew member was taken to hospital with minor injuries and has since been discharged.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue said the fire engine had been on its way back to Winchester after dealing with a gas leak at a petrol station in Lymington.
A spokeswoman confirmed the vehicle did not have its blue lights on at the time of the crash.
