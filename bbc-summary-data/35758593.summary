Senior officials questioned over £50m science fund

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £50m fund set up by Welsh ministers to invest in biotech firms gave the impression a small group of people were awarding each other large sums of money, an AM has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wales Life Sciences Fund was created in 2012 to get more firms in the sector to re-locate to Wales.
Labour AM Jenny Rathbone made the claim in a Senedd committee on Tuesday.
The Wales Audit Office (WAO) has said ministers should have handled potential conflicts of interest more robustly.
Ms Rathbone is a member of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, which is holding its own inquiry into the fund.
Questioning a senior civil servant, she said: "The impression being given is that a small group of people, who are experts in this field, are awarding each other large sums of money."
The Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund was created on the recommendation of a panel chaired by the multi-millionaire life sciences entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans.
Sir Chris later formed a company called Arthurian, which bid for and won the tender to manage the fund.
The fund then invested £5m in ReNeuron, a firm in which Sir Chris held shares.
The WAO found that Arthurian and Sir Chris acted properly and potential conflicts of interest were declared.
The chair of the Welsh government's arms-length body Finance Wales, Gareth Bullock, said there was a "scruffiness" to the tendering process.
Welsh government Deputy Permanent Secretary James Price said it was recognised that there was likely to be a series of potential conflicts of interest as a result of finding the best people who are active in the life science industry.
"We would expect them to invest their own money alongside our own money in the projects that they take," he said.
"If they did not do that there would be questions about whether they are making good investment decisions."
Arthurian Life Sciences chief executive Martin Walton said the fund had been a Welsh success story, having created 150 skilled jobs.
"The Wales Audit Office report also stated that all potential conflicts of interest were declared properly by Arthurian," he said.
"It also made clear that the chairman of the sector panel had ensured he had declared any potential conflict, and crucially he had no influence whatsoever in the awarding of the fund management contract."
