[SN]TITLE[SN]
£2,000 reward offered for 'Holy Grail' return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a stolen Holy Grail relic are offering a reward for its return after the cup was stolen last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Nanteos Cup was taken from a home in Weston under Penyard, near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire in July 2014.
West Mercia Police described the dark wood cup as a "medieval mazer bowl" and "a wooden cup/chalice", and that it was kept in a blue velvet bag.
The owners are offering £1,000 and West Mercia Police are offering an additional £1,000 for its safe return.
Police are also hoping for information leading to the arrest and subsequent conviction of those who stole it.
The Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in Aberystwyth where it was once kept, is claimed to be the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and then brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea.
It is then believed to have been taken to Nanteos Mansion by seven monks from Strata Florida, Ceredigion, during the reign of Henry Vlll.
Owner Margaret Powell kept the chalice locked in a cupboard in a library.
After many years it left Nanteos Mansion and came into the ownership of the Steadman family in Ross-on-Wye.
