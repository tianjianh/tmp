Despite a substantial injury list that limited them to six players on the night, the Eagles moved out of reach of second-placed Leicester Riders.
Charles Smith played all 40 minutes and scored 27 points to keep the title with Fabulous Flournoy's team.
It completes a treble for Newcastle, after winning the BBL Cup and Trophy.
"When the final buzzer sounded it was indescribable," said Flournoy. "To have a run of winning as much as we have over a 10-year period and to have more than 20 trophies is incredible.
"But we want to continue this legacy and all the team and the club wants to do now is to keep on winning.
"This success was a little bit different because we started off the season with not exactly a question mark, but when I said at the pre-season press conference that this team was potentially special and then we the lost opening game of season, it was interesting.
"From that moment on, it seems like the guys were on a mission and I think we floated under the radar a lot this season in the early days.
"We discovered some incredible rhythm - we played together and it just felt right."
Riders are now guaranteed to finish in second position following Tuesday's 66-63 victory over third-placed Worcester Wolves
Elsewhere, Glasgow Rocks moved up to fifth with a 96-77 win over Surrey United, with Omotayo Ogedengbe scoring 22 points.
