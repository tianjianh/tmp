The book will trace the rap crew's origins as a New York high school punk band through to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Band member MCA, real name Adam Yauch, died from cancer aged 47 in May 2012.
Publishers Faber & Faber said the book was "a landmark acquisition".
"Beastie Boys have entertained us for years with classic albums like Paul's Boutique and Hello Nasty," said Faber's Lee Brackstone.
"They will now entertain us on the page, in this book which celebrates the 30-plus years of their unique story and influence."
Initially a hardcore punk band called the Young Aboriginals, Yauch and co-founders Mike D, aka Mike Diamond, and Ad Rock, real name Adam Horowitz, met in high school in Brooklyn.
They switched to hip-hop, renamed themselves the Beastie Boys and, in 1986, launched their debut album Licensed To Ill.
Its hit singles included (You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party) and No Sleep Till Brooklyn.
Although the music was acclaimed, the band's brash and bratty personas earned them more than their share of negative headlines.
Their penchant for wearing Volkswagen badges around their neck was also blamed for a rise in car vandalism.
But subsequent albums such as Paul's Boutique and Ill Communication are considered classics of the genre and cemented their reputation as one of America's most popular and enduring rap outfits.
In 2009 the band delayed their release of their album Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 1 following news that Yauch was suffering from cancer of the salivary gland.
Although Part 1 was delayed indefinitely, the album's second part was released by the band in 2011.
The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Yauch died just a few weeks later.
Musicians from across the spectrum paid tribute, with electronic DJ Moby calling him "a wonderful, generous, remarkable and inspiring man and friend".
The new book, to be compiled by hip-hop writer Sacha Jenkins, will include contributions from writers exploring Yauch's musical legacy.
