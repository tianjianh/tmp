A stowaway kitten "found cowering" inside a Spanish lorry by UK border officials is to be given a new home.

The male tabby, which has been named Paella, was spotted during a routine vehicle search at Portsmouth International Port.
It was thought the four-week-old had stowed away with his family, or had even been born in the vehicle.
He is currently in quarantine in Hampshire until November, after which he will be re-homed locally.
When he was found, vets were not sure if he would survive and has spent the past few weeks recovering from an eye infection, charity Cats Protection said.
Steve Bell, environmental health team leader at Portsmouth City Council, which runs the port, described the discovery as "pretty unusual".
"Paella was found cowering in the back of the HGV," he said.
"We can only assume he had been with his mother and siblings and they took shelter in the back of the lorry at some stage.
"He might even have been born there."
