Matloob Hussain, Mohammed Sadiq and brothers Basharat, Nasser and Tayab Dad, were convicted at Sheffield Crown Court.

The men are due to be sentenced on 2 February.

Amjad Ali, 36, of Hodthorpe in Worksop, pleaded guilty at a hearing last February to one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13. He will be sentenced with the others.
Mark Langan, Crown Prosecution Service lawyer, said the girls were subjected to "appalling abuse" and targeted because they were "naÃ¯ve and vulnerable".
He said: "These men have been found guilty of a catalogue of vile sex offences against two young girls [who] were given alcohol and cannabis and intimidated into performing sexual acts.
"On one occasion, one was locked alone in a flat for hours without food, water or electricity.
Det Ch Insp Martin Tate, who oversaw the inquiry, said: "The court heard harrowing evidence from two very brave women whose childhoods were robbed by these men."
The girls, one of which was 12 at the time and the other 13 to 14, were "subjected to horrific sexual abuse", the officer added.
Det Ch Insp Tate said: "No child should ever have to experience what these women have had to endure. I hope today's result offers them both some resolution after so many years of anguish."
He thanked the women for their "support and courage" over the past two years, and their families and witnesses who played "vital roles" in convicting the men.
