Ms Sturgeon met Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth, who hailed her as a "dedicated pro-European".
The first minister said she had set out Scotland's perspective on the EU referendum, saying she was aiming to strengthen Scotland's relations.
The Scottish government is considering its options after 62% of Scots voted to remain as the UK voted to leave the EU.
Speaking following talks with Mr Roth, Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was "an enthusiastic part of the EU".
She said: "Today's discussion has been a welcome and constructive opportunity to strengthen our relations to discuss the way forward for the European Union and how all voices can be heard in that process.
"Scotland chose to remain in the European Union, and the solidarity shown toward Scotland as an enthusiastic part of the EU - demonstrated once again in today's talks here in Berlin - has been very welcome."
Mr Roth said: "This has been a very pleasant and constructive conversation between two dedicated pro-Europeans and has demonstrated once again that a degree of Europe's strength lies in its diversity.
"I hope that the UK finds a way forward that will benefit Europe as a whole in the end."
Prime Minister Theresa May visited Berlin in July for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, which were also dominated by discussion of the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Ms May has pledged to consult the devolved administrations as part of the Brexit negotiations.
The Scottish government has established a Standing Council on Europe to consider how to protect Scotland's relationship with the EU, with Ms Sturgeon insisting that all possibilities including a second independence referendum should be on the table.
