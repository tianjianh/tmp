England U21: Carroll strike secures win over Czech Republic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Carroll's second-half strike gave England Under-21s a 1-0 win in the Czech Republic - and a 12th win in 13 games for Gareth Southgate's side.

The Tottenham midfielder, who is on a season-long loan with Swansea, scored soon after the break in Prague, capitalising on a goalkeeping mistake.
Watford's Matej Vydra went closest for the hosts in the first half when his shot was cleared off the line.
The U21 European Championships will be held in Czech Republic in the summer.
England lost 3-2 in France in their last match in November, after they had won their previous 11 games, but they returned to the winner's circle after a gritty display at the Letna Stadium.
In the 12th minute, Alex Pritchard picked out Cauley Woodrow, who turned and shot just over the bar as England began brightly.
However, the Czechs were more dangerous in the rest of first half and Carroll cleared a Matej Vydra shot from a corner off the line shortly before the half-hour.
Three minutes into the second half Gareth Southgate's side edged ahead thanks to an opportunistic goal from the impressive Carroll.
Nathan Redmond did superbly to nip between two players in midfield before he spread the play out to Chambers.
The Arsenal defender's cross was fumbled by Czech goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka and back out into the area, where Carroll arrived to stroke the ball home.
Carroll, who captained the side, was withdrawn later in the half after he picked up a knock and was replaced by Derby's Will Hughes.
But England's players finished the game strongly and apart from Ondrej Petrak's shot, which flashed past the post, England goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli remained largely untroubled.
Match ends, Czech Republic U21 0, England U21 1.
