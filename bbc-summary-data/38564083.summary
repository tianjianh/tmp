De La Salle: Report criticises school's 'culture of intimidation'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arrangements to safeguard pupils at a west Belfast school are "unsatisfactory and do not adequately reflect guidance issued by the Department of Education", an inspection report has said.

The Education Training Inspectorate (ETI) report also criticised staff absenteeism at De La Salle College.
The average was 40 days each during the 2015/16 academic year.
That compares to an average staff absence of eight days per year in the post-primary sector.
The inspection further found that aspects of teaching and leadership at the school required "significant improvement".
The inspection was carried out in November 2016 following an independent investigation into the school, commissioned by the Department of Education.
The school, in Andersonstown, west Belfast, has more than 1,000 pupils and was the scene of industrial disputes and protests by parents earlier in 2016.
On child safeguarding, the report said that the school must:
The inspectors will return to the school in six weeks to monitor progress on safeguarding arrangements.
The ETI inspection is also highly critical of a number of aspects of the provision for learning and the governance and management of the school.
It said that "planning, teaching and assessment require significant improvement".
The report also said that "a culture of intimidation and bullying had existed in the school which led to staff being vulnerable and stressed".
"The working relationships between staff need to improve in order to establish a culture of trust and mutual respect across the school," it said.
While it acknowledges recent improvements in working relationships, it also mentions an "unprecedented number of complex human resource issues" at De La Salle.
While the commitment of the governors "through exceptionally difficult circumstances" is mentioned, "the ETI evaluation is that there can be limited confidence in the aspects of governance evaluated".
As a result, the report recommends that the Department of Education (DE) uses its powers to directly appoint additional governors to the board.
Under the Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, where the failure of a school is "due (in whole or in part) to the management of the school by the board of governors", DE can take action to directly appoint governors.
However, there were some positive aspects mentioned in the inspection.
"Most of the pupils are motivated and have a positive disposition to learning," it said.
It also said that staff had begun work to address the decline in standards, that they were committed to the care of the pupils and that there has been a significant reduction in staff absence since the beginning of the 2016/17 school year.
