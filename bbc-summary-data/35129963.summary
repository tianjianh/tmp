Derek Serpell-Morris, known as DJ Derek, was last seen in July.
On his 74th birthday on Friday, his family said a sighting of a man being chased from a pub at the time could be "the biggest lead yet".
Police said they had recently carried out a fresh search of his flat as part of an ongoing investigation.
Mr Serpell-Morris's great niece, Jennifer Griffiths, told Bristol 24/7 that another DJ had seen a man matching Derek's description chased out of a pub in Thornbury after an "altercation about a drink" on 11 July.
She said: "I've spoken to the witness personally and he's 100 per cent sure it's Derek.
"This could be the biggest lead yet."
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said an investigation into the whereabouts of DJ Derek was continuing.
"We have recently gone back into his flat as part of our ongoing enquiries.
"This investigation remains live and we would still appeal for anyone who might have any information as to Derek's whereabouts to contact us immediately.
"Any information, regardless of how insignificant you think it might be, could be crucial to this investigation."
DJ Derek is known to thousands of people and has played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
