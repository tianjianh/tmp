Barry Hawkins says Graeme Dott's superb Crucible record and "bottle" makes him a dangerous second-round opponent.

Kent cueman Hawkins, 2013 runner-up, faces the 39-year-old former champion and two-time runner-up in the last 16 of the World Championship on Sunday.
"He seems to thrive here. Even if he has had a terrible year he comes here and plays well," Hawkins, 37, said.
Dott beat Peter Ebdon in the 2006 final and lost finals to Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2004 and Neil Robertson in 2010.
World number seven Hawkins added: "Some venues bring the best out of players and this place brings the best out of Graeme for sure.
"He is a great player; he has tons of bottle, tons of grit and tons of determination."
Hawkins cruised past Tom Ford 10-3 in his opening round, while Scottish qualifier Dott, the world number 29, beat world number 10 Ali Carter 10-7.
"He played well to beat Ali Carter and I will have to play very well to beat him," Hawkins added.
"He is a bit like myself in that he goes under the radar.
"He is definitely a lot quicker than he used to be and is more fluent in the balls. If he is scoring and has confidence then he is a handful for anybody.
"I am expecting to play very well to beat him. There are a few players in the draw you wanted to avoid and he was one of them. I was delighted I didn't get him in the first round."
