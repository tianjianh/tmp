The files included video and audio recordings as well as police reports on pending investigations.
The trove of records had previously not been made available to the public.
The disclosure comes six months after public backlash over video footage of a black teenager who died after being shot 16 times by a white officer.
The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), which investigates alleged police misconduct, released the files dating back five years.

Police chief fired over teenager's death
Protesters called on Mayor Rahm Emanuel and other officials to step down in November after police dashcam footage showed Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014. Mr Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder.
Chicago officials withheld the footage of Mr McDonald's death for a year before a judge ordered its release.
Public outcry prompted the US Justice Department to launch an investigation into the Chicago Police Department's use of force and accountability procedures.
The city posted the files online as part of a new policy to release videos of shootings at the hands of police within 60 days of most incidents.
Chicago is struggling to restore public trust in law enforcement amid the fallout over the handling of Mr McDonald's death.
A task force appointed by the mayor issued a scathing report in April that found the police department to be plagued by racism.
