Mhairi Black won the Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat for the SNP in last month's general election.
The 20-year-old sat her final exam on Scottish politics shortly after being elected.
She graduated along with the rest of her class in a ceremony at the university on Friday.
Ms Black posted a photograph of herself in her gown on Twitter.
She wrote: "Overwhelmed by all the messages of support. They're really appreciated. It's been a great day for everyone involved."
Her graduation came seven weeks after being elected MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South.
The student had yet to sit her final exam when she ousted Labour's Douglas Alexander to become the youngest member at Westminster since the Reform Act of 1832.
She won her seat by 5,500 votes after overturning former Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander's 16,000 vote majority.
The MP admitted recently that it was "quite bizarre" returning to university after being elected an MP.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, she said: "It was a brass neck walking into a room with people I've been studying with for years and they're all pulling their hair out applying for a million and one jobs and I'm like, 'Hi guys, how's it going?'."
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: "We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer.
"They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers."
