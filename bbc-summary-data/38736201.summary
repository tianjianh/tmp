A34 death: Driver admits using mobile in crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who crashed and killed a man while using a mobile phone has admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Stratford, 24, from Field Avenue, Oxford, crashed through the central reservation of the A34 in June and collided with another vehicle.
The other motorist, Australian national Gavin Roberts, 28, was killed.
Appearing at Reading Crown Court, Stratford admitted he was distracted by his phone. He was released on bail to be sentenced on 3 March.
The court heard that over a 35-minute period Stratford was speeding and made three "emotional" phone calls.
It was on the third call that he lost control of his Vauxhall Corsa and crashed through the barrier into Mr Roberts' BMW.
The defence argued Stratford had not been holding his phone at the time of the accident and it was in a cradle attached to his dashboard.
But Stratford was disqualified from driving with immediate effect and told to expect a custodial sentence.
Mr Roberts, who was living in Swindon where he worked for Network Rail, died of a brain injury on 15 June four days after the collision near the Compton junction in Oxfordshire.
