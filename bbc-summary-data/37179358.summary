Vuelta a Espana: Gianni Meersman wins stage five as Chris Froome remains third

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome remains third in the Vuelta a Espana after a late crash caused chaos on Wednesday's stage five.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Belgium's Gianni Meersman sprinted to victory, while Darwin Atapuma retained his overall lead despite being one of the riders caught behind the collision.
Colombian Atapuma lost more than a minute, but organisers applied the 3km rule to determine finishing times.
Froome and second-placed Alejandro Valverde were part of the bunch sprint having been ahead of the crash.
The accident split the pack in the closing stages and ended the race of Dutch rider Steven Kruijswijk, who sustained a suspected broken collarbone.
It was a second win in this year's Vuelta for Meersman, who held off the challenge of Italy's Fabio Felline and Kevin Reza of France.
Team Sky's Froome is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Vuelta and Tour de France in the same season.
