Four Israelis have been injured, two of them seriously, after being stabbed in the southern city of Kiryat Gat, Israeli police say.

An Israeli police spokesman told AFP news agency that security forces were searching for at least one person over a "confirmed terrorist attack".
The attack is the latest in a two-month long wave of similar assaults.
Fifteen Israelis and more than 80 Palestinians - many of them attackers - have been killed in the violence.
Israeli police say at least 50 of the Palestinians killed were attackers. More than 30 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli security forces.
The surge in violence began in September when tensions at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews and Muslims boiled over, amid rumours that Israel planned to relax long-standing rules to strengthen Jewish rights at the complex.
Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.
