The locals in the town celebrate it on the 13th because they follow the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar which is used by most of the UK.
Children walk from house to house and sing traditional Welsh language songs. In return they are given gifts, sweets or money.
Have a watch to hear about it from the kids themselves.
