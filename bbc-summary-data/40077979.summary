Alex Lozowski and Sam Underhill were injured and could miss next month's tour to Argentina as a young England side beat the Barbarians on Sunday.

Lozowski and Underhill were both forced off with suspected shoulder injuries in the first half at Twickenham.
Nathan Earle, Nick Isiekwe and Danny Care scored tries for Eddie Jones' team in Sunday's non-cap international.
The Barbarians scored tries through Australia's Adam Ashley-Cooper and Joe Tekori, who plays for Samoa.
"It was good preparation for Argentina," said Jones.
"Secondly it gave us an opportunity to look at some young guys and we got some really good performances from some of them, which gives them an opportunity to keep going with their England career."
England named eight uncapped players including try scorers Earle, 22, and Isiekwe, 19, who both play for Saracens.
Bath-bound flanker Underhill, 20, also made his England bow along with 23-year-old Lozowski.
Chris Robshaw and George Ford, who kicked 13 points, co-captained England in front of a 51,636 crowd.
It was the first time Robshaw, 30, had captained England since standing down after England went out of the 2015 World Cup.
Eighteen-year-old Sale Sharks flanker Tom Curry - called into the side when his identical twin Ben was injured during the week - won the man-of-the-match award after coming off the replacements bench for the injured Underhill just before half-time.
England: Brown; Earle, James, Lozowski, May; Ford, Care; Genge, Singleton, Collier, Ewels, Isiekwe, Robshaw, Underhill, Beaumont.
Replacements: McGuigan, Harrison, Ford-Robinson, Ellis, B Curry, Wilson, Wigglesworth, Haley.
Barbarians: Goode; Nagusa, David, Steyn, Ashley-Cooper; Madigan, Fotuali'i; Nariashvili, Hibbard, Johnston, Albacete, Thrush, Dusautoir, Armitage, Isa.
Replacements: Brits, Franks, Nel, Tekori, Galan, Piernaar, Fruean, Agulla.
