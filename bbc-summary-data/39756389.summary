[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay has been re-selected to fight his seat in Kent despite an inquiry relating to his expenses in the 2015 General Election.

He was selected by his local party to stand in South Thanet, which he won when he beat UKIP leader Nigel Farage.
It was revealed earlier this week that Kent Police had submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Mr Mackinlay said he would continue to fight for re-election if the CPS decided to prosecute.
Speaking after he was re-selected on Friday night, he said he was "annoyed" about the issue and it felt as though he had been "accused of speeding in a car I wasn't driving, I didn't even know where the car was".
Mr Mackinlay said there was no reason why the investigation would overshadow his campaign ahead of the election on 8 June.
"I've acted properly and honestly throughout and I've done nothing wrong," he said.
