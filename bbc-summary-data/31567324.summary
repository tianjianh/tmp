A banner in the stands reads: "Black or white, we're all blue."
Police are investigating racist chanting at St Pancras station by men thought to be Chelsea fans returning from a Champions League match in Paris.
It follows an incident, also said to be racist, where a black man was pushed from a train on the Paris Metro.
Captain John Terry has appeared on the pitch wearing a top with logos promoting anti-racism organisations. Today's match is the club's annual "Game for Equality".
"Football is a sport for everyone, that is one of the main reasons why we love it, and what happened on the Paris Metro was unacceptable," said Terry.
Chelsea manager Jose Mouriho has invited the victim of the Paris Metro incident to visit the club with his family.
A video shows the man, who has been named as Souleymane S, trying to get on a Metro carriage but being pushed off.
A group of people can be heard singing: "We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it."
Chelsea FC has already barred five fans from attending Stamford Bridge following what happened at the Metro station.
Manager Jose Mourinho has  said he was "ashamed" by the accusations fans had been racist.
In his programme notes, Mourinho said it was time to "celebrate this club's diversity".
He also said that Chelsea is "dedicated to tackling all forms of discrimination".
