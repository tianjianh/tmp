Pro12: Welsh regions' big moves for the 2016-17 season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new Pro12 season kicks off on Friday night when Ospreys host Zebre, and it has been a busy summer of comings and goings for Wales' regions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The return of Wales centre Jonathan Davies to the Scarlets will boost their hopes of being Wales' top region for a second successive season.
The capture of Wales fly-half Rhys Patchell from Cardiff Blues is a further feather in the cap for Wayne Pivac's side, with Patchell hoping to press his claim for a place in the national set-up, having been assured he will play at 10 for his new region.
The Ospreys also brought home an international with lock Bradley Davies signing from Wasps and, along with other key additions, they will be hoping to contend for a fifth Pro12 title.
The versatile Kieron Fonotia has arrived from Crusaders and he should provide a boost behind a pack that includes Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones, hooker Scott Baldwin and flanker Dan Lydiate.
Two players with considerable Pro12 experience have also arrived at the Liberty Stadium from the Scarlets and Dragons, with Wales prop Rhodri Jones and Hugh Gustafson adding power to the squad.
However, Wales prop Aaron Jarvis departed for Clermont despite the switch putting his international future in doubt.
Cardiff Blues have also been busy, adding New Zealander Willis Halaholo and they also have high hopes for Matthew Morgan's return to Wales as he looks to add to his five Wales caps.
The Dragons are hoping a trio of signings from Blues gives them a boost, with Sam Hobbs,Craig Mitchell and Tom Davies all now playing their rugby at Rodney Parade.
Further recruitment has seen the Dragons sign Northampton back Pat Howard, centre Sam Beard swap directions with the departed Jason Tovey and fly-half Nick Macleod adding his experience to the region.
However, much will depend on how the Dragons cope with the Welsh regions' most high-profile departure, with Wales and British and Irish Lions number eight Taulupe Faletau joining Bath.
