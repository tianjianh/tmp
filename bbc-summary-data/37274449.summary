The star had already notched up more chart toppers than any other female artist, and now extends her lead over Madonna, who has eight.
She also overtakes Elvis Presley, who has 10, to tie with Bruce Springsteen.
Encore sees Streisand duet with the likes of Antonio Banderas and Anne Hathaway on songs from hit musicals.
Among the 11 tracks are a version of Climb Ev'ry Mountain, with Jamie Foxx, and Pure Imagination, from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, performed with Seth MacFarlane.
The record also entered the UK charts at number one last week, denying Britney Spears her first ever chart topper.
In the US, Encore sold 149,000 copies - of which 126,000 were on CD or vinyl.
Streaming equivalent sales - in which 1,500 song streams are counted as the equivalent of one album sale - only accounted for 1,000 of Streisand's total.
The star is now the only act to have the scored a number one album in each of the last six decades - the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.
But she still has some way to go if she wants to eclipse The Beatles, who have a record 19 chart-toppers in the US.
