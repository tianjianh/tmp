Joe Jones: Former Cardiff Blues prop joins Perpignan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales Under-20s tight-head prop Joe Jones has signed for French second-tier side Perpignan following his release from Cardiff Blues.

The 21-year-old has agreed a one-year contract with an option to extend the deal for two further years.
Originally from Mold in north Wales, Jones has also played for Sale Sharks and RGC 1404.
"It all came about quite fast - it escalated quite quickly to be honest," Jones told BBC Wales Sport.
"I enjoyed my time with the Blues and now I've got the opportunity to come out to France and I'm just going to get my head down and work hard and see what happens".
Perpignan play in France's ProD2 and face BÃ¨ziers and Carcassone in pre-season friendlies before opening their season campaign at home against Mont-de-Marsan.
If he can establish himself with Perpignan, Jones hopes to add a senior Wales cap to his five for the Under-20s and does not think his move to France will affect his chances of representing Wales in the future.
"I feel like in my position at my age it's not a major factor," he explained.
"I've just turned 21 and I know at my age not many people at 21 are going to play tight-head prop for Wales."
