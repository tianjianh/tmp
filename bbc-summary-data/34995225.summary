The veteran presenter underwent a procedure on an abdominal aortic aneurysm last month.
The Christmas Day show is set to be recorded next week, but a BBC statement said it was too soon for Sir Bruce "to have made a full recovery".
"Due to the long studio hours, he is unable to host the show, but will still play a part in the production."
The BBC confirmed that Strictly regular Claudia Winkleman will host alongside Tess Daly, in his place.
The presenter underwent extensive medical tests after suffering a fall at his home in October.
He had keyhole surgery in November and was expected to make "a speedy recovery". At the time, the BBC released a statement saying the 87-year-old "will still very much be a part of the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special".
Sir Bruce, who stepped down from the role in April 2014, was last seen taking the helm of the dancing competition for a Children In Need special on 13 November, recorded ahead of his operation.
"Sir Bruce will record a special video message for this year's celebrity line-up and the viewers at home, which will play out when the Strictly Christmas Special airs on BBC One on Christmas Day at 6:15pm," the BBC statement concluded.
The annual Christmas show - now a stalwart of the festive TV calendar  - will feature three of the hit show's previous winners: Abbey Clancy, Harry Judd and Tom Chambers, alongside war veteran Cassidy Little - who won the People's Strictly for Comic Relief - TV presenter Alison Hammond and radio DJ Lisa Snowdon. There will also be a special performance by Dame Shirley Bassey.
