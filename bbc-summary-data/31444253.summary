[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northop crematorium plans rejected by Flintshire councillors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a crematorium in Flintshire have been rejected in a vote by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developer Memoria Ltd wanted to build the facility between Kelsterton Lane and Oakenholt Lane, Northop, near Mold.
But it was refused at a meeting of Flintshire councillors on Thursday in a vote of 13 against and eight in favour.
An application to build a crematorium on another section of land at Northop was rejected last year after being put forward by a local funeral director.
Memoria's separate plans for a crematorium at St Asaph in Denbighshire have also been rejected.
The nearest crematoria serving Flintshire residents are in Colwyn Bay and Chester.
