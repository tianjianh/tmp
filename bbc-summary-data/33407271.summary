Roadworks costing Â£10m at two busy junctions in Oxford will have a "major impact on traffic" for more than a year, a county councillor has warned.

Two "already heavily congested" roundabouts at Cutteslowe and Wolvercote are set for a major overhaul later this month.
Work includes widening approach roads, new traffic lights, improved crossings and cycle lanes.
Councillor David Nimmo Smith warned of "considerably" longer journeys.
He urged motorists to find alternative methods to get into the city such as using buses or the park and ride.
Work on the roundabouts at Banbury and Woodstock roads begins on 21 July and is expected to take up to 16 months.
Both are major routes into the city with about 100,000 vehicles using the junctions every day.
A series of drop-in exhibitions for people to find out more, view plans and ask questions take place this week.
It comes after an upgrade on the A423 Kennington and London Road caused traffic chaos last year with some motorists stuck in traffic for three hours.
The council said the work was necessary to cope with the future increase in demand from planned developments in and around Oxford.
Mr Nimmo Smith, who is Oxfordshire County Council's cabinet member for the environment, said action was needed "now" to avoid future "large scale congestion".
He said: "Clearly there will be a major impact on traffic during the work which is unfortunate but unavoidable - the message now is that people should look closely at how they travel and consider alternatives.
"If we didn't do this work, commuters would face a future of congestion and growth in key areas would be held back."
