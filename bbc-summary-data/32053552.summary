[SN]TITLE[SN]
Westminster five limber up for campaign trail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's a marathon, not a sprint - and that's just the general election.

Five MPs from the current parliament who are running next month's London marathon got their kit on this morning for the benefit of the cameras at Westminster.
Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns is one of the five and still basking in his "fastest MP" title from last year.
"It's a great way to keep fit when you're walking door-to-door. It's obviously a great way to take your mind off the stress of an election but most importantly there are two great charities, Macmillan Cancer Support, supporting patients and families of people suffering from cancer and the PDSA, supporting sick and injured animals."
With parliament dissolving on Monday, the five won't be MPs when they toe the line on April 26, although ministers do stay in office until after the election so Mr Cairns and Children's Minister Edward Timpson will be flying the ministerial flag around the streets of London.
With an election to fight, the Vale of Glamorgan MP has also set himself a more modest target. "I did 3:34 last year. I'm not sure I'll be able to do it this year, I'll be happy with sub 4 (hours)".
