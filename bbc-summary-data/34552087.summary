Sue Gallagher found a note signed only as Jodi from a woman who wanted to know more about her father Victor Edwards.
"I didn't know I had an extra sister," said Mrs Gallagher who has left messages in reply to no avail.
"If it was me, I would want somebody to try and get that information to me. And for me it would be lovely to have another sister," she added.
Mrs Gallagher, who lives in Birmingham, visits her father's grave in West Ham, east London, twice a year.
He was only 37 when he died on Christmas day in 1965.
Mrs Gallagher said: "It was about two or three years ago I found the letter. I was surprised.
"It said the lady had found out this grave belonged to the man who she had found out was her father.
"And she wanted to know where she came from and more about him; please would somebody contact her. But the rain had washed her details away."
Mrs Gallagher, who worked in the international students' office at Birmingham University, left notes but has not received a reply.
She said: "My parents split up and my mother went off with another relationship, as did my father.
"My father had another two children with his new partner.
"A little girl called Pauline and a little boy called Victor. I later heard after his death, that they had a third child, that maybe they had adopted, which could be Jodi or not."
