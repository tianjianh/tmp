CalMac and RMT talks in ferry workers dispute 'productive'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A meeting between Caledonian MacBrayne and RMT on ferry workers' jobs and pensions have been described as "productive" by the union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RMT members working for CalMac and Argyll Ferries are preparing to hold a second 24-hour strike on 10 July.
Three days of industrial action by CalMac staff last month culminated in a 24-hour strike.
The dispute has been triggered by the tendering of Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.
Unions have concerns that the new contract will not protect jobs and pensions.
Further talks are expected to be held on Tuesday afternoon.
Gordon Martin, of the RMT, described the meeting as "productive".
He told BBC Scotland: "We are pursuing every strategy and we await a response tomorrow from the company, hence the reason we are meeting them again.
"We are looking for guarantees going forward into the next contract. At the moment those guarantees have not been forthcoming."
In a statement, CalMac said it had agreed to another meeting but was also preparing for the planned strike.
It said: "Ferry customers can be assured that we will do what we can minimise any disruption caused by industrial action."
A second union, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), sent out strike ballot papers on Friday to about 100 of its members who work for CalMac.
Like CalMac, Argyll Ferries is owned by the state-owned David MacBrayne Group.
CalMac said earlier that it was "bemused" about why RMT members within Argyll Ferries had decided to join the planned strike.
It said the Argyll Ferries contract was not up for tender and no employee terms and conditions were under threat.
The RMT said Argyll Ferries relied on CalMac engineers and expertise, so would be affected by any changes to the Clyde and Hebrides contract.
