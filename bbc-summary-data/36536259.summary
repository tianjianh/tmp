'Hugshots' for Surrey Heath milestones campaign starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being urged to hug a milestone as part of campaign to raise awareness of the road signs across key routes in part of Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The initiative has been set up by Surrey Heath Museum after one of stones in Surrey Heath was removed for structural reasons.
It is hoped people will take selfies - or #hugshots - at the milestones and send them in to the museum.
Pieces of the broken stone are on display at the museum.
A replacement is due to be installed later this year.
Museum experts said people had travelled across open heathland for centuries and the tracks they used became some of the main routes used today, such as the A30 Great West Road and A325 Portsmouth Road.
In the 1700s, an increase in stagecoach travel often made routes impassable - tolls were brought in with stones placed to mark out the miles.
The museum is posting people's milestone pictures on social media and on its website. Nine out of 10 milestones remain in Surrey Heath borough.
