Royston Pratt, of Wickham, was driving a Land Rover Defender on 22 December when he hit Robert McQueen, 37, at Staples Cross near Fareham, Hampshire.
Pratt, who earlier admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention, was given a 16-weeks sentence, suspended for 12 months.
He was also handed a five-year driving ban at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court.
Pratt was told he must take an extended driving test at the end of the disqualification period before his licence can be returned.
He was also ordered to pay costs and charges totalling Â£165.
Mr McQueen, 37, from Port Solent, was pronounced dead after his Triumph motorbike hit the Land Rover on the B2177.
Speaking after the case, Hampshire Police road safety Sgt Rob Heard recommended people "regularly assess their abilities to drive safely on the road".
