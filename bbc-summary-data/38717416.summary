Luton Town boss Nathan Jones said Wycombe "targeted" Hatters striker Danny Hylton in Saturday's 1-1 draw.

Wycombe equalised in their League Two game following Hylton being substituted after receiving a yellow card.
"Danny Hylton was getting no protection out there. It was clear and blatant to see that they'd earmarked him for treatment," said Jones.
But Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth refuted the claims, saying there was no talk of targeting Hylton.
Jones continued: "I think the reaction of (the fans) would have put the referee in a position that he would have to give him (another) yellow card.
"That's sad, because he's a wonderful player, he's an example, the best player in this league. But they targeted him early and fair play to them."
Luton had taken the lead in a game between two promotion hopefuls through Scott Cuthbert before Johnny Mullins was sent off for a tackle on Wycombe forward Scott Kashket, and Adebayo Akinfenwa equalised for the hosts.
Ainsworth admitted Mullins' red card was "harsh", and the former QPR midfielder added: "If that's a red card I'd have been sent off a lot more times in my career.
"I like Danny Hylton," he told BBC Three Counties Radio. "He's the pantomime villain a lot of the time. But good players get booed. If you're rubbish the fans don't notice you and you don't get booed.
"I've got a lot of admiration for his work rate, the way he puts himself about. It was like an FA Cup tie, a real local derby, all the fans shouting, it was a highly-charged atmosphere and the referee does get one or two things wrong.
"He had a couple against him that weren't great but again he's put himself about and our lads give as good as they get."
