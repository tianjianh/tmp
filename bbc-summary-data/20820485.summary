[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hugh Grant has accepted a "substantial sum" after settling his legal claim over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, his solicitor says.

The actor was one of the victims of the illegal practice which led to the closure of the newspaper last year by its publisher News Group.
His lawyer said the money would be donated to the Hacked Off campaign, which promotes a responsible press.
News Group settled 22 other cases earlier in December.
Grant's solicitor, Mark Thomson, said in a statement: "Hugh Grant has today settled his claims for damages and other legal remedies arising out of the unlawful activities of News of the World journalists and others over a number of years.
"News Group Newspapers have agreed to pay him a substantial sum by way of damages."
Mr Thomson also said the actor had "instructed us to donate all of his damages plus an additional payment from him to the Hacked Off campaign for a free and accountable media".
"A statement in open court will be made shortly in the new year," he added.
The NoW was shut down by owner Rupert Murdoch following the revelation the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler had been hacked.
The scandal also led to the establishment of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, an MPs' inquiry and the launch of three police investigations into alleged widespread phone hacking and corruption.
Grant - who is a high-profile member of Hacked Off - has been one of the leading voices in the campaign for stricter regulation of the press.
He gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry and said at the time it had become "extremely fashionable" to hate him and journalists were "entitled to their opinion".
However, he criticised press intrusion and what he called "lazy reporting".
"There has been a section of our press that has become allowed to become toxic over the last 20 or 30 years and its main tactic is by bullying and intimidation and blackmail," he said.
Meanwhile, some 100 UK editors and publishers, including The Sun's Dominic Mohan and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, have been meeting to discuss proposals for a new independent press regulator - as recommended by Lord Justice Leveson in his report.
