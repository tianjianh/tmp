YouTuber James Mitchell asks 'nanna' to back gay marriage

Imagine chatting to your grandma about your sexuality. A 25-year-old Irish vlogger phoned his nanna asking her to support same-sex marriage, and posted the tearful conversation.

In the seven-minute video James Mitchell is seen calling his 82-year-old nanna, Joan Reilly.
"This is something we've never talked about, but you know that I'm gay?" "Yes," she replies.
He then asks which way she'll vote in a referendum on the issue on 22 May.
People in the Republic of Ireland will have the chance to vote yes or no to the following statement: "Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex."
Most polls suggest the referendum will be backed by a majority of people, but it's expected a significant minority of mainly conservative, religious people - who tend to be older - will vote no.
That's what prompted students at Ireland's most prestigious university, Trinity College, Dublin, to post a video asking you people to call older relatives to ask how they'll be voting.
James's video which has now been watched by more than 100,000 people.
His nanna says she'll back same-sex marriage: "You don't need to ask me that question, I'll be behind you 100%.
"I have always been your number one fan because you're so brave."
James told Newsbeat that the video "speaks for itself really".
"I just cried my eyes out. But it was very much relief and happy tears.
"Older people vote in large, large numbers.
"It's a really important issue that everyone votes on because it will come down to something where every vote really matters."
He also hopes it will help raise the profile of same-sex marriage in the only part of the United Kingdom where it isn't legal - over the border in Northern Ireland.
"I really, really hope so.
"Northern Ireland is kind of in a tie where it's half of the UK and half of Ireland at heart, so I think seeing both countries moving towards a marriage equality situation for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people in general would really help push the movement forward in Northern Ireland.
"My favourite reactions are the one where someone says 'I'm going to go and call my grandmother now.'"
As for James' nanna... he says she's doing fine.
"She's great, she's delighted. I told her all the nice comments people were saying and some of the not so nice comments people were saying.
"I did another reaction video with her and that will be up on my channel next weekend."
