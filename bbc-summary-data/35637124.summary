The Brewers are four points clear as second-placed Wigan drew at Millwall.
Burton boss Clough was making his first return to Bramall Lane since being sacked by the Blades last May.
Akins scored the only goal four minutes into the second period, cutting in from the left wing before side-footing past home goalkeeper George Long.
Burton manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:

"It was a brilliant win - the performance as well. I thought we dominated the game throughout.
"We created enough chances to score more than one goal but also restricted them to I think one header at the end.
"It was a complete away performance in lots of ways."
