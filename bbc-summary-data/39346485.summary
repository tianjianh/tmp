The victim had been returning with friends to a house in The Drive, Hullbridge, on Sunday evening when they were approached by two masked men.
Detectives say the victim, 57, was "pushed" - and "fell heavily into a low level wall". He suffered a brain injury and died in hospital on Tuesday.
Police are treating his death as "an isolated, targeted incident".
It was also revealed that one of the masked men was carrying a gun, police say, but it was not used in the attack.
The robbery took place when the group of friends returned to a house at around 23:10 GMT on Sunday after spending the evening in the Anchor Pub on Ferry Road.
Police said the group was forced inside and demands were made. A sum of money was handed over.
Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: "We understand that during the incident one of the suspects pushed the victim and he fell heavily onto a low level wall, causing a serious brain injury.
"He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he sadly died.
"This is an extremely tragic incident during which an innocent man lost his life. We are treating this as an isolated, targeted incident.
"These men were clearly ready to use any level of violence necessary to achieve their aim."
