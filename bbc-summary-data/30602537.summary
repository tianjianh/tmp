There had been uncertainty about the future of the former Emmerdale actress, who joined the show in 2012.
She has starred alongside two Doctors - first Matt Smith and now Peter Capaldi.
"It's wonderful," she said. "I get a whole other series of stories with the Doctor and I couldn't walk away with the story being unresolved."
She added: "There is so much more to do. I think they've finally just reached a point where they really understand each other.
"The arrival of the 12th Doctor has just kind of dropped this whole bombshell and allowed the dynamic to totally change, so I think just when Clara was feeling more comfortable in the relationship, it has suddenly thrown something new up."
Capaldi said: "I'm thrilled. Jenna has just been fantastic and such a pleasure to work with."
Fans of the show had to wait until the end of the Christmas Day special edition to find out whether Coleman's character would be staying.
