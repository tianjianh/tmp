West Bromwich Albion 4-0 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom scored three first-half goals as they swept aside a Burnley team that is struggling away from home this season.

The Clarets, now with only one point from 15 on their travels, got off to an awful start when Matt Phillips turned six yards out and fired high past keeper Tom Heaton.
I broke my leg here at 17 and I have never had a result here
Like Phillips, James Morrison also scored for a second successive game when he ran on to Salomon Rondon's pass and curled a low shot inside Heaton's near post from the edge of the box.
And the impressive Phillips provided the cross for the third, which was tapped in at the far post by Darren Fletcher for his first of the season.
Forward Rondon produced another terrific all-round performance and was rewarded with a goal after the break when his strike took two slight deflections as it beat Heaton.
The Baggies are back up to ninth in the Premier League, replacing Bournemouth, while Burnley move one place down to 12th.
This Monday night clash was not given a big billing as two mid-table sides met on a wet evening in the Midlands.
However, the Baggies had demonstrated some bite in their attacking play during their 2-1 win at Leicester two weeks ago, with former QPR player Phillips to the fore.
He was again dazzling down the flank and scored a brilliant opener in a cohesive team display.
The Scotland forward had three shots and set up Fletcher's goal - yet he was possibly not the home side's most impressive player, with Rondon and Morrison arguably their brightest performers.

Venezuelan Rondon gave Burnley centre-backs Michael Keane and Ben Mee a tough workout. The 6ft 2in forward's hold-up play allowed Morrison to provide an attacking threat and the Scotland midfielder, recently back from a long-term injury, scored a terrific second.
His countryman Fletcher then added a third from close-range just before half-time, the first time since 2009 that three Scottish players had scored in one Premier League game.
Rondon was rewarded for his admirable efforts for the team with a low strike in the 64th minute.
This was the first time this season Burnley had finished a league game with more than 50% possession, which highlights how those statistics cannot be relied upon to tell the tale of the game.
The Clarets out-passed West Brom 483-401 but were guilty of giving the ball away in dangerous areas. Keane and Heaton - touted as future England players - were exposed at the back, with the keeper at fault when he allowed Morrison's strike to beat him while his sloppy pass almost resulted in a second for the Scot.
The only time Baggies keeper Ben Foster was troubled was when he tipped Johann Berg Gudmundsson's free-kick on to the bar.
Baggies boss Tony Pulis praised his team and striker Rondon's display against Burnley.
"We are pleased - it was going to be a tough game, Sean Dyche's players are honest and hard-working but we got goals at the right time," he said.
"Every three points are enormous and back-to-back wins are very important. I'm pleased for the supporters as well.

"We will take every game as it comes - the most important thing is to make sure we are ready for Hull this weekend, that will be such a tough game.
"I'm pleased for Salomon, who has upped his game this season. He has settled in, he feels part of the group and he is such a smashing lad."
Pulis' counterpart Sean Dyche said his side need more belief away from home.
"It was not good enough - the first half particularly. The game was done at half-time," said the Clarets boss.
"We just got drunk on keeping the ball and playing in front of them and that is what they want you to do, so they can counter attack. We got sucked into it - even though we had told the players what to expect.
"We have good points on the board but you have to build on what you are doing at home and take that on the road. I think some of that is a mentality thing - to play with more belief.
"We have had two below-par performances on TV - here and at Southampton, we were miles off it.
"I broke my leg here at 17 and I have never had a result here - one of the few grounds in the country where I have had nothing."
Burnley have a tough home fixture against Manchester City at 12:30 GMT on Saturday and West Brom are at Hull on the same day (15:00 GMT).
