University of Bath 'offers best student experience'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Students are offered the best experience in the country by the University of Bath, an annual survey has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Times Higher Education survey not only assessed learning and teaching but included campus facilities, industry connections and cheap amenities.
Loughborough University came second, with last year's winner, the University of Sheffield, dropping to third place.
Almost 14,700 full-time undergraduates took part in the survey.
The University of Bath, which was in second position last year, teaches more than 11,000 undergraduates.
John Gill, editor of Times Higher Education, said: "One of the aims of the government's higher education reforms was to increase competition between universities and intensify the focus on the student experience.
"Our survey, which is now in its 10th year, is perfectly placed to track what this has meant in practice, and which universities are performing particularly well in specific areas - whether in teaching and learning, or areas such as the standard of facilities, in which many institutions have been investing heavily."
The University of Cambridge came fourth, followed by the University of Oxford.
The University of Surrey and Newcastle University have now joined the top 10, while the University of Nottingham, University of Dundee and Durham University made an exit.
The survey was conducted in conjunction with specialist youth market research agency YouthSight.
