Pupils at a school where a student was slashed with a knife earlier this year are now "well-behaved" Ofsted has said.

Worle Community School in Weston-super-Mare was rated inadequate, and safeguarding was rated as ineffective, in an Ofsted report in April.
Following a monitoring inspection Ofsted has now said the school has made positive and significant changes under its new leadership.
The inspection carried out last month found safeguarding was now effective.
In a letter sent to the school's head teacher, Ofsted said "significant, positive change" in the "standard of pupils' behaviour" and "policies, practice and culture of safeguarding" had been brought about in a short period of time.
"Pupils, both in and out of lessons, generally behave well, and all the outside areas of the school are seen by pupils as safe."
The knife attack happened in March when a 15-year-old boy suffered a "slash injury" during an argument.
A 16-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of assault and possession of an offensive weapon is due to answer police bail later this month, Avon and Somerset Police said.
A 16-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article and assisting an offender was released without charge.
