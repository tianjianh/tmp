Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho says it will be "more difficult" facing a Manchester City side that does not include Sergio Aguero on Saturday.

The Argentina forward, 28, is serving a three-match ban for his violent conduct in City's 3-1 win against West Ham.
Aguero has scored three goals in three Premier League matches this season, but Mourinho says his absence makes Pep Guardiola's side "unpredictable".
"He doesn't play and they have amazing options," said Mourinho.
"It is more difficult. When Sergio Aguero is available he plays, we know their formation."
Mourinho suggested any one of Kelechi Iheanacho, Raheem Sterling or David Silva could start as a "false nine" in the derby at Old Trafford.
"We have to reduce the unpredictability," added the Portuguese.
