A leather jacket worn by John F Kennedy has been valued at a "six-figure sum" in a forthcoming episode of Antiques Roadshow.

The former US president owned the jacket - which was kept by a former Swedish girlfriend - in the 1950s.
The exact valuation will be revealed on Sunday's show, which was filmed at Walmer Castle, in Deal, Kent.
Antiques Roadshow expert Jon Baddeley called the jacket an "iconic piece".
It is now owned by Canon Carl Arvidsson.
A jacket worn by US singer Michael Jackson in his renowned Thriller video sold at auction in California for $1.8m (£1.1m) in 2011.
BBC News takes a look at how other famous items of clothing fared when sold at auction.
He told the Antiques Roadshow the jacket was handed down to him by his father, whose best friend had family connections with Swedish aristocrat Gunilla von Post.
He said: "Gunilla was 21 to 22 and lived in the south of France and then in Paris, and she was JFK's lover before he got married to Jacqueline Bouvier.
"I believe the relationship ended in 1955 or 1956. She kept the jacket.
"Some of her belongings and love letters from JFK were sold recently in America and some of his goods were left in the apartment."
Antiques expert Mr Baddeley said: "Without the provenance, you're not going to get the dollar signs, but that seems a very strong link… in America or anywhere world-wide, it is an iconic piece.
"The story's everything, please write it down. I feel confident the market will pay that price."
The jacket will appear on Antiques Roadshow, Sunday 22 November, BBC One, 8.00pm.
