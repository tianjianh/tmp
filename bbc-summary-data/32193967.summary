Andy Murray will look for answers to his Novak Djokovic hoodoo

Andy Murray says he is going to analyse why he has struggled against Novak Djokovic following his latest loss to the Serb in the Miami Open final.

World number one Djokovic has an 18-8 record against the 27-year-old Scot, and has won the last seven meetings, including the Australian Open final.
"There have been some tough matches - ones where my game has been there, but not [for] long enough to get a win," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I need to look at why that is."

Murray was beaten 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-0 in hot and humid conditions as Djokovic collected his fifth Miami title.
The Scot added: "At the Australian Open it was mental, but today it was physical. In the third set I had nothing in my legs."
Murray also lost to the 27-year-old in the Indian Wells final two weeks ago, but said his performance on Sunday was an improvement.
"This match was completely different regarding the level I played," he added.
"I felt I pushed Novak a lot more than a couple of weeks ago. I haven't managed to quite get a win yet. I'm sure people will make up their own minds why that is."
Asked whether the consecutive losses to Djokovic weighed on his mind, Murray said: "Last year I wasn't where I wanted to be, so it's this year's three losses which are the ones I need to look at.
"Novak went through a period when he never won against [world number five] Rafael Nadal in a final, but then won six or seven times in row.
"[World number two] Roger Federer went through a period of not having won against Rafa on clay."
Murray, who will get married to Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday, has returned to third in the world rankings after reaching the semi-finals in Miami and final in Indian Wells.
