The magic lantern slides were once owned by hot air balloonist and photographer Cecil Victor Shadbolt.
He collated them for a lecture called Balloons and Ballooning he gave some time between 1882-1892.
There are also 37 colourful non-photograph slides as part of the collection.
Dominic Winter Auctions in Gloucestershire expects the images to be sold for up to Â£10,000.
