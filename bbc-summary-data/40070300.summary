Somerset had resumed on 157-5, but Kyle Abbott (4-49) and Gareth Berg (2-8) helped bowl the hosts out for 197.
The visitors' 35-run lead was quickly wiped out as opener Michael Carberry (51) and all-rounder Berg (49) led Hants to a second-innings score of 293, spinner Dom Bess taking 7-117.
Marcus Trescothick and Dean Elgar guided Somerset to 39-0 at stumps.
Somerset's grip on the game slackened throughout the morning session as no lower-order batsman passed 20.
Abbott forced an early breakthrough to remove Lewis Gregory, caught by James Vince, and his combination with Berg threaded by Liam Dawson's spin had the Taunton club struggling.
Bess continued his promise for Somerset with the ball, taking his match tally to 10, including the important scalps of Carberry, Dawson (33) and Berg.
Hopes of an early breakthrough for Hampshire in Somerset's chase were thwarted as openers Trescothick and Elgar stood firm to set up a fascinating third day.
