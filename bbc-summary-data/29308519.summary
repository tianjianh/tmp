Police have opened an investigation after Mario Balotelli was subjected to racist online abuse for sending a tweet on Sunday afternoon.

He tweeted: "Man utd ... LOL" shortly after Leicester scored their fifth goal in a 5-3 win over Manchester United.
The Liverpool striker's message has been retweeted more than 185,000 times and received around 100,000 favourites.
Merseyside police say there has been no formal complaint from Liverpool or the player but they are "making enquiries".
It's not the first time the Italian, who was adopted after being born to Ghanaian immigrant parents, has found himself the subject centre of racial abuse, particularly in Italy.
Last year, the former AC Milan striker said he would walk off the pitch if he received further racial abuse. That was after the referee temporarily halted play because of racist chanting in the AC Milan v Roma match.
The vice-president of AC Milan was also accused of using racist language to describe Balotelli a week after he'd signed for the club.
In an interview with GQ magazine earlier this year, the 24-year-old talked about the abuse he suffered whilst playing in Italy.
He also said: "There are racists in England but I think they hide it more.
"People are fighting this thing, and it's important. But in the media every time I have talked about this subject people talk about it for three or four days but then everything goes back to normal.
"So, either there is something really strong for all of us to do, some real movement or real action, and in that case I will be the first guy to participate, but if it's just talk, I'd rather not.
"We can talk about it as much as we want but things don't change that way."
