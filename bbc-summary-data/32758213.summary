Opening hours of Glasgow nightclub The Arches cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Licensing Board has told The Arches nightclub it will have to close early following complaints by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city council confirmed the board had "varied the licence", meaning the venue could no longer stay open until 03:00 and must close by midnight.
Last month police made a bid to have the club closed after a woman was found unconscious and officers recorded 26 drug and alcohol-related incidents.
It was rejected after a lawyer for The Arches argued this was inappropriate.
Last year The Arches announced it was raising its minimum age for admission to 21 after the suspected drug-related death of a teenage girl who fell ill there but the over 18's policy was later reinstated.
Regane MacColl, 17, died after becoming ill at the club in February 2014. Police linked her death to an ecstasy-like "Mortal Kombat" tablet.
Inspector Mark Sutherland, area commander for Glasgow city centre, said they recognised the decision of the licensing board.
"Our aim is always to work closely with licence holders to uphold the law and provide a safe environment for their patrons to enjoy alcohol responsibly," he said.
"Where breaches of licensing legislation occur we will take appropriate action and record and report this to the local licensing authority."
