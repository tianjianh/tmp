He said Richard Matt, 49, was shot dead in woodlands near Malone, a town near the Canadian border about 30 miles (50 km) from the prison.
David Sweat, 35, remains at large as police continue to search the area.
The pair escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora on 6 June, setting off a massive manhunt.
On Friday officers were called to an area south of Malone where a caravan had been attacked, police said. They found evidence left behind by the pair in a nearby cabin.
Matt was later found in woodland and shot around 15:45 local time (19:45 GMT).
A search for Sweat is continuing in the area. Police say he is dangerous and warned the public not to approach him.
Manhunt timeline
Prisoner worker Joyce Mitchell has been charged with aiding the inmates in their escape.
Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through.
Ms Mitchell denies the charges.
Before their escape, Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.
Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy.
