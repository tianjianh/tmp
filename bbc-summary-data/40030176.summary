Sussex v Durham: Vernon Philander helps hosts win by innings and 177 runs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex took the final six Durham wickets they needed on the final day to complete a thumping innings-and-177-run County Championship victory at Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham resumed on 97-4, still 284 behind, and lost captain Paul Collingwood lbw to David Wiese in the second over without adding a run.
James Weighell resisted with 58 before he was bowled by Jofra Archer (3-49).
Vernon Philander finished the match after lunch with two wickets in two balls as Durham were all out for 204.
When the last wicket fell, Ryan Pringle was left stranded on 38 having batted for 201 balls and more than four hours.
Durham, who began the season on minus 48 points as a sanction for their financial problems, have now failed to win any of their opening three Division Two matches.
Sussex's first four-day victory of the campaign was largely built around their mammoth first-innings total of 668 and a career-best 258 from Luke Wells, meaning Durham needed 381 just to make the hosts bat again.
But after Collingwood went to just the 11th ball of the final morning for 31 his side faced an uphill battle to salvage a draw.
Weighell struck 10 fours in his maiden first-class fifty before his 55-ball innings was ended when the pacy Archer sent his leg stump flying.
Three overs later Philander dismissed Chris Rushworth and Graham Onions to end with 4-39 and leave Durham still on minus 30 points.
