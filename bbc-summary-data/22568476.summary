Sarah Groves had multiple stab wounds, inquest told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Guernsey woman who was murdered in India died as a result of multiple stab wounds, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Groves, 24, died on a houseboat in Srinagar, Kashmir on 6 April.
Judge Philip Robey opened and adjourned the inquest at Guernsey magistrate's court earlier, while police in India continue their investigations.
Richard De Wit, from the Netherlands, was arrested on the day of her death and is being held in custody in Srinagar on suspicion of murder.
A full forensic pathology report is still awaited but Judge Robey agreed to release Miss Groves' body to her family.
Four of Miss Groves' relatives, including her father, Victor Groves, attended court.
The inquest was told she had travelled alone to India on 15 November without any fixed itinerary.
In the southern state of Goa, she met Samir Ahmad and in February, travelled with him to Konakhan near Srinagar in the northern state of Kashmir.
There she lived on a houseboat belonging to his family.
Her family were concerned about this move, as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website described the state as a "no-go area".
At about 05:30 BST on 6 April, Victor Groves received a call from the Indian police telling him that Sarah had been murdered.
He contacted Guernsey Police, who, with the help of the FCO, were able to confirm that this was the case.
Mr De Witt was arrested the same day and the inquest heard he was awaiting trial.
Insp Mazir Ahmed confirmed he was being held in custody in Srinagar and is expected to be charged with murder.
Miss Groves' body has undergone two post mortem examinations.
The first was carried out in India before her body was repatriated to Guernsey on 13 April.
The second was carried out by Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffrey.
A memorial service is to be held at St James Concert Hall in St Peter Port on 8 June.
Miss Groves' family have said: "The event will be informal, open to anyone and everyone who knew or knew of Sarah and bright colours are the order of the day."
