Each year Cambridge-based UK Antarctic Heritage Trust chooses a small team to spend five months at Port Lockroy.
Rachel Morris from Essex, Adele Jackson from West Yorkshire, Laura Martin from Inverness-shire and Iain Pringle from Lincolnshire beat 2,000 other hopefuls.
The tiny post office deals with mail from 18,000 visitors during the summer.
Last year the trust received about 200 applications for the postmaster positions.
This year, more than 2,400 people from 75 countries applied.
All felt able to answer "yes" to questions such as: "Can you carry a big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging penguins?
"Are you happy not to shower for up to a month, live in close proximity to three people and 2,000 smelly penguins for five months?"
The successful team was chosen after a two-day selection process testing their fitness, teamwork and knowledge of Antarctica.
They will receive further training in September before leaving the following month for Goudier Island, home to thousands of gentoo penguins.
During the Antarctic summer they will mail thousands of cards from visitors on board expedition and cruise ships.
They will also look after the museum, act as guides and monitor the impact of humans on the penguin population.
