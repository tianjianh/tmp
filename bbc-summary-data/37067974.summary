[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 2-1 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Tubbs chipped in a last-gasp penalty as Forest Green won 2-1 against a York side whose captain, Simon Heslop, saw red.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heslop was sent off for two fouls in quick succession, leaving his team-mates to cling on for the last 17 minutes of the National League game.
By that stage, Richard Brodie's early goal for York had been matched by Forest Green's Rhys Murphy, and the hosts had the final say in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
Four days after the Minstermen suffered a 6-1 mauling at Gateshead, Jackie McNamara's side went ahead at the New Lawn.
Striker Brodie cracked a fine shot into the top of Sam Russell's net for the 20th-minute opener and he went close again three minutes later.
But Forest Green levelled when Murphy tucked away a cross from Ben Jefford in the 40th minute and the home side's Mohamed Chemlal cracked the ball against the York woodwork before the break.
York were in trouble when Heslop was ordered off, with Chemlal on the wrong end of each challenge.
Tubbs went close for Forest Green and at the other end Yan Klukowski was thwarted near the death by Russell.
With time almost up, Aarran Racine was brought down late on in the penalty area and Tubbs made no mistake from 12 yards.
