[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SPS Technologies is planning redundancies at its site on Troon Industrial Estate, Barkby Road, Leicester, according to the Unite union.
It follows news earlier this month of nearly 600 job losses at Mark Group Ltd in Leicester.
The Unite union described the proposals as "devastating".
Mark Pettifer, from the union, said it is working with the company to avoid compulsory redundancies.
He added there could also be a knock-on effect to local firms in the company's supply chain.
SPS Technologies, which makes parts for the aerospace industry, is yet to comment on the proposed job losses.
Mark Group Ltd went into administration on 8 October, with the loss of more than 570 jobs at its headquarters in Beaumont Leys.
