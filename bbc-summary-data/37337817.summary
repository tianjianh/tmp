The character is the "feisty" sister of Chrissie Sugden, played by Louise Marwood, and the daughter of Lawrence White (John Bowe).
She is set for a dramatic entrance to the ITV soap in October, with ITV saying "she will continue to raise tensions" for months to come.
Series producer Iain MacLeod said she was a "brilliant addition".
He added: "She's funny, feisty and flirtatious - she might turn your fella's head but, importantly, she has a good heart."
He said "Emily couldn't be more perfect for this role" and that there is already an "electric" chemistry on-set between her and the rest of the cast.
Rebecca is also the aunt of Lachlan White, played by Thomas Atkinson.
Head, daughter of actor Anthony Head, said: "I am really looking forward to joining the Emmerdale cast, and so excited to be the one to put a face to the name Rebecca White.
"I can't wait to see how the village reacts to her arrival."
