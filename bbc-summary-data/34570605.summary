Brands such as Vivienne Westwood and Peter Van Holland were among those donated to Shelter Scotland.
All the items are said to be in "mint condition", with many still having price tags on.
Shelter Scotland said they were now for sale for a fraction of their original price in the Union Street shop.
Manager Kylie Cooney said: "We've been gobsmacked by this generous donation and can't thank whoever donated it enough.
"We're humbled that they chose to donate to Shelter Scotland and want them to know that every penny we raise from selling these items will go towards helping households facing homelessness and bad housing here in Aberdeen and across the whole of Scotland.
"While this generous donation will go a long way to make a difference to families and individuals facing housing crisis, we are always in desperate need of donations to help raise funds."
