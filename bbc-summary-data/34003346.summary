Sussex v Yorkshire: Play tells of last cricket match before war

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A play commemorating the last first-class game of cricket to be played before the outbreak of World War Two is touring Yorkshire and Sussex.

It tells the story of the game between the two counties on 1 September 1939 - the day Germany invaded Poland.
"I have always been fascinated by cricket and history," said playwright Colin Philpott.
"It must have been very surreal to have been there that day."
No first-class cricket was played on English soil during World War Two.
The play centres on cricketer Hedley Verity, who played for Yorkshire from 1930 until 1939 and appeared in 40 Test matches for England.
He joined the Green Howards regiment and died in 1943 from wounds sustained during the Allied invasion of Sicily.
"Despite the fact that other county games elsewhere were called off, the cricketers of Sussex and Yorkshire decided to carry on - mainly because it was the benefit match of one of the Sussex players," said documentary maker Mr Philpott.
"It turned out to be a fairly remarkable day of cricket as well.
"Hedley Verity turned in some astonishing figures of seven [wickets] for nine [runs], Sussex were bowled out for 33 and Yorkshire won."
The play, which has been funded by the Arts Council England, is being performed at Newhaven Fort in East Sussex.
On Saturday it will be at Sussex County Cricket Ground in Hove, and on 1 September at Yorkshire's ground at Headingley.
"The main reason we are doing it at Newhaven Fort is that there is a Romney hut there which looks quite 1930s, so that seemed a really great venue to do it," said Mr Philpott.
"But, of course, the county ground is the iconic venue that is relevant to this story so we are looking forward to doing it there."
