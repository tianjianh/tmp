A heavy police presence is expected at the Mass for David Byrne, 33, who was from Raleigh Square, Crumlin in the south of the city.
According to the Irish edition of The Sunday Times, police have identified two of the six gunmen involved.
It is understood that a dissident republican from Tyrone has been identified by police as one of them.
Police are said to believe the gunman from Northern Ireland is a member of the Continuity IRA.
The dissident republican organisation issued a statement to the BBC last weekend claiming that it was responsible for the shooting at the Regency Hotel on 5 February.
However, a later statement purporting to be from the Continuity IRA was issued to other media outlets saying the organisation was not involved in the attack.
Three days after David Byrne's murder, Eddie Hutch Sr, 59, was also shot dead in his north Dublin flat in what looked like a revenge attack.
Both killings are linked to a gangland feud in the city.
As a result of the two killings, gardai are establishing a permanent armed support unit.
Last week, a number of Irish journalists were formally notified by police in the Republic of Ireland that their safety was at risk from organised criminals.
