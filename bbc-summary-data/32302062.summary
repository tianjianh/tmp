Election 2015: Conservative manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservative Party has launched its manifesto ahead of the general election. The full document is available online. Here are the main things you need to know.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The front page of the Conservative manifesto gives their three key messages for the election: "strong leadership", a "clear economic plan" and a "brighter, more secure future".
David Cameron adopted an upbeat tone at the launch, saying he wanted to offer people in the UK a "good life". He said he wanted to "finish the job" of economic reform, having "rescued" the economy when he took power in 2010. And he described the Conservatives as "the party of working people".
The main pledges in the manifesto combine previous announcements and some new policies, announced at the launch. Here are some of the most important:
The party says mortgages, schools, hospitals and pensions are some of things that depend on a "strong economy". The manifesto says the Conservative Party will continue with its "long-term economic plan". Pledges on the economy include:
The document says the Conservative Party is committed to helping people enjoy the "satisfaction and rewards of a decent job". Pledges include:
The manifesto launch paid significant attention to plans to reduce tax for low-paid workers and increase benefits for working parents. Some of the main pledges in this area include:
The party says it still wants to see annual net migration in the tens of thousands. It pledges to reduce the incentive for EU migrants to settle in the UK by:
The party says it will also:
The Tories pledged at the weekend to spend an extra Â£8bn per year on the NHS. Other manifesto commitments include:
The party pledges to:
Justice
The Conservatives pledge to:
Pledges include:
As well as an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017, the party pledges to:
Labour leader Ed Miliband: "The reality about the Conservative Party is that they are the party not of working people. First, last and always they are the party of the richest in our society and that is absolutely the case with what they are saying today."
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg: "I don't think a sudden, screeching U-turn where they now want to spray the country with warm words is going to in any way hide the fact that the Conservative Party wants to cut, cut, cut way beyond what is necessary."
UKIP leader Nigel Farage: "It's a re-hash of so much that was said in 2010 and has not been delivered upon, with a new initiative on housing which will do nothing to guarantee those homes go to British people or solve our housing crisis, and perhaps most worryingly of all no commitment to Britain's defence whatsoever."
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon: "George Osborne and David Cameron have missed every single one of their fiscal targets. I agree we need to get the deficit down, but we need to do that in a way and at a pace that allows us also to invest in the NHS and growing our economy faster and lifting people out of poverty."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson: "This week of political cross-dressing goes on. David Cameron tried to re-brand the Conservatives as the party of working people - the day after Ed Miliband claimed that Labour was the party of economic responsibility." Read more from Nick here.
Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson: "The prime minister confirmed - almost in passing - that the Conservatives are looking for a budget surplus by 2018. To get to budget surplus by 2018 will require tens and tens of billions of pounds worth of spending cuts or tax increases, and of course we got no detail whatever of what those might look like."
John Cridland, CBI director-general: "Progress has been made in cutting the deficit over this Parliament, and the Conservative Party's clear plans to continue the path of deficit reduction are welcome. Business will want clarity over how manifesto commitments will be funded."
The Telegraphs Will Heaven: "The Tory manifesto basically offers a "cradle-to-grave" approach, just like the founding document of the welfare state, the 1942 Beveridge Report. David Cameron's earlier speech also emphasised that theme. "We are the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your life," he said. Ed Miliband, or any Labour leader since the Second World War, could have uttered that sentence. Because in 16 words, Mr Cameron has basically nicked the Labour Party's mission statement. He has stolen its soul."
The Guardian's Zoe Williams: "There is a considerable accent in the Conservative manifesto on creating a hopeful mood: new jobs, new apprenticeships and the right to buy housing association stock. These three promises between them speak to the voting holy grail, the "working family", those normal people whom the debate overall finds so elusive."
