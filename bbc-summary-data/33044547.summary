Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's latest remark about Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina's political achievements is attracting criticism and humour in equal measure on social media, reports BBC Monitoring.

"We know solution for everything, but not terrorism. I am happy that Bangladesh Prime Minister, despite being a woman, has declared zero tolerance for terrorism," the PM said in his hour-long address to Dhaka University at the weekend.
Analysts say Mr Modi may have been trying to highlight the importance of "women power" in politics, but he could have chosen better words.
His latest "gaffe" has led to the top-trending "despitebeingawoman" hashtag on Twitter.
Many Twitter users are highlighting what they have achieved "despite being a woman". While some have shown anger in their reactions, others have chosen sarcasm to comment on the situation.
But there are others who see "no harm" in Mr Modi's remarks.
Some have suggested that Mr Modi's team needs to be more careful while preparing his statements and speeches at home and abroad.
Foreign policy analysts had criticised Mr Modi's veiled criticism of China during his visit to Japan in September last year. And his remarks in South Korea last month about migration had sparked a Twitter backlash at home.
Dr Athar Zafar of the Indian Council of World Affairs, a foreign policy think tank, says Mr Modi is certainly keen on improving India's relations with the world.
"But he needs to choose his words carefully. His intentions may be right, but the message gets lost if wrong words are used," he says.
Dr Zafar adds that Mr Modi's foreign policy achievements get lost in the noise about his "politically incorrect statements".
"This is something he needs to change if he wants more Indians to talk about his foreign visits and not such gaffes," he adds.
