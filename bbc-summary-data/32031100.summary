[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The seaside resort is the only Welsh location to feature in the list of top 10 places to visit.
London finished top and Edinburgh second in the list based on tourist reviews.
TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said the fact Llandudno is a "great value destination" means it can hold its own against big-city rivals.
