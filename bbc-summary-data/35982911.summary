Jade Lynch, who was last seen on 26 March, was found in the Wigan area earlier.
Her social media accounts had been silent since she disappeared, leading to a appeal from her sister to the public to find her.
Cheshire Police had been following up a possible sighting of the teenager, from St Helens, Merseyside, in Manchester.
