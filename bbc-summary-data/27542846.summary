A British couple who lost their fight against extradition have been remanded in custody by a US court to face fraud charges.

Paul and Sandra Dunham, both 58 and from Northampton, flew from Heathrow on Thursday accompanied by US marshals.
The couple appeared before Maryland magistrate judge William Connelly in the US District Court at Greenbelt.
The couple are due to reappear in court on Tuesday when a decision is expected on whether they will be granted bail.
Mr Dunham's lawyer Gary Proctor said that the hearing went as he expected with the couple remanded into the custody of US marshals.
He said: "Paul is doing fine in the Chesapeake Detention Facility.
"So is Sandra, but they will be unable to see or speak to each other while they're there.
"He was allowed to bring all of his medication with him, so there is no discontinuity of medication."
The allegations the couple face centre on Mr Dunham's time as chief executive and president of Pace, a US company manufacturing soldering irons for the electronics industry. Mrs Dunham was director of sales.
The indictment against them says that between 2002 and 2009 the couple fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards and submitted vouchers to Pace for reimbursement that falsely described them as business expenses.
The couple went to hospital last week after saying they had tried to take their own lives to avoid being extradited.
They appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court where senior district judge Howard Riddle concluded they took drugs to prevent or delay their facing charges.
They were handed over to US marshals at Terminal Four of Heathrow Airport by officers from the Met Police's extradition unit.
Mr Dunham spent the weekend in Wandsworth prison, while Mrs Dunham was held in HMP Holloway.
They were initially arrested on 13 November 2012 on behalf of the US authorities.
Since then they have fought through the courts to resist extradition.
Solicitor Karen Todner said the pair were a "hard-working couple from Northamptonshire who strenuously deny the allegations against them".
