Captain Jacques Rudolph has said Glamorgan's senior players need to "stand up" after the county's poor start to the Championship season.

Glamorgan were beaten in under two-and-a-half days against Worcestershire having failed to last two days in their opening loss at Northamptonshire.
Rudolph says discussions have been held with the senior players and head coach Robert Croft.
"We've had some good, strong conversations," Rudolph said.
"I think it's important for the senior players in the team to stand up.
"We have a good blend of senior players and a lot of young Welsh talent in the likes of Aneurin Donald and Kiran Carlson.
"We've refocused and we're ready for Friday's game against Leicestershire and it will be nice to start off with a win.
"I've always been of the belief that in County Cricket as soon as you can gather some momentum you've got to try and carry it on for a long time."
Glamorgan were beaten by an innings and 22 runs by Northants in their opening game of the season before an eight-wicket loss at home to Worcestershire.
Despite his side's poor start to the season, South African Rudolph still believes Glamorgan can make an impression in Division Two of the County Championship.
"If you look at last season we started with three losses and during the season there were about three or four games where we just missed out on winning opportunities," Rudolph told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"If that had happened we would still have finished in the top three or four so it's not all doom and gloom at the moment."
