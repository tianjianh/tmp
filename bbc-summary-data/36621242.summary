The granddaughter of a composer, who founded the Nottingham Symphony Orchestra, is searching for a wedding march he wrote in 1955.

Gaze Cooper, who died in 1981, set up the orchestra in 1933 and was its conductor for over 40 years.
Sarah Bradwell said her grandfather composed a wedding march for her parents' wedding, but "sadly we can't find the sheet music".
Mrs Bradwell has also launched a campaign to keep his legacy alive.
Mr Cooper, who was born in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, died at the age of 86.
His compositions include eight symphonies, four piano concertos, two ballets, overtures, an opera, chamber music and songs.
Mrs Bradwell said the wedding march he composed for her parents more than 60 years ago, which was played on the organ at Sawley Church, Derbyshire, was also played at her own wedding.
"My daughter's getting married next year and she would like it played at her wedding but sadly we can't find it. It's the sheet music we're looking for," she said.
"I've contacted the lady who played at our wedding and she can't find it.
"I've looked through all the opus lists and I can't identify it myself from the music scores in the archive.
"But I'll just have to keep hunting."
Mr Cooper was well known in his lifetime, but Mrs Bradwell said he and his music have been forgotten.
"It is sad and I don't understand why he's not heard of," she said.
"It's amazing to hear the music, it makes me feel like I'm soaring into the air.
"It makes me very proud of my grandpa, makes me feel very privileged to have known him."
A group of ex-pupils, musicians, music lovers and his grandchildren have launched a website hoping to revive his memory and his works.
