Ben, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he disappeared on 24 July 1991 during a holiday on Kos.
Last week, police told his family that new information suggested he could have been crushed to death by a digger.
South Yorkshire Police said excavations would take place on Monday at two former farmland sites close to where Ben was last seen.

The force said it expected the first excavation to take 10 to 12 days and that "any unusual items recovered" would undergo forensic testing.
A decision on whether to dig at the second site would be made after work had finished at the first, a spokesman.
In a statement the force said it was "entirely expected that the team will regularly come across bones in the ground as the site is former farmland".
A spokeswoman for the Campaign To Find Ben Needham said they were supporting his family as "much as we can".
She said: "The campaign has received thousands of comments, emails and messages of support which is simply overwhelming and goes to show Ben and the Needhams is in the heart of the nation at this time."
Ben was holiday with his mother and grandparents, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of Iraklise, when he vanished.
His family and supporters have led a campaign to find him and his mother and police officers have appeared on Greek television to appeal for information.
Earlier this year, South Yorkshire Police secured funding form the Home Office to send 10 officers to Kos to carry out further investigations.
