Players and coaches visited Aberfan Cemetery before laying a wreath at the memorial gardens.
Dan Biggar and Rhys Webb were among those who spent time with children from Ynysowen Primary School.
Head teacher Simone Roden said it brought "a lot of happiness" to pupils at a very sad time.
The village was devastated on 21 October 1966 when a colliery waste tip collapsed, engulfing Pantglas Junior School.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May said the people of Aberfan had shown great "solidarity and resilience" to overcome a "powerful tragedy".
