The science papers disappeared from Penglais school in Aberystwyth in August.
It is believed they were in a courier delivery van which was stolen from outside a depot near Cardiff.
The teenagers were awarded their projected scores, and the school said no pupils had been disadvantaged.
Year 10 pupils will receive their actual grades, while Year 11 will only have their marks changed if they have done better than the grade they have been given.
A spokeswoman for the school said: "It's a relief, parents were concerned but it was not [the courier's] fault or ours."
She added: "The papers had been delivered to their destination but we don't know what happened from there.
"I was told by the exam board that a van had been stolen with a number of parcels including the papers, which were of no use to anybody else."
A WJEC spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, a courier service failed to deliver the scripts securely from Penglais school to the examiner.
"WJEC is unable to comment on specific details regarding such cases."
