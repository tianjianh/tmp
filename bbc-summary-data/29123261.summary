[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey association in call for review of planned milk changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to end fixed prices for milk in Guernsey need to be examined in more detail, according to the Milk Retailers' Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The States say removing rules on prices would allow retailers to set milk prices, which could see prices fall.
It is part of a report about the island's dairy industry which calls for the 1958 law, banning most milk imports to the island, to be tightened.
The association, representing milkmen, says the change could lead to chaos.
It says there should be a consultation, impact assessments and proper costing before any changes are introduced.
The group invited politicians to a closed meeting on Monday to express its concerns.
The States are due to debate the plans which ministers say aim to secure the future of the industry.
Commerce and Employment Minister, Deputy Kevin Stewart, criticised the way the local Milk Retailers' Association had approached the consultation.
He said the organisation was "the most opaque and secretive organisation" he had ever come across.
Brian Martel, of the Guernsey Milk Retailers' Association, said it was simply scrutinising the proposals.
