Vincent Waddington, 18, was found suffering from serious gunshot wounds following a crash between a car and a scrambler bike in Garston on Tuesday.
He was taken from the scene on Banks Road to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
A 25-year-old man from Speke has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Witnesses reported three men running away from the car, one with a shotgun.
The offenders are believed to have run off towards Blackburn Street, or through the industrial estate.
The area has been cordoned off whilst forensic examinations are carried out and house-to-house inquiries are under way.
Det Ch Insp Gayle Rooney appealed for any witnesses to come forward, saying "the people responsible for this attack knew exactly what they were doing".
A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the precise cause of the teenager's death.
