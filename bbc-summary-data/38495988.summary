The Magpies sacked manager John Sheridan on Monday, after a run of nine successive defeats left them one point above the League Two relegation zone.
Smith, 36, has been a player-coach at Notts since joining in May 2014.
"The important thing is for everyone - players, staff and fans - to stick together," Smith told the club website.
"There's no getting away from it, it's been a very, very disappointing season so far. But there are lots of points still to play for and we are determined and confident of putting things right."
Assistant coach Mark Crossley remains at the club and will be part of the coaching set-up preparing for Saturday's away game against Morecambe.
Academy boss Mick Halsall and goalkeeping coach Kevin Pilkington had already left Meadow Lane before Sheridan's exit.
Sheridan signed 10 new players in the summer, but oversaw just six wins from his 24 league games in charge.

"Recent performances have been nowhere near the standard required in all aspects. Spirit and determination seem to have been missing.
"It's down to players not performing - no manager asks players to go out and defend like Notts have been defending as a team. Nine consecutive defeats speaks for itself.
"The players have to ask themselves massive, massive questions. Were they doing everything they could for the manager and the club? If they didn't want to play for the manager, they should be doing it for themselves out of professional pride.
"Confidence has gone and the players are as low as they can be. Notts have a genuine challenge to stay in the EFL."
