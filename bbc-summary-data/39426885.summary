Tom Huddlestone is still suspended, but fellow midfielder Evandro could feature for the first time since February after recovering from a calf problem.
Middlesbrough defender Fabio has been ruled out for at least two matches after suffering concussion on Sunday.
Gaston Ramirez is doubtful with an ankle injury, while Calum Chambers and George Friend remain sidelined.
Simon Brotherton: "When Marco Silva became Hull head coach in January, the Tigers were six points behind Middlesbrough. His team are now four points ahead of them in the table and will go into this encounter in a more optimistic mood than their out-of-form opponents.
"Boro didn't appear to be in trouble for most of the season, but their lack of goals and creativity has caught up with them in a big way.
"They've now gone 12 games without a win and travel to face a team with renewed hope of survival, who have won four of their five Premier League home games since Silva's arrival."

Hull head coach Marco Silva: "We have a game against one of our direct opponents and we have be at 100% to win this game.
"The system we play is not the most important thing. Our intensity and performance is the most important factor."
Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "A win does change everything, and that's what we need.
"It's a huge challenge and an exciting fixture. We've had limited time on the grass, but the preparation from the final whistle at Swansea has been terrific and I can feel the players are in a good place.
"I'm quietly confident and so are the players. They'll be fully focused going into the game."
It will be interesting to see how Boro boss Steve Agnew sets his team up because this is a tough game for them - Hull had a great result at the weekend, coming back from a goal down to beat West Ham.
I know it took me until last week to tip Hull to win this season, but I think they are going to do it again, and at this rate I might be safe to venture over the Humber Bridge soon.
