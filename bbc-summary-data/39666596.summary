Paul Hepworth has been granted permission to transform the former public conveniences in Station Street in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex.
Artists could soon be making beautiful music in the lavatories after he gave the council assurances noise would be minimal and opening hours restricted.
There was a "rich music heritage" locally he said he wanted to continue.
Mr Hepworth said he was taking on the toilet block challenge "through experience", as he had "been recording and mixing for around 10 years".
"I am keen to offer something creative with an educational use and for people with disabilities, as I used to work as a music therapist and know the benefits this can have," he added.
Having commissioned an environmental noise report, Mr Hepworth said he planned to insulate the building, and the recording and mixing studio would only be open during the day, from Monday to Friday.
He will be leasing the land from Tendring District Council, whose planners gave him their "unanimous backing" and "wished Mr Hepworth well with his new venture".
The public toilet block has been closed since 2003 when facilities were moved elsewhere in the town.
