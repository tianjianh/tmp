D'Almeida was released by PSG at the end of last season after failing to make a first-team appearance.
The 20-year-old started his career at Bordeaux, playing in two Ligue 1 games before joining PSG in July 2015.
"He has the potential to become a top player," Tykes head coach Paul Heckingbottom told the club website.
"We've given him an opportunity to build a career here in England, and now it's down to Sessi to work hard and break into the first team."
