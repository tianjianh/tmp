[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Sheffield man, aged 40, remains in police custody while another man from the city, aged 36, has been bailed.
Both were arrested on suspicion of an offence under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act - preparation to commit an act of terrorism.
A 55-year-old woman and a man, 44, from Batley arrested over suspected terrorist fundraising were bailed.
The searches of five properties in Sheffield, Batley and Dewsbury have now been concluded, said the North East Counter Terrorism Unit
Det Ch Sup Clive Wain, head of the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, said: "We understand that people may be concerned following today's arrests, however we would like to reassure communities that today's activity is as a result of an ongoing investigation which is intelligence led.
"There is no evidence to suggest that communities are at risk."
In an unrelated operation, the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism in east London.
Officers have been searching the address where he was detained and a second residential address nearby.
