Jon Gorenc Stankovic: Borussia Dortmund defender signs for Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield have signed Borussia Dortmund defender Jon Gorenc Stankovic on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee, understood to be around Â£500,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slovenia Under-21 international Stankovic joined the German Bundesliga club from Domzale in 2014.
The 20-year-old is reunited with the Championship side's head coach David Wagner, who was Dortmund's second team boss from July 2011 to November 2015.
Stankovic never made a first-team appearance for Dortmund.
"He is an outstanding young talent and it is not normal that we'd get the opportunity to bring him here," Wagner told the club website.
"Jon will come in and work with the first-team group, but he will be given time to develop further."
