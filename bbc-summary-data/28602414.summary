[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a £41m redevelopment of Barnsley have gone on display as work gets underway clearing some of the town centre sites.

The redevelopment was announced in January and includes a new town square, library and a refurbished market.
A six-week public consultation on the scheme is due to take place.
The Labour-run council said the plans would not affect existing budgets and will be paid for by "recent asset sales and borrowing".
The scheme would have "no impact" on its essential services, Barnsley Council said.
Councillor Roy Miller said: "We'll really put the market and retail shopping back in the heart of our town."
Preparatory work has already started in the Cheapside shopping precinct. The former site of the Central Library on Shambles Street is being cleared to make way for a new sixth form college.
The new £17 million learning centre at Barnsley College is due to open in summer 2015.
A new landscaped square is due to be finished in 2016 and the revamped market hall, shopping boulevard and new central library in early 2017, the council added.
