A new cinema project is to take archived films on a tour of Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Made On Our Land features material from the National Library of Scotland Moving Image Archive.
The films include one made by an Aberdeenshire mother and daughter that documents farm life around Aboyne and another shows 1960s holidays to Islay.
There are also World War Two propaganda films and a post-war film made to dissuade Highlanders from leaving their home area to live and work in cities.
Using a mobile cinema and starting in Arran on 22 July, the tour will also visit Aboyne, Benbecula, Castle Douglas and Peebles.
Made on Our Land curator and tour producer, Shona Thomson, said: "I love the strong tradition of rural cinema-going that started with the Highlands and Islands Film Guild 70 years ago and continues today.
"It's an honour to be celebrating that tradition by showing films from the 1930s to the 1980s that have a relevance to the modern rural audiences now served by the Screen Machine and Film Mobile network."
