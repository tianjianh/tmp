[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have confirmed the departure of striker Anthony Stokes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old leaves as a free agent after the Scottish champions decided against triggering a clause for another year on his contract.
The Republic of Ireland international moved to Celtic Park in 2010 and scored 77 goals in 192 games.
Stokes spent the second half of last season on loan at Hibernian and scored twice in the Scottish Cup final victory over Rangers at Hampden.
He netted nine goals in 25 appearances in what was his second spell at Easter Road.
New Rotherham boss Alan Stubbs has admitted his interest in working with Stokes again, having recently left Hibs.
"I wouldn't rule out an interest in Anthony Stokes," he said prior to Celtic's announcement. "But we wouldn't be on our own.
"There will be a number of clubs interested him, particularly if it's a free transfer.
"I know him from his time at Hibs and at Celtic. Obviously, it doesn't hurt that I have a good relationship with him already."
