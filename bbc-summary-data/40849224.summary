The dramatic late intervention gave the Tribesmen a 0-22 to 1-18 win in a keenly contested All-Ireland hurling semi-final at Croke Park on Sunday.
The sides were level 13 times but Canning's 11th point of the game sent the All-Ireland champions crashing out.
Galway will play the winners of next week's game between Cork and Waterford.
The final will be staged on 3 September.
John O'Dwyer had a chance to snatch an equaliser in the final play but his effort from the right tailed off and Galway's passage to the final was secured.
Galway may not have scored a goal for a third championship match in a row but their ability to pick off points when they were most needed saw them home.
It's the third year in a row that the All-Ireland semi-final has been decided by a single point between theses sides, with Galway gaining revenge for last year's loss.
Now they will fancy their chance of a first All-Ireland title since 1988 after surviving a thrilling conclusion.
The sides were level six times in the opening half but Tipperary, playing with the breeze, led by 1-10 to 0-12 at the interval.
The goal came after 24 minutes when John McGrath pounced on an error by Galway goalkeeper Colm Callanan and corner-back Adrian Tuohy to flick the ball to the net.
