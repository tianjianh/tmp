Holly was confirmed dead at the scene of the crash which happened in the Castle Vale area of the city at about 09:00 BST.
Another teenage girl was taken to hospital with minor injuries and other pupils were treated at the roadside.
In their tribute, Holly's parents and twin sister Emma said: "You grasped every opportunity that life presented to you, displaying so much passion, enthusiasm and determination in pursuit of your dreams.
"All this without forgetting to care about people, being there for others and having time for those that needed it.
"We will miss you so much but you will always be in our thoughts, hearts and prayers."
Birmingham City Council has confirmed one of its bin lorries was involved in the crash and said it would "be fully co-operating with all investigations".
