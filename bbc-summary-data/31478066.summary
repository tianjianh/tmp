[SN]TITLE[SN]
Surrey County Council given £41m extra for schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An extra £41m has been awarded to Surrey County Council to help with a "significant and unexpected" rise in demand for school places.

The money, spread over the next two years, comes from the Department for Education.
However, the council said there was still a funding gap of £30m a year.
Council leader David Hodge said: "We have pushed long and hard for a fair settlement."
The council expects it will need an additional 13,000 extra school places over the next five years.
Mr Hodge said there was still a "long way to go" to ease the pressure.
"While the additional money acknowledges the huge strain being put on Surrey's schools from ever growing demand for places, it only eases the short-term pressure on our budgets rather than solving the problem of plugging the funding gap," he said.
