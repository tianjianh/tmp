A number of controlled explosions were carried out on a car in Azalea Gardens. A number of items were recovered and taken away for further examination.
Police have said they believe it may be linked to a robbery in Dunmurry.
On 3 April, three men dressed as postmen, and one armed with a suspected gun, robbed offices in The Cutts area. They assaulted two female members of staff and escaped with cash.
The alert began on Friday night. Residents in the area were not moved out, but were advised to stay towards the rear of their homes.
"I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the local community, who have been inconvenienced during the operation, for their patience," Det Insp Stephen Harvey said.
"I would appeal to anyone who has information about the robbery at The Cutts, or who saw any suspicious activity in the Azalea Gardens area, to contact police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1178 of 7/4/17."
