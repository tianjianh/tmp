A Lego exhibition that has opened in Londonderry is proving a hit with both children and adults.

The Brick Wonders exhibition arrived in the city last week from Rome.
Among the models are the seven wonders of the world and other ancient and modern exhibits. Some of them feature as many as 50,000 blocks.
Derry City and Strabane District Council has said the Nerve Centre exhibition is part of the legacy of being the 2013 UK City of Culture.
"People sometimes ask where's the legacy of 2013 - this is one of the legacies of 2013," the council's Brendan McMenamin said.
"As you can see it's incredible detail in terms of what we've titled the Brick Wonders exhibition."
A series of animated workshops is taking place this weekend.
The exhibition is running until May.
