Reading defender Liam Moore believes "trying new things" in training and matches is helping improve his game.

Moore helped Reading to a fifth successive Championship win on Saturday as they edged out Bristol City 2-1.
"To have a manager who wants his defenders to play is only going to improve me as a player," Moore said.
The 23-year-old will miss their next match at Fulham on Saturday through suspension after picking up a fifth booking of the season.
Jaap Stam's possession-based approach to Reading's style of play received a cautious welcome, but has seen the Royals collect maximum points in November.
Moore, who joined the club from Leicester City in August, is thrilled to be given the chance to be a key part.
"We have to have the ball as defenders," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "There's no two ways about it.
"We have to make angles and take brave decisions. The gaffer always wants us to take initiative, so if I can improve that in my game, it will obviously make me a better player."
