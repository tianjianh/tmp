[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan McHugh scored a late goal against his own senior side to give Ulster University Jordanstown victory over a youthful Donegal in the McKenna Cup.

McHugh, son of UU manager Martin, fisted in to give the students a 2-20 to 4-13 opening win in Section C.
In the same section, new Cavan boss Mattie McGleenan saw his side achieve a 1-13 to 0-12 win over Tyrone who have won the cup for five years in a row.
Tyrone's Mattie Donnelly and Niall McDermott of Cavan were sent off.
Cavan's Seanie Johnston also had to leave the action early as he got a black card.
Gerard Smith scored an early goal for Cavan as Tyrone were made to pay for poor finishing.
Connor McAliskey was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury on a disappointing day for the Red Hands, whose hopes of a sixth McKenna Cup title in a row are badly dented.
Smith's goal came in the 19th minute of a match in which the home side were never behind.
Cavan sub Paul O'Connor was on the field a matter a few seconds when he split the Tyrone defence finding Smith in space, and the forward fisted the ball over keeper Niall Morgan's head.

Meanwhile, in a competitive match at Ballybofey Donegal, fielding an entire team of Under-21 players managed by Declan Bonner, seemed to be heading to a narrow win over the UU students.
They scored two goals in each half through Eoghan Ban Gallagher, Micheal Carroll, Brandon McCole and Ethan O'Donnell.
But UU, with a number of Donegal senior players in their ranks including the resourceful forward Patrick McBrearty, kept sending points over to keep the contest alive and set the stage for McHugh's decisive score.
