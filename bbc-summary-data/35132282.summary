[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland have the chance to avenge their last-minute Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat when Australia visit in the autumn Tests in November.

Vern Cotter's men will face the Wallabies for the first time since the 35-34 loss at Twickenham in the first of the traditional three-Test series.
Both that opener on Saturday 12 November and the Test against World Cup semi-finalists Argentina the following Saturday will be at Murrayfield.
Scotland play Georgia one week later.
The venue and kick-off time for that third Test has yet to be confirmed, but what is certain is that it will be the first time Georgia have played a touring Test match in Scotland.
The nations have met only once previously when fly-half Dan Parks scored four penalties and a drop-goal in a 15-6 win for Scotland in the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
The hosts enjoyed a 9-8 win over Australia in Edinburgh in 2009 and ran in four tries last November to beat the Pumas 41-31.
Scottish Rugby chief operating officer Dominic McKay said: "We have had many fantastic matches against Australia and Argentina at BT Murrayfield in the past and we're looking forward to more of the same when they come to Edinburgh next year.
"The Georgians won over thousands of new fans with their performances in the Rugby World Cup, defeating Namibia and Tonga to take them from tournament debutants in 2003 to securing automatic qualification as one of the top 12 teams in RWC 2019.
"I'm sure they'll get a great reception when they come to Scotland for the first time for this historic Test."
