Crawley Town have signed midfielder Conor Henderson on a free transfer following his departure from Hull City.

The 22-year-old began his career at Arsenal but left the Gunners last summer after making only one appearance and subsequently joined Hull.
Henderson also featured just once for the Tigers and had a brief spell on loan at Stevenage in April.
The Republic of Ireland Under-21 international has signed a one-year deal with the West Sussex club.
Henderson becomes Crawley's eighth signing of the summer.
"He was highly regarded at Arsenal but then suffered a bad knee injury which affected his progress," Crawley boss John Gregory told the club website.
"I have spoken to Hull manager Steve Bruce at length about him and he speaks very highly of Conor.
"He is coming down a level to play for us but he sees it as a move which will progress his career in the right direction. He's very skilful, passes it and keeps possession well and is a threat in the box too."
