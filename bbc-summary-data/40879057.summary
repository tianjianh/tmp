The retailer tweeted the display was "horrible" and "truly awful," and said it would investigate how it came to be.
The image has been widely shared on Reddit and Twitter, with many users questioning how it had happened.
In recent years, the US has seen a number of deadly school shootings.
Charles Crowson, a spokesman for Walmart, told the BBC: "What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores.
"We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened."
