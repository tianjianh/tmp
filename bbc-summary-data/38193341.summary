[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hibernian 2-0 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A goal in each half against a struggling Dumbarton side was enough to give Hibernian the victory that keeps them top of the Scottish Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Hanlon swept in a Jason Cummings corner at the end of a poor first half.
Brian Graham doubled the lead with a well taken strike midway through a second half dominated by the home side.
Cummings started his first game since October and he also had the ball in the net, but it was rightly flagged offside.
Hibs manager Neil Lennon was desperate for a positive reaction from his side following the away defeat by chasing Dundee United.
But, despite the score-line, the Edinburgh side struggled to create for long periods of the match.
Dumbarton looked very much like a side who have recorded only three wins all season and they created next to nothing all afternoon.
Hibernian assistant manager Gary Parker: "It was an okay performance, but the result is the most important thing at the end of the day.
"In patches, it was good and, in patches, it was not so good.
"After last week, we know it wasn't good enough and we had to put that to the back of our minds and go on another run.
"We got the result today and we just have to keep winning and winning."
Dumbarton manager Stephen Aitken: "It's never easy coming to places like Easter Road against a team that people see as a Premier League side.
"We had to get over the disappointment of midweek, but I thought the players gave everything they had today and, in the first half, we made it a good contest.
"We are in the mix, so we just have to build on that first-half performance."
