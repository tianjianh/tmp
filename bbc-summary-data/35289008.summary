The Championship's bottom club, facing the threat of a winding-up order, fell behind to a super Joe Partington goal.
Gary Madine levelled before Dean Moxey put the hosts ahead with a strike from the edge of the box.
A composed Kaid Mohamed equalised but the influential Darren Pratley struck from 12 yards to seal a nervy win.
Neil Lennon's beleaguered team will host Championship rivals Leeds United in round four at the end of the month, providing a much-needed financial boost for the debt-ridden club.
Watch highlights of all Tuesday's FA Cup third-round replays.
The financially-troubled Trotters are seven points adrift of safety in the Championship and before the match captain Pratley had described this season as a soap opera.
The club are Â£172.9m in debt, under a transfer embargo for breaching Financial Fair Play rules and their High Court hearing for a winding-up order has been adjourned until next month.
Victory against a team fifth in the National League may not normally be a cause for great celebration for a side in the Championship, but this win was crucial to the confidence of a team which had won just once in their last 22 games.
Bolton were made to battle for their place in the fourth round and, at times, there was a sense that Eastleigh, the only non-league team remaining in the competition, were set to cause a great upset.
The non-leaguers, in the first half especially, were composed and well organised defensively, while Bolton were on edge, though they showed spirit in responding to Partington's burst down the right flank which resulted in a dreamy goal for the full-back.
Madine dragged the hosts back into the match, controlling Josh Vela's cross to finish low beyond Ross Flitney.
But Eastleigh too were resolute in a thrilling first half as Welshman Mohamed scored his first FA Cup goal since November 2012 to negate Bolton's second goal.
After the break, Pratley scored a goal his industry deserved after a neat one-two with substitute Shola Ameobi, who will be available to play in the league on Saturday against MK Dons despite being set to leave because the club cannot offer him a new deal.
Bolton boss Neil Lennon: "It was a hiding to nothing, I'm absolutely delighted. It was never going to be easy.
"I'm pleased, particularly with the second-half display. We could have won by a little more in the end.
"Psychologically it's a confidence booster going forward in the league as well."
Eastleigh manager Chris Todd: "The cup run we've been on has been outstanding and the two performances against a Championship outfit have been incredible.
"The lads showed great commitment and desire. They could have caved in, but that's what my players won't do.
"We were unlucky in the end but Bolton showed their class at times, which we expected."
