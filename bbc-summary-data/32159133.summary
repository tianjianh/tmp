The men aged 32 and 56 were detained on Wednesday following searches at premises in north Belfast and Templepatrick.
The arrests are part of an investigation into the importation and supply of Class A and B drugs into Northern Ireland.
Cash and ammunition was also recovered.
Det Insp Trevor Stevenson, said: "This is a proactive investigation into the importation and supply of Class A and B drugs into Northern Ireland from England and Europe."
"We are delighted to have seized almost £90,000 worth of drugs and taken a significant quantity of firearms and ammunition out of circulation.
"We believe those involved are members of an organised crime group as opposed to having any paramilitary or terrorist links but the threat posed by the drugs and the weapons should not be underestimated.
"Their removal has made our streets safer today. The suspects are being interviewed at a police station in Belfast and our enquiries are continuing," he added.
During the searches, police uncovered:
• Suspected cocaine worth £60,000
• Cannabis worth £20,000
• Cannabis plants worth almost £10,000
• Suspected firearms and ammunition
• A replica firearm and ammunition
• Cash and financial documentation
• Drugs paraphernalia including cutting agent, mixer, moulds, presses and plastic bags
The searches and arrests are not related to the ongoing major international drugs trafficking operation.
