Footage from a police dashboard camera shows Alexander Blood, 21, swerving between lanes of the southbound M6 as officers pursue him.
The 23 May incident lasted 25 minutes before Blood crashed into a central reservation, writing off his partner's car.
He had earlier fled after attacking his partner in the bedroom of a Blackpool hotel.
Blood, of Yardley, Birmingham, admitted assault, drink-driving and aggravated vehicle-taking at Preston Crown Court.
He was jailed for nine months and received a 12-month driving ban, after which he must complete a fresh extended test before he is allowed back on the road.
