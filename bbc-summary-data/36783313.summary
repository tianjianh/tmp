[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Peterborough United have re-signed forward Paul Taylor on a one-year contract after he spent the last year out of the professional game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old, released by Ipswich Town in 2015, has been training with Posh during pre-season.
He scored 14 goals in 53 matches before his Â£1.5m switch to Ipswich, but his most recent first-team match came while on loan at Blackburn in April 2015.
Taylor has signed a deal after fellow forward Lee Angol had leg surgery.
