[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tate Britain will host the largest presentation of British war artist Paul Nash - who played a key role in developing Modernism in English art.
Next summer, the Tate Modern will host the UK's first large-scale show of O'Keeffe's work in more than 20 years.
Tate Liverpool will also show about 35 large-scale works by Francis Bacon.
The exhibition Francis Bacon: Invisible Rooms will be grouped in themes such as portraiture and existentialism, crucifixion, the stage and arena and invisible rooms, which gives the show its title.
O'Keeffe is considered a founding figure of American modernism. She is best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers and New Mexico landscapes.
The Rauschenberg exhibition, meanwhile will be the first posthumous retrospective of the artist since his death in 2008.
It will also be the first exhibition of Rauschenberg in the UK for almost 35 years.
In summer 2016, Tate St Ives will present Sea & Studio, exhibitions which explore the ocean, the landscape and the ceramics studio.
In the winter, British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer's film chronicling Paul Gauguin's voyage to Tahiti will be shown.
It will make up a wide-ranging exhibition of paintings and sculptures by Gauguin himself, as well as earlier depictions of Tahiti by other artists.
