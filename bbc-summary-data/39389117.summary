[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle maintained their lead at the top of the Championship, as Wigan made them battle for a first win in four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dwight Gayle netted his 22nd goal of the season when Mohamed Diame put the ball on a plate for him to finish unmarked at the far post.
But the visitors created a shock early in the second half when Michael Jacobs levelled from Alex Gilbey's ball in.
Matt Ritchie restored the lead for the Magpies when he headed in a rebound off the post from his own half-volley.
Newcastle stay a point ahead of second-placed Brighton, who beat Blackburn at home, but now have a 10-point cushion over third-placed Huddersfield who were beaten at home by relegation-threatened Burton.
Wigan's third straight defeat, in what was interim manager Graham Barrow's first game in charge, sees them slip seven points adrift of safety with seven games remaining.
The Latics caused the leaders problems at St James' Park and could have taken the lead in the second half when centre-back Dan Burn headed over the crossbar when unmarked from a corner.
Second-half substitute Ryan Colclough also went close on a couple of occasions, but Newcastle had enough to close out the game.
Ritchie was denied a second to make sure of the points late on when Matt Gilks saved with his feet in a one-on-one when played in by Christian Atsu.
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez: "I would like to score five goals and be amazing, but at the moment we showed character, good reaction and personality to manage the situation.
"We can improve on a lot of things, but we do a lot of things well. But when you see Huddersfield losing or Brighton winning 1-0 it shows it is not easy.
"We need a little more composure on the ball in the final third and then we will score more than we need. We are so close so we have to do well and not suffer."
Wigan interim manager Graham Barrow: "I'm disappointed with the result. At 1-1 I thought we were in with a chance. They got the rub of the green on the second goal. But if we can play like that we have got a chance (of staying up).
"Newcastle brought players off the bench, had great pace in the side, but at 1-1 I thought we could win it.
"We got in good situations and we have to try to perform like that against Ipswich and Rotherham next Saturday."
