Now the plot, which sees the 16-year-old abused by Nathan, has two nominations at the British Soap Awards.
Lucy Fallon, who plays Bethany Platt, is nominated for best actress, while her unfolding nightmare is in the running to be named best storyline.
The story sees Nathan, played by Christopher Harper, exploit the schoolgirl to have sex with strangers.
After luring her into a relationship and persuading her to move in with him, viewers have seen him tell her she was responsible for the theft of a friend's camera equipment.
He then made her believe the only way to make up for it was for her to sleep with his friend - and the storyline is expected to continue for some time to come.
The depiction has been praised by some charities and campaigners, while other viewers have complained it is too harrowing to be shown before the watershed.
The winners of the British Soap Awards will be announced during a live ceremony broadcast from the Lowry in Salford on Saturday 3 June.
Here is the full list of nominees:
