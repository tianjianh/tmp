[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most people in a survey marking 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement referendum said they believe Northern Ireland is now a better place to live.

The survey, carried out for the Nolan Show by Ipsos Mori, said 71% of the 1008 people surveyed said life was slightly or much better.
Sixty-four percent of those who agreed were Protestant and 77% were Catholic.
However, 32% said the current system of power sharing at Stormont was not working well.
Twice as many Protestants as Catholics held that view.
And more than half of those questioned felt that Stormont politicians were not doing enough to tackle sectarianism - 57% of Protestants and 48% of Catholics felt this.
But the response to a question on whether Northern Ireland is more or less divided than it was 15 years ago got a positive response, with 47% saying that they felt it was less divided.
A total of 1,008 interviews were conducted for the Nolan Show by Ipsos Mori between 30 April and 13 May 2013, with a representative sample of the Northern Ireland population aged 16 and over.
The interviews were held at 50 places across Northern Ireland.
Fifteen years ago on 22 May 1998, voters went to the polls to vote yes or no to the Good Friday Agreement - more than 71% of people in Northern Ireland voted yes.
