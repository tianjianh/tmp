Properties in Nantwich, Crewe, London, Bristol, Stoke and Preston were targeted by more than 100 officers.
Eight women, believed to be originally from Eastern Europe, were found at several of them, Cheshire Police said.
A 49-year-old man from Nantwich and a 37-year-old woman from Crewe were arrested in connection with the investigation.
They are currently being questioned on suspicion of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
The raids involved officers from the Metropolitan Police, Avon and Somerset Police, Staffordshire Police and Lancashire Police, along with the National Crime Agency.
Det Insp David Brown, who has led the operation for Cheshire Police, said the warrants were executed after "months of hard work" and formed part of a larger inquiry.
He said human trafficking and sexual exploitation stemmed from "organised crime" and targeted "some of the most vulnerable people in our society".
Det Insp Brown said the women found at the addresses were being offered support.
