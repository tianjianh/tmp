The Royal Lyceum's version of the Beckett drama featured Scottish actors Brian Cox and Bill Paterson.
It took the Best Production award while the cast, also including John Bett and Benny Young, scooped the Best Ensemble Award.
Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre picked up six awards split between two shows.
Speaking about Waiting for Godot, Cats co-convener Mark Fisher said: "Mark Thomson's lucid, precisely choreographed production got under the skin of a modern classic, ensuring it was not just a star vehicle for two very well-known actors, but a full-blooded ensemble performance.
"It was one of the triumphs of the Royal Lyceum's 50th anniversary season and of the whole Scottish theatre calendar."
At the Citizen's theatre, This Restless House - a reworking of the ancient Greek trilogy The Oresteia - won Zinnie Harris Best New Play, Dominic Hill Best Director and Pauline Knowles Best Female Performance.
The theatre's staging of Alasdair Gray's epic novel Lanark: A Life in Three Acts won Sandy Grierson Best Male Performance as well as taking Best Design and Best Technical Presentation.
The awards were announced at a ceremony at the winning theatre on Sunday, hosted by actress Daniela Nardini and Still Game star Sanjeev Kohli.
Muriel Romanes, who recently stepped down as long-term artistic director of Scottish theatre company Stellar Quines, was awarded the 2016 Cats Whiskers for her vision and determination in Scottish theatre-making.
The Best Music and Sound award went to the National Theatre of Scotland's Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour, an adaptation of Alan Warner's novel Sopranos about a tearaway Argyll Catholic schoolgirl choir, bringing the company's tally of Cats to 30.
Uncanny Valley, an interactive show for 8-12 year-olds with a robot at its heart, won the Best Production for Children and Young People award.
