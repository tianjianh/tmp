Defending Olympic champion Katie Taylor says she has no concerns about the Zika virus which has caused many golfers to withdraw from this year's Games in Rio.

Rory McIlroy and world number one Jason Day are among the top players to pull out over the threat of the mosquito-borne disease.
Irish boxer Taylor said: "it's not even something I'm worried about".
"I'm not thinking about it, I'm focused on the competition itself and trying to come home a two-time Olympic champion."
The Zika virus has been linked to defects in newborn babies but Taylor has been critical of the golfers' withdrawals.
Last week she tweeted "I wonder what excuse they would have made if there was no virus," after Jason Day became the latest to opt out.
At the Team Ireland Olympic kit launch in Dublin on Wednesday, Taylor said: "we have been given a lot of advice on it and it's not really something that we should be too worried about".
Taylor has suffered a couple of surprising defeats this year.
She lost her world lightweight title after a semi-final defeat to Estelle Mossely of France in May, having already lost to Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna at the semi-finals of the European Olympic qualifiers.
However she is confident she can retain her Olympic title won in London four years ago.
"It would mean absolutely everything to me really.
"After I came back from London with a gold medal, my focus straight away was to defend it four years on.
"To stand on top of the podium in front of every other nation would be a privilege and an honour."
