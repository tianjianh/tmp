Singer Barry Manilow has been forced to call off the opening three nights of his Broadway comeback show after coming down with bronchitis.

The 69-year-old had been due to play the first of 25 concerts at New York's St James Theatre on Thursday.
A statement on his website read: "Barry is deeply sorry to disappoint his fans and is doing everything he can to ensure a speedy recovery."
The concerts will be rescheduled for February and March.
The tour - Manilow's first on Broadway for more than two decades - will now have its the first night on Tuesday.
After two preview shows were cancelled earlier this week, Manilow's website posted a statement saying the Grammy-winning performer would be ready for opening night "come hell or high water".
But after the cancellation of this week's concerts were confirmed, it was replaced by the line: "It turns out the only thing worse than hell and high water is bronchitis."
Barry Manilow's worldwide record sales exceed 75 million, thanks in part to such hit records as Copacabana, Mandy and I Write the Songs.
