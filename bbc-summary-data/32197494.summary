England began their West Indies tour by skittling out a St Kitts & Nevis Invitational XI for just 59.

In response, captain Alastair Cook was 95 not out and Jonathan Trott - in his first senior international appearance since leaving the 2013 Ashes tour early - hit 72 as England closed on 181-1.
Ben Stokes claimed three wickets for 10 in the morning session as England dominated the two-day warm-up.
Chris Jordan and Stuart Broad both took two wickets.
And there was a wicket apiece for James Anderson, Adil Rashid and James Tredwell.
The new-look opening partnership of Cook and Trott combined for a stand of 158.
Cook was dropped from the one-day squad on the eve of the World Cup, while Trott has not played for the Three Lions since leaving the tour of Australia almost 18 months ago with a stress-related illness.
"Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left," said Durham all-rounder Stokes.
"To see him go out and score some runs was really good."
Cook, meanwhile, could score a first century in England colours since November 2013 when play resumes on Tuesday.
Stokes said: "He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great."
This is the first of two two-day warm-up games before the first Test against West Indies starts in Antigua on 13 April.
