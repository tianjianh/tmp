The return of Bristol City's top scorer Tammy Abraham after nearly four weeks out with injury will be "like a new signing", says head coach Lee Johnson.

The England Under-21 striker has netted 21 times in all competitions this term but returned to parent club Chelsea in February for treatment on his thigh.
Abraham, 19, resumed training with the Robins on Thursday, ahead of Saturday's game at fellow-strugglers Wigan.
"The players will get a massive boost," Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"He is almost like a new signing. Tammy will be like a jack-in-the-box at the moment, looking forward to getting back.
"With a ball, he hasn't trained for a month. But he is young, athletic, mobile and should be able to deal with it.
"The rest will have done him good in some ways, mentally. He's had a tough season. We'll try to judge it so we use him correctly."
Johnson added that Abraham has a "decent chance" of featuring in the game against the 23rd-placed Latics, who are one point behind 22nd-placed City in the Championship table.
