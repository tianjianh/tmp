The 21-year-old had recently been on trial with the Championship club and played against them for Cheltenham Town in a pre-season friendly on Monday.
The former Austria Under-19 player made one league appearance for Austrian Bundesliga side Ried before joining German champions Bayern in 2014.
"We'll look to get him a loan," head coach Lee Johnson told City's website.
"There's no compensation for actually playing games. I believe he needs to earn his stripes and previously he's been a training goalkeeper really at a top club."
Speaking after Monday's friendly win, Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "He's athletic, he kicks the ball well and it's interesting to take a punt on one like that, because he's got a really good pedigree."
