Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday.
Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.
George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital.
A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: "Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time.
"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary."
The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday.
Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday.
However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility.
When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter.
The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries.
Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia.
Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: "The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight.
"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions.
"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died."
The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the area.
