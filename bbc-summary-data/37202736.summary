[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 1-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Debutant Rhys Oates came off the bench to score Gateshead's winning goal in their National League victory over Sutton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The London club looked most likely to score with centre-back Kevin Amankwaah having the best chances as he head the ball wide in the 19th minute and again two minutes after half-time.
Promoted Sutton should have taken the lead in the 56th minute as Bedsente Gomis found himself alone in front of the hosts' goal but lost control of the ball.
Paul Doswell's men were punished for wasting that opportunity when Hartlepool loanee Oates slotted home five minutes after coming on.
