Channel 4 confirmed to BBC News it was "looking at options" for the show, which would form part of its Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser in October.
According to reports, the problem-solving show would feature celebrity contestants, with former Doctor Who star David Tennant tipped to host.
However Channel 4 said it was "premature" to confirm the details.
The Crystal Maze originally ran from 1990-95 and was first hosted by Rocky Horror Show creator Richard O'Brien and then Ed Tudor-Pole in its last two years.
It saw members of the public tackle a range of physical, mental, skill and mystery timed challenges across four themed zones.
The format was recently revived as an immersive live experience in London thanks to a crowdfunded project.
Organisers for the The Crystal Maze experience told Buzzfeed the new Channel 4 special would be filmed on their premises.
