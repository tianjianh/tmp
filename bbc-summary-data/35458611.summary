Who were the Deepcut four?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Between 1995 and 2002, four young Army recruits died from gunshot wounds in unexplained circumstances at the Deepcut Barracks in Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Army insists the deaths were all suicides, but each of the families disagreed. Now, a long-awaited fresh inquest into the death of one of the young soldiers - Private Cheryl James - is under way.
Speaking ahead of the start of the inquest, her father Des James said he hoped for "justice" for his daughter and the other young soldiers who died at Deepcut.
"Twenty years after we lost Cheryl, and following numerous attempts by successive governments to assign the scandal of Deepcut to history, the answers to our many questions may finally be within reach."
So who were the Deepcut four?
Pte Benton was the first to die. He was found with five gunshot wounds in June 1995 while on guard at a perimeter fence.
A BBC Panorama investigation claimed that one night Mr Benton was attacked by a gang wearing gas masks as he slept.
On another occasion, the programme said, he was thrown through a window after falling out of favour with a sergeant for answering back.
Did he kill himself? The Army said so, and an inquest concurred.
A friend of Pte Benton added to the suggestion.  Trevor Hunter said the recruit had been the target of "vicious verbal attacks and humiliating abuse" which drove him to take his own life.
"He was an easy target because he had a croaky voice, he spoke his mind and his kit was a mess," Mr Hunter said.
But independent ballistics expert Frank Swann, who investigated the deaths initially for the police and later the families, said it was impossible for Pte Benton to have killed himself. He suggested he had been shot four times from a distance and only once from close range.
Pte Benton's mother Linda has called for a new inquest and a public inquiry, saying she did not believe he had committed suicide.
Pte James was found dead with a bullet through her forehead in woodland outside the barracks in November 1995.
The Army said she had killed herself but an inquest recorded an open verdict.
Her parents Doreen and Des believed their daughter suffered sexual harassment and violence at Deepcut - one of Pte James' friends went as far as saying the recruit "had been forced" to have sex with a corporal.
Did she kill herself? Frank Swann said it was "highly unlikely" Pte James shot herself and that "she was probably trying to push the gun barrel away from her face when she was shot, accidentally or deliberately".
Her family said it suspected a cover-up after the bullet, removed during a post-mortem and which would have been a vital piece of evidence, went missing.
Now new evidence has emerged suggesting Pte James "may have been sexually coerced or raped the night before, or before the time of her death".
Her father Des James said hearing the new evidence was "shocking".
"It's the last thing parents want to hear. It's the one thing a father dreads," he said.
"I want justice for all four of them. It goes beyond my daughter and the kids who died at Deepcut.
"This is an issue of recruits being passed weekly into the hands of the Ministry of Defence and their duty of care."
Pte Gray was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on guard duty in 2001
The Army said he killed himself but, once again, an inquest returned an open verdict. Some aspects of his death seem mysterious, including reports that a figure was seen running away from the area and suggestions his body was moved shortly after his death.
Frank Swann said it was "highly unlikely" Pte Gray killed himself.
Pte Gray's parents, Geoff and Diane, believe he loved life in the Army and do not think he committed suicide.
They said: "He had no girl problems, no money worries and, in fact, he could not have been at a better time in his life."
The Grays have consistently pushed for a public inquiry into the Deepcut deaths and also for a new inquest for their son.
Mr Gray said: "There's an awful lot of young soldiers being killed in various circumstances and I believe that an awful lot of those soldiers' deaths have not been investigated correctly.
"I think the Army has had a blas√© attitude towards young soldiers - you're in the Army, you're nothing but a number, but as soon as you're dead that number is scratched out straightaway."
Pte Collinson was found with a single gunshot wound through his chin while on guard duty in 2002.
Once again, the Army said he had killed himself and an inquest returned an open verdict. His parents insist he was a happy, cheerful young man, full of pride at being a soldier and making plans for his future, and had no reason to take his life.
Frank Swann said it was "unlikely" bullet wounds to the underside of Pte Collinson's chin and head were self-inflicted, but it was possible they were the result of an accident.
Pte Collinson's mother, Yvonne Heath, said: "I don't believe that my son pulled that trigger but at the same point I don't believe anyone wished him dead. I think in the regime at Deepcut at the time there was very little supervision. I think some silly prank went terribly wrong."
More than 100 witnesses are expected to give evidence during the new inquest.
The family have requested the scope of the hearing be widened to take account of new evidence which they believe sheds fresh light on Pte James's state of mind.
Coroner Brian Barker QC will consider whether a third party was involved in her death and what happened on the evening before she died.
He will also address whether there were "shortcomings" with barracks policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.
The inquest is due to take place at Woking Coroner's Court in Surrey and is expected to last seven weeks.
