They include Jaguar Land Rover and Veolia Environmental Services UK, as well as smaller businesses, including All3Media, which makes programmes including Horrible Histories, and children's clothing company, Frugi.
Other companies have been granted awards for sustainable development and innovation.
The awards are designed to reward growth and enterprise.
A survey of Queen's Awards winners found 76% said the win had brought added commercial value to their business.
The winning businesses come from a range of sectors including fashion, food and drink, media, IT and construction, and range from enterprising small businesses, with just a handful of employees, to companies employing thousands.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "Companies that are growing, innovating and championing UK business overseas deserve the recognition that these awards bestow."
This year 162 businesses have been recognised, with 110 winning awards for international trade; 39 for innovation and 13 for sustainable development.
Eight individuals won the Queen's Award for enterprise promotion, nominated by their peers for their efforts to encourage UK entrepreneurship.
Their nominations show that, in addition to being full-time entrepreneurs, they have voluntarily passed their skills and experience on to others, involving themselves in education and providing help and support to develop people's business skills.
Winners are presented with a crystal bowl and are invited to a reception at Buckingham Palace.
They can use the Queen's Award emblem in advertising, marketing and on packaging for a period of five years, as a symbol of their quality and success.
