Hardaker scored 67 tries in 155 games for Leeds, before joining NRL side Penrith Panthers on loan in June.
The 25-year-old, who was named Man of Steel in 2015, moved to Australia after struggling with personal problems.
"I'm in a really good place, so that's why I can't wait to get started," he told BBC Look North.
"Me and my partner at the time we were supposed to have a baby and the crux of it is we didn't, so I took it a bit the wrong way and it was a bit of an upsetting time.
"I pretty much locked myself away and went a few weeks without seeing anybody. It took me a few months before I realised I could talk about it."
Leeds will not be able to recall Hardaker for the duration of the loan move, while a transfer fee has already been agreed between the two clubs.
"There is no doubt he is an outstanding rugby league player," Tigers head coach Daryl Powell said.
"His flexibility in playing a number of positions in the backline will clearly enhance what is already a very talented squad and add quality competition."
