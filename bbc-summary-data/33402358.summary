It comes after a public appeal to find a donor for the BBC journalist, who has acute myeloid leukaemia and is dependant on a transplant to survive.
She posted on Twitter to say the donor was a "good match" and she would return to hospital in two weeks to undergo the transplant procedure.
"Thanks so much to all donors and all tweeted good wishes," she wrote.
Ms Lloyd-Roberts, who has also worked for ITN, has reported on events in Syria, Burma and North Korea among many others, and has campaigned for human rights.
The BBC held an open day last month for anyone aged 16-30 to join the register of the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan Trust.
Since being diagnosed more than four months ago, Ms Lloyd-Roberts has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy at University College Hospital in London, and is now in remission.
She had expected a stem-cell transplant to take place in May, but the would-be donor failed medical tests and the operation was cancelled.
The Anthony Nolan Trust says that only one in about 1,200 people on the register ends up donating in any given year because matches are rare.
