Police say Ellie Underhill was on the bonnet of a silver Vauxhall Corsa being driven in a Dudley car park, before she fell and suffered a head injury.
The 20-year-old was taken to Russells Hall Hospital where she died from her injuries on 3 January.
West Midlands Police said three teenagers have been arrested and bailed in connection with the incident.

Police said Miss Underhill, from Quarry Bank, Dudley, was on the bonnet of the car moments before she fell at the Tesco Extra car park at Burnt Tree, Dudley, at about 22:30 GMT.
In a statement, her family described her as a "bubbly, lively girl" who "truly lived life to the fullest".
"As a family we are totally devastated and really need to find out the truth of what happened that night."
A man and woman, both 18, and 19-year-old man, all from Stourbridge, were arrested on 5 January on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
They have been bailed until 29 March while inquiries continue.
Officers are appealing for information and would like to speak to people who were in the car park at the time.
Police said they particularly want to hear from the occupants of a dark blue three-door VW Golf, which was in the car park playing loud music, and those of a small red Peugeot with a spoiler on the rear and red tinsel attached.
