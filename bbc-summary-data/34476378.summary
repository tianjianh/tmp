You can now create a My Sport page on any device - this page becomes your one-stop shop with news, live coverage and stats tailored to your interests.
My Sport is available now for users in the UK, and will be available soon for international users of BBC Sport online.
The key benefits of My Sport are:
As an example, choosing from more than 300 available topics, you might opt to follow Swansea City, Premier League football, the Wales national team, Scarlets rugby union team, cycling and Get Inspired articles.
By adding these topics to a My Sport page, all the latest news, live coverage and reports for these sports and teams would be available in one place, as will football scores. This builds on the existing push alerts offering, with alerts available for football, cricket, rugby union and league and formula 1.
In the near future we will be offering even more topics to pick from, and easier ways to follow your My Sport topics from the new Sport homepage.
We have a blog post which outlines more information about My Sport.
What is My Sport?
My Sport is a new page in BBC Sport where you can easily keep up to date with the latest news and scores for the sports and teams you love.  It will let you follow more than 300 sport topics, including competitions, and teams.  You can add as many as you like to create your own My Sport page.  We'll be looking to add more features in future too.
What happens when I add topics?
When you add a topic, it will be added to your own My Sport page, where you can read the latest stories and scores just from your topics.  It will also show you the latest fixtures and results for any football team you follow.  You can even reorder topics, to see your favourite stories at the top of My Sport.
Why do I need to sign in?
Sign in to get the most out of BBC Sport. It's quick, free and easy to create a BBC iD account. By signing in, your preferences & My Sport page will be available across devices running the app.  This means you can keep up to date with the topics you love on a phone or a tablet and, in the near future, on a computer too.

What happens to my quick links?

When you sign into the app, your quick links will be used to create a personal My Sport page with stories and results that most interest you.
