[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years after being convicted of "a horrendous catalogue" of abuse against a woman for more than a decade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Pepper, 67, from Glasgow, raped the woman on various occasions between 1986 and 2001.
He also hit her with a baseball bat and bottle, cut off her clothes, struck her with a knife, kicked her on the body and caused her to fall downstairs.
Pepper was also placed on the sex offenders register.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Johanna Johnston QC told Pepper: "Your actions blighted this woman's life. You now accept your guilty, albeit at a late stage.
"However, this woman had to come to court and give evidence of a very private nature.
"This was a horrendous catalogue of offending."
