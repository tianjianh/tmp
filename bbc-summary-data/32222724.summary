[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controversial plan to revamp two buildings in an area of Bristol regarded as the "spiritual home" of the street artist Banksy has been deferred.

The plans involve Westmoreland House office block being knocked down and the adjoining Carriageworks renovated to create 118 home in Stokes Croft.
Protests were held as councillors from Bristol City Council met at City Hall on Wednesday evening.
Eight councillors voted to defer a decision with one abstaining.
Although Banksy's artwork is not on either building, his famed mural The Mild Mild West is also in Stokes Croft, which is known for its street art and independent businesses.
Lori Streich from the Carriageworks Action Group said: "In the circumstances, having listened to the entire debate, we feel it's a win-win situation for the community and the developer as we all now have the opportunity to look at it all again.
"It will bring the community vision into reality, or closer anyway. I'm still optimistic."
She said councillors had raised concerns about a number of issues such as the delivery of the community vision and the lack of consultation with the local community.
Developer Fifth Capital has said between Â£15m and Â£20m would be needed for the revamp.
