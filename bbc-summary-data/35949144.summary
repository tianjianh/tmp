On-loan Bournemouth keeper Ryan Allsop kept Wycombe in the game with a string of fine saves.
And they Chairboys levelled when midfielder Matt Bloomfield fired in from 10 yards to earn his side a point.

"Like last weekend it should be three points. We should have put the game to bed on a couple of occasions.
"We had some good opportunities to be clinical and finish the game and get the second goal.
"We deserved to win again today. The football we're playing, it's there for everyone to see the difference in the players and how they're responding well."
