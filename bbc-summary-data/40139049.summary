Chancellor Philip Hammond has dismissed claims in the press he will be replaced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd if the Conservatives win the general election.

Theresa May refused to rule out sacking Mr Hammond last month, amid reports of rows between him and her advisers.
Mr Hammond told BBC News he would not speculate about what might happen after the election.
Ms Rudd won plaudits from Conservatives for her performance in a TV debate, when she defended Mrs May's absence.
The Telegraph claimed minsters were tipping her for a promotion to chancellor if the Conservatives won a "landslide" victory on Thursday.
Asked about the reports, Mr Hammond said: "I'm not going to comment on what happens on 9 June. We're focusing on 8 June.
I'm not going to speculate on anything beyond the general election - I'm not going to comment on what the PM does on 9 June."
Asked if he'd like to keep his job, he says: "Of course I would, that's a silly question. We have a very big challenge ahead of us and I believe I can play a part in that, as all of my colleagues can.
"Brexit is a critical issue underlining this election, getting it right is essential.
"Voters have a big choice next week. All campaigns are wide ranging, there is often a focus on one issue but people want to speak about many issues."
On the BBC TV debate earlier this week, he said Amber Rudd "did very well" and the prime minister, who declined to take part, had "always said she is more interested in speaking to real voters".
