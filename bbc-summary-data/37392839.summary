[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 4-0 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton got back to winning ways with a 4-0 demolition of 10-man Southend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two goals after the restart from John-Joe O'Toole and Alex Revell, from the penalty spot after Jason Demetriou was sent off, put Cobblers in control before Matt Taylor and Paul Anderson wrapped it up.
Sam Hoskins tested Southend goalkeeper Mark Oxley who then struggled to keep out Taylor's low drive.
Gabriel Zakuani's block prevented Stephen McLaughlin from giving the visitors the lead before Jermaine McGlashan fired at Adam Smith.
Those chances apart, both teams struggled in the final third but it took the Cobblers just two minutes after the restart to break the deadlock. Oxley failed to hold on to Jak McCourt's low drive and O'Toole swept home the loose ball.
Four minutes later Southend were two goals and a player down after Demetriou pulled back Anderson in the box and got a straight red card. Revell sent Oxley the wrong way from the ensuing spot-kick.
Taylor curled in a superb 30-yard free-kick on the hour mark and Anderson grabbed a fourth goal in the 78th minute, firing past Oxley after being set up by substitute Harry Beautyman.
