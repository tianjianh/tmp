RNLI 'tombstoning' warning after Porthcawl injuries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RNLI has warned people of the dangers of jumping into water from height - or "tombstoning" - after a man seriously injured his leg at Porthcawl Harbour, Bridgend county, on Monday.

Lifeboat volunteers said the man, in his 30s, jumped from about 6ft (1.8m) into murky water he thought was deeper, but hit the rocks below.
He broke his ankle and sustained cuts, but managed to swim to safety.
The RNLI administered oxygen until paramedics arrived.
Phil Missen of Porthcawl RNLI said: "This incident reminds us how dangerous jumping into water from height - or tombstoning - can be.
"Water changes depth with the tide, so the water may be shallower than it looks. Submerged items may not be visible and can cause serious injury or paralysis if you hit them.
"The water can be a lot colder than it looks so the shock of cold water may also make it difficult to swim and strong currents can sweep you away."
