Thomas Putt, 20, and Nikki Willis, 23, were discovered in Fox Crescent, Chelmsford, on Monday morning. They were pronounced dead at the scene.
Post-mortem tests have proved inconclusive.
Essex Police warned anyone who modifies a car to get it checked out by a qualified mechanic.
Police said they were not treating the deaths of engineering apprentice Mr Putt, of Wren Close, Leigh-on-Sea, and shop worker Ms Willis, of Fox Crescent, Chelmsford, as suspicious.
A police spokesman said: "Current investigations do not indicate their deaths were the result of a deliberate act.
"One of the lines of inquiry police are investigating is the possibility they may have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.
"Tests will be carried out on the vehicle, which will include establishing whether any modifications have taken place."
Ms Willis's family paid tribute to a woman who "loved life and always had a smile".
"You will never be forgotten, always and forever in our hearts and memories. Our angel now has her wings.," said the statement.
Mr Putt's family said: "We are utterly shocked and devastated at the death of our darling son Tom. He was a whirlwind in our lives from day one, always cheeky, always smiling."
