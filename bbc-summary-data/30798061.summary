An orthodox Jewish newspaper has digitally removed German chancellor Angela Merkel and other women from a photo it printed of the Unity March in Paris on Sunday.

The original picture shows both male and female world leaders.
Some of them linking arms, ready to march at the rally, which was attended by millions after the terror attacks.
But their version printed in Israeli paper HaMevaser has no women in the line-up despite them being there.
HaMevaser abides by the rules of Haredi Judaism, an ultra-Orthodox sect which is defined by its modesty and rejection of modern culture.
It's known for its distinctive clothing of black hats, sidelocks for men and long skirts and sleeves for women.
While traditional Jewish rules respect gender separation in certain situations, Haredi Jewish rules are much stricter and the divide spills over into public places.
There are even bus routes in some areas of New York which separate men and women by a curtain.
Photos of women and girls generally don't appear in the Haredi press as it is viewed as a violation of female modesty.
It's not the first time a Haredi paper has doctored photos for publication.
In 2009 two Israeli papers removed two female ministers from a photo of Israel's new cabinet.
One of the publications blacked them out, the other replaced them with pictures of men.
