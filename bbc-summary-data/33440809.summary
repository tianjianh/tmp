Staff at Claythorpe Watermill, near Alford, Lincolnshire, said Stan the cockerel had a reputation for chasing toddlers and pecking ankles.
They said with the busy summer season approaching it might be better if Stan found somewhere else to live.
Owner Rebecca Agate said she wanted people to enjoy a trouble-free visit to the watermill.
She said: "We get a lot of small children visiting the park and if he is chasing you, or pecking, he can be a bit intimidating.
"So, rather than people going away remembering their visit for the wrong reasons, we thought someone might be able to offer him a nice home."
She said Stan, who is thought to be at least part Dutch bantam, has "lots of personality and likes being around people".
However, she added: "He has a bit of a grumpy side as well."
There have been numerous other cases of birds attacking either people, animals, or other objects.
Last year in Cambridgeshire, a "terrorist" pheasant attacked vehicles and chased cats and dogs at a farm in Hail Weston.
One delivery driver was trapped for 20 minutes after the bird blocked his way, flew at the bonnet then chased his van.
Another pheasant, named Phil, started attacking members of a Shropshire family, forcing one of them to carry a badminton racket for self-defence.
Claythorpe Watermill and Wildfowl Gardens is home to numerous animals, including waterfowl, wallabies, chipmunks and peacocks, as well as a family of otters.
