A private funeral service was held in Gorleston, Norfolk, on Wednesday for the 24-year-old, whose real name was Chris Hardman.
Friends and family then gathered at Claremont Pier in the singer's hometown of Lowestoft to release the balloons - chosen to match his favourite colour.
His friend George Goddard, 23, said it was "what Chris would have wanted".
Hardman, who rose to fame in Channel 4's Rock School, was found dead last month at a house in Lowestoft.
Mr Goddard, who met Hardman in 2006 at Kirkley High School, said the short funeral service for close friends and family had contained speeches but no hymns.
"If we'd had hymns he would have laughed and said 'why are you dragging it out?'" Mr Goddard said. "The celebration of life afterwards would have been more his thing."
After the funeral, a larger group gathered at Lowestoft's Zoo bar to toast Hardman with a round of his favourite drink, whisky and Coke.
The party, which included McBusted's James Bourne, then released balloons into the mist off the pier.
"It was a sad day for everyone," Mr Goddard said. "There wasn't a dry eye in the house."
"Chris' priority was always family and friends, so for him to know people were talking and getting to know each other, that would have been more important to him," Mr Goddard said.
He said he would remember his friend, who had been battling with depression, from his time as Lil' Chris.
"Every time I think of Chris now I think of a 16-year-old cheeky little kid running around causing mayhem, making 20,000 Girl Guides scream at Wembley," he said.
"They're the memories he'd want us to remember - that was the favourite part of his life, when he was happiest."
