Ospreys fly-half Dan Biggar is having concussion tests after initially passing a pitch-side examination during the 20-18 Pro12 defeat by Leinster.

Biggar missed a last-minute penalty after a head injury assessment.
In a post-match interview on Saturday, Biggar said: "I can't really remember much of the last 10 minutes, to be honest. I was a little bit dazed."
Ospreys say the Wales international, 27, must pass return-to-play protocols before playing again.
He was absent for nine minutes after leaving the field in the 59th minute following a clash of heads.
In a statement on Sunday, Ospreys said their medical staff were "satisfied" Biggar was fit to return.
"Having resumed playing, Dan reported no further symptoms and his actions caused no undue concern for the medical team at that time," the club said.
"Dan will continue to be monitored as part of the HIA (head injury assessment) protocol in case of any delayed reaction.
"The medical welfare and wellbeing of players is the utmost priority of everybody involved at the Ospreys at all times."
In a post-match interview, Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy said Biggar was the right person to take the potentially match-winning kick from 40 metres out.
"I'm sure if Biggs didn't really feel like it at the time he'd have given the ball to Sam Davies," said Tandy.
"Dan has gone through the HIA, he's passed all the tests and we wouldn't be putting someone back on we didn't feel was right and ready to partake on the field.
"There's definitely no finger pointing. You can go across the board and go back to the last final we won and Biggs' kick from the sideline won the match."
Biggar returned to the field with his head bandaged and moved to centre, with Sam Davies having moved from full-back to the number 10 shirt.
The kick came in overtime following Leinster replacement Ross Byrne's 80th-minute drop-goal that edged the visitors ahead after they had trailed 18-17 from the 63rd minute.
The result means Ospreys have lost their last three matches, including defeats against Treviso in the Pro12 and Stade Francais in the European Challenge Cup, but remain third in the Pro12 table.
However their buffer over fifth place was cut to two points after Scarlets rose to fourth by beating Treviso with a bonus point later in the day.
Tandy says the side have to beat Cardiff Blues at the Principality Stadium on 15 April's Welsh Judgement Day to maintain their place in the play-off places.
"It's a massive game for us," he said.
"The Blues are playing pretty well, but ultimately we know we need to win that game to stay in control of our own destiny going into the last two games."
After that match Ospreys face their two play-off rivals - Ulster at home on 29 April and Scarlets away on 6 May.
