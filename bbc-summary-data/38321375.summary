An airport spokesman said: "As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we reacted quickly by aiding the passengers in re-booking flights and offering an overnight stay in a premium hotel on site," an airport spokesman said.
"We are working with the handling agent to ensure that this does not happen again in the future."
Mr Costello returned to his home in Ireland on Wednesday, but was tired and and cross after his ordeal, she said.
Ms Costello said her father had run out of high blood pressure medication during the delay.
"My dad had a stroke four years ago and mobilises in a wheelchair so we always book full assistance when he flies over to us," Ms Costello, from Nottingham, said.
Despite the offer of a hotel, Ms Costello's father, who is from County Mayo, wanted to return to her home.
She criticised an overall lack of communication.
"They no longer put calls out for passengers in the airport, I have heard nothing from the airport since it happened," she said.
"They put him in a taxi and he arrived at my home but no-one told us he was coming. Luckily my husband was at home at the time."
