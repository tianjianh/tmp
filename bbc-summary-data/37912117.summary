NI greenways plan 'needs major investment'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A charity that campaigns to get people out of their cars has welcomed proposals for 1,000 km (620 miles) of greenways, but says major investment is needed to make them a reality.

Sustrans says the network of walking and cycling routes could have huge benefits.
It adds it will take "long-term capital investment" by the Stormont Executive.
Sustrans was responding to the launch of a strategic plan for a path network in Northern Ireland.
Infrastructure minister Chris Hazzard is making £160,000 available to councils which want to work up detailed proposals.
The greenways would see the development of abandoned railway routes, canal towpaths and flood embankments.
They include some with a cross-border element.
Mr Hazzard said: "While the overall target is ambitious and long term, this is a starting point on which to build a lasting legacy for future generations."
Ten of the 11 councils have been approved for grants worth between £8,000 and £32,000 to run feasibility studies on their plans.
