Unite union signals ballot of North Sea contractors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Unite union plans to ballot offshore contractors on industrial action as part of an ongoing dispute over changes to working conditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said talks over pay and rota changes with the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) had broken down.
Unite is now preparing an industrial action ballot for members working within the OCA.
The OCA has previously said that shift rotation changes would cut costs and were not new to the North Sea.
