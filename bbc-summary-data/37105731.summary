Call for unity over Kinloss barracks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The convener of Moray Council has called for party politics to be put aside over the potential closure of the Kinloss army barracks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moray MP Angus Robertson this week said he had been told by an "impeccable source" at the Ministry of Defence that the former air station could close.
SNP colleagues are calling for the council to establish a task force to campaign to protect it.
Convener Allan Wright said the community needed to work as one.
He told BBC Scotland: "We really do need to work together and put petty party political lines to one side."
The MoD is carrying out a review of its property portfolio, with land that is no longer needed being sold off and the money raised being invested in the armed forces.
Kinloss is not among the sites named in the review, and the MoD said no decisions have been made about future ones.
Mr Robertson said the closure of Kinloss Barracks would be "a betrayal" of promises made to people in Moray following the decision to end the site's life as an RAF station.
RAF Kinloss was home to Nimrod surveillance aircraft before all of those stationed there were retired in 2010 and new planes were scrapped.
The site closed as an air station in 2012 and the Army now occupies it, with RAF personnel and jet aircraft continuing to operate from nearby RAF Lossiemouth.
