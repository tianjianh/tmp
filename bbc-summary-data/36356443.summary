Bristol Metrobus road closure plan 'needs more work'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planned one-way system on a busy commuter route in Bristol has been postponed indefinitely by the council.

The move was planned as part of Bristol's Metrobus scheme but Bristol City Council has halted the work so more traffic assessments can be done.
Cabinet member Mark Bradshaw ruled out a deadline, saying the delay was "for as long as it takes" to complete the research.
The plan involved making Stoke Lane one-way southbound.
Mr Bradshaw added: "I don't want to add to the uncertainty, I don't want to increase the cost and I don't want to increase the disruption for those who are going to be affected but we have to get this right to do this further piece of work.
"That's why I and my colleagues agree that it was the right thing to do to put a halt to this."
The closure was delayed for the first time in April.
Campaigner, Amanda Vinall, said: "We're absolutely thrilled to bits that someone is finally listening to us."
The road carries traffic to and from the Frenchay area over the M32. It had been expected that the change would have lasted a year.
Residents and staff at the nearby University of the West of England (UWE) had opposed the one-way system, claiming other commuter routes were already congested.
Metrobus bosses say the building work would take nine months longer using temporary traffic lights rather than a one-way system.
But Ms Vinall, who's a member of Stoke Lane Action group said any road closure along this route would be unworkable.
She added: "We will not be happy until we have just traffic lights - it would be bearable. The complete one-way system would be unbearable."
