[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted stabbing a fellow party-goer nine times after taking offence over a comment made about him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee McIntosh, 20, attacked Kenny Drew outside a flat in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, in September last year.
He followed Mr Drew outside after the victim made a remark about McIntosh walking about with paper over his face.
McIntosh admitted assaulting Mr Drew to the danger of his life. At the High Court in Glasgow, he was remanded in custody after sentence was deferred.
The court heard how McIntosh had been invited to the party and was initially well behaved.
Mr Drew also turned up having earlier been at a nightclub.
McIntosh was later seen messing about with paper covering his face.
Mr Drew - who did not know McIntosh - made a remark, which he appeared to take exception to.
McIntosh later had another go at Mr Drew, which resulted in him deciding to leave the party.
McIntosh followed a "scared" Mr Drew out and repeatedly stabbed him. As the victim slumped to the ground, McIntosh yelled to others: "I've not got the knife - I don't want to go to jail."
The attacker fled, but was later traced by police.
The court heard Mr Drew is scarred for life as a result of the attack. He continues to suffer from depression and now finds every day tasks difficult.
