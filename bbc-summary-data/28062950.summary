The 24-year-old will sign a three-year deal at Carrow Road with the option of a further 12 months.
He had completed his Carrow Road medical earlier in the week, as reported by BBC Radio Norfolk.
Lafferty scored 11 times last season for the Serie B champions and had a spell at Swiss club Sion in 2012.
He started his career at Burnley, where he netted 10 goals in 83 league games, before a Â£3m move to Rangers in 2008.
The Enniskillen-born forward was on target nine times in 37 appearances for Northern Ireland and played 137 times during four years at Rangers, scoring 38 goals.
"Norwich is a team that wants to get promoted back to the Premier League at the first opportunity, so I'm excited to come here and start playing football for a team like this," he told the club website.
"I've played in the Championship before and I've played against Norwich, and the things I noticed about the club were the fans and the football they played.
"Speaking to the gaffer, everything he said and everything he wants me to do, it's good to have someone like that believing in me. I can't wait to get started."
Lafferty becomes Norwich boss Neil Adams's second signing since suffering relegation from the Premier League last season, with striker Lewis Grabban having joined from Bournemouth.
