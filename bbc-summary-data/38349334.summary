Sinead Higgins, 37, and her seven-year-old son Oisin were found inside the property in The Fairway, Ruislip, on Wednesday.
Formal identification is yet to take place.
Officers have said nobody else is being sought in connection with the deaths at this stage.
A Metropolitan Police statement said the causes of deaths remained inconclusive after post-mortem tests, but stated: "Detectives are satisfied that the deaths are consistent with a murder and a suicide."
The force is awaiting further toxicology tests.
Officers responded to concerns for the pair's welfare at about 10:50 GMT and forced their way into the house.
Police said next-of-kin had been informed.
