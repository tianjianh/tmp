[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

The fighting has spread to 21 out of 22 of the country's provinces and shows no sign of ending. Almost 1.5 million people have been displaced.
The destruction of infrastructure and a naval blockade by a Saudi-led coalition carrying out air strikes against the rebels have led to 21 million people - 80% of the population - being deprived of life-sustaining commodities and services.
The BBC spoke to a resident in Yemen each day, between Monday and Friday, to find out what is life like under the current circumstances.
Ahmad Murgim lives in the capital, Sanaa. He has witnessed air strikes almost every day. "It's our normality," he says.
Abu Al Anwar Salim Ajjar lives in the northern city of Hajjah and says a friend's wife who had cancer died because of a shortage of medicine.
Badri Al Hasani lives in the Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. He says people are luck to get an hour of electricity each day. "Darkness. That's what I feel," he adds.
Sami Al Jabri is a resident of Dhamar, in the south. He complains that there is chronic lack of food. "Sometimes we just pick things from the trees to eat," he says.
Ali Ahmad lives in Taiz, a southern city that has seen fierce fighting in recent weeks. "For us, the future is lost. There is no hope," he says.
