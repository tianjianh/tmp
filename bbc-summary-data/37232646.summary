Norfolk headless body inquiry: Dundee women ruled out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police trying to identify a headless murder victim more than 40 years on have ruled out two women from their inquiry.

The corpse was found in August 1974 at Cockley Cley, near Swaffham, Norfolk.
In May, Norfolk Police said they had new lines of inquiry but the force said the investigation had now been put on hold due to "demand from live cases".
Two women from Dundee have been eliminated from the investigation.
The murdered woman was found wearing a pink nightdress and was bound in a plastic sheet, tied with rope from Dundee.
In January, Det Ch Insp Andy Guy, from Norfolk and Suffolk's major investigation team, said police had the victim's full DNA profile.
He said more than 500 missing women cases had been looked at to eliminate possible matches.
A second post-mortem examination on the remains was carried out using modern techniques and police said the victim had probably given birth before her death.
Original tests, made the day after the body was found on a heath, put the victim's age between 23 and 35.
One line of inquiry was that she could have been an escort known as The Duchess, who had worked in Great Yarmouth before vanishing.
The unusual four-strand rope found with the body, believed to have been used in agriculture, was tracked to Dundee but the manufacturers have all since closed.
Current cases for Norfolk Police, which have led them to rest the inquiry, include the attempted abduction at knifepoint of an RAF Marham serviceman.
