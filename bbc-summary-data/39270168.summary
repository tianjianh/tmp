Arnor Gudjohnsen: Swansea City sign Eidur Gudjohnsen's half-brother

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City have signed Arnor Gudjohnsen, the 16-year-old half-brother of former Chelsea and Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gudjohnsen was on trial with the Premier League club earlier this year.
The midfielder has returned to his Icelandic club Breidablik and will officially join Swansea in July.
He will link up with one of Iceland's highest-profile players, Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has played a starring role for the Swans this season.
Sigurdsson helped Iceland defy the odds by reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2016.
Gudjohnsen's older half-brother, Champions League and Premier League winner Eidur, was also in the squad in France.
Now 38 years old, the former Bolton and Tottenham forward made his debut for Iceland as a 17-year-old when he came on as a substitute for his father, also named Arnor Gudjohnsen.
