Sharon McMurray, from Towcester, sent the messages during eight hours when she thought husband Tony, 46, had died.
Mr McMurray, who was at Everest base camp hours before it was devastated by a landslide, said the experience would "live with me for the rest of my life".
More than 6,000 people are now known to have died in the disaster.
Mr McMurray, who was trekking in the Himalayas to raise money for the Alzheimer's Society, said he was a few hours into his return journey when "one almighty shake hit the mountain".
"There was a loud bomb like a multi-nuclear bomb going off," he said.
"The very place our tents had been two hours earlier was no longer there."
He said he and fellow travellers had slept with their sleeping bags undone and trainers on "ready to run" for the next four days as aftershocks hit the area.
One of them brought down the side of a monastery.
"There were screams, there was crying, there was grief," said Mr McMurray.
He said he hugged locals whose family members had died.
When he finally got to safety he was able to open up text messages and "emails from every corner of the globe," including from wife Sharon.
"Some of the messages Sharon sent, I will probably have a good cry over," he said.
"Basically it was her saying goodbye to me."
Mr Murray said the first thing he would do when he got home was give Sharon a hug and "have a mug of English tea".
