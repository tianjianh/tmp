The clock is ticking down on the deadline for registering to vote in the 2017 general election.

Eligible voters have until 23:59 BST to register online through the official website.
More than two million people have joined the register in the month since Theresa May revealed there would be a snap election on 8 June.
The highest number of applications so far was on 18 April, the day the prime minister made her announcement.
The latest official figures published in March show that 45.7 million people were registered to vote in a general election as of 1 December 2016.
Five reasons you should register
General election: What you need to know
Who is registering to vote?
If more young people actually voted, would it change everything?
The Electoral Commission has warned that about seven million people across Britain who are eligible to vote are not registered.
This includes 30% of under 34s while only 28% of home movers in the past year have registered.
Anyone wanting to vote on 8 June who is not already on the electoral register needs to sign up or they will miss out.
There is expected to be a spike of applications in the run-up to the cut off time.
Both Instagram and Snapchat will be carrying prominent reminders of the deadline on Monday in order to encourage their users to sign up.
