Former Swansea City midfielder Lee Lucas has signed for Motherwell for the second time this season.

The 24-year-old signed a short-term deal in July following his release by the Premier League club.
That was cut short by a hamstring injury sustained on his debut, but he has now signed again until January.
Manager Mark McGhee told the club website: "We look forward to continuing to work with Lee for the duration of his contract and hopefully beyond."
Lucas' career has been hampered by injuries since he made his solitary Swansea appearance as a substitute in 2011.
Before joining Well, the Welshman had played only three other senior games, one during a loan spell at Burton Albion in 2012 and two on loan at Cheltenham in 2014.
But McGhee was impressed by the midfielder on trial - and in a Well debut cut short by injury in July during a 3-1 League Cup win over Annan Athletic.
"He'll be a valuable addition to our squad," said McGhee.
"As we've seen in recent weeks, injuries can hit at any point and Lee adds depth to the squad as well as bringing real ability and a great option.
"He is a technical midfielder, a good passer - a little different to what we have."
Lucas said: "Now that the contract is all sorted and done, I can just focus on my football and enjoy my time here even more."
