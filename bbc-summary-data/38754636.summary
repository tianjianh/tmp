A police force criticised over the death of a 13-month-old girl needs "immediate" improvement in order to protect children, a watchdog has said.

A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) listed a catalogue of poor practice by Cumbria Police.
The force was criticised for failing to properly investigate the death of Poppi Worthington in 2012.
It said improvements had been made since the inspection in July.
The 41-page HMIC report said some serious cases were given to non-specialist teams who lacked necessary skills and the force had not done enough to train officers in child sexual exploitation.
The inspection was prompted by Cumbria's former police and crime commissioner Richard Rhodes, who urged HMIC to look into how the force responded to unexplained deaths of children.
A number of case studies in the report identified "shocking" cases where procedures were not followed, leads not pursued and children's safety has potentially been put at risk.
They include the mother of a 14-year-old girl disclosing that her daughter had been in a sexual relationship with a number of men, including a 19-year-old registered sex offender.
The suspect was arrested and the matter investigated, but inspectors found no evidence of a longer-term safeguarding plan to protect the girl from further exploitation.
In another case an eight-year-old girl alleged she had been sexually assaulted by her mother's partner.
But the suspect was not arrested for three weeks following the initial report and the suspect was not considered as a possible serial offender for six months, despite being known to have access to and explicit pictures of other children.
Barrow MP John Woodcock said Cumbria Police needed "rapid improvement" to ensure the "horrific abuse" of youngsters was identified and those responsible punished.
He said: "Parents across the county will be alarmed by the report's chilling examples of child sex victims who were not given proper protection from Cumbria police.
"Similarly disturbing are the instances where there is no record of suspects of serious sexual offences being properly investigated.
"The report did contain some examples of good practice and it is encouraging that inspectors concluded Cumbria's police officers are clearly committed to protecting children and determined to turn the situation around."
A force spokesman said since the inspection 600 frontline staff had received training in how to spot child sexual exploitation.
He added: "Much of what HMIC found in their visit in July has already been addressed and significant improvements made.
"During the first two or three months of this year we are training staff in domestic abuse and how to treat children in domestic abuse situations, so we are investing heavily in ensuring our frontline staff have a better understanding of the issues and how to protect children."
