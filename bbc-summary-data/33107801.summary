Alan Cronin, 60, from Guilden Sutton, near Chester, was found with serious injuries near Rossett flyover on the A483 Wrexham bypass on Thursday.
North Wales Police have arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop and report a collision.
He is in custody and being questioned.
A family tribute described Mr Cronin, a member of Chester Triathlon Club, as the "best possible dad, husband, brother and partner to have, willing to do anything for anyone".
In a statement, issued by police, they said: "He was always someone to turn to and had a solution to any problem.
"He was the most fantastic man and he'll stay with us for the rest of our lives."
