Cardiff body in carpet killing: Men fail in appeal bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men who killed a 15-year-old-girl whose body was found wrapped in a carpet have failed in an appeal against their convictions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Charlton, 56, of Bridgwater, Somerset, and Idris Ali, 51, of Cardiff, were jailed in 1991 over the death of Karen Price.
At a brief hearing at London's Court of Appeal on Tuesday, judges dismissed their appeal.
Karen's body was found on Fitzhamon Embankment, Cardiff, in November 1989.
Charlton was jailed for life in 1991 for murder while Ali was freed in 1994 after his conviction was quashed and he admitted manslaughter.
Karen went missing from a children's home in 1981 and when her body was found, it was so badly decomposed it was impossible to establish the cause of her death.
Lawyers for the men argued during their appeal that evidence from the key witness in the trial - a girl from the same children's home as Karen who was known only as D - could not be relied upon.
It was this testimony which implicated the men in Karen's killing.
Ali claims he only confessed to manslaughter in order to get out of prison.
Charlton's representatives claimed police officers involved in the investigation pressurised key trial witnesses.
Some also worked on the 1988 murder of Cardiff prostitute Lynette White, which later triggered an investigation into alleged police corruption.
Lawyers argued if that was known at the time of their prosecution, the evidence from D would have been excluded or viewed differently by the jury.
