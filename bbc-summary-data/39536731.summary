Loic Remy is nearing a comeback from a calf problem but is one of six Palace players unavailable this weekend.
Leicester captain Wes Morgan will miss a sixth straight match because of a back injury, although he may be fit to face Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.
Manager Craig Shakespeare will rest several key players ahead of that tie.
Mark Scott: "A little over two months ago, Crystal Palace were second from bottom in the table, with Leicester lying just one place above the relegation zone.
"But only Spurs can better the 15 points both teams have taken from the last 18 available and Sam Allardyce believes one more win would 'probably be enough' to secure Palace's safety.
"On paper, the timing of the game should aid Allardyce's chances of getting that victory on Saturday, as Craig Shakespeare will surely be tempted to rest a number of Leicester's first-team regulars with Tuesday's return leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid in mind."

Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "We need to focus on the game this weekend and make sure we don't get wrapped up in all the talk of us being safe, because we are not.
"The aim will be to try and secure another three points but we are playing a team in exceptionally good form like ourselves and this will be just as difficult a game as we faced against Arsenal on Monday night, if not more."
Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: "We need to be competitive against a real competitive Palace team.  I'm thinking that we still need the points. None of us are safe.
"We need to concentrate on Palace and try to get those points. It'll be a really tough challenge. You could see [against Arsenal] on Monday their confidence."
This is a good time for Palace to play Leicester, who are in between both legs of their Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid.
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare made lots of changes for their last league game, at Everton, with that match in Madrid in mind.
They lost 4-2 at Goodison Park, and were so open. If they play the same way against Palace, they will get punished.
Prediction: 2-1
