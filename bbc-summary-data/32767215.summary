National Good Gestures Day has been held in 15 locations, supported by Stephen's friends.
Stephen, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, died of cancer a year ago.
He and his friends helped make the gestures day a national event last year and they promised him they would keep it going.
Hannah Telles knew Stephen, who was 19 when he died, and took part in the day with him last year.
"It's celebrating his message and his legacy," she said.
"With the anniversary (of his death) just gone, it's a good time to come out and make people happy.
"I think he would love this."
One woman who was given a hug in Birmingham said it brought tears to her eyes.
"It's 12 months since he died and his friends are still here doing things to raise awareness for him," she said.
"And he did so much himself."
Stephen had initially set out to raise just £10,000 ($16,800) for charity, but his fundraising campaign attracted huge attention after he posted a selfie online.
The image went viral and attracted the support of celebrities including Jason Manford, who championed Stephen's charity efforts. So far, his Just Giving page has raised £4.5m.
Good Gestures Day events have been held in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Chelmsford, Falmouth, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton and Swansea.
