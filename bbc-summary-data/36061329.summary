The visitors took the lead when on-loan Celtic striker Michael Duffy steered an excellent shot past Wes Foderingham.
Andy Halliday missed a penalty but crossed for James Tavernier to head home the equaliser minutes later.
Rangers spurned several chances in the second half, before the celebrations began in earnest.
The occasion was more significant for the home side than the game itself. The players walked out to a guard of honour from the Alloa side, and the fans were in celebratory mood throughout.
The players could not succumb to the atmosphere, not least with the Scottish Cup final providing a competitive end of the season next month.
Slackness proved to be more than a mere irritant, since conceding possession from their own throw-in led to Rangers losing an early goal.
Duffy left Rob Kiernan in his wake as he raced upfield on the left before curling a shot into the far corner.
It was a measure of Rangers' lack of penetration that Alloa goalkeeper Scott Gallacher was mostly only called upon to make routine saves in the first half.
He was relieved to see Halliday stroke his penalty wide after Barrie McKay had been brought down inside the area by Kyle McAusland, although the goalkeeper was helpless on the cusp of half-time when Tavernier converted Halliday's cross with a close-range header.
It was Tavernier's 15th goal of the season in all competitions, taking him above the likes of John Greig and Sandy Jardine to set a new club record for goals in a single season from a full-back.
Rangers continued to command the ball after the break, and Billy King twice saw efforts saved by Gallacher, who also stopped a Liam Burt effort.
For the home fans, though, the day was ultimately about the scenes of celebration that followed the final whistle.
