Manager Kevin Nicholson says Torquay United's new owners must earn the trust of the National League club's fans.

The takeover of the Gulls by Swindon-based Gaming International (GI) was confirmed on Tuesday.
Prior to the deal being finalised, Nicholson had said he was unsure what it meant for his own future.
"They have got to show that they are in it for all the right reasons, and they assure me that they are," the 36-year-old told BBC Radio Devon.
"I spoke to them very openly and honestly, making them aware their takeover has not been overly positively taken (among fans). They're aware of that.
"These guys have got a lot to prove but they have technically saved Torquay United right now."
Nicholson, who has been in charge since September 2015, continued: "They've got to gain the trust of thousands of Torquay fans."
"We're going to sit down and put together a five-year plan and then we're going to hold a forum as soon as possible so that these fans that are worried can come in."
Torquay are currently 17th in the table, and play Forest Green Rovers at home on Boxing Day, before a trip to Gloucestershire for the return game to start the new year.
