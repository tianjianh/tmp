The money will go to 57 organisations, including The Pat Finucane Centre, Youth Action and Corrymeela.
Healing Through Remembering and Community Relations in Schools will also benefit.
Charlie Flanagan said the funding reflects his department's commitment to supporting peace in Northern Ireland.
"The Reconciliation Fund has been in existence since 1982 and since that time over €46m (£39m) has been granted to over 1,900 projects, supporting organisations across the community and voluntary sector," he said.
"These groups are working to build meaningful links between all communities and traditions on the island and address the issues, including sectarianism, which still impact on the lives of so many people."
