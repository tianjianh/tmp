[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the first, a young child was approached by a man near the city's Drakies Primary School on 8 December.
At 18:20 on Tuesday, a man sitting in a car parked on Union Road spoke to a child on a nearby footpath.
Police said the man was with another man in a white, four-door car with red and white checkerboard livery.
The men were described as having tanned complexions.
A police spokesman said: "Police Scotland would seek to reassure the public that extensive inquiries have been carried out into the matter and these remain ongoing at this time."
In the incident earlier this month, a man approached a child and tried to speak to them.
The man was described as being between 30 and 40 years old, about 5ft 6in tall, white with facial stubble.
He was wearing a black beanie hat, brown zipped jacket and blue jeans.
