The Community Speed Watch pilot will run for six months at up to 50 sites in York, Harrogate and Selby.
North Yorkshire Police said the volunteers would work alongside police officers and community support officers.
Drivers caught speeding will not face a fine but will receive a letter from the force informing them of their offence.
Data gathered by volunteers will also be monitored and further enforcement measures may be taken against a persistent or extreme offender, the force said.
The scheme, which already operates elsewhere in England, is aimed at mainly residential areas with 30 and 40mph speed limits.
Dep Ch Con Tim Madgwick said the main aim was to draw drivers' attention to the speed limit in areas where residents said it was affecting their quality of life.
