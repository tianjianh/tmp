[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The winners of this year's Royal Photographic Society (RPS) International Print Exhibition have been announced and include work by both professional and amateur photographers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RPS exhibition has been held 156 times since it began in 1854 and this year attracted nearly 5,000 entries from 1,285 photographers, spread across nearly 60 countries. It truly is a global competition.
That said, the top three spots went to three photographers from Italy. Antonio Busiello won a gold award, Mattia Vacca a silver and the under-30s award was won by Michele Palazzi.
The pictures are judged anonymously by the selectors who this year were commercial and fine art photographer Ray Spence FRPS; Sophie Batterbury, picture editor of The Independent on Sunday; Anthony Holland Parkin, director of editorial content at Getty Images; contemporary portrait photographer Kate Peters; and fine art photographer Bill Jackson.
Here are the winners and a selection of other pictures that were chosen.
The exhibition opens at Shire Hall Gallery, Stafford on 20 July 2013 before moving on to venues around the country.  All the selected images can be seen online.
