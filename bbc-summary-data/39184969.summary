The car crashed into them in Bromley Road, Bellingham, shortly before 08:30 GMT on 26 February.
One of the five, a 31-year-old Romanian who was in a critical condition, had his life-support machine turned off on Friday, police said.
The driver was arrested and bailed on suspicion of drink-driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He will not be re-arrested in light of the death and is due to answer bail in early May, the Met Police said.
Officers were awaiting confirmation that all of the Romanian man's next-of-kin had been informed of his death before releasing details of his identity, the force added.
None of the other victims is believed to be in a critical condition.
The other injured people include a 35-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man who were initially described as critically ill but have since stabilised, plus two other men aged 36 and 46.
