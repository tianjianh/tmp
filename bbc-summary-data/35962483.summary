Police have pledged to mount high-visibility patrols in Hawick following a "completely unprovoked" attack on a man in the town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old was treated for minor injuries following the assault in Princes Street at about 03:50 on Sunday.
Police believe the two men responsible for the assault were part of a larger group of up to five men, aged 16-17.
The attack came shortly after a spate of vandalisms in the town.
Three men were seen damaging cars in the Roxburghe Drive and Stirches Road area at about 03:00
Sgt Rachel Campbell said: "This was a completely unprovoked attack and there will be an increase in high-visibility patrols in the local area over the coming days.
"We'd urge anyone with information about either the assault or the vandalisms, or who recognises the descriptions of the suspects, to get in touch as soon as possible."
