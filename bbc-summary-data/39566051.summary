[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lorry driver denies charges over M20 bridge collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver has denied dangerous driving charges over the collapse of a pedestrian bridge on to a motorway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when the bridge fell on to the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent on 27 August last year.
Alan Austen, 63, of Darlington, Durham, pleaded not guilty to two charges of dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Maidstone Crown Court set a trial date for 19 February 2018.
The bridge collapsed between junctions four and three, near the junction with the M26, which links the M25 London orbital with the M20.
The road, which is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover, had to be shut while two large cranes worked to clear the debris.
