The 22-year-old, who won the English Amateur Championship last summer, had previously said she would stay amateur.
Giles. who is the first golfer to win all three major English women's amateur titles, has applied for the Access Series of the European Ladies Tour.
"This season just gone I achieved everything I wanted to achieve in the amateur game, so I'm ready to take on the pro game now," she said.
"I'm hoping to eventually end up in America on the LPGA tour, that's where everyone really aims to get to, that's where the best competition is, that's where the best golf courses are and it would be a really awesome experience to go out there."
Giles says she is inspired by Charley Hull, who like Giles had an impressive amateur career before turning professional at the age of 16.
"I'd love to play in the Solheim Cup one day, that would be the aim," she added to BBC Radio Cornwall.
"That's what Charley Hull's done in the last few years, she was an amateur playing in the same stuff I was playing in and now she's doing really well in America and played two Solheim Cups."
