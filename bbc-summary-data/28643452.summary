The 2014 Travellers' Choice Awards feature categories including landmarks, hotels and beaches.
Jamie Christon, managing director of Chester Zoo said: "We're absolutely delighted."
He said: "Our sincere thanks go to every single person who has come here because, as a registered charity, their visits help us to carry out all of our vital conservation work - saving species from extinction both here in the UK and overseas."
According to the poll, the UK has the most award-winning zoos of all European countries.
Among the other venues winning plaudits were Colchester Zoo, Essex; Paignton Zoo Environmental Park, Devon; Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire; Cotswold Wildlife Park and Gardens, Burford, Oxfordshire; Knowsley Safari Park, Merseyside; and South Lakes Safari Zoo, Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria.
