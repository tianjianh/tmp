The pair have won 14 titles since April 2015, including three consecutive Grand Slams.
However, a 41-match winning streak ended in February and they have failed to advance beyond the quarter-finals in their past four events.
But Swiss Hingis and India's Mirza will reunite to defend their WTA Finals title in Singapore in October.
The self-styled "Santina" team issued a statement which said: "We have mutually agreed that we would each be open to playing with other players for the remainder of the season.
"Perhaps, because of our great past results, we have had very high expectations from our partnership and unfortunately did not get the results we desired recently.
"We would like to clarify that it was a totally professional decision based purely on our recent results."
Mirza will link up with Czech Barbora Strycova at next week's Western & Southern Open, while Hingis is at the Rio Olympics partnering fellow Swiss  Timea Bacsinszky.
