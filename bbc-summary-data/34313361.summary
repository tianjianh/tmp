A hospital trust which cancelled appointments last winter after it struggled to cope with emergency admissions has said its management of elderly patients was partly to blame.

Ashford and St Peter's Hospitals Trust declared a major incident in January while under "severe pressure".
The trust said extra beds will now be made available and "seven-day working practices" will be implemented.
It said last winter saw an "unprecedented demand" on NHS services.
A spokeswoman said: "One of the biggest issues last winter was managing frail and elderly patients. We have been looking to see how we can provide more care locally, out of hospital wherever possible."
It said in December the first of three "locality hubs" will open in Woking to provide vulnerable patients with preventative care.
Within the hospital it said services will be made available at weekends and over bank holidays, with additional capacity for x-rays, pharmacy cover and ward staffing.
The spokeswoman added: "Most importantly, the local health system - commissioners, primary and community care, social care and acute hospital services - is committed to ensuring a joint response, working together to collectively manage health and social care services over the winter period."
