[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Robins had conceded 10 goals in their last two games and it looked like more of the same after Wes Burns headed the Cod Army into an early lead.
Tyrell Belford saved well from Burns and his luck was in as Fleetwood then hit the woodwork four times.
Town held on and Ajose levelled with his 23rd of the season from Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill's cross.
Louis Thompson then hit the Fleetwood bar, and the visitors also had an effort cleared off the line in an eventful finish.
Fleetwood remain one point and one place above the relegation zone, while Swindon are still 15th in League One, 10 points clear of the bottom four.
