[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The elderly female Staffordshire bull terrier was discovered outside The Burgh on Musselburgh High Street on Friday and has been named Myrtle.
The police said no-one at the pub recognised the pair.
They are in their late 30s and of average height and weight.
Myrtle is now being looked after by the Scottish SPCA's Edinburgh and Lothians Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Balerno.
Paul Anderson, Scottish SPCA, said: "We have been told a man and woman were in the pub with Myrtle that afternoon.
"They went outside at around 17:30 and apparently had an argument, resulting in them walking away in different directions and leaving Myrtle behind.
"No-one at the pub recognised the pair and they are described as being in their late 30s and of average height and weight.
"We are very keen to trace these two people and would ask anyone with information to contact us.
"Myrtle is a lovely dog in good condition and she's now receiving the care she needs."
