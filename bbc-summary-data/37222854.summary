[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Drury said the car, which had been parked on a zebra crossing, mounted the pavement, lifting him on to the bonnet.
Police said no-one had been arrested, despite the warden's body-worn camera capturing images of the attacker.
Mr Drury has been off work injured since the hit-and-run on the Isle of Sheppey on 8 July.
He said he was helping a colleague issue a ticket on a car parked on zigzag lines when the "driver got into the vehicle and went into me".
"I heard the accelerator go, didn't look up and didn't realise he was going to come towards me.
"He went straight into me, mounted the pavement and drove into me. I went on to the bonnet and crashed down to the side of the pavement."
Mr Drury, who suffered neck and shoulder damage, said in six years as a traffic warden he had been "pushed over a few times" and receives "verbal abuse every day".
Kent Police said enquiries into the attack were ongoing.
