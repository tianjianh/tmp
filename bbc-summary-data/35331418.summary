The 20-year-old forward, on loan from Millwall, headed in Dan Walker's cross to give the visitors the lead.
Damon Lathrope then doubled the advantage when his 30-yard free-kick looped over home keeper Ritchie Branagan and into the top corner.
Kristian Dennis had a late effort blocked for the hosts, but the Shots defence held firm for a clean sheet.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"It was a good away performance, we got the goals at good times and the boys worked ever so hard to get that result.
"The starting eleven and the boys that came on, they worked very hard defensively and that allowed us to win chances in order to take them.
"I think overall our team defensively ensured a good performance, where the strikers worked hard to stop them getting the ball forward and when they did get it forward the midfielders tracked their runners which allowed us to defend well.
"I've got a great squad, their attitude is superb and I've said that all along. The players have worked ever so hard during the week topping up their fitness levels and that showed."
