The girl did not speak during the five-minute hearing as her solicitor confirmed her name when asked by Judge Peter Collier QC.
She is next due to appear for a pre-trial hearing at Leeds Crown Court on 16 February.
Due to her age, the judge and court officials did not wear gowns or wigs.
Katie was found by police after they were called to Alness Drive, in the Woodthorpe area of the city, on Monday afternoon.
A number of floral tributes, candles and teddies have been placed in the alleyway which links to the playing field.
An online donation site in aid of Katie's family has raised almost Â£20,000 in three days.
