She was attacked by the dog on Tuesday as police pursued a man who ran away after a stolen car crashed into a wall in Newton Heath, Manchester.
Her mother, Sarah Malone, said her daughter Phoebe was bitten on the legs and had "10 wounds".
The girl was taken to hospital. An internal investigation has begun, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
Mrs Malone said Phoebe was playing outside with friends when the incident occurred at about 19:55 BST.
Her son saw what happened from the window and shouted: "Mum, Phoebe's been bitten by a police dog", she added.
"I ran out and the next minute she was just sat on the chair and there was loads of police around her and she was just shaking.
"They asked me if I could get her in the house because she's cold, we need to get her warm.
"She's got 10 wounds, two of them very deep, they said if it was two inches more, it could have gone for her arteries, so it was serious.
"I'm still shocked," she added. "I just can't believe it's happened to a little girl, let alone my daughter."
Mrs Malone said her daughter was "traumatised" and criticised police for releasing the dog close to where children play. She called for a review of the training for dog handlers.
A police spokesman confirmed the incident happened while in pursuit of the driver of a stolen Fiat Punto who ran off after the car crashed into a wall on Blackstone Walk in Newton Heath.
"A police dog was deployed to pursue the offender and during the chase a six-year-old girl was unfortunately bitten. The girl was taken to hospital and kept in overnight for observation," he said.
"Her injuries are not believed to be serious."
The incident has been automatically referred to the force's Professional Standards Branch, GMP said.
