[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 1-2 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool moved into the play-off places as goals from Jamille Matt and Tom Aldred sentenced Leyton Orient to a seventh straight home defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt broke the deadlock on the half hour when hew bundled Orient defender Yvan Erichot off the ball, advanced towards goal down the left, then drilled his shot past goalkeeper Alex Cisak at the near post.
The home side had Cisak to thank for restricting the visitors' advantage to just one goal at the interval, denying Brad Potts at close range before diving at the feet of Colin Daniel as the Blackpool player was about to pull the trigger.
The home side's best effort came in the 32nd minute when Gavin Massey hit the woodwork from 25 yards.
But Blackpool doubled their lead on 58 minutes when defender Tom Aldred was left completely unmarked to head in a corner.
The home side looked dispirited until Paul McCallum's looping header with two minutes left offered them a lifeline, but the visitors were able to contain a late rally.
There were combined protests before and during the game involving 300 Orient and Blackpool supporters protesting at the manner of ownership of their respective clubs.
