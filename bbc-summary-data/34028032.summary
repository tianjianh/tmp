Police at Weston Park tested purple ecstasy pills with a Louis Vuitton logo and orange ones with a crown logo.
Supt Elliott Sharrard-Williams said: "We are concerned that high level of purity could cause users to become seriously ill."
It is not known whether a man who collapsed with a suspected drugs overdose had taken the tablets.
Mr Sharrard-Williams said the man who was found collapsed in the arena was "recovering well in hospital".
Officers said anyone with drugs should put them in the drugs surrender bins at the site.
Mr Sharrard-Williams said on Friday night thefts from nine tents at the Weston Park site had been reported to police and led to three men being arrested.
The music festival, which is also held at Hylands Park, Chelmsford, is marking its 20th year.
It first took place in 1996 when Pulp and Paul Weller headlined. This year will see Kasabian and Calvin Harris play the main stage.
Organisers said they expected a total of 250,000 people to attend both sites over the weekend.
