Malcolm Greaves, who has died aged 75, worked with Ivory when they were both binmen in Nottinghamshire.
Mr Greaves inspired two characters in the programme, who were played by actors Edward Woodward and Tim Healy.
Mr Ivory said in tribute: "Malcolm was a lovely, funny, kind man and was a big part of my growing up."
Mr Greaves worked on the bins for many years with his son Paul, and the pair inspired a father-and-son binmen team in the programme.
"Dad enjoyed watching the series," said Mr Greaves. "He was very pleased with it all because he could really relate to all the characters. He recognised a lot of the traits of people he'd worked with at the depots in Newark and Southwell.
"My dad thought the world of Bill Ivory anyway, and Billy always liked to get back on the bins when he was back home from university in the holidays. He liked to meet up with all the old friends and faces."
Malcolm, known as "Malc", worked as a driver on the bin lorries for 28 years, originally for Southwell Rural District Council, which was succeeded by Newark and Sherwood District Council.
"Edward Woodward played the serious side to my dad but dad was also very happy and jovial," said Paul.
"He was full of one-liners and would have people in stitches, but he was never crude. Everybody felt better for being in his company, whether they were 18 or 80."
Malcolm was diabetic and died in hospital on 31 July after complications from an operation to remove his leg.
His funeral takes place at 16:00 BST at the Sherwood Forest Crematorium in Ollerton.
