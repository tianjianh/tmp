The married father-of-two, 34, was struck and killed by a pick-up truck while on duty in Wallasey on Monday.
Clayton Williams, 18, of Wallasey, has been charged with murder; and Phillip Stuart, 30, of Oxton, was charged with aggravated unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle and burglary.
The Birkenhead football club made the tribute before its National League game against Eastleigh.
Tranmere's vice-chairman Nicola Palios tweeted to announce the plans, which also included a collection.
The club had initially proposed a minute's silence, but bosses changed their minds after supporters expressed a preference for applause.
PC Phillips was an avid football fan and a supporter of neighbouring Merseyside club Everton.
His family told in a press conference how he had wished to one day take his daughters to their first match.
Mr Williams, of Wheatland Lane, Wallasey, appeared before Liverpool Crown Court on Friday when he was remanded in custody until 22 October, when he is due in court again.
His solicitor issued a statement that said the 18-year-old accepted his driving caused the death of PC Phillips but said he did not intend to kill him.
Mr Stuart, of Mayfair Court, Oxton, was also remanded in custody until 22 October.
Three women, aged between 19 and 59, and a 39-year old man, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender in connection with PC Phillips' death, have been released on bail.
