The 71-year-old told the Daily Telegraph he could return for a fifth instalment.
The news came ahead of the Twitter announcement from Sylvester Stallone that Ford would be joining The Expendables 3.
The last film in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, was released in 2008.
It is estimated the movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, was produced for $185 million (Â£120m) but took more than $786m (Â£510m) at the worldwide box office.
It starred Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett and was co-written by director George Lucas.
Talking about his return as Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford said: "We've seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it's perfectly appropriate and okay for him to come back again with a great movie around him where he doesn't necessarily have to kick as much ass.
"To me, what was interesting about the character was that he prevailed, that he had courage, that he had wit, that he had intelligence, that he was frightened and that he still managed to survive. That I can do."
Ford will be starring in a number of films, including the thriller Paranoia and the sci-fi movie Ender's Game.
Filming for The Expendables 3 is due to start this month.
Stallone tweeted: "Willis out... Harrison Ford in!!!! Great news!!!!! Been waiting years for this!!!! Greedy and lazy ...... A sure formula for career failure."
Jackie Chan and Nicolas Cage are due to appear in the film, which is expected to hit cinemas in 2014.
