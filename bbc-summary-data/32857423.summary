The city council said it wants to create three routes into the city centre from Beeston, Clifton and Hucknall.
It will also give cyclists "priority" when planning new housing estates and road junctions.
Officials said feasibility work would begin immediately with the first routes being built with "a couple of years".
Jane Urquhart, portfolio holder for transport and planning at Nottingham City Council, said: "Cycling is a key part of the council's vision for sustainable transport.
"The new routes are exciting because they will offer something for all types of cyclists - providing quick and safe travel into and across the city, opportunities to cycle for sport and for fun."
Local cycling charity Pedals welcomed the plan but said it needed to be "the start of something more ambitious".
