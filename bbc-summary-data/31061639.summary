A new 1,000-home "garden village" could be built on the site of a former airfield.

The proposals for Deenethorpe Airfield in north Northamptonshire have been included in regional housing plans.
The development would include between 1,000 and 1,250 homes, a hotel, industrial base, tree planting, a school and a community hall.
But, there are fears it would increase pressure on services in neighbouring Corby.
The 600 acre airfield, which was used by the American air force during World War Two, is located between Deenethorpe and Upper Benefield.
After the war it became an RAF recruiting centre, before most of the land was returned to agriculture in the 1960s.
The proposals, by land owners the Deene Estate, include planting more trees at Rockingham Forest, dedicated pedestrian and cycling routes between Deenethorpe, Upper Benefield and Corby, and an equestrian centre.
Development manager Aldred Drummond said the project is "a huge opportunity to build really amazing green spaces".
East Northamptonshire Council has set up a working party to speak to people in the surrounding villages and look into any new ideas.
One member, Councillor Phillip Stearn, said it was "a wonderful project".
But Corby Borough Council lead member for the environment, Councillor Mark Pengelly, said Corby would "have to absorb the extra pressure" on services such as schools and doctors surgeries created by the new homes.
The plans have been included in the draft North Northamptonshire Core Strategy.
Deene Estate hope to submit a planning application by the new year.
