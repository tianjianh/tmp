The work to build 16 new wards at the high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire will end in 2017.
Visitors to two open days will be able to view images showing the progress of the build and find out about works scheduled for this summer.
The first event is at Meadows Shopping Centre in Sandhurst, with the second on Thursday at Crowthorne Library.
The open days are being used as a way to keep residents up to date on new developments and how the project is progressing.
Currently three new ward buildings are under construction.
Vivienne Mowatt, Broadmoor Hospital's deputy programme director, said: "We're well into our first year of construction, so passers-by can actually see the buildings beginning to take shape.
"The hospital also plays an important role in the local community, so it's essential that we continue to let people know what's going on and remind them just how much this redevelopment is needed."
The new hospital will provide accommodation for 210 patients. Current patients will remain on site throughout the redevelopment.
The trust previously said many "core aspects" of the site, such as its Grade I listed gatehouse, would remain.
