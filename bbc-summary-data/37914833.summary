[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' players want to redeem their autumn international campaign by winning their remaining three matches, says Bradley Davies.

Rob Howley's team were hammered 32-8 by Australia, in their opening game of the series last weekend.
They now face games against Argentina, Japan and South Africa, starting with the Pumas on Saturday.
"We're all proud Welshmen and hate losing especially in that manner," Ospreys second row Davies said.
"But if we win the next three games everyone will be saying it's been a successful autumn, so that's what we've got to strive for now."
The Pumas are Wales' next opponents in Cardiff, fresh from a 54-20 win over Japan in Tokyo.
Argentina reached the semi-final of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, but their win against South Africa was their only success in the 2015 Rugby Championship.
But they impressed at home against New Zealand at home, and looked sharp in beating Japan.
"They've  played very good rugby especially in the last couple of games they've played - probably from the World Cup really,"  Davies added.
"The way they have improved has been phenomenal and they've got a physical pack as well - so they beat you up up-front and they spin the ball about as well now.
"We've got to pick ourselves up and we've shown over the years that we can do it."
Scrum-half Gareth Davies is likely to start against Argentina following an injury to Ospreys number nine Rhys Webb.
Davies impressed during the World Cup when Webb was also injured, but the Scarlets half-back feels for his Wales team-mate.
"I'm gutted for Webby," he said.
"He's had some bad luck over the past 12 months or so. It's a good opportunity for me now to get a bit more game time and hopefully have an impact in the autumn matches.
"I rate Webby, he's a great player and it's good to have competition in the squad - there's Lloyd Williams and Tomas Williams coming in as well now.
"We've got some good scrum-halves in Wales keeping us on our toes.
"It's nice to have a game this weekend so hopefully we can put things right and we can come away with a good win against the Pumas on Saturday."
