Tickets for the event, at the derelict Tropicana in Weston-super-Mare, have sold out for the slot originally due to be filled by DJ Dapper Dan.
But the anonymous artist's website said a "supply DJ from Brighton" would now play in his place.
Fatboy Slim - alter ego of Norman Cook - is best known for 1990s hits like The Rockerfeller Skank and Praise You.
The Dismaland exhibition is a dark take on theme parks with a nod to Disneyland, featuring work by more than 50 artists including Bristolian Banksy.
"I've been trawling through the Disney back catalogue, working out ways I can subvert it in the same manner that Dismaland tries to subvert it - but in a reverential way," Norman Cook told BBC 6 Music.
"There will be a sort of twisted tribute to Disney in some form or another."
The father-of-two added: "I'm very au fait with the Frozen soundtrack and it might feature in my set."
Others featuring in Dismaland are Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Jimmy Cauty, who says he chose the venue himself after walking past the old lido - which closed in 2000 - six months ago.
Among the exhibits are a distorted mermaid, a dilapidated fairy castle and a boat pond where all the boats are filled with models of migrants, along with a beach ball hovering above upturned knives.
