The online retailer will open the centre in Wythenshawe in the autumn, with permanent jobs being created over three years.
The posts will include engineers, computing staff, human resources and operation managers.
The announcement is part of plans to create 2,500 new jobs this year, bringing the total workforce to 14,500.
Amazon is already planning to open a new centre in Coalville, Leicestershire, bringing its number of UK sites to 12.
The company currently employs 40,000 people in Europe and last year created 10,000 jobs.
Mike Kane, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, said the announcement was "fantastic news" and part of a continuing "renaissance of Wythenshawe".
He added: "A thousand new permanent jobs over three years will open up new opportunities for many people in my constituency."
