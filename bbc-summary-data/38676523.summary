A Dundee bus company whose vehicles were targeted by stone-throwing youths has produced a video warning of the potentially fatal consequences.

Xplore Dundee was forced to temporarily suspend three services in the Whitfield area last November after its buses came under attack.
The company said it made the decision as a result of the "extremely dangerous and totally unacceptable" incidents.
It has now released a film that was previously shown in Dundee schools.
A Stone's Throw Away is a 15-minute film showing the recreation of a brick attack on a double decker bus and its aftermath.
It includes interviews with emergency services workers and is based on actual events.
PC Scott Menmuir, of Dundee Community Safety said: "We are well aware of the impact this has on our community and those travelling through Whitfield.
"Throwing stones at buses is not a bit of harmless fun - it is reckless, extremely dangerous and has the potential to cause serious injury."
PC Menmuir said police were carrying out high-visibility and plainclothes patrols to provide reassurance to the local community.
He said: "As a passenger or driver on the bus, this can be a very frightening experience and it is extremely fortunate that no-one travelling on the buses has been injured so far.
"We are also working with Xplore Dundee to trace those responsible and we are working together with partner agencies to identify opportunities to prevent further incidents."
