After four months of 2015 the blue-chip index is up 6.3%.
Lloyds Banking Group was the top riser, jumping 7.1% to 82.87p after investors welcomed its first-quarter results.
Underlying profits at Lloyds rose 21% to £2.2bn, at the top end of forecasts, although the bank said it had taken a £660m loss on the sale of TSB to Spain's Banco Sabadell.

The company - which also owns the Scalextric and Airfix brands - said this would be the first time for three years that it had reported a pre-tax profit.
