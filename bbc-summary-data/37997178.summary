Barratt Developments has said that there remains "strong demand" for new homes, although the London market is cooling.

In a trading update, Barratt, one of the UK's biggest housebuilders, said sales since July had risen by 4.3%.
But the company said the London housing market was "more challenging" because of the higher selling prices.
The news comes on the day that a report said first-time buyers need more help to stop a decline in home ownership.
Average prices have fallen in central London because of an increase in stamp duty property tax and the uncertainty created by the June 23 EU referendum.
"We do recognise that at price points about Â£600,000, particularly at price points once you move above Â£1m, the market is clearly slower," said Barratt chief executive David Thomas.
When asked how much Barratt is cutting prices in London, Mr Thomas added: "You are seeing commentary about prices backing off year-on-year on a 5% to 10% basis so I think that it's in that sort of order."
Mr Thomas added: "We are mindful of the potential for economic uncertainty created by the outcome of the EU referendum. However, market fundamentals are robust.
"This has been another good trading period for the group."
The housebuilder has launched 69 new developments since July, compared to 51 in the same period last year. The company now has 385 sites, slightly up on last year's 380.
Barratt said the average rate of reservations per week was in line with last year, at 265.
Liberum's housebuilding analyst Charlie Campbell predicts house prices will drop further, saying: "We continue to expect house price falls of 2.5% in 2017 if the economy slows as forecast."
