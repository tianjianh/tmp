Western Trust: Minister intervenes in disability funding fallout

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The health minister has intervened to help resolve a row over a health trust's £8m funding shortfall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Western Trust confirmed in May that the shortfall in learning disability services was "in the last couple of years".
Michelle O'Neill said she has taken steps to ensure the focus returns to "the delivery of frontline services".
Her intervention follows a breakdown in talks between the trust and a disability group.
John McCann, of Western Learning Disability Action Group (WLDAG), said the group had withdrawn because they had concerns over the "openness and transparency" of the process.
Mrs O'Neill said she has since appointed a senior health department official "to oversee progress and to be a point of contact for the families".
She also said an independent facilitator would "be appointed to support a process of co-production between the trust and local families".
Mr McCann said WLDAG welcomed the minister's intervention and was "now looking forward to moving forward".
He said the underfunding - which he said could go back as far as 1996 -  had created a "bottleneck" in learning disability services and caused "a lot of distress to families and carers".
The minister also said an increased investment of £3m in adult community learning disability services is now in place with a further £5m earmarked for future investment.
In a statement the Western Trust said: "The health minister has spoken to the chief executive of the trust regarding the learning disability issue and in going forward the trust will be engaging in a full Personal  and Public Involvement (PPI) process with the families and the carers of those affected by an adult learning disability."
