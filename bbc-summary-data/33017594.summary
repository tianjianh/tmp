Annan-led UN panel calls Australia 'free rider' on climate

An panel led by former UN chief Kofi Annan has called Australia a climate change "free rider" for not doing enough to curb carbon emissions.

The African Progress Panel listed its criticism in a report on Friday.
Australia has one of the world's highest carbon emissions per capita, and recently replaced its carbon tax and emissions trading schemes with a reduction fund in a controversial move.
Canberra said in response it was taking "significant action" on climate change.
Australia is described in the Africa Progress Panel report as having, along with Canada, Russia and Japan, "withdrawn from the community of nations seeking to tackle dangerous climate change".
The report said it "has gone from leadership to free-rider status in climate diplomacy".
The panel focuses on how African governments and international partners are tackling the continent's energy and climate challenges, and calls for "wholesale reform" of the "ineffective" climate financing system.
The panel is made up of 10 high-profile individuals advocating for Africa's sustainable development.  Members include former IMF chief Michel Camdessus, Transparency International's founder Peter Eigen, and Irish singer Bob Geldof.
Separately, Australia's climate policy and reduction targets were examined at a UN conference in Bonn, Germany on Thursday.
The conference is part of an assessment process before a crucial Paris climate summit scheduled for December, which Australia will attend. Diplomats have questioned if Australia's current goals are ambitious enough.
Australia is the only nation attending to have removed an emissions trading scheme in the lead-up to the summit, and this week its house of representatives voted to lower renewable energy targets.
The government had set a 2020 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from 2000 levels.
But emissions are now expected to rise between 12% and 18% above levels from the year 2000, following the policy switch to an emissions reduction fund which pays big polluters to cut emissions and use cleaner energy.
A spokesperson for Environment Minister Gregg Hunt said that the emissions reduction fund was "delivering real and significant abatement".
He said the A$2.5bn fund (Â£1.25bn, $1.93bn) has so far contracted four times the amount of emissions reduction achieved with the carbon tax.
Countries such as China and Brazil, as well as environment groups, have questioned the current policy and the scrapping of the previous emissions trading scheme.
