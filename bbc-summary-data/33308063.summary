No one was onboard and no was was hurt.
The craft, an American Falcon-9 SpaceX rocket, was carrying supplies of food and equipment to the astronauts on the space station.
US space agency Nasa say the astronauts who were waiting for the supplies still have plenty to keep them going.
An investigation is underway to find out what went wrong.
