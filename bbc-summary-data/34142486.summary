[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gore-Tex manufacturer to shed 120 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 120 jobs are under threat at fabrics manufacturer WL Gore in West Lothian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company, which makes Gore-Tex, said it was "realigning operations" at its fabrics plant in Livingston as part of a global business review.
The job losses represent more than half of the plant's 200-strong workforce.
Gore said manufacturing and technical roles would be affected, and that a consultation process would start in the coming weeks.
Gore's other manufacturing plants in Livingston and Dundee are unaffected by the move.
The firm opened its upgraded fabrics plant in the West Lothian town three years ago.
Gore's UK fabrics manufacturing leader Justin King said: "This decision has not been taken lightly.
"We are extremely conscious of the impact to associates and will make every effort to assist them.
"In order to minimise the need for compulsory redundancies, we are seeking volunteers for redundancy from all areas of the plant."
