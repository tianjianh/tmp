Life expectancy, employment, school leaver skill levels and air quality are among the measures ministers plan to use to judge Wales' national progress.

Welsh language use and housing quality would also feed into an annual report, to help achieve the goals of the Well-being of Future Generations Act.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said the aim was to achieve a "more rounded picture" of how Wales was advancing.
He invited people to give their views on 40 planned "national indicators".
Mr Jones called the consultation a "fantastic opportunity for public bodies, individuals and organisations to have their say on how we continue to develop and build the Wales we want".
"The Well-being of Future Generations Act places a duty on us all to work together to ensure that decisions taken today are made with future generations at their heart," he added.
During its passage through the assembly, some opposition members had criticised the proposed law to improve the nation's social and economic prospects as a "bureaucratic monster" with no "clear purpose".
