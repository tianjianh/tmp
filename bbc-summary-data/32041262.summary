Young survivor says Angelina is right to speak out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Angelina Jolie has had her ovaries removed, two years after her double mastectomy.

It's because she has inherited the faulty BRAC1 gene, putting her at high risk of cancer.
Her mother, aunt and grandmother all died of the disease.
While most women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are over 45, The Teenage Cancer Trust say it is getting more common in teenagers and younger women.
Jenna Mansfield from Bristol told Newsbeat she was really shocked when she was diagnosed with breast cancer aged 28.
She has the same genetic mutation as Angelina Jolie, but presumed she wouldn't have to worry until later.
She said: "From what I'd heard, and even been told by the doctors, that even with the gene, I was unlikely to get it before my mid thirties."
Like Angelina, who's almost 40, Jenna had both her breasts removed. She thinks she will also have to have her ovaries removed, but that comes with certain risks because of her age.
"The problem with having your ovaries removed when you're young is that you go through early menopause. Obviously that means not being able to have children, but it also puts you at higher risk of heart disease and osteoporosis."
Whilst Jenna has been told she is not at a high risk of ovarian cancer until she's over 40, she says she doesn't believe that, because she got breast cancer younger than expected.
"Statistically, sure you're less likely to get breast cancer under 30, but if you're that one that does gets it then it's kind of 100%, for you."
She's glad Angelina Jolie has chosen to speak out: "I think it's great that she's publicising her health choices, the more she talks about it the more it raises awareness and the more we can get everyone talking about it the better."
