According to Entertainment Weekly (EW), the live-action film will be based on PL Travers' series of books about the no-nonsense but magical nanny.
EW reports the film will be directed by Rob Marshall (Into the Woods, Chicago) and will see Mary return to the Banks family in London.
Anne Hathaway is already favourite to land the lead role, according to bookmakers William Hill.
She is the 6/1 favourite ahead of Emily Blunt at 7/1 while Anna Kendrick, Carey Mulligan and Meryl Streep are all 8/1.
"Hollywood's leading ladies will all be vying for this role but given her striking resemblance to Julie Andrews, Anne Hathaway is the early favourite," said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly.
The action will take place about 20 years after the original, which was set in Edwardian London. The new story will be set in the Depression era.
EW reports that Hairspray composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman will write the songs for the new film.
The original film, starring Julie Andrews, was based mainly on the first volume of PL Travers' Poppins series.
The new film will take inspiration from all eight volumes written by Travers, including Mary Poppins Comes Back, Mary Poppins in the Park and Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.
The 1964 film won five Oscars, including best actress for Andrews, best song - Chim Chim Cher-ee - and best visual effects.
