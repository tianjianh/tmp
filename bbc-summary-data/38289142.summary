Centre Piutau made 12 Premiership appearances for Wasps last season, having joined them on loan in February.
The 31-year-old previously played for Chiefs and Highlanders in Super Rugby before moving to Japan in 2012.
"He will give the squad a boost in a crucial period of the campaign," interim head coach Mark Tainton said.
"I know Siale from his time at Wasps and he's a big presence in the midfield who carries hard and is a reliable defender."
