They join rugby star Mike Tindall, who's married to the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Tindall.
The first series - in which stars compete in winter sports - saw injuries.
Two finalists, Sir Steve Redgrave and comic Marcus Brigstocke, retired hurt.
Sally Bercow, married to MP John Bercow, has been on Celebrity Big Brother, as well as appearing in a Channel 5 series with Paddy Doherty.
Ola Jordan partnered TV wildlife expert Steve Backshall in the latest series of Strictly, but was voted off the show in November.
Also in the line-up are Jackass star Steve-O, ex-JLS star JB Gill, Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills and choreographer and ex-Dancing On Ice judge Louie Spence.
Former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! contestants Phil Tufnell, Ashley Roberts, Joey Essex and Stacey Solomon will all be on the show.
Completing the line-up are Paralympian Jon-Allan Butterworth, socialite Lady Victoria Hervey, heptathlete Louise Hazel and Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson.
Steve-O and Lady Victoria Hervey both appeared on ITV reality show Love Island in 2006.
The 16 contestants have already begun training for events including bobsleigh, slalom and ski cross.
The fastest racers in a skeleton bobsleigh will directly qualifying for the final stages, while others will have to perform a live ski jump to progress.
Those who jump the shortest distances will be put on a subs' bench to replace any casualties.
Last year's winner, Joe McElderry, was drafted in after too many competitors were injured.
Socialite Henry Conway broke a bone in his hand and Melinda Messenger withdrew with concussion suffered on the bobsleigh track.
Past British Winter Olympic stars Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, Graham Bell, Amy Williams and Jenny Jones will be among the experts on hand for the show, which will be shown on TV early next year.
