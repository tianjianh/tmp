The fancy dress theme for the 51st Christmas morning swim was pirates and parrots - along with the usual Santas and elves.
The event, which included carol singing and Christmas music, raised money for lifeboat charity, the RNLI.
Organisers thanked volunteers and swimmers for their "unquestionable dedication and support".
