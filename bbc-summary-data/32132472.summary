[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff law firm shut down by Solicitors Regulation Authority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two solicitors at a Cardiff law firm have been suspended from practising, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The SRA said it had intervened into the practice of Roland Cassam and Peter Lewis at Temple Law Solicitors, in Llandaff, and closed the firm.
It said Mr Cassam was suspected of dishonesty and there was a failure to comply with rules which govern how solicitors handle clients' money.
The SRA investigation continues.
BBC Wales has been unable to contact the firm for comment.
The SRA said in a statement: "An intervention means the SRA has closed a firm with immediate effect.
"We will stop the firm from operating, take possession of all documents and papers held by the firm (including clients' papers), and take possession of all money held by the firm (including clients' money).
"We are not responsible towards employees or trade creditors of firms that we have intervened in.
"The SRA has appointed an agent to deal with all matters currently held by Temple Law Solicitors. The agent will assess all on-going matters and deal with those of greatest need first.
"The SRA's archive team will take control of all documents held by the firm."
The regulator said the firm's clients do not need to contact either the agent or the SRA at this time. It will now complete its investigation and decide on the appropriate course of action.
The SRA said no further details would be disclosed unless disciplinary proceedings become necessary.
