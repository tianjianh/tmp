The 19-year-old was treated for serious injuries after being attacked at the Light nightclub in Royal Exchange Square in the early hours of Sunday.
A witness told BBC Scotland the brawl involved about 15 men.
Police said two men, both aged 19, were taken to hospital with serious injuries after being assaulted in the club at about 01:30.
They were both later released.
Police said they were continuing their inquiries into the incident.
A  21-year-old woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC she sustained injuries to her face after being hit by a glass thrown during the fight.
She said: "I saw a fight break out between two guys, then quickly it turned into this huge fight with around 15 men involved.
"A lot of innocent people like myself ended up getting hurt, and because of it I've got a fractured cheek bone and a bruised eye and nose."
Det Sgt Colin MacRitchie said:  "We need to establish what triggered the disturbance which involved a large number of people in the main area of the club, including the members of staff and security who intervened.
"People routinely visit the city centre to enjoy the varied night life which is on offer. We will not tolerate any violent incident which places people in a state of fear and alarm and results in serious injuries.
"I'd like to speak to anyone who was within Light nightclub on Saturday night into Sunday morning."
Police said anyone with information should contact them via 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 where anonymity can be maintained.
