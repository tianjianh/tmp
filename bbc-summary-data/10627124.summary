The North American leg of their 360 tour had been due to start on 3 June in Salt Lake City but Bono had to undergo surgery in May.
New dates begin in May 2011 in Denver and end on 23 July in Minneapolis.
In a video message on U2's website, Bono apologised and said: "Thank you for standing by us."
Their 2010 European tour will begin as scheduled next month in Turin.
Bono said he was "feeling strong, feeling confident".
'Serious injury'
He added: "I'm going to be fighting fit next summer in the US. Looking forward to this summer in Europe. I actually wanted to apologise for the trouble that this injury has put you all through.
"Those of you who bought tickets, organised hotels, travel plans, it's a very big deal. People go to a lot of trouble to get U2 tickets and we don't take that for granted."
He thanked fans for "standing by us in our hour of need" and said the injury "was not a lot of fun for me",
"The injury was quite serious," he said.
"It happened the day after my birthday and I was staring at the ceiling, which has some advantages - we got some great songs."
The new dates have been published on the band's website.
Manager Paul McGuinness said the band were delighted the dates had been rescheduled in the same venues as originally planned and thanked fans.
"They're the best and the band wants to get back to where they belong - surrounded by their audience," he added.
U2 also pulled out of Glastonbury Festival because of Bono's injury.
