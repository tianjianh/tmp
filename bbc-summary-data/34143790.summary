[SN]TITLE[SN]
Deal struck over Scottish teachers' pay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A two-year deal which would see Scottish teachers being given a 1.5% pay rise this year and a 1% rise next year has been struck after months of talks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This year's pay rise would be back-dated to April under the deal.
Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, will ballot its members but has recommended approval of the offer while the SSTA has "reluctantly" accepted it.
The proposed deal may also see changes to how supply teachers are paid.
And there will be a written commitment on attempting to manage teachers' workload.
The EIS had warned of the risk of industrial action over pay of the issue was not resolved.
As part of the proposed deal, a letter will go out to councils confirming that they can choose to pay supply teachers at the full daily rate from the first day of their work.
Some councils have experienced shortages of supply teachers - with critics claiming one reason for this is that they are paid less for short engagements.
EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "Clearly, the pay element of this offer is disappointing and falls short of EIS aspirations. The continued austerity measures of the UK government have created a situation where an offer of 2.5% over two years is the most that Cosla, as the employers' side, was prepared to offer.
"However, the non-pay elements of the offer, including a commitment to address supply teaching issues, an agreed set of principles and action on managing teacher workload and, crucially, a separate commitment from the Scottish government on maintaining teacher numbers in year two of the deal, offer more positive developments which establish the basis for a potentially workable agreement.
"However, should members vote to reject the offer then the question of industrial action will be considered."
Teachers are employed by councils but pay and conditions are agreed nationally.
The offer also covers teachers employed by councils, including Glasgow, which are no longer members of the council umbrella body Cosla.
SSTA General Secretary Seamus Searson said: "Teachers have been getting Curriculum for Excellence into classrooms over the last eight years. Throughout this time they have seen the real value of their salaries reduced. Teachers have toiled to introduce a new range of experiences and outcomes in S1 to S3.
"For the last three years they have been putting a huge amount of their own time into new S4 to S6 qualifications. There is more assessment than ever. Attainment levels are rising. Record numbers of youngsters passed their Higher exams this year. It is disappointing that the value of teachers is not properly recognised."
Cosla spokesman Billy Hendry said: "It has been a long and protracted negotiation on the different elements of the teachers' pay and conditions claim but we got there in the end.
"I am delighted that we have reached an agreement and that the teaching unions will make a recommendation to accept the Cosla pay offer.
"We value each and every member of the local government workforce, no less so our teachers who are doing a great job delivering high quality education to children and young people across the length and breadth of Scotland."
