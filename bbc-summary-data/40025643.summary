Graeme Shinnie will lead Aberdeen out for Saturday's Scottish Cup final and insists there is no ill-feeling between him and deposed captain Ryan Jack.

Midfielder Jack will leave the Dons under freedom of contract following the meeting with Celtic at Hampden.
"I've got a great relationship with Jacko," said Shinnie. We will be fighting for each other. We'll be doing everything we can to win.
"We've got a great team spirit here and it's all about the team."
Jack, who has been heavily linked with Rangers, returned to action as a half-time substitute in Sunday's 6-0 win at Partick Thistle after recovering from a groin operation at the start of this month.
"Speculation is speculation," added Shinnie. "We've got a cup final here and that is what we're focused on. This is what we all want to do.
"There's a Scottish Cup to be won, a winners' medal to be claimed, so that's the only thing that matters."
Shinnie, who skippered Inverness Caley Thistle to their Scottish Cup triumph two year ago, now has the chance to repeat the feat.
"It's a big honour but it's not going to change the way that I play," said the 25-year-old.
"The same can be said of Jacko if we both play.
"We will both do the same things that we have done all season. It's all about the team. The team is desperate to win this.
"The players, the management and everyone else at this club are just focused on trying to win this game."
Jack, also 25, was made captain at the start of last season, having made his club debut in 2010.
Last week, manager Derek McInnes confirmed the midfielder's departure but said that no club has made an official approach for the player.
McInnes had previously said Jack offered him assurances that he would not be moving to Premiership rivals Rangers.
