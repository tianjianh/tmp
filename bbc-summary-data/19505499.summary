Creative Director Xanthe Hamilton said they would stage a smaller gala screening in November when plans for the fifth Branchage would be unveiled.
Miss Hamiliton said they plan to make next year's festival bigger and better.
She said there would be more community involvement and other arts events including comedy, theatre and poetry.
Branchage is a mixed media festival with screenings and performances at venues across the island from castles and barns to theatres and cinemas.
Miss Hamilton said: "Whilst I understand that many local filmmakers and film enthusiasts may be disappointed that Branchage won't be taking place in all its glory this year, I'm confident that the 'interim' events we have planned for November are going to be really special and unmissable for Jersey's film fans.
"When people see what we have planned for 2013, they'll hopefully agree with us that it'll be worth the wait."
