Wales flanker Justin Tipuric says Ospreys need to be "on the money" for their European Challenge Cup quarter-final against Stade Francais.

Despite 51 Wales caps and a Test appearance for the British and Irish Lions, Tipuric has never played in a European knockout match.
"It was something I always wanted to do with the Ospreys," he said.
The 27-year-old was still an academy player when Ospreys lost 29-28 away to Biarritz in the 2010 European Cup.
Tipuric added: "I was more of a fourth or fifth choice number seven then but it was good being there as part of the academy and being part of the Ospreys.
"After seeing the boys playing in the quarter-finals, in big games, in big stadiums, you want to go that step further."
This year is the first time the Ospreys have competed in the Challenge Cup after failing to qualify for the top-tier Champions Cup.
The Swansea region took a maximum of 30 points from the pool stages to earn a home draw in the quarter-final.
But the match has been moved from Swansea's Liberty Stadium to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff because of a fixture clash with Swansea City, who play Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Sunday.
Tipuric hopes the crowd will still give them an edge.
"It's a big stadium and if we fill it with fans the noise could make a massive difference for us," he said.
"[Stade Francais] are powerful, big, and full of big names.
"It's going to be a tough game. They're very good set-piece wise and they've got those x-factor backs out wide as well.
"So it's definitely going to be the toughest game we've had in the Challenge Cup and we'll need to make sure we're on the money."
