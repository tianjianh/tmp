The promotion-chasing League One side side have brought in the former England Under-19 captain on an initial two-month youth loan.
Morris, 19, who started the campaign in the Midlands on loan at Coventry City, previously worked with Saddlers boss Sean O'Driscoll while on England duty.
"I've worked with Sean before. He's got a really good philosophy," said Morris.
"I loved playing for him and we had some really good results with England. He said it's the club's philosophy to give young players a chance.
"So that's good for me and shows young players that there is a pathway through the system."
Morris is Walsall's first signing of the January window and, other than on-loan midfielder George Evans' return to Manchester City, prior to being sold to Reading, the Saddlers have not yet had to let any players go.
O'Driscoll's side stand third in League One, four points off top spot.
Hartlepool-born midfielder Bryn Morris progressed through the ranks to sign professional forms in 2013, after joining Middlesbrough's Academy at the age of seven.
Despite joining the club in time for this weekend's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Reading, Morris is cup-tied, having played in the competition for York City, where he also spent a month in October.
Morris has made three Boro substitute appearances, since being handed his debut by Tony Mowbray, now Coventry's boss, as a 16-year-old. He has made 11 appearances this season; seven for Coventry, four at York.
He also made five appearances on loan to League Two champions Burton Albion last season.
