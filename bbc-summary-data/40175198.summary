Class A drugs and a machete were seized after more than 100 police officers carried out dawn raids.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine people aged between 18 and 53 were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply - or intent to supply - Class A drugs in Reading.
Tuesday's raids at 12 addresses were targeted at individuals suspected of supplying drugs in the town and taking part in activity "across county lines".
Thames Valley Police said it was part of a campaign against organised crime.
The raids were "the result of a short, pro-active investigation" into drug dealing, the force said.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, and a further five men and a woman are in custody on suspicion of intent to supply Class A drugs.
