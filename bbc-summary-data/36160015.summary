[SN]TITLE[SN]
Planning permission granted for Ireland's national children's hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning permission has been granted for a new national children's hospital in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The planning board, An Bord Pleanála, granted permission, subject to 17 conditions.
The project had been mired in controversy, with objectors concerned about access and public transport links to the site.
Construction is expected to start this summer with the hospital opening in 2020.
The project, costing 650m euros (£460m) is the Republic of Ireland's largest ever single investment in healthcare.
Critical care
Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin and the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght will be merged into one, with all the paediatric specialists working under one roof. .
The hospital will include 380 single rooms, 42 critical care beds and 18 units for neonatal critical care.
An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission in 2012, saying the development would be "a dominant, visually incongruous structure".
It also said the hospital "would have a profound negative impact on the appearance and visual amenity of the city skyline".
Chief executive Eilísh Hardiman of the Children's Hospital Group told RTE that the  granting of planning permission marked a "fantastic day and a great day for children".
