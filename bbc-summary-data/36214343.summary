[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey paying more for Jersey's weather services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The States of Guernsey is now paying more for getting its weather services from Jersey despite talks about the contract being cancelled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2013 the Environment Department was considering ending the contract because Jersey Met wanted more money.
But now a five-year contract has been signed with the cost rising by 12.5%.
The cost is about Â£350,000, which includes a separate contract for specialist aviation forecast services.
The contract between Guernsey's government and Jersey Met had previously not gone up since 2004.
When the Met Office said the fee was no longer sufficient, the Environment Department held talks with the rest of Guernsey's States as to whether the contract should continue given the higher cost.
Jersey Met provides weather forecasts for all of the Channel Islands.
The new fixed price contract for five years between Guernsey and Jersey Met is subject to an inflation increase of 2.5% per year.
Principal Meteorological Officer in Jersey, John Searson, said: "If inflation or cost of living is low, our island is better off. If it is higher Guernsey does much better."
He said that Jersey Met was now providing a better service to Guernsey.
