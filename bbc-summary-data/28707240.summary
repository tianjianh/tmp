The 350m long trench, which has been built to the specifications and manuals of the Irish Guards and used by the Royal Irish Fusiliers at the Battle of the Somme 1916, opened at the museum on the centenary of the moment war was declared by Great Britain on 4 August 1914.
Not only can visitors see what the trenches would have looked like but they can be fully educated on what life was like through sound and visual effects.
The sleeping quarters of the trenches includes maps and pictures of family at home and signs warning of the risk of being hit and barbed wire represents "no-man's land".
Savina Donohoe, the curator of the museum, said the Cavan Peace Partnership had made a commitment to carry out a number of things to commemorate those who died in World War One.
She said these included a Roll of Honour, a statue and a "permanent structure dedicated for the education purposes of people who would visit".
Historian Dr Michael Finnegan said the experience was "pretty authentic" and that there was definitely more of an interest in those who fought in WW1.
"At the moment people seem more open to start to explore exactly why it was that so many people from the nationalist and the unionist perspective could have fought together in the first World War", he said.
The trench forms part of a wider exhibition including a permanent World War One gallery at the Cavan Museum.
