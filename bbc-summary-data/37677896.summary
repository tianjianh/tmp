Healthcare Improvement Scotland said it was pleased with changes at Stranraer's Galloway Community Hospital.
It found proper screening taking place and good communication between staff.
Last year NHS Dumfries and Galloway apologised for being "unable to demonstrate best standards of care" at the hospital.
The latest inspection visit took place in August this year and was a follow-up to a visit in January which also found improvement.
Claire Sweeney, interim director of quality assurance for HIS, said: "Overall, we were pleased with the progress that had been made.
"We found that screening for delirium was taking place and there was evidence of good communication between staff through daily hospital-wide huddles.
"To bring about further improvements, NHS Dumfries and Galloway must ensure all older people are assessed within the national recommended timescales and have person-centred care plans in place."
She said they would follow up on these issues at future inspections.
