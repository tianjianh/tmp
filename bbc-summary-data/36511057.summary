Officers found 53-year-old Andrena Douglas dead in her home in Stewarton, at about 06:20 on Thursday.
They had gone there to tell her that her partner had been seriously injured following a fire at nearby Peacockbank Farm, Stewarton, at about 05:15.
Ms Douglas's partner is seriously ill and had been unable to speak to police.
Det Insp Martin Fergus said: "What we need to do is establish what happened between 2000 hours on Wednesday 8 June when Ms Douglas was last seen and 0600 hours on Thursday morning (9 June) when she was found.
"To this end, I would appeal to anyone who was in the area, who may have seen any suspicious activity - whether that be a vehicle or someone on foot in the area - to contact police."
He added: "How and why the fire started has still to be established and a joint investigation between police and Scottish Fire and Rescue is under way."
He urged anyone with information to contact police or Crimestoppers.
