[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will meet US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken on the third day of her trip to the United States.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her appointment with America's second most senior diplomat will take place in Washington.
Former first minister Alex Salmond met Hilary Clinton when she was secretary of state in 2009.
Ms Sturgeon is also due to address an audience at the World Bank with a speech about economic equality.
The US trip has consisted of visits to schools and an appearance on one of American television's top chat shows, The Daily Show, hosted by Jon Stewart.
Ms Sturgeon followed in the footsteps of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown by making an appearance on the late-night programme, although the former Labour leaders were interviewed after they left office.
On the first day of her visit, the first minister went to the Daniel Hale Williams elementary school in Brooklyn in the hope of learning lessons from the New York education system on improving attainment in Scottish schools.
Ms Sturgeon also hosted a reception in the United States to thank supporters of the fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art (GSA).
The event in New York's Lincoln Centre Plaza was attended by 200 guests, including GSA alumni and expatriates.
They were told of plans to restore the Grade A-listed art nouveau Mackintosh building that was badly damaged in the blaze on 23 May 2014.
