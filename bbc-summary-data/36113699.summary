The event, which will take place on 21 September at the SSE Hydro, will feature both singles and doubles matches.
Former Wimbledon and US Open Champion and current Olympic gold medal holder Andy will play against Gael Monfils from France in the Singles.
In the Doubles, Andy and his brother Jamie will take on Monfils and Henman.
Profits from the playoff, called Andy Murray Live, will go to local Glasgow children's charity Young People's Futures and Unicef, of which Murray is a UK Ambassador.
Andy said:  "It's great to be returning home to Scotland. I travel the world playing tennis and unfortunately I don't spend as much time as I would like to at home. I owe it to my fans who have supported me throughout the years.
"I'm looking forward to bringing top-level tennis to Glasgow on an annual basis and making this event bigger and better every year."
Young People's Futures, based in north Glasgow gives children and young people aged 5-18 years access to weekly activities as well as providing family support, education, employment advice and health and wellbeing programmes.
Spokeswoman Ann Lawrance said: "We are overwhelmed. Our team are so excited.
"We can't thank Andy enough for his support and look forward to what could be a life changing prospect for YPF and the Possilpark community."
The move is the latest high profile venture outside of championship tennis by Andy, who also owns a hotel. He was reported recently to have hit out at claims by former British Number 1 Annabel Croft that fatherhood had affected his form.
