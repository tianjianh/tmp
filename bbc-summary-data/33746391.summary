Crowds gathered outside St Michael's Roman Catholic Church in Elswick, to catch a glimpse of celebrities arriving at the star-studded Geordie wedding.
The TV presenter's brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, conducted the ceremony, and Dec's TV partner Ant McPartlin was the best man.
Wearing matching blue suits, the pair posed for fans outside the church.
In a tweet to fans earlier, the groom joked: "Morning! I know I've got somewhere to be today but I can't for the life of me remember where....D".
Guests at the 39-year-old's Saturday Night Takeaway presenter's big day included some of the Geordie glitterati, among them ex-Newcastle United footballers Peter Beardsley and Alan Shearer.
Presenters Tess Daly, Fearne Cotton and comedian Keith Lemon were also guests at the wedding.
Donnelly and Astall got engaged in November on an island off the coast of Australia, before travelling to the set of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! for the latest series.
In an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show earlier this year, Donnelly said he proposed as the sun set.
He admitted it was "a little strange" when the couple first got together because they had been colleagues for so long, but added: "It's going good. Everything's hunky-dory."
Donnelly was best man at his on-screen partner's 2006 wedding to make-up artist Lisa Armstrong and McPartlin said he was looking forward to returning the favour.
The celebrity pair first first found fame in teenage BBC drama Byker Grove.
