Celtic fined £13,000 for fireworks and indiscipline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have been fined £13,000 after poor behaviour by their supporters and player indiscipline in their Europa League match against Fenerbahce.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish champions had been charged after fans set off fireworks during the 1-1 draw in Group A at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul on 10 December.
Uefa's disciplinary body also charged the club with improper conduct after five players were booked.
Celtic finished bottom of the group and without a win in their six matches.
It is the third match in a calendar year - and the eighth in five years - that has resulted in the Glasgow club being fined by European football's governing body.
Last season, they were disciplined for crowd disturbances against Dinamo Zagreb and then for supporters setting off flares, as well as player indiscipline, against Inter Milan.
Celtic issued indefinite bans to two supporters following the incidents in Turkey and revealed in December that they were considering legal action against individual fans.
Five fans were arrested this month in connection with complaints of sectarian singing during Celtic's Scottish Cup win away to Stranraer.
The Scottish FA has written to both clubs and continues to investigate.
