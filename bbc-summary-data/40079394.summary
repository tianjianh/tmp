[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohanna Abdhou was shot in Malvern Road, Kilburn, on Friday night and died at the scene.
Post-mortem tests gave the cause of death as a single gunshot wound.
Police believe the 20-year-old, known as Montana, was standing with a group when they were approached by "two males" on bicycles who fired "a number of shots at the group".
A police spokesman said: "It was still daylight when this attack took place and the location is very near a school playground.
"This was a cowardly attack on a young woman who was out enjoying the warm weather in the company of her friends."
The two suspects have both been described as being of medium build and dressed all in dark clothing.
The force said their faces were covered, which "would have made them stand out on such a warm evening".
