Back row forward Ed Jackson has agreed a contract extension with Newport Gwent Dragons.

The deal will keep the number eight in Newport until 2019 and comes the day before his 28th birthday.
Jackson has made more than 30 appearances since joining from Wasps.
"Originally my thoughts were to look to move back into the Aviva Premiership afterwards, but since joining I have enjoyed it a lot more than I first anticipated," said Jackson.
"It feels like there is a proper rugby community in Gwent, which is very infectious and I have really enjoyed that aspect of it."
Jackson arrived from Wasps in the summer of 2015 and says he turned down a potential move back to the English top-flight to stay at Rodney Parade.
"This year I had the opportunity to go back and play in the Aviva Premiership, but when [head coach] Kingsley [Jones] mentioned that he would like me to stay it didn't take much consideration," he added.
"I am enjoying myself on and off the pitch and I believe that the region are moving in the right direction."
Jones added: "I had the opportunity to work closely with Ed before he joined the Dragons, and he has continued to impress me with his intelligence and skill set.
"He has earned his new contract with some outstanding performances, and what pleases me most is his belief in what we are trying to build here and how positively we're progressing."
