[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumbarton 0-3 Ayr United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Alan Forrest hat-trick was enough to give all three points to Ayr United and take them seven points clear of bottom side St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It only took three minutes for this match when Forrest buried the rebound after Gary Harkins forced a save from Dumbarton goalkeeper Alan Martin.
Harkins was again instrumental in the second goal, teeing up Forrest for an easy finish.
And Forrest made it three from the penalty spot.
Harkins could have had one himself; driving the ball towards goal from distance, but there was too much on the strike and it flew over the bar.
Dumbarton finally showed up in the 18th minute. Greg Fleming had to punch clear in the Ayr goal, it then fell to Josh Todd, but his shot from 20 yards took a deflection on its way over.
There were calls for a penalty by the United camp before the end of the first half, but it looked as though Mark Docherty timed his challenge on Nicky Devlin as he burst into the area.
It was another early goal in the second half and another gift from Dumbarton. Alan Martin lost out to Harkins in the box, the keeper committed and lost, then Harkins squared to Forrest who couldn't miss for his second.
Ayr wrapped up the points from the penalty spot when Devlin was brought down in the box by Daniel Harvie, and Forrest stepped up and secured his hat-trick.
Ayr United move five points clear of Dumbarton and seven clear of St Mirren who are rooted to the bottom of the Championship table.
