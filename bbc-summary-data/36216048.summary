American football star Johnny Manziel has made his first court appearance in Dallas, a day after posting bail on charges of domestic violence.

The 23-year-old is accused of hitting and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley during a night out in January.
A judge has ordered the former Cleveland Browns quarterback not to have contact with Ms Crowley.
His attorney says he "looks forward to defending himself".
Last month, the player was indicted on a charge of misdemeanour assault. If convicted, he faces up to a year in prison and a $4,000 (Â£2,750) fine.
Mr Manziel reported to a Dallas-area jail for booking and a mug shot on Wednesday. He posted a $1,500 (Â£1030) bail, the Dallas Morning News reported.
Afterwards, he tweeted: "Just thankful I had a shirt this time..." The message has been deleted.
He was apparently referring to his first arrest, in 2012, when he was charged for carrying fake identification and disorderly conduct. He was shirtless in his mug shot.
In the brief court session on Thursday, judge Roberto Canas barred him from possessing firearms and from any form of contact with Ms Crowley.
"You can't call her, can't text her, can't email her, can't send her any letters or go to where she's at," the judge said.
Mr Manziel did not answer reporters' questions following the court session.
In a statement quoted by ABC News, his lead attorney said: "Johnny has, over the last 24 hours, fulfilled all the current requirements of the court. He looks forward to defending himself against the misdemeanour allegation and focusing on the next phases of his life, both personally and professionally."
A video posted on Twitter apparently showed the player flipping off as he had his hands behind his back. The moment was caught by cameras which were broadcasting the session.
Ms Crowley, 23, accused her former partner of hitting her so hard she lost her hearing, according to the indictment..
The Browns dropped him from the team after poor play on the field and bad headlines off.
Despite his success in college football, Mr Manziel - nicknamed "Johnny Football" - has struggled with substance abuse and has had a spell in a rehabilitation centre
