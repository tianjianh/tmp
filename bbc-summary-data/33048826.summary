Eric and Carol Ruddy murders: Son 'staged burglary'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his parents at their Newcastle home said they were attacked by intruders who also injured him, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eric Ruddy, 64, and his wife Carol, 54, were found dying in their Elswick home in December. He had been stabbed and beaten, she had been strangled.
Their 28-year-old son, Martin Ruddy, denies two counts of murder.
The prosecution at Newcastle Crown Court said he staged a burglary and injured himself to cover up his tracks.
Mr Ruddy told police that he had been watching television with his parents when two or three men had forced their way into the property in Bentinck Street.
However, the court heard that his life was "spiralling out of control", with mounting debts.
He was also the sole beneficiary of his parents' will and stood to benefit from their savings of more than Â£80,000.
The trial continues.
