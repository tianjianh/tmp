New fundraising complaints line and website goes live

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new phone number and website set up to protect the public against aggressive fundraisers has gone live.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will allow members of the public to make complaints about the conduct of Scotland's charities
The new measure was recommended by the Fundraising Working Group in Scotland.
The Scottish government said it was important confidence was maintained in the country's charities, but stressed that the majority operated to high standards.
Communities Secretary Angela Constance said: "Scotland's charities benefit from a great deal of public trust and it's important that that confidence is maintained.
"This new phone number and website will be run by Scottish Fundraising Complaints - set up by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Scottish Charity Regulator - and will give people information about how to raise any concerns they may have."
Members of the public who are concerned about the fundraising tactics of a charity in Scotland can call 0808 164 2520 or visit the website.
Cross-border charities, where charities operate in Scotland but are registered in England and Wales, will continue to be regulated by the Fundraising Regulator.
