The Reverend Irene Wilson was leaving Holy Trinity Church at about 13:30 BST on Sunday when the robbery took place.
Humberside Police said following a search involving the force's helicopter two teenagers aged 16 and 13 "were arrested a short time later".
The grandmother of four was "unhurt" but "very, very shaken", according to Canon Neil Barnes.
The teenage boys denied a charge of robbery during an appearance before Hull and Holderness Youth Court.
They were remanded to youth detention centre and will appear in court again later this month.
The court heard that as well as having her car stolen, Rev Wilson's handbag containing Â£250 in cash and a laptop computer were taken.
Canon Barnes, who is also a vicar at Holy Trinity, said: "Thankfully she is safe. She's with family and we obviously continue to pray for her.
"She is very much a community person and the church has rallied round."
