Queues formed as the five-year wait to see the complex above the newly renovated New Street rail station came to an end.
Shoppers took in the largest John Lewis outside of London, but not all retailers were ready to open on time.
Centre management said those stores would open their doors "very shortly".
Centre manager Jonathan Cheetham said: "Some of [the shops] haven't managed to get over the line by today but very, very shortly they will be opening.
"It's a disappointment for some of those businesses but they are doing the very best they can to get into Grand Central as quickly as they can."
He said some of the businesses in Grand Central were local independents and the centre had given Birmingham the shopping experience it deserved.
Conrad Francis and Anthea Larkins travelled from Lichfield for the opening.
"We came into Birmingham on Monday and saw that the station had reopened so we thought we'd come into today for the opening.
"It all looks great. It's come together now and all makes sense."
Navneet Kang from Birmingham said: "I just wanted to have a look around really. I think it's going to be quite popular here and good if you're on the train. I think more people will come to the city because of what's here.
"I'm amazed they've finished it all though."
Pauline and Frank Kelly from Chesterfield travelled to Birmingham for the opening.
"We've watched Birmingham change all through the years from our college days until now and it's just what Birmingham needs.
"It's my favourite place to shop outside of London and this is fantastic. The city is much better than Manchester and it deserves this. It is the second city. I'm a big fan," said Mrs Kelly.
