The money will see the repair and re-use of up to 30 buildings within the city's conservation area.
The buildings have not yet been identified but Upper English Street and Russell Street are among the areas set to benefit from the funding.
HLF said the five-year project will create 20 jobs and five new businesses.
They added it will also secure a further 10 jobs and four existing businesses.
Support was awarded through the fund's Townscape Heritage (TH) programme.
Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Darryn Causby, has welcomed the award.
"This will enable us to build on the excellent work already completed in the city," he said.
"Armagh has a rich built heritage and the funding will help restore and enhance this culture for future generations."
Paul Mullan of HLF said the plans would "play an important role in regenerating the city's commercial core, restoring its economic heart and opening up its unique heritage for both local people and visitors to enjoy".
