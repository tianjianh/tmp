Appeal after snake found in outdoor shed in Newport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An injured snake has been found in a shed in Newport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RSPCA Cymru said the 4ft (1.2m) long boa constrictor was in the shed down an alley of Bassaleg Road on Sunday.
It is thought it escaped from somewhere and was attacked by another animal as it has a broken jaw and a puncture.
The RSPCA is appealing for its owner to come forward.
