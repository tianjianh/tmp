Gwent Police deployed trained negotiators to a property at Buxton Court, Lansbury Park on Thursday at 15:45 BST because the man was threatening to harm himself.
Power supplies to the area were cut off to around 60 homes until the incident ended peacefully at about 23:30 BST.
The man handed himself over to police and has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent and criminal damage.
Neighbours at the scene told BBC Wales that a man, believed to be in his 30s, lived in a flat on the complex and was seen throwing items out of the building.
A spokesman for Gwent Police said: "Due to the risk of fire at that property and adjoining properties we had to stop gas and electricity in the area which affected about 60 properties.
"Our officers visited those affected to explain what is happening and to thank them for their patience."
South Wales Fire and Rescue, about six police cars and vans, a police dog and paramedics were also at the scene.
