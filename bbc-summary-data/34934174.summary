[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's chief constable is to become the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA), which tackles serious and organised crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lynne Owens will replace the NCA's first director general, Keith Bristow, who leaves the post in January.
The NCA took over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2013.
Home Secretary Theresa May said Ms Owens was the best candidate to continue its work to tackle the full range of serious and organised crime.
Ms Owens, who was previously the Met Police assistant commissioner in charge of public order, moved to Surrey in 2012.
She said the NCA would need to continue to build its capabilities in the face of changing threats to the UK.
"Whether it be stemming the availability of illegal firearms, the fight against organised immigration crime, the threat presented by those who abuse children or the growth in cyber and economic crime, the work required is significant," she said.
She said it had been an "absolute privilege" to be chief constable of Surrey.
Mrs May said under Mr Bristow's leadership the NCA had re-shaped the UK's response to serious and organised crime.
"He has been at the forefront of the law enforcement community, leading and co-ordinating the UK's effort to tackle the most dangerous individuals and criminal groups," she said.
