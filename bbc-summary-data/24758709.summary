The 30-year-old, who has joined until 29 January, has only played four games for the Black Cats this season.
But he has made a further four appearances for his country.
Vaughan has not featured in either of the games under new manager Gus Poyet and last appeared for Sunderland in the loss away at Arsenal in mid-September.
He began his career with Crewe Alexandra and had a short spell in Spain with Real Sociedad, before returning to England with Blackpool and then joining Sunderland in 2011.
