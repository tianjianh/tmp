The attacks escalated during school holidays.
Every day about eight post men and woman are attacked by a dog in the UK, the company said.
Royal Mail has launched its annual Dog Awareness Week running from Monday 29 June, in an effort to curb such attacks.
The company said dog attacks were "a significant hazard" for post men and women.
In Northern Ireland, the number of attacks between April 2014 and 2015 was the same as in the previous year.
