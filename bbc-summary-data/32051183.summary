The organisations will gain some £4.8m in top-up grants in 2015-16.
This is the first time they have been eligible for a share of the government's £25m voluntary and community sector grants.
Young Minds chief executive Sarah Brennan said the windfall would help it provide "a vital lifeline" to families.

"There must be no trade-off between learning about mental health and academic success.
"By improving teaching on this subject, we will help young people make sense of mental-health issues and teach them how to keep themselves and others healthy."
Overall some 94 organisations will receive grants for projects, including:
The grants would supplement existing government funding, the Department for Education said.
