[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cian Healy: Leinster prop's citing hearing to take place on Thursday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster prop Cian Healy will have his citing complaint for an incident in a Champions Cup defeat by Toulon on 13 December reheard in London on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Healy is alleged to have struck Toulon's Guilhem Guirado with his knee.
The initial striking charge was found to be not proven but the incident was deemed to be foul play and he was banned for two weeks.
Healy won his appeal against the ban but an independent committee decided the citing complaint should be reheard.
Leinster had argued that Healy was cited for one offence yet suspended for another.
The 28-year-old was cleared by organisers European Professional Club Rugby to play in the return fixture, won 20-16 by Toulon in Dublin on 19 December.
Welsh judicial officer Roger Morris amended the charge to "dangerous charging or obstructing or grabbing of an opponent without the ball, including shouldering", in breach of World Rugby's regulations.
The decision that the complaint should be reheard by a different judicial officer from the original disciplinary hearing was made by an independent appeal committee on 23 December.
Jeremy Summers has been appointed as the independent judicial officer for the new hearing.
