The yellow "be aware" warning forecasts winds gusting to up to 60mph and, in exposed places, up to 65mph from between 07:00 to 18:00.
The Met Office said the public should be aware of the potential for some travel disruption.
Earlier this month, winds gusting to 90mph affected power supplies to 14,000 properties and travel.
In the latest warning, the Met Office said: "Winds will strengthen during Saturday morning to bring gales to many locations.
"The swathe of strongest winds will start in the southwest of the warning region during the early morning before transferring northeast wards through the day."
