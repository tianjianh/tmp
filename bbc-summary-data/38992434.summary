Aberdeenshire Council officials raise new Aberdeen FC stadium concerns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Officials at Aberdeenshire Council have raised concerns over the impact of Aberdeen FC's proposed new stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
Although the planning application is a matter for Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire is a statutory consultee.
A report to councillors next week says there are a number of issues which have not been fully addressed.
However, it says the stadium development could bring significant benefits to the area.
The ground would have a capacity of 20,000. The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future.
There has been some local protest to the plans.
