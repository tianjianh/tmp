Radcliffe was named best actor in a play for his role in Martin McDonagh's The Cripple of Inishmaan, which opens on Broadway in April.
Grint took the newcomer of the year award for his West End debut in the revival of Jez Butterworth's Mojo.
The awards, voted for by the public, were handed out at a ceremony at London's Prince of Wales Theatre.
It is the second WhatsOnStage award for Radcliffe, who previously won Grint's prize in 2008 for his role in Equus.
"I am deeply honoured to receive this prestigious award and I accept it on behalf of the whole cast who together helped make this production... a truly joyous experience for me as an actor," Radcliffe said.
He also thanked Michael Grandage for his "inspirational direction".
The inaugural season of Grandage's new company was a big winner on the night, picking up four awards in total.
As well as Radcliffe's award, David Walliams won the best supporting actor prize for his role in A Midsummer Night's Dream, while the play itself won best Shakespearean production.
Grandage was also named best director for his five-play season.
The Book of Mormon was the other big winner, also collecting four awards and dominating the musical categories.
It beat competition from the likes of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Once to be crowned best new musical.
It also won three out of the four acting prizes, with Gavin Creel named best actor in a musical, Stephen Ashfield winning best supporting actor in a musical and Alexia Khadime best supporting actress in a musical.
Scarlett Strallen's role in A Chorus Line earned her the best actress in a musical honour. The production also won best ensemble performance.
Peter Morgan's The Audience picked up best new play with Dame Helen Mirren awarded best actress in a play for her role as the Queen.
Unable to attend the ceremony, Dame Helen said in a filmed acceptance speech: "I'm so thrilled to receive this. I'm honoured that it was voted for by the public, that's the most wonderful thing."
Haydn Gwynne also won best supporting actress in a play for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in Morgan's production.
Barry Humphries - better known for his alter ego, Dame Edna Everage - collected the best solo performance award for his Eat Pray Laugh! farewell tour at the London Palladium.
Matilda the Musical fought off strong competition from Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera, War Horse and Wicked to be voted best West End show.
