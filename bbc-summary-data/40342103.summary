[SN]TITLE[SN]
Marian Brown soldiers 'thought they were being shot at'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who survived a gun attack that claimed the life of a pregnant teenager in 1972 says a soldier told him at the scene that the Army thought he had shot at them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marian Brown, 17, was killed and several other people were injured in the incident in west Belfast.
Michael McGuigan, then 19, was a student and part-time bar man.
He was walking along Roden Street in the city with his girlfriend and a colleague when the shooting started.
He told an inquest on Tuesday that he remembered lying on the ground and seeing bullets peppering the street around him.
His two friends were wounded and he saw the silhouettes of men with guns - who he believed were soldiers - running in a line down the street.
Later, when he tried to get into the ambulance with his two friends, a soldier with a rifle stopped him.
Mr McGuigan said the soldier sounded apologetic when he told him: "We thought you were shooting at us".
The inquest continues.
