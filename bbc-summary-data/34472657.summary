Pacquiao, who lost to Floyd Mayweather in his last fight, wants to run for a seat in the Philippines senate in 2016.
Britain's Amir Khan is one potential opponent for 36-year-old Pacquiao, with American Terence Crawford among the other contenders.
"I think I'm ready. I've been in boxing for more than 20 years," the six-weight world champion told ANC.
"If you are a senator, your focus should only be your job and your family.
"I will have to give up the other things that require my attention."
Pacquiao said he "cannot say" whether his last fight would be a rematch against Mayweather, with the American having pledged to retire after his defeat of Andre Berto.
The Filipino, who underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff after the fight against Mayweather, boasts a fight record of 57 wins, six losses and two draws.
