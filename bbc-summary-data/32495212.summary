The business of Cannes: Part 1

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The lights, the cameras, the glamour - the Cannes Film Festival certainly has its share of those.

But alongside the red carpet on the famous Palais des Festivals on the Croisette is the the Marche du Film, a bustling movie market where producers, distributors and investors are all trying to find or fund the next big thing.
Among them are British producers Rachel Richardson-Jones and Daisy Allsop.
Both women have been selected by Creative England as part of its Market Trader programme, aimed at giving film producers, distributors and sales agents at the start of their careers a better understanding of international markets.
But with hundreds of producers all camped out and hoping for the same thing, what do they expect will be the challenges facing them?
Richardson-Jones is a film producer and co-founder at Not A Number Productions and, prior to entering the world of feature films, directed and produced corporate videos and commercials.
She produced horror films Splintered in 2010 and White Settlers in 2014 and is meeting with sales agents for her third film, Dearly Beheaded, which is due to start shooting this in September.
The corporate stuff has stood me in good stead for features. My last two movies I raised through private equity. You need to be able to understand the corporate culture and how SEIS works. I wouldn't have imagined being a corporate producer had so much continuity with film producing.
Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) - Investors can invest up to £100,000 a year and for every £10,000 invested under SEIS, will get £5,000 tax relief or 50% back.
There are the horrors of the corporate world, making high end films about fork lift trucks! When Simeon (film director Simeon Halligan), approached me with an idea for a low budget horror,  I didn't really know anything about the genre. But I thought, that kind of stuff sells.
I was so lucky to have been mentored by Tony Parsons (producer of films including Scum and Gregory's Girl) and I asked him whether I should go for it and, in the end, he offered to executive produce and said he would teach us everything there was to know about film producing.
Sadly, he died before we finished producing Splintered (2010), so both Simeon and I knew about production but it was after-production which was where we missed him so very much. So there we were, we had this movie and didn't know the world of sales and distribution.
We didn't have UK distribution so we decided to put on on an event, just us and a few filmmakers of low budget movies. and before we knew it, it wasn't one day with three or four films, it was three days with 27 films and Grimm Up North was born and we're now in its seventh year.
Sim loves the genre and we've now built an audience - I'm more of a sci-fi geek. I'm dying to make a pure sci-fi movie but they take bigger budgets
We're actually just about close finance on that, and hope to start shooting in September. So we are talking to sales agents (who market films and help find international distribution) but with Cannes around the corner they are all very busy.
I'm going to be doing some meetings about a monster movie bank heist, primarily with American sales and financiers because it really lends itself to being an American-set movie. I've been sending emails about meeting with production partners, there are a couple of studio people I met at the Berlin Film Festival and I'll reconnect with them.
The industry people spend the first four or five days seeing who they are there to see, they are there to buy and sell. So you coming along with your little project, its very difficult to get time with them, to sit down and have a proper conversation. It's always good to have meetings planned and have time to shift them if you need to.
Also the parties, they do help in bumping into people and catching up. We have another Manchester-based project called Habit. It's a novella by the writer Stephen McGeagh.
Simeon has just adapted it in to a screenplay so we are going to start talking about that project. It's a fantastic gritty, kitchen sink horror.
Allsop began her career in 2000 in development and distribution. She helped launch the film arm of Feel Films in 2004.
As head of development for Feel she managed a slate of literary adaptations through development, production and distribution, including the upcoming BBC series adaptation of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.
She was also associate producer on Skellig starring Tim Roth and is now producing with director David Leon through their company Zeitgeist Films.
This is my 13th Cannes Film Festival, I've been every year since university. I used to go in my capacity as development and acquisitions sales agent. That was a different kind of Cannes where I was in the office all day taking meetings every half hour with producers pitching their ideas, and now I'm on the other side.
Absolutely. Working for a sales agent gives you a view on the whole market. Firstly, it was good training right from the beginning of my career on how films get made, and the market value of a film. Sometimes the quality of a script is not enough. It's also about whether the budget matches the elements attached. It also taught me to work out the producers who get their films made are the ones that are smart about aiming it for the right budget and with its destination audience in mind.
Yes, there are so many people in Cannes doing so many different things at different levels. People do come year after year and don't get films made, but then maybe they do once they've had time to mould them and make it work. Sometimes it can take a long time. I've been coming as a producer for about three years.
You tailor your trip to Cannes for whatever stage you are at with your project. Sometimes you have a finished film and you want to find a sales agent. Last year, I had a film that was almost finished called Orthodox, directed by David Leon and starring Stephen Graham and Michael Smiley. It was David's first feature and now I produce him and we have a company. We've developed his second feature - no-one has seen the script yet, it is hot off the press. I will be coming to meet with sales agents and potential financiers about that. It's called The Albatross - we'll be partly shooting it in north-east Yorkshire and partly Newcastle and it's about a trawlerman who becomes a reluctant father figure to a young migrant girl.
It's really full on. I've also got another project called Tell it to the Bees, which is an adaptation of a novel which I've developed with the BFI which is slightly bigger budget, around the £5m mark. The script just finished and I'll be starting conversations around that. So with both projects at an early stage, planning Cannes has been about planning how I am going to finance these films. It's coming up with a whole strategy.
Other festivals are catching up slowly with markets. They are dotted throughout the year, but Cannes is the one time you really know everybody. People tend to use it to meet people from other countries. The other thing is just keeping up with people and telling friends what you're up to. But ultimately it's a market - sales agents are there to sell films they've already got so indie producers coming in and saying, 'Can I have a meeting is a low priority' for them. It can be difficult to get  half an hour unless you know who you want which is important so you don't waste the wrong people's time.
It can feel quite big and unwieldy, it takes a few times of going to get a sense of the place and what you're doing.
We'll be catching up with both Daisy Allsop and Rachel Richardson-Jones later in the festival.
