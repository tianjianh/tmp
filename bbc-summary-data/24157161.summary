Kathryn Blair, 25, was targeted as she walked down a street in Marylebone with her boyfriend and a group of friends.
The Metropolitan Police said an incident involving two male suspects with a gun happened in Ivor Place at 20:30 BST on Monday.
A firearm was "seen" but "not used" and "none of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen", police said.
No arrests have yet been made, but police have said they will increase patrols in the area.
A spokesman for the Blairs said: "Kathryn was with a group of friends.
"No-one was hurt and nothing was stolen."
A Met spokesman said: "The victims were a man and a woman; the suspects were two males."
Police said one of the suspects was wearing dark clothing and a balaclava, while the other had a scarf wrapped round his face.
Officers believe the incident is linked to another attempted robbery which happened in Boston Place about 30 minutes earlier.
The earlier episode involved a female victim and a male suspect.
"On both occasions a firearm was seen but not used - no shots were fired.
"None of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen during the incidents," the spokesman added.
The Met Police said they are tracking down CCTV covering the area.
As well as daughter Kathryn, Tony and Cherie Blair have three sons, Euan, Nicholas and Leo. Kathryn, a barrister like her parents, is their third child.
The couple's oldest child, 29-year-old Euan, got married to long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman at All Saints parish church in Wotton Underwood, Bucks, last Saturday.
