Hibs had taken the lead just before the half hour with a controversial penalty duly put away by Jason Cummings.
Tommy Wright's team responded four minutes later when Joe Shaughnessy headed an equaliser.
McGinn's low drive from distance settled the game and set up a meeting with either Celtic or Ross County.
It was a lead the Edinburgh side deserved and maintained thanks to a fine late save by Mark Oxley from another Shaughnessy header.
This was a semi-final played out in biting cold, rain and occasional snow. For all that, it was an absorbing clash of Championship versus Premiership, of a Hibs side on a great run and a St Johnstone side who came into this on a poor run of no wins from their previous six games.
Hibs were without the injured Anthony Stokes - a minor back strain kept him out - but they went in front when Liam Henderson cut across Chris Millar, drawing a tentative challenge. There was contact, but how much contact was debatable.
Saints thought it was a minimal and protested vehemently when referee Steven McLean awarded the penalty. Cummings calmly rolled it in and Hibs were on their way.
Their glee was brief, their advantage wiped out in quick order. When David Wotherspoon swung in a cross from the right, Shaughnessy angled a superb header into the top corner.
You could not say Hibs took control from there, but most of the clever football came from the Championship side and most of the big performers wore green instead of blue.
Across the midfield, the Edinburgh side were sharp and slick.
McGinn was excellent in an attacking sense and Dylan McGeouch was a rock behind them. Henderson played powerfully and Fraser Fyvie was decent also.
Saints have character, though. At the beginning of the second half they rattled Hibs' crossbar from a Simon Lappin free-kick and never looked beaten even when McGinn rifled home to give Alan Stubbs' team the lead again.
It was deserved, you have to say. Cummings and Chris Dagnall had gone close, as had Henderson. McGinn's goal was coming and well-earned.
Hibs made more chances - Dagnall again, then McGinn's delicious turn and run caused more trouble for the Saints defence.
The Perth side finished strongly, not decisively. Shaughnessy's header was tipped away by Oxley, then an ineffective Michael O'Halloran drove over from a decent position.
Stubbs has worked wonders with this Hibs side since the dog days of relegation in 2014. Their world has turned since then.
