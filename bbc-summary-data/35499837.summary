Akhtar Javeed was killed when masked men raided his fast food and drink warehouse in Digbeth, Birmingham. He was found lying in the street.
West Midlands Police believe the shooting, at Direct Source 3 Ltd on Wednesday evening, was targeted.
Mr Javeed's family said he was an "honest" man who valued his family more than anything else.
He was in Birmingham to run the warehouse so he could provide for his family and he was planning to move back to London soon, they said.
Officers have been examining CCTV footage to try to identify the two gunmen who fled the scene.
They have refused to comment on claims 56-year-old Mr Javeed, a father of four, may have followed the raiders out of the building before being shot.

Ch Supt Andy Parsons said officers were alerted by a 999 call from staff inside the business premises.
It is not known what type of a firearm was used and fingertip searches and forensic testing have been taking place at the scene.
The force has declined to confirm whether anything was taken during the attempted robbery. It is believed other staff were on the premises at the time of the raid.
Mr Javeed worked five days a week in Birmingham before returning to his home in West Ham, east London, where he lived with his wife and family.
Norman Khan, 28, a car salesman, said he saw him lying on the ground in a pool of blood.
He said: "All his face was full of blood and there was blood on the floor. There were three guys standing there, I think they knew him."
Mr Javeed's death is the third gun death investigated by West Midlands Police since October.
There has been a spike in gun crime in the city in recent weeks with 41 arrests made this year for gun-related crime and 19 firearms have been seized.
Acting Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin has appealed for witnesses or information about the suspects, saying the shooting happened at happened at a time when people may have been leaving for work.
