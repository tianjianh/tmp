[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his landlord told his trial he "lost control" after a request for sexual favours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denies murder.
Swansea Crown Court has heard that unemployed Mr Ellis could not afford his rent and Mr Warburton suggested "things of a sexual nature" instead.
Mr Ellis told the jury his experience of being sexually abused as a child had triggered the fatal attack.
Mr Ellis said his landlord had "barged" into his bedroom and reminded him his rent was in arrears.
Mr Ellis said he felt angry due to the suggestion he could give sexual favours in lieu of rent and he tried to punch Mr Warburton after he cupped his face.
"I was abused as a child. The height difference made me feel like a child again," said Mr Ellis.
He said he picked up a screwdriver and tried to stab Mr Warburton but the attempt was unsuccessful.
The jury was told Mr Ellis eventually managed to kick his landlord in the groin causing him to drop to one knee.
Christopher Clee QC, prosecuting, said: "At that stage he was of no threat to you at all, was he?"
Mr Ellis replied: "I don't know what I was thinking at the time."
The court then heard how Mr Ellis picked up a hammer and struck Mr Warburton on the back of the head.
Mr Clee asked Mr Ellis: "You hit him from behind with such force you made a hole in his skull, didn't you?"
He replied: "Yes."
Mr Clee added: "You caved that man's head skull in - what were you doing?"
Mr Ellis said: " I don't know, I lost control."
The trial continues.
