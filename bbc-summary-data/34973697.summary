Petitions from 86 MPs backing a new national funding formula for England's schools have been given to the Commons.

The MPs said under the current system, the best-funded areas received up to Â£6,300 per pupil, while the worst-funded got an average of Â£4,200.
The MPs, led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart, want a fairer system.
The move followed the chancellor's promise last week that the government would consult on a new funding rate.
In his Spending Review at the end of November, George Osborne said the consultation would take place in the new year.
The petitions had been signed by thousands of local constituents from across the country.
Mr Stuart, Conservative MP for Beverley and Holderness, presented the petitions with MPs from his own and other parties on Tuesday evening.
Mr Stuart said: "Tuesday's presentation was intended to showcase the strength of feeling that exists up and down the country that levels of school funding cannot continue to be arbitrary and unfair.
"The current system hits rural and urban areas alike and the campaign does not divide along party lines.
"I am very grateful to everybody who has signed the petition in Beverley and Holderness and all those across the country.
"It's great that ministers have now committed to consult on how best to implement a new national funding formula but we will not let up until fair funding is delivered to schools in our constituencies."
Mr Stuart has called for change on this issue since he was elected in 2005 and is the vice-chairman of the F40 campaign, which calls for school funding to be overhauled.
More recently, he led a parliamentary debate on the issue in Westminster Hall.
