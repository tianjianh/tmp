The winners are to lead the carnival parade on its way around the city from Potternewton Park on Monday.
Charis Betts, from Leicester, was crowned queen with Dreamcatcher, a costume she co-designed.
Elroy Condor was chosen as the king with a stunning half-bird, half-man costume, Flight of Fantasy. It was designed by his uncle, Hughbon Condor.
Mr Condor, from Leeds, saw his winning design provide his fourth carnival king title in six years. He has designed more than 20 winning Carnival Queen costumes since 1979.
Ms Betts said her Dreamcatcher design was inspired by native American costume and included LED lights and a smoke machine.
Five Kings and 11 Queen costumes took part in the competition on Friday night.
Arthur France launched the annual Caribbean-themed extravaganza in 1967 after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis.
The carnival, believed to be the oldest event of its kind in Europe, is now in its 48th year.
It takes place over three days of the bank holiday weekend and culminates with the parade on the streets of Chapeltown and Harehills, with an attendance often estimated at about 150,000.
