Tube strike 8-9 July: What you need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 27-hour Tube strike is under way in London. Here's the lowdown on what you need to know to get around.

The Tube strike began at 18:30 BST on Wednesday and is due to end at 21:30 on Thursday.
Considerable. Transport for London (TfL) says there'll be no Tube service from late afternoon on Wednesday and no Tube service at all on Thursday.
Tube stations across the capital are closed so are best avoided.
All Tube lines.
First Great Western (FGW) services to and from Paddington are also likely to be disrupted because of a 48-hour strike by RMT members, also from 18:30 and running until services begin on Saturday.
Cricket fans heading to Cardiff for the first Ashes test are likely to be affected - FGW recommends alternative travel arrangements if possible.
London Overground, DLR, Transport for London Rail and trams are all operating a normal service.
Buses or walking look like your best bet.
Below is a walking map of central London showing the walking time, in minutes, between stops. Fortunately for commuters, Thursday's weather looks set to be sunny and dry, with a high of 23C - though Wednesday evening could be a bit chilly.
Extra buses are also running. Here's a map of the key bus routes you might need.
Roads are likely to be much busier than usual though, so make sure you leave plenty of extra time or travel outside rush hour.
Some coach services will run more regularly on many London routes during the strike.
Extra river services are also due to run, and extra bikes will be available to hire.
But bear in mind all of these services will be much more busy than usual.
It's likely to be harder to get to Heathrow as the Piccadilly line is not running.
But the Heathrow Express is still operating, and there are extra coach services being put on to take passengers to the airport from Victoria Coach Station.
Rail services to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted airports are all running as normal.
The strike was called after London Underground and various unions failed to agree a pay deal over new night Tube services.
The First Great Western action relates to job losses and maintenance of new Hitachi trains.
The short answer is no.
This is because TfL says strike action is something that is beyond its control so no refunds for journeys delayed or cancelled will be on offer.
