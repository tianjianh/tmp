The four-day festival celebrates the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Organisers said this year's theme was Once Upon A Time and hoped to turn Manchester's streets into a fairytale.
The procession of about 100 vibrant floats started on Liverpool Road at 13:00 BST and finished next to Manchester's Gay Village.
Coronation Street actors Kym Marsh and Anthony Cotton were among the stars on the soap's float this year.
Emergency services were out in force showing their support for the parade with Greater Manchester Police sporting specially-designed hats.
Many people used social media to say what a good time they had been having at the parade.
Abigail Taylor tweeted: "Had an amazing time at #ManchesterPride and I can't wait for next year!!!!"
Chelsey Willis wrote: "So so so happy to have experienced Manchester Pride and to have been there when my uncle got engaged ðŸ’œðŸ’›ðŸ’™ðŸ’šâ
