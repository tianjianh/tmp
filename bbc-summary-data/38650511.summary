A giant Huntsman spider from Japan was found by workers who opened a shipping container in Suffolk.

The 12cm (4.7in) creature scuttled out when staff at a storage company in Old Newton, near Stowmarket, opened the container to unload it.
It was found on 13 January.
RSPCA officer Naemi Kilbey, who was called to collect the spider, said: "Workers who found the spider definitely thought it was a Friday the 13th jinx."
She added: "I must admit I'd get a bit of a shock if I was unloading some stock and a huge Huntsman spider crawled out."
The RSPCA said Huntsman spiders, usually from Australia, can grow to more than 15cm (6in) in size but are generally harmless.
While a bite from a Huntsman could cause some pain and discomfort, they are not a highly venomous species.
The spider was taken to a local exotic animal specialist who will keep it.
