The veteran broadcaster presented the annual charity event for 35 years until poor health saw him pull out in 2015.
Friday night's BBC One broadcast was the first since Sir Terry died in January and a fundraiser of the year trophy was awarded in his memory.
Presenter Rochelle Humes said Sir Terry would have been proud of this year's "absolutely incredible" total.
Last November's Children In Need show raised £37.1m on the night.
The 2016 show featured special editions of Strictly Come Dancing with Team GB Olympic squad members and EastEnders.
The winner of the first Sir Terry Wogan Fundraiser of the Year Award was announced as Lauchlan Muir, from West Lothian, a boy who raises funds by being a "human statue".
Sir Terry's son Mark, who presented the award, said the late presenter's family were "hugely grateful" for the "amazing tributes".
He added that Children In Need was his father's favourite night of the year.
"The money raised tonight and throughout the year actually made a difference to people who need it. And that's why he loved it," he said.
Presenters Tess Daly and Greg James kicked off this year's show saying: "Sir Terry was somebody who embodied Children In Need and was someone we will all miss very, very much."
Graham Norton and Ade Adepitan later took over hosting duties and showed a montage of Sir Terry's best Children In Need moments, including clips of him performing with Madonna and showing some moves on the Strictly Come Dancing dance floor.
A host of celebrities appeared on screen as part of the night's entertainment.
Among highlights were Sue Perkins, Mel Giedroyc, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood poking fun at The Great British Bake Off's move from the BBC to Channel 4 in a sketch also featuring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, and Ricky Gervais appearing in his David Brent guise.
There were also performances from Michael Buble and Little Mix.
