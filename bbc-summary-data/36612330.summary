The deal for the 29-year-old is effective immediately.
However, the Super League club are in the process of applying for a visa and say they "anticipate his arrival in the UK in a few weeks' time".
Nuuausala was in the New Zealand side which lost to Australia in the 2013 World Cup final.
"I've achieved everything that I can in my career in the NRL, and, whilst still in my prime, want to experience the challenge of Super League," Nuuausala told the club website.
Warriors coach Shaun Wane added: "Frank-Paul is exactly the kind of player we want at Wigan. He's a very tough player who really throws himself into the action and is used to winning."
