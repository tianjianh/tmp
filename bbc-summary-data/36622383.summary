US election: Sanders says he will vote for Clinton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US Senator Bernie Sanders has said he will vote for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in November's presidential election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two have fought for the Democratic nomination, which former Secretary of State Mrs Clinton won this month.
Mr Sanders, a self-described socialist, told MSNBC he would do everything in his power to defeat the likely Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
But he stopped short of saying he would end his campaign.
He said his job now was to "fight for the strongest possible platform" at the party's convention in July, including a higher minimum wage.
Although Mrs Clinton has more of the all-important pledged delegates than he does, Mr Sanders failed to give the former first lady a full endorsement.
