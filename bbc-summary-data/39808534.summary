[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City moved up to fourth place in the Premier Division and ended a run of six league matches without a win with a 2-0 home success over Bohemians.

Centre-back Dean Jarvis headed the Candystripes into the lead in the 31st minute from an Aaron McEneff free-kick into the penalty area.
McEneff made it 2-0 midway through the second half with a twice-taken penalty.
The spot-kick was awarded for Dan Byrne's foul on Ben Doherty and McEneff drilled in the retaken spot-kick.
City badly needed the three points having taken just three from their last six fixtures after starting the season with four wins in a row.
It was a deserved victory Kenny Shiels' men against a Bohs side which had lost five of their last six in the league.
Visiting keeper Shane Supple saved early on from Ronan Curtis who did not get a clean strike on is far-post shot after McEneff's free into the box.
The Bohs defence will be disappointed they did not deal with another McEneff set-piece as Jarvis managed to get across his marker and head in his second goal of the season.
Nathan Boyle and Barry McNamee had chances early in the second half but failed to make them count.
Then came the penalty for Byrne's foul on Doherty just inside the box. McEneff netted past Supple, and kept his head to repeat the trick when Dublin referee Robert Harvey ordered the retake.
