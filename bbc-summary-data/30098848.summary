[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were lured to Ballycolman estate on 23 October to investigate reports of a bomb thrown at a police patrol vehicle the previous night.
The alert was a hoax but then a real bomb, packed with nails, was discovered in the garden of a nearby house.
The men, aged  29 and 43, had been questioned at Antrim PSNI station.
They had been detained in Strabane on Tuesday morning.
A number of houses were searched and two cars were seized during the operation.
The nail bomb was defused by the Army, and more than 130 schoolchildren and a number of householders were moved as bomb disposal officers dealt with the device.
