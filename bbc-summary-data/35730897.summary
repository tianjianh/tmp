The British number three, 26, prevailed 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 7-5 in a match which lasted two hours and 16 minutes.
Broady saved three break points in the third set to make the last four.
After beating the world number 31, she will now face Eugenie Bouchard, the Canadian sixth seed who breezed past Turkey's Cagla Buyukakcay 6-1 6-4.
Broady posted on social media afterwards: "Had to fight hard again to get the win today and make it through to the semi-final here in Kuala Lumpur #keeprolling."
The Briton, now ranked 96 in the world, also reached the semi-finals of last September's WTA event in Quebec.
She moved into the top 100 for the first time in February after winning an ITF tournament in the United States.
That came a month after she beat former world number one Ana Ivanovic in the first round of the ASB Classic in Auckland, her first victory over a top-20 ranked opponent.
