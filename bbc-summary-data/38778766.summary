Barnsley 0-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnsley and Preston remained in the Championship play-off picture despite a goalless stalemate at Oakwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnsley's Ryan Kent almost caught keeper Chris Maxwell out at the near post with an inswinging corner.
Striker Jordan Hugill pulled Preston's best first-half effort just wide from a tight angle from Paul Gallagher's pass.
Tom Bradshaw had an effort blocked on the line for Barnsley and Adam Davies clawed away Hugill's header in added time to deny Preston a winner.
Barnsley dropped a place to ninth, but only four points behind Sheffield Wednesday in sixth, while Simon Grayson's Preston also slipped one to 11th, three points further back.
The home side gave a debut to loan signing Callum Elder at left-back, with Alex Mowatt suspended after being sent off against Wolves, while Preston recalled 6ft 6in Simon Makienok to spearhead their attack.
An early header apart, Makienok was well marshalled by Marc Roberts and Angus MacDonald, and was eventually replaced by Jermaine Beckford.
Bradshaw was denied by a defender on the line after sliding in to meet Kent's cross, but Davies pushing away Hugill's header as it flew towards the top corner was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock thereafter in a game of few clear-cut opportunities.
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:  "I was pleased with how we coped with their threats but I didn't feel that we did enough to win the game.
"There were not enough crosses into the box, not enough efforts on goal.
"I said at half-time I was conscious that I didn't want Preston to grind us down, because the team they picked and the message from Simon (Grayson) at the start of the game was that he wanted a tougher, more aggressive performance.
"I don't even speak about the top six. It is about winning the next game, so it has not even entered my head.
Preston boss Simon Grayson: "There are plenty of games still to go and there will be so many twists and turns from now until the end of the season.
"We have aspirations to try and get there (the play-offs), but obviously we will need to turn these draws into wins if we are going to make up the ground on teams that are up there already.
"Neither team really had that cutting edge to go and break down two resilient defensive performances today.
"These games just hinge on a little bit of magic from somebody, and from our point of view we never really had that little bit of quality.
