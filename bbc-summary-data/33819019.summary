[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has brought his Labour leadership campaign to Wales as a fierce battle for the support of party members continues.

The veteran left-winger has won the backing of more local constituency parties in Wales and the UK than the other three candidates.
Visiting north Wales on Monday, he said he would be happy to work with Plaid Cymru MPs to deliver a radical agenda.
Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall are also in the race.
Visiting Conservative-held Aberconwy and then Connah's Quay in Labour's Alyn and Deeside seat, Mr Corbyn said there was a need "to work with all the opposition parties in order to win votes" in the House of Commons.
"I'm not proposing any coalitions with anybody," he said.
"What I am proposing is we put forward our agenda.
"My agenda is maybe slightly more radical than other people would want to put forward.
"If that brings people with us and they vote with us and we work together on it so be it, that's good".
Earlier, Mr Corbyn called for a debate on public ownership of firms, saying some industries were "natural monopolies".
But the idea was criticised by former Labour minister and Pontypridd MP Kim Howells, who said it would "cost a fortune" and would not improve services.
Senior Labour figures including former Prime Minister Tony Blair have claimed that a Labour party led by Mr Corbyn would be seen as too extreme by voters at a general election.
There have also been claims that Labour has been infiltrated by hard left activists and by Conservatives aiming to ensure the party elects a left-wing leader.
Brendan Toomey, the Labour leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, claimed new members who had joined the party locally to take part in the leadership election included a Communist sympathiser and a supporter of UKIP.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has not publicly backed any candidate, but has said Mr Corbyn would be a "surprise choice".
However, he has also warned that sniping between the rival camps in the increasingly bitter battle is a "gift" to Labour's opponents.
The winner, to be chosen by a vote of Labour party members, will be named on 12 September.
Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan said she backed Ms Cooper for the leadership, but said: "I know Jeremy well and I think very highly of him and I agree with a lot of his policies.
"I think he has brought an awful lot to the debate."
The leadership campaign trail will take Mr Corbyn to Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent and Cardiff on Tuesday.
