The woman spent hours searching for her pet near Prickwillow on Tuesday evening after it ran off, climbing down into the gate where it had become stuck, Cambridgeshire Fire Service said.
If the water level had risen further, the pair could have been dragged into the gate's mechanisms, fire crews said.
It took nearly three hours to rescue the woman and her collie.
"We understand how precious animals are but the owner had put herself in extreme danger," said Station Commander Paul Clarke.
"With sluice gates you don't know when they are going to activate.
"We have to emphasise to owners the dangers of trying to rescue their animals. If your pets are in danger then please call the fire service."
