Ospreys could be without Wales and Lions flanker Justin Tipuric for the rest of the 2015-16 season.

Tipuric suffered a heavy blow to the head as he fell from a line-out in Wales' 67-14 Six Nations win over Italy on 19 March.
Ospreys backs coach Gruff Rees said: "We're not even putting any thought process around when the next game for Justin can be.
"It may be we just sit tight and see the season out and get to the summer."
Rees described the incident on 19 March in which Tipuric was injured as a "hefty blow".
The 2013 British and Irish Lion started for Wales as captain Sam Warburton had been concussed in the defeat by England seven days earlier.
Tipuric went on to miss Ospreys' 25-16 Pro12 defeat by Scarlets last Saturday and he will be absent when the Swansea-based team visit Newport Gwent Dragons on Friday, 1 April.
Rees added: "He was in the office last Friday and he had a tough old week of it in terms of just being inactive at home and really not being comfortable getting out and about.
"And we're not putting any pressure on him having to do anything but sitting on the sofa."
Rees added: "You've got to be really wary and sit back and look at the long-term betterment of these players."
Wales lock colleague Alun Wyn Jones is also on the Ospreys sidelines as he recovers from a heel problem.
No matter what part Jones and Tipuric play in the rest of Ospreys' season, Wales hope they are fit to face New Zealand down under in three Tests in June.
