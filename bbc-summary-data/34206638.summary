[SN]TITLE[SN]
Conductors share Proms orchestra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two of the final concerts of this year's BBC Proms season see Sir Simon Rattle and Semyon Bychkov conduct the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra on consecutive nights. The performances are an opportunity to hear two conductors with very different backgrounds work with the same ensemble, and gain a glimpse into what different conductors can bring to the podium.

A typical symphony performance can see up to 100 musicians on stage. Among the audience there might be 200-300 people. All of them, for much of the time - and certainly at key moments - will be looking at one person. The conductor.
The baton-wielding arm-waver positioned between the stage and the auditorium is perhaps the only musician who routinely works with their back to the audience. It seems simple - they do that because they conduct the orchestra, not the audience.
But Soviet-born conductor Semyon Bychkov says leading a modern orchestra is a complex and sensitive task.
"An orchestra is a human instrument consisting of lots of individuals, who have lots of different ideas," he explains, "but in a good moment, in a good ambience, somehow all of that becomes unified and produces something that a single person can never express. That is what makes the magic"
"Whether it is two individuals participating, or 102, should not make any difference.
But with such large numbers of professional musicians on stage, and with ensembles like the Aurora Orchestra committing entire symphonies to memory, how can the one person not holding an instrument make a difference to the performance?
Although Bychkov says conducting is a young discipline - and one which is not fully understood - he insists conductors unify the musical visions of their colleagues, giving a coherence to the whole, and conveying the image of the work being performed to the audience.
Professional orchestra musicians will have often played works many times before, and will bring their own point of view to the music. The task is to convince them to accept an idea and go with it, but also to "open them up" and bring out their rich talent.
"They have to have a feeling they are playing a piece the way they want to play it - then they are very happy," says Bychkov.
"When they have to play against their inner conviction, they will do it - because they are professionals - but it will give them no joy and inevitably the audience will feel this unease on stage."
The people listening to the two Vienna Philharmonic concerts will expect any such kinks to be ironed out by the orchestra takes the stage at the Royal Albert Hall. But could they expect to hear a difference in the orchestra between the concert conducted by Bychkov, and the one by Sir Simon?
It's a tricky question, and one that perhaps only the most dedicated listener might be able to answer. Bychkov believes it is probably too much to expect the average concert-goer to hear the specific detailed nuances of a performance unless they are familiar with the piece or happen to have knowledge of the score.
What is more important is that the listener is moved by what they hear, identify with it, and want to hear it again.
"That is what makes music alive - the desire of the artists who interpret it and the audience with whom the music is shared. The desire to come back to it is what finally decides which music will live and which won't."
But he also insists it is "absolutely normal" for the Vienna Philharmonic to sound different across the two concerts. While Sir Simon conducts a piece by the English composer Elgar, Bychkov performs work by Brahms, a German, and the neglected Austrian composer, Franz Schmidt. These men were born into different national cultures, and between them their lives spanned two centuries.
So the orchestra will adapt to the different repertoire. It brings enormous flexibility gained from working at the Vienna Opera, where it plays with different singers night after night, performing different repertoire in changing productions. That experience has given the ensemble the capacity to adapt to a very wide range of music.
Creating a distinctive sound though can take years, and it is difficult to predict how the sound of an orchestra might change when it works with a different conductor. Bychkov compares the relationship to that between two people - it will grow and develop over time.
"When two people decide to join their life together, at first they are two individuals, they have their own luggage in life," he says.
"Then little by little they will become a blending of souls, and there will be certain things that don't need to be said - they are just felt, they are already anticipated. Well here you have more than 100 as opposed to two, but the idea is the same."
It may take decades for a relationship to evolve in that way, says Bychkov, "but I guarantee you that if the relationship is successful, 20 years later it will be again something else, but it will be evolving, separately, but together, and so harmoniously."
It will only be a handful of professionals working in and with an orchestra that will follow the evolution of a conductor and orchestra over a period of years. And although many of the concert-goers filing into the Royal Albert Hall will know their Elgar from their Brahms, they might be hard pressed to detect the nuanced differences in how the Vienna Philharmonic responds to each of the two different conductors.
So without the luxury of a spare couple of decades to learn to hear such subtleties, they might do better to just sit back - or stand, as many do at the Proms - and just enjoy the music.
The Vienna Philharmonic performs at the BBC proms on 10 September conducted by Semyon Bychkov and on 11 September conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.
