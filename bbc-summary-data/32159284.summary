The deaths of four patients have prompted an investigation by police into an Alderney medical practice.

Guernsey Police raided the Eagle Medical Practice at about 10:30 BST.
The surgery in Ollivier Street in St Anne's is run by Dr Rory Lyons. He has been suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.
Guernsey Police Chief Patrick Rice said: "It is likely medical records will be seized - no-one has been arrested."
Mr Rice said: "Concerns were raised with the Health and Social Services Department following the death of a patient who had been under the care of the Eagle Medical Practice.
"A preliminary internal investigation found three further deaths of concern were identified before it was referred to police."
Items, including documents, have been removed from the surgery, whose website says it has about 500 patients.
Officers left the scene at 15:45 after loading a vehicle with boxes. A private residence in Alderney has also been searched.
Dr Carol Tozer, chief officer of the Health and Social Services Department (HSSD), said: "Following our internal investigation a doctor was excluded from treating patients at the Mignot Memorial Hospital and the General Medical Council was informed.
"The GMC was also notified that this matter is now the subject of a police investigation.
"The GMC has confirmed that the doctor's practice is already under restrictions and he is being investigated."
She said senior staff had been sent to Alderney to provide information and advice to concerned patients.
Dr Tozer said the HSSD was "responsible for the health and well-being of the people of Alderney" and "while GP practices in Alderney are privately-run businesses, we act as the investigating authority for complaints involving our staff or incidents taking place in our facilities".
Mr Rice said the investigation would be "complex and take time to establish the full facts".
He said family liaison officers had been sent to Alderney and further information would be released when available and he urged islanders to "avoid partaking in any unhelpful speculation".
