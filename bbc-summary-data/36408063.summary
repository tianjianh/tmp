The Northern Irishman, 52, led the Perth side to a second straight fourth-placed finish in season 2015-16.
Saints have finished in the top half of the table in each of Wright's three seasons in charge.
"I was delighted to hear I'd won it," Wright said of his award on the St Johnstone website.
"But even though it's me that receives the award, it's also recognition for the great work carried out by Callum [Davidson], Alec [Cleland], Paul Smith and all my staff for what we've achieved together over the season.
"The players have been terrific this season and it's their performances that have led to this award. So, I would like to thank them for all their help this season.
"It's nice to get that sort of recognition from people outwith the football club. The chairman and the board are supportive of me, as are the supporters, so to get the backing of an outside party shows that the football club is progressing.
"We've achieved a lot in getting a fourth place finish in what I feel was a tougher league this season.
"Planning for next season is well underway and has been for a few months."
