The visitors did well to compete with high-flying Burton, before Hamza Choudhury received a second yellow card for a late tackle.
Bury quickly capitalised and led through substitute Ryan Lowe's header from Dan Gardner's cross.
Burton pushed numbers forward and were rewarded when substitute Tyler Walker scored his first goal for the club with a back-heel to equalise in injury time.
It was only the second goal as a professional for on-loan Walker, the son of former England defender Des.
Burton dropped to second place, a point behind Wigan, who were 5-1 winners away at Shrewsbury, while Bury are 10 points clear of the relegation zone.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:

"It feels like a win. I know it's not but we feel as though we should have won over the course of the game.
"Up to the sending off we pressed, we tried and we created chances. It's just one wouldn't drop for us. It seemed as though we were going to get nothing from the game until the last few minutes.
"It's an incredible point in the circumstances and we think it could be a very important one."
