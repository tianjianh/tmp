'World's oldest' Koran: Birmingham reacts to discovery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fragments of what could be the world's oldest Koran have been discovered at the University of Birmingham. Academic and media interest has been ignited across the world, but what does the revelation mean for Birmingham?

Radio carbon dating found the manuscript was at least 1,370 years old, putting it among the earliest in existence.
The Staffordshire Hoard, dug up in 2009, attracted more than 1.5 million visitors to its first exhibition, with visitors travelling from across the world.
The newly-discovered Koran is due to go on display for three weeks in October.
If it's real, it's hugely exciting, not just to Muslims but to any theologian, academic and historian. It's of profound significance to Muslims in that it reinforces faith in the authenticity of the Koran.
For Muslims, this is God staying true to His word. In chapter 15 of the Holy Koran, He says he will reveal and preserve the Koran, so the prophecy appears to have been fulfilled, subject to it being verified as being from the 7th Century, of course.
I'm really looking forward to seeing it with my own eyes. It would be nice for it to be displayed on appropriate occasions, such as Islam Awareness Week, as it would offer schools a fantastic teaching and learning opportunity too.
When I saw these pages I was very much moved, and there were tears of joy and emotions in my eyes.
And I am quite sure that even the people from all over the UK will come here to Birmingham, to just have a glimpse of these pages.
We've been inundated by both students and staff from around the world who want to come and see it.
We were excited and surprised about its discovery but we didn't expect such an emotional response. We knew people would be pleased but there's been a really passionate reaction.
It's great for the city.
Whilst some manuscripts are major attractions elsewhere in the world, their appeal to visitors is determined more by the status of the person who is understood to have recorded them.
The problem with this particular fragment is that we don't actually know where it comes from.
But, in line with the recent trend for such finds, the fragments will be studied worldwide. It means there is potential for other significant discoveries in Britain.
These Koran fragments going on display in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham will add to our rich diversity and culture, and the city will continue to be an important destination in terms of faith tourism.
Birmingham already has lots to offer in terms of faith tourism.
Birmingham Cathedral is celebrating its 300th anniversary, the city is famous for its St Patrick's Day parade, the Cadburys were a Quaker family who created the famous Bournville Village in the city, while John Wesley was instrumental in the Methodist movement in the late 1700s here in Birmingham.
We are thrilled that such an important historical document is here in Birmingham, the most culturally diverse city in the UK.
It is among the earliest written textual evidence of the Islamic holy book known to survive. This gives the Koran manuscript in Birmingham global significance to Muslim heritage and the study of Islam.
A lot of people from Birmingham and all over the country will love to see it.
It will show people in Birmingham that they have a treasure that is second to none.
People coming in from Malaysia or Indonesia, maybe the Gulf countries, they'll be interested. I don't know if they'd go all the way to Birmingham though. But if people are in the area, I'm sure they would want to see it.
The manuscript will be on public display at The Barber Institute of Fine Arts, University of Birmingham, from Friday 2 October until Sunday 25 October.
