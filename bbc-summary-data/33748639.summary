Thousands of Peterborough United and Cambridge United fans turned out for a match at the Abax Stadium in memory of the clubs' former manager Chris Turner.

He died aged 64 in April after a long battle with dementia.
The goalless draw between the only two Cambridgeshire clubs in the Football League began with a minute's applause "to honour this county's greatest sporting icon".
It was the first match between the two sides in 14 years.
Almost 4,700 fans from both clubs turned out on Saturday for the friendly in Peterborough, with all profits going to the Glenfield Care Centre, whose staff looked after Turner during his final years.
He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969, making more than 300 appearances for the club before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s.
Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend.
He retired as a player in 1984 and took over as Cambridge United boss the following year, managing them until 1990.
His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman.
Turner was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006.
His wife Lynne said doctors told her the illness was "caused by heading too many balls" and called for greater research into the health risks surrounding the sport.
Turner died on 27 April. Hundreds of fans from both Peterborough and Cambridge attended his funeral in May.
The Chris Turner Memorial Match was devised as a way of "commemorating Chris [in a way] that is fitting, and to make sure we celebrate the life of Chris in the right way", Phil Adlam, from Peterborough United, said.
It was, both team managers agreed, "a fitting memorial" and "the result didn't matter".
