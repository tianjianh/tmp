[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was lying on Neilston Road at about 01:45. He is being treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, where his condition  is said to be serious.
Officers investigating the incident said the man left a local pub at about 01:30.
They want to trace the drivers of a white Ford Transit pick-up and a dark saloon car which were in the area.
Sgt Mark Miller said: "We know from CCTV that the injured man had been in a nearby local pub which he left around 0130 hours.
"He is then seen five minutes later lying on the road. It is believed from CCTV that he was struck by a vehicle.
"Neilston Road is a busy area - a main route out of Paisley heading towards Barrhead. The local pubs were spilling at the time and I am confident someone will have seen what happened to the man.
"I would stress again that at this time we need to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident, and I am keen to trace the drivers of a white Ford Transit pick-up and a dark saloon car that were seen on CCTV on Neilston Road at the time."
