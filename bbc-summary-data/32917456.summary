[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A circular walled garden with a water feature is being proposed as a memorial to infants at the heart of the Mortonhall baby ashes scandal.

The garden, in the grounds of Mortonhall crematorium, is expected to be completed by November this year.
Parents were asked to choose between four different designs.
The walled garden design emerged as the favourite, although the pond originally proposed will be replaced with a stone water feature due to safety fears.
The preferred design is featured in a report going to Edinburgh City Council's transport and environment committee on Tuesday.
It is described as "an enclosed circular space providing parents with a private and peaceful place for personal contemplation".
It will include beech hedges, birch trees, a stone ball water feature, rocks, a pathway and seating and will be located off the existing memorial walkway not far from the main chapel.
A second memorial is being proposed for Princes Street Gardens as some families had strong views that they did not wish to return to Mortonhall.
Sue Bruce, Edinburgh City Council's chief executive, said: "I am pleased that we now have a design identified for the memorial at Mortonhall.
"This was a difficult process for everyone involved but it was important to hear the views of all affected parents and reflect their wishes.
"The walled water feature garden will provide a tranquil area for reflection. I'd like to acknowledge my appreciation of the feedback from parents in choosing such a fitting memorial."
Nicola Welsh, chief executive of stillbirth charity Sands Lothian, said: "Since taking over running the charity in January, I have attended all the Mortonhall working party meetings and have been very impressed with the level of care and attention given to try and get the memorials right.
"The council and other group members have been keen to involve parents and their online surveys have given everyone a voice and hopefully a majority vote on the designs.
"It will be a special and lasting memorial for all the little babies."
