[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Northamptonshire and Sussex washed out by rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire opener Ben Duckett remained 18 runs short of a triple century as rain prevented play on day three against Sussex at Wantage Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Umpires Richard Kettleborough and Billy Taylor made a series of inspections before abandoning play at 15:45 BST.
Duckett is 282 not out, having hit two sixes and 38 fours, with his side on 481-7 and a draw seemingly inevitable.
Chris Rogers was the last triple centurion for Northants, making 319 against Gloucestershire in 2006.
