Royal Blood, Years and Years and deadmau5 are also in the line-up.
Organisers had already announced Metallica as one of the main acts for the festival, which will take place between 22 and 24 August.
"We are so excited to be playing," Years and Years said. "We'll bring three times as many synths as Metallica - can't wait to party with you all."
Mumford & Sons last appeared at Reading and Leeds on the NME/BBC Radio 1 Stage in 2010.
The band have been working on their third album since February 2014, according to band member Ben Lovett.
Bastille are also performing and mega group Rebel Sound featuring Chase & Status, Rage, David Rodigan and Shy FX.
"The last time we played Reading and Leeds, the crowd were insane and we had to stop the set four times - there was so much energy," Chase & Status said.
"We're already preparing the new dubsâ€¦ can't wait to see what the Reading and Leeds crowd will bring this summer."
Catfish and The Bottlemen are also in the line up.
"Last year really was a game changer for us and one of, if not the best shows we've ever done. This year's gonna blow it away," the band said.
Wolf Alice, Pretty Vicious, Jack Garratt and Hannah Wants have also been announced.
"I'm looking forward to revealing the third headliner and even more great artists soon," festival boss Melvin Benn said.
