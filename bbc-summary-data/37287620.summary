[SN]TITLE[SN]
Abuse inquiry criticised by ex-chairwoman Lowell Goddard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The independent inquiry into child sex abuse is too big, bureaucratic and lacking in adequate systems, its former chairwoman has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dame Lowell Goddard, who resigned last month, said in a memo to MPs that the inquiry needed overhauling.
She said the inquiry should focus less on the past and more on current standards of child protection.
New chairwoman Alexis Jay said its terms of reference would remain but an internal review of it would be held.
Last month, Dame Lowell became the third chief to quit the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), which was set up to investigate allegations made against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions in England and Wales, as well as people in the public eye.
The inquiry was set up after a string of scandals involving celebrities such as BBC DJ Jimmy Savile, who since his death in 2011 has been exposed as one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators, and the targeting of vulnerable children by organised gangs in towns such as Rotherham, Oxford and Rochdale.
The spotlight also fell on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites.
The inquiry was then launched in 2014 and it has announced 13 initial investigations, which include inquiries into the allegations of abuse by people of prominence.
In her memo to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Dame Lowell said she had stepped down in order to challenge the way the probe was running.
There was "an inherent problem in the sheer scale and size of the inquiry", she said - adding that its budget did not match.
"Its boundless compass, including, as it does, every state and non-state institution, as well as relevant institutional contexts, coupled with the absence of any built-in time parameters, does not fit comfortably or practically within the single inquiry model."
She said there should be a complete review, "with a view to remodelling it and recalibrating its emphasis more towards current events and thus focusing major attention on the present and future protection of children".
Dame Lowell also said:
Inquiry sources have told the BBC she lost the confidence of senior insiders.
However, Prof Jay said the panel would not be seeking any revision of the inquiry's terms of reference or introducing any new restrictions on its scope.
"To ensure that the inquiry can meet the challenges it faces, I have already initiated a wide-ranging internal review of the inquiry's ways of working," she said.
"We are currently looking at different approaches to evaluating the information we receive."
But Lord Macdonald of River Glaven QC, who was director of public prosecutions from 2003 to 2008, said the probe's "overwhelming focus on the past" was "ballooning out of control" and called for its terms of reference to be rewritten.
Peter Saunders, founder of the charity National Association for People Abused in Childhood and a member of the victims' advisory panel for the inquiry, said it remained the "best hope" despite its scale.
The prime minister's official spokeswoman said the government believed the inquiry was "absolutely vital and we remain committed to doing it".
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: "We owe it to victims and survivors to confront the appalling reality of how children were let down by the very people who were charged to protect them and to learn from the mistakes of the past."
