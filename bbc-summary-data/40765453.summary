Women's Euro 2017: Germany 1-2 Denmark

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Germany's bid for a seventh consecutive European Championship title is over after Denmark fought back to win an entertaining Euro 2017 quarter-final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pre-tournament favourites - last knocked out of this competition in 1993 - had led when Isabel Kerschowski fired in early on.
But Nadia Nadim nodded Denmark level after half-time and Theresa Nielsen's late header completed the comeback.
It is only Germany's third loss in the 26-year history of the competition.
The Olympic champions - ranked second in the world - created plenty of chances but were also frequently opened up at the back by a Denmark side who, after a nervy start, became increasingly dangerous.
The opener came courtesy of a goalkeeping error, as Stina Lykke Petersen misjudged Kerschowski's fierce shot from the edge of the area and could only parry the German's shot in to the net.
After the break, Germany hesitated when they thought they had conceded a free-kick only for the referee to play an advantage that Denmark took, with Portland Thorns forward Nadim jumping well at the far post to nod in the equaliser.
Plenty of openings for both sides followed as the game became stretched with the prospect of extra time looming.
Another right-wing cross found Nielsen unmarked in the Germany penalty area on 83 minutes and she headed in to spark wild Danish celebrations.
The result guaranteed that the tournament will have a different winner for the first time since Norway's triumph in 1993, with Germany having won the following six European Championships.

The match had to be rescheduled for 11:00 BST on Sunday after torrential rain fell on Saturday night in Rotterdam.
That meant the quarter-final was one of three to take place on Sunday.
Austria beat Spain in a shootout after the sides drew 0-0, meaning they will face the Danes in the semis.
And England beat France 1-0 to secure a meeting with hosts Netherlands, who booked their place in the last four on Saturday with a win over Sweden.
