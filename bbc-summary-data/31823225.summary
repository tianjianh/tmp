Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan will return as detective superintendent Stella Gibson and serial killer Paul Spector.
The drama was created, written and directed by Allan Cubitt.
The popular psychological thriller gained an average of 3.3m viewers making it one of BBC Two's highest performing dramas of 2014.
Writer and director, Allan Cubitt, said: "The cliff-hanger ending of season two was conceived in the hope of further exploring the characters and the themes that are at the heart of The Fall. We're grateful to be given this opportunity by the BBC."
Ben Stephenson, controller, BBC Drama, said: "The story is far from over. Allan has known the end game from the beginning - the cat and mouse game between Gillian and Jamie has one last act to play out. Who will win?"
The BBC said the third series would return to Belfast as the complex relationship between Det Supt Stella Gibson and Paul Spector intensifies and the story of the investigation into the murders becomes more "complex and intricate".
