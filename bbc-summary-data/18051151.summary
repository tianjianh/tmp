The donation, made by clothing manufacturer Montane, has been raised over the past two years by selling specialist clothing.
Kendal MRT Chair Dagmar Johnson said: "This kind of national support eases the financial pressure on teams."
The charity relies on donations to cover the annual running costs of about £45,000 each year.
The Kendal team accepted the cheque as representative of the national mountain rescue organisation because Montante has its UK showroom in its area.
Mrs Johnson said: "We are also eternally grateful to the local people and businesses who have always supported us and continue to provide so much of the financial backing to our volunteers."
