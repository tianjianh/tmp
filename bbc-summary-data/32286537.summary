The high-tech cook can chop ingredients, mix food in a pan and do the washing up afterwards.
It's been designed by a London based company and shown off at a technology fair for new gadgets.
The robo-chef learns how to perform kitchen duties by capturing the movements of a human in the action of preparing a meal.
These movements are then turned into commands that drive an intelligent pair of robot hands.
But the product is still two years away from being available to buy in shops.
