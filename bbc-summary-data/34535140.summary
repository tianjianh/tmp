Hundreds of candles were lit and placed alongside the floral tributes at the entrance to the halting site.
Five adults and five children died in the fire.
It is understood the blaze broke out at a pre-fabricated building at the site and quickly spread to a nearby unit.
Police are investigating the cause of the blaze, but it is not being treated as suspicious.
A number of people released Chinese lanterns during Wednesday night's vigil, however police stopped this after one lantern got caught in a tree and burned out above the crowd.
Earlier, DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council told residents of a south Dublin housing estate that a temporary halting site for survivors of last weekend's fire will be used for just six months.
Those living on the estate met local council officials on Wednesday after they blocked entry to a plot of land earmarked as a temporary accommodation site for survivors.
Residents of Rockville Drive, a cul-de-sac off Glenamuck Road in Carrickmines, have said that they were not consulted on the plans and while they had sympathy for those affected, they were concerned about the lack of discussion in selecting the site and its suitability.
