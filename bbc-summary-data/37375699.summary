Tens of thousands of Wales supporters travelled to France in the summer to see their side progress to the tournament's semi finals.
They were branded "the red wall" by the Wales players.
Uefa's executive committee has also recognised supporters from Iceland, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The announcement coincides with Wales rising to 10th in the Fifa world rankings.
