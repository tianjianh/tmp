One type of homophobic bullying is when people use words like "gay" or "lesbian" as an insult.
Homophobic bullying became an issue for Jessica and Libby on CBBC show Our School.
Somebody called Jessica a lesbian (a girl who dates girls) to try and upset her.
Jessica and Libby told a teacher what had happened and the school held a workshop to tackle homophobic bullying.
