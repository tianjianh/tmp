[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for nine years after killing a man with a "cowardly" punch during a night out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ridwaan Shaikh, 22, hit Bradley Cresswell, 21, after they had been to Hydeout Nightclub in Watford on 17 September.
Mr Cresswell suffered a bleed to the brain and never regained consciousness.
Shaikh, of Ilford in London, denied murder and manslaughter but was found guilty of the latter at the Old Bailey.
The two young men were with groups of friends when they encountered each other at the nightclub.
Shortly before closing time, one of Mr Cresswell's friends knocked one of Shaikh's friends to the floor.
Mr Cresswell later separated from the group and was walking alone towards Bentine Lane when Shaikh knocked him unconscious, although he soon recovered.
The two groups met each other again in The Parade about 40 minutes later and began arguing, where Shaikh hit Mr Cresswell, this time fatally.
Insp Pushpa Guild, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "He was determined to pursue Bradley and waited for an opportune moment before cowardly striking the fatal punch."
