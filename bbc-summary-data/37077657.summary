Williams suffered the injury in a pre-season game against Farnborough.
The 22-year-old will also miss the games against Austria and Georgia in October and is expected to be out for up to 10 weeks.
He was part of the Wales squad for Euro 2016, starting the opening game against Slovakia.
"It's another injury for Jonny and we hope it's not too long," Wales assistant manager Osian Roberts said.
"It's really disappointing for Jonny  because we thought this would be the season he would make a breakthrough in his career."
