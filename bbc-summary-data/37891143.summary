Emily Kay, 21, won the new-look omnium - reduced from six races over two days to four in one - by one point to add to her win in Friday's team pursuit.
Kay won on 121 points, ahead of Lotte Kopecky with Tatsiana Sharakova on 119.
Jack Carlin, Ryan Owens and Joe Truman then won the men's team sprint, beating France by almost one second.
Britain have won the past three Olympic titles in the event but with Olympic champions Phil Hindes, Jason Kenny and Callum Skinner all resting, Carlin, Owens and Truman stepped up.
Kay, who matched Olympic champion Laura Kenny's haul of team pursuit and omnium gold, said that while "they are pretty big boots to fill" the results showed "the strength in depth" the British team enjoys.
She started the final discipline of the omnium in second place but led going into the final sprint.
However, she was too tired to contest the finale and admitted that she was "lucky" to win after Belgium's Kopecky was half a wheel from claiming the second place she needed to take the title.
Britain also won the men's and women's team pursuit titles and women's madison gold over the weekend to top the medal table at the first World Cup event of the new Olympic cycle.
The second of this season's four events takes place next week in Apeldoorn, Netherlands.
