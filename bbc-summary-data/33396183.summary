It comes after an inquest at West London Coroner's Court heard details of how they died.
William Graham, 51, died from gunshot wounds to his pelvis while his wife Lisa Graham, 50, died from gunshot wounds to her chest.
James and Ann McQuire, aged 66 and 63, were both fatally shot in the chest.
The bodies of Mr and Mrs Graham, from Bankfoot in Perthshire, and Mr and Mrs McQuire, from Cumbernauld, were flown back to London on Thursday for post-mortems to be carried out.
Chinyere Inyama, senior coroner for West London, said the victims' bodies will now be released to their families and authorised transportation to Scotland.
He added: "I'm going to suspend the investigation pending completion of parallel investigations in both Tunisia and the UK."
Thirty Britons were among 38 victims killed by Seifeddine Rezgui when he opened fire in the resort of Sousse at about  11:15 on Friday 26 June.
Det Sgt David Batt of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command told the inquest the shootings lasted around half an hour.
In a statement read out during the hearings, he said: "Tourists were indiscriminately targeted by the gunman. The gunman was shot by security services."
The bodies of the victims were moved to the central mortuary in Tunis after they were killed, he added.
Det Sgt Batt said: "Senior UK police identification managers have assisted in Tunisia and in the UK to oversee the identification process."
Mr Batt said 275 witness accounts had been taken by police so far, and more than 1,200 potential witnesses have returned to the UK.
"Accounts are being taken from those who are deemed significant," he added.
Police were patrolling the streets around the coroner's court and a large number of officers guarded a fenced-off area surrounding a white tent close to the building.
Flowers and cards were piled on the pavement nearby.
The final five bodies of the murdered Britons arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in an RAF C-17 aircraft on Saturday afternoon.
Tunisia's president has declared a state of emergency in the wake of attack.
On Friday, the Queen, the prime minister and Scotland's first minister joined millions of people across the UK in a minute's silence in tribute to those killed.
