Mentally ill carer admits killing bedridden father

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mentally ill man who was a carer for both of his parents has admitted beating his bedridden father to death at the family's north-west London home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohsin Manji, of Kingshill Drive, Harrow, admitted attacking his 81-year-old father on 29 November 2015.
The 45-year-old, who has paranoid schizophrenia, denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility.
He was handed a hospital order and a restriction order without a time limit.
Mark Heywood QC, mitigating, told the Old Bailey Manji had heard voices in his head which led him to believe his father was "some sort of zombie".
The court heard Amirali Manji was found unconscious and with scratches on his face by carers who visited the house later on 29 November.
Mr Manji senior was taken to hospital but never regained consciousness and he died on 3 December 2015.
Manji later told police his father had sworn at his mother "so I hit... [him] lots of times".
He also claimed "evil spirits control him", the court heard.
Prosecutor Mukul Chawla QC said Manji had "suffered for very many years from paranoid schizophrenia" which had "manifested itself from his late-teens or early-20s".
Sentencing, Judge Michael Topolski QC said the pressure of caring for both of his parents "given his ill health, placed intolerable pressure on him".
"This is a truly tragic case," he said.
