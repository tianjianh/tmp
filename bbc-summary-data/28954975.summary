The 6ft (1.8m) statue will stand at the entrance to Liverpool Central Station from early 2015.
Sculptor Rick Myers said it would celebrate "the new Liverpool and the massive number of firsts that have been achieved here".
Councillor Nick Small said the bird would be "a fantastic way of celebrating the city's proud history... seen by up to 50,000 people a day".
The statue will be dedicated to former Commercial District Partnership chief executive Paul Rice, who died in 2012.
The current chief executive Bill Addy said it was "fantastic to see that Paul, who did so much to improve and promote Liverpool, is to be remembered at a high profile city centre location in such a striking fashion".
"The fact that it's the emblem of the city and his beloved football club - his two great passions - is a fitting tribute."
Liver Birds Inc director Arthur Johnson said he expected the sculpture to be "a popular photo spot for tourists, football fans and shoppers".
