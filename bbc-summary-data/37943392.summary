Harlequin ladybirds are larger (between six and eight millimetres) and more dome-shaped that the native species.
They have been found in several Belfast parks and at the Titanic Memorial at the city hall.
Larvae were found at a number of the locations, proving that the species is now breeding in Northern Ireland.
The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) has issued a scientific circular asking for any sightings to be reported.
The Harlequin ladybird poses a threat to the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths.
Harlequins usually have reddish to brown legs and can have a distinctive M or W marking on the back of the head.
They were introduced to Europe as a way of controlling aphids, but escaped and spread.
They can fly long distances and sometimes hitch a lift on imported fruit and flowers.
Harlequin ladybirds can be found in a number of locations including Asia, Europe and North America.
The species has been recorded in Northern Ireland before - in 2007 and 2009.
But this is the first time there has been confirmation that they are breeding.
