The firm, which has had a presence in the city for more than 30 years, says it follows a restructuring review.
The office will shut later this year but a new "commercial trading site" will open in the city in September. Staff are to be offered redeployment around the UK, a spokesman said.
Union Unite called it a "big blow" for the finance sector in Birmingham.
Regional secretary, Gerard Coyne, said: "[Royal Sun Alliance] have made us aware of their intention to close the Birmingham office.

"We will now enter into discussions with them and try to get them to review their decision in Birmingham as it's a big blow to our members and the finance and insurance sector in the city."
Royal Sun Alliance told staff on Wednesday that 190 jobs were at risk of redundancy but was "committed" to staying in the city. It has been at its current site in Colmore Row for 20 years.
A spokesman said the firm's review showed it could work more effectively "if teams doing the same kind of work, or focused on the same kinds of customers, are situated together".
"Unfortunately, a number of our employees will be impacted by these changes and we will be working closely with them over the next few months and will look to redeploy our people wherever possible."
