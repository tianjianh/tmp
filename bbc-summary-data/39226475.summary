Police are to ask the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider a murder charge over the death of a 14-year-old girl more than 50 years ago.

The body of Elsie Frost was found near a tunnel under a railway line in Wakefield on 9 October 1965. She had been stabbed several times.
A man, 79, who was re-arrested earlier this week on the suspicion of her murder has been granted police bail.
West Yorkshire Police is sending a file of evidence to the CPS.
Police have been questioning the man after arresting him for a second time.
He is understood to be Peter Pickering and was arrested near Newbury, Berkshire, on Monday.
He has also been questioned about allegations of an unconnected kidnap and rape in 1972.
After granting him police bail on Thursday evening, Det Supt Nick Wallen said officers were sending a file to the CPS for it to consider charges of kidnap, rape and murder.
