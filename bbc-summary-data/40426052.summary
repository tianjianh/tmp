Yorkshire v Surrey: No play on third day at Headingley because of rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The third day of the day-night County Championship match between Yorkshire and Surrey at Headingley was abandoned without a ball bowled because of rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Umpires Richard Kettleborough and Neil Mallender called the day off at 15:30 BST after persistent rain on Wednesday.
It means Surrey's hopes of forcing a victory are all but over, having taken control thanks to Kumar Sangakkara's brilliant unbeaten 180 on day two.
Yorkshire are 27-1 in reply to the visitors' 516-7, still 489 runs behind.
