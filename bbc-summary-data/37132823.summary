West Heslerton: Offer made in £20m village sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An offer has been made to buy the majority of a North Yorkshire village after it was put up for sale following the death of its most recent owner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Heslerton, near Malton, has a 21-bedroom mansion, pub, petrol station, 43 homes and 2,116 acres of land.
It has been owned by the same family for more than 150 years.
Cundalls estate agents confirmed an offer for the estate was "on the table", but would not go into any further detail.
The sale, with a guide price of £20m, picked up media interest from national press in the UK, America and Australia earlier this year.
Eve Dawnay owned the estate until her death five years ago, with the family now deciding to sell.
About half a dozen properties in the village are privately-owned and, therefore, not included in the sale.
