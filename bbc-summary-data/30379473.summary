[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ludham Marshes From Upper Horning by Edward Seago will be auctioned at Christie's in London on Thursday.
The work was owned by the Queen Mother's servant William Tallon who assembled a collection of nine Seago works, buying some and receiving others as gifts.
It is one of 14 Seago works expected to sell for a total of £325,000.
Mr Tallon died aged 72 in November 2007 and eight of his Seagos were sold for £66,100 at Reeman Dansie Auctions in Colchester the following July.
The sale included Ludham Marshes which sold for £11,000.
In a foreword to a new biography of Edward Seago, by James Russell, published earlier this year, Prince Charles wrote: "My grandmother was particularly fond of Ted (Seago) and every year he would be invited, with other old friends, to stay at Sandringham during the week of the annual Flower Show at the end of July.
"There was always a wonderful moment, I remember, when Ted would give my grandmother his annual present of a painting - sometimes one of his great big oils and which, again, used to form a special part of the unique atmosphere which pervaded my grandmother's homes."
Mr Tallon was affectionately known as Backstairs Billy as his official title, in the Queen Mother's household, was Steward and Page of the Backstairs.
Seago (1919-1974), a self-taught artist who was born in Norwich and lived in Ludham, was best known for landscapes and portraits.
After Seago died his ashes were scattered over the Norfolk marshes.
