Brighton player Norwood grew up in nearby Burnley and had five years at Manchester United early in his career.
"I spent a lot of time in the city and it's like a second home to me," said the 26-year-old.
"It's devastating to think that young children who went to a concert did not come home to their parents."
Norwood added:"Growing up not far from Manchester in Burnley, 20 miles away, I spent a lot of time of Manchester in my own childhood.
"It's difficult to think about what happened because it's madness."
