Some 200 jobs will be lost in Gloucester as retailer Superdry moves its distribution arm out of the county.

Supergroup, which owns the brand, has announced it will begin moving to a distribution centre in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, later this year.
Its current units in Brockworth and Barnwood will continue to operate until the new unit fully opens next year.
The Cheltenham-based group said no units were available in Gloucestershire that could meet the company's needs.
It added it would be encouraging current distribution employees to make the 90-mile (145km) move with the company, but would proactively help those that could not to find other employment.
Suzanne Given, chief operating officer, said Supergroup was combining its two distribution centres to become efficient and give customers a better experience.
"We're doing it because our company has grown very significantly and we have some very ambitious growth plans for the future," she said.
"We asked five potential logistics partners to look throughout the UK, including Gloucester, to find a unit which in terms of layout and design would deliver great efficiency but also facilitate the capacity that we need to grow this company over the next five years.
"They came back with a variety of suggestions but unfortunately we were not able to find a unit in Gloucestershire."
John Leamon, from the Cheltenham Chamber of Commerce, said there was very little office, retail and warehouse accommodation available and the chamber was campaigning for more land to be developed.
"We get quite a lot of inquiries from businesses that want to move to Cheltenham and we have difficulty accommodating them," he added.
