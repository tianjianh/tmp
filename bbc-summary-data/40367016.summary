Office for National Statistics data, for June 2016, shows a 0.5% increase compared to 2015.
As a percentage, it is the lowest of the home nations and overall, the UK population rose by 538,000 to 65,648,000 with net migration accounting for 336,000, or 62.4%.
Since 2006, Wales' population has risen by 4.3%, again the lowest in the UK.
UK-wide, more births and fewer deaths made up 35.8% of the rise and 2016 saw the highest increase since 1947 when a surge of births after World War Two saw the population spike by 551,000.
