World number 12 Hawkins, who was runner-up in 2016, took a lengthy opening frame before fellow Englishman Selby levelled with a 76 break.
Breaks of 63 and 60 gave Hawkins a 3-1 lead at the break before world champion Selby pipped him to the fifth frame.
It was 4-3 when Selby produced a superb 101 before Hawkins hit back to take the next two frames and seal victory.

He will play England's Joe Perry, who also produced a shock with a 6-1 win over world number six and 2011 champion Ding Junhui (China) in the last of the quarter-finals.
The world number nine had breaks of 55, 63 and then 127 in the seventh and final frame to secure the victory.
Earlier, Hawkins said his 6-1 opening-round win over former world champion and compatriot Shaun Murphy gave him extra belief going into Friday's match against Selby.
"I was quietly confident in my game, I played well against Shaun," he said.
"The last few times against Mark I've played him instead of playing the table, but today I managed to settle better and play the balls."
English defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will face Hong Kong's Marco Fu in Saturday's other semi-final.
