[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United strengthened their position at the top of League One with victory over relegation-haunted Swindon at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
United took the lead on 29 minutes when Caolan Lavery seized on a mix-up in the Swindon defence to slot home.
And he turned provider six minutes later as his driven cross was smashed in from close range by Kieron Freeman.
Top-scorer Billy Sharp almost made it 3-0 but narrowly failed to get on the end of Jack O'Connell's teasing centre.
Charlie Colkett reduced the deficit within a minute of the re-start with a long-range shot and United were stunned seven minutes later when Ben Gladwin rifled home an equaliser from the edge of the penalty area.
Swindon's joy was short-lived as the Blades retook the lead on 58 minutes through Jay O'Shea's close-range strike after more poor defending from the hosts.
Paul Coutts sealed the win in stoppage-time from the penalty spot after Samir Carruthers had been fouled by Colkett.
