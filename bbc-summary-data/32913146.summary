Tom the cat had taken to the tree near his owner's home in Sawston, Cambridgeshire, on Friday, while being looked after by a neighbour.
Having tried everything to get the forlorn feline down, they eventually called the RSPCA who turned to the county's fire service to rescue him.
Tom was safely back on all four paws on solid ground after about an hour.
Officers from Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service came to Tom's rescue at about 13:45 BST on Wednesday.
"The cat was about 40ft up in a tree. We had to cut through brambles to even get to the tree," crew commander Jason Leach said.
"The owners were away on holiday and the neighbour who has been looking after him tried everything to get him down."
The neighbour had done the right thing by not attempting to rescue the moggy themselves, he said.
"It is important members of the public do not attempt to carry out rescues which could put themselves in danger," Mr Leach said.
The cat was said to be none-the-worse for his ordeal, although "a little hungry".
"We're happy Tom the cat is safe, and hopefully he won't go on any more adventures while his owner is on holiday," Mr Leach added.
