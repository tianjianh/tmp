Tyler Morgan: Dragons centre aiming to return to Wales midfield spot

Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan says he is starting to return to the level which earned him a spot in the Wales midfield.

The 21-year-old won the last of his three Welsh caps in the 2015 World Cup quarter-final defeat by South Africa.
A shoulder injury picked up in that match kept him out for most of the 2015-16 season but he has been an ever present in the Dragons side this term.
"I'm starting to get back to where I was," Morgan said.
He continued: "I'm confident that I can play at that level but I've just got to work myself back up there."
Morgan is hoping to impress for his region in their three remaining Pro12 matches and earn a spot on Wales' tour to face Samoa and Tonga in the summer.
"With the Lions tour there will be some spaces on the Wales tour. You imagine there'll be some boys going with the Lions with a few gaps for the young guys to come in," he added.
"I'd love to get out there and get a few caps under my belt and if that comes I'll be happy but if it doesn't I'll carry on working."
Dragons, who have won just four Pro12 matches this season, next face Scarlets on Judgement Day in the Principality Stadium and Morgan feels a number of players will have something to prove to the Wales coaches.
"The boys have some respect to earn and some dignity to get back and will be really up for it," Morgan said.
"It's a really exciting game and a massive stage for the boys to set an example for themselves and there's a summer tour coming up and a lot of boys have to put their hands up,
"Having just one or two from the Dragons in the Wales squad isn't acceptable any more,
"We want to get some numbers in there this season and I think we've got some player which could do that and Judgement Day will be the first step on that journey."
Morgan knows he will have his work cut out in his battle to keep Scarlets' backline including Wales centre pairing of Jonathan Davies and Scott Williams quiet.
"I feel I play better under pressure and on that stage with a lot of people watching," he continued.
"Jonathan is gold standard and it's a level I want to surpass really, while Scott is a quality player great in attack and in defence,
"You have to look out for him and Liam Williams and they have a really good attacking backline but every team has it's weaknesses and there are a few things we can exploit I think."
