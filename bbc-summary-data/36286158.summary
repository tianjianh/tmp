Starship Technologies said it had tested the robots in London, the US, and Estonian capital Tallinn.
Ahti Heinla told the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones that there had been no serious incidents of the public interfering with the robots.
He hoped they could begin their deliveries in London before the end of 2016.
