Harlequins have agreed to sign full-back Aaron Morris from Saracens ahead of the 2016-17 season.

The 21-year-old, who can also play on the wing, is yet to make his Premiership debut but has featured for Bedford on dual-registration terms.
Morris has represented England at under-20 level and helped them win the Junior World Championship in 2014.
"Aaron is a highly-regarded powerful and dynamic full-back," Quins director of rugby John Kingston said.
"He will provide competition across the back three, where we consistently lose players to international representation over the course of the season."
Harlequins finished seventh in the Premiership table this season and missed out on European Champions Cup qualification when they lost in the European Challenge Cup final to Montpellier last Friday.
The south London side have already signed Scotland international Ruaridh Jackson from Wasps but fellow fly-half Ben Botica and scrum-half Tito Tebaldi will leave The Stoop for Montpellier and Treviso respectively.
