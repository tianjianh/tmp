Ecuador orders partial recount of election votes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The electoral authorities in Ecuador have ordered a partial recount of the votes cast in the presidential election earlier this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officials said almost 1.3 million votes would be recounted after allegations of fraud by the losing candidate - former banker Guillermo Lasso.
Mr Lasso has refused to accept anything less than a full recount.
His rival, the Socialist candidate, Lenin Moreno, won the second round with a slim majority of 51.15%.
He is set to replace his fellow socialist, President Rafael Correa, at the end of May.
The recount of the equivalent of 1.2 million votes, which would account for 12% of the total votes cast, will take place on Tuesday in public in the capital Quito.
The council has not disclosed what sort of ballots would be recounted.
