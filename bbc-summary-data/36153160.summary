Holyrood 2016: Scottish Labour manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour has published its manifesto ahead of the Holyrood election on 5 May. Here are some of the key points from the document, which can be read in full here.

In her introduction to the manifesto, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale sets out her ambition of creating a Scotland where a young person's life chances are determined by their ambition, potential and work rate rather than where they were born.
She argues that the only way of making that vision a reality is by investing in education and vital public services, and says her party is "focused on using the powers of our Scottish Parliament to invest in the future", rather than "re-running the old battles of the past".
And Ms Dugdale says the election is about which party is willing to use the new devolved powers to "stop the cuts and invest in the future".
Labour points out that it created the NHS, which it describes as the party's proudest achievement, and says it remains committed to keeping it in public hands and free at the point of delivery.

The manifesto says that voting to remain in the United Kingdom in the independence referendum in 2014 was the "right decision for Scotland" and that it is now time for both sides in the debate to "move on".
It rules out another independence referendum within the five-year term of the next parliament, and says the new devolved powers mean Holyrood can now "make different decisions, and act in the best interest of the people of Scotland".
The manifesto also makes clear Scottish Labour's support for the UK remaining a member of the EU, and the party's opposition to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
And it proposes freezing Scottish government ministerial pay, and ensuring any party that has a majority in the parliament does not also hold the majority of committee convenorships and should not nominate a member for the position of presiding officer.
Following a vote at the Scottish Labour conference, the party says it will make a submission to the UK party's National Defence Review opposing the renewal of Trident.
This would be subject to a Defence Diversification Agency guaranteeing the retention of all existing jobs.
