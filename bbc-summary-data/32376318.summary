Many spoke of Spacey's "incredible" work in revitalising the London venue during his 11 years in charge.
Guests at Sunday's event included Downton stars Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, Jeremy Irons, Eddie Izzard and singer Beverley Knight.
There were also musical tributes from Sting and Annie Lennox.
Sting performed two songs including Every Breath You Take, while Lennox's set featured No More I Love Yous and Here Comes the Rain Again.
In his closing speech, Spacey referred to the Old Vic's lack of government subsidy wondered why the theatre was not treated as "a national treasure".
He also said the "best thing about the Old Vic is its future".
There were recorded tributes from James Bond director Sam Mendes, former US president Bill Clinton and singer Elton John.
During his time at the Old Vic, Spacey has directed two productions and starred in nine - including an acclaimed version of Richard III.
The Hollywood star has also continued with screen projects such as Netflix's remake of House of Cards, which won him an acting Golden Globe this year.
Mark Gatiss, who starred in All About My Mother at the Old Vic in 2008, said Spacey had been "amazingly supportive" during the run.
"He's done an incredible job, he's totally revitalised this place and it's the end of an era."
McGovern, who was at drama school with Spacey, recalled: "He was the brilliant person he is today. We always knew that he had it."
A week ago Spacey was honoured at the Olivier Awards for his contribution to British theatre.
Sunday's gala show at the Old Vic included a cast reunion of some of the cast of Spacey's inaugural production at the theatre in 2004.
Bonneville and Drop the Dead Donkey stars Neil Pearson and Stephen Tompkinson had appeared in Cloaca by Dutch playwright Maria Goos.
The Downton actor recalled how the play - the title is the Latin for sewer - had garnered poor reviews.
"It didn't get the best critical reaction, but we had an absolute blast," he told the BBC on the red carpet before hosting the show.
He recalled that not everyone had been keen about Spacey taking over at the theatre, with some thinking he would "scurry back the Hollywood".
"There was snide undercurrent from the British asking who's this Yank who thinks he can come over here and run our hallowed Old Vic? But he's proved them wrong.
"There were troubled times, programming a theatre like this is a delicate thing and you make mistakes sometimes. But think of the fantastic hits he's had over the years.
"This place is in good nick now, and is a fantastic platform for [incoming artistic director] Matthew Warchus to build on."
Warchus, who directed the hit musical Matilda and the film Pride, is set to reveal his opening season at the Old Vic this week.
