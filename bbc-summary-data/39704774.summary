Her body was found a mile from the town centre in Rochdale Canal the following April.
A 68-year-old man from Bradford was arrested by police on Tuesday morning.

He was released earlier.
A 63-year-old man arrested in November on the suspicion of Lindsay's murder remains on police bail.
Lindsay's body was found by two canal workers who were checking the water for debris.
One of them was Andy Glover, from Mytholmroyd, who said at first sight he thought it was a sheep but then realised it was the missing teenager.
On the day Lindsay was last seen, she left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT and met her mother at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge.
The last known sighting of her was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes on Crown Street.
In April, police said a new DNA profile had been identified which it hoped would lead them to identify the killer.
