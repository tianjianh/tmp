Queen of the South directors oppose fans' board bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish Championship club's directors are to oppose a supporter bid to get a seat on the board.

The issue is on the agenda for discussion at the annual general meeting of Queen of the South.
Fan group the Queens Trust secured the backing of Dumfries and Galloway Council in order to allow the subject to be debated.
However, the Dumfries club's directors have said they do not support the move and will vote against the resolution.
The supporters' organisation has been trying for some time to secure a place as a director or a non-voting seat on the board.

It has taken a long time for the Queens Trust to get a shot at their directorial goal.
Council support, needed to get the issue discussed, came too late for last year's annual general meeting.
The subject is now up for discussion next month but the current board has already made its feelings known on the subject.
They have appointed a liaison officer to work with fans but are not prepared to offer even a non-voting seat on the board.
It will be up to all the club's shareholders to decide the ultimate outcome of this particular match.
It now looks likely to end in gallant defeat for the supporters' group unless they can pull off a genuine shock result.
It needed the backing of the local authority - and its shareholding in the club - in order to put the item on the agenda for the AGM on 20 February.
Although the subject will be discussed, the board of the Palmerston Park side has made it clear it does not support the move and will be voting against it.
The club has previously said that its door is "always open" for an "open and honest dialogue" with fans.
It has also appointed a supporter liaison officer to improve the relationship between fans and directors.
