An exhibition of 40 photographs of David Bowie, some previously unseen, is to begin a nationwide tour in July.

Norwich is the first stop for David & I, which features pictures taken by rock photographer Denis O'Regan.
O'Regan was official tour photographer when most of the photos were taken between 1978 and 1990.
Exhibition organisers said that as well as live shots, many images featured the late singer out and about in countries he was touring.
O'Regan said: "It represented me being on tour, and also doing stuff on the tour that had nothing to do with the tour.
"David had never been photographed in this way before... this was the first time anyone had really been given that access.
"If you're there all the time, you get a lot more coverage."
The touring exhibition was arranged by Mark Overton, who runs a gallery at Carleton Forehoe near Norwich.
He said about half the O'Regan photos will be fresh for the public and they were mainly taken on the Serious Moonlight, Glass Spider and Sound & Vision tours between 1983 and 1990.
Mr Overton said: "Denis and David were good friends, so it's a tribute to Denis he was allowed to take so many photographs in so many different circumstances.
"Having reviewed an awful lot of photographers, Denis's work with David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Duran Duran and Thin Lizzy is tremendous and I'm not sure there are too many photographers with that range in their portfolio - so he's very important, spans a very long time and he is still working."
The one-day exhibition starts at the Mini dealership at Forest Way in Norwich on 28 July and then visits other showrooms in Brighton, Chelmsford, Birmingham, York, Cambourne in Cambridgeshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow between August and November.
