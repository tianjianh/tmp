Notts County officials hope hosting the first senior international fixture at Meadow Lane in the ground's 106-year history will lead to more England matches being played there in future.

England Women will play their final home Euro 2017 qualifier in Nottingham against Estonia on 15 September.
Notts Ladies chief executive Matt Alexander said: "I'd like to think if we get a good turn out that we may get another one and other England games.
"It's fantastic news for the city."
Meadow Lane has been home to Notts County - the world's oldest Football League club -  since 1910, while the Women's Super League side by the same name moved to the ground in 2014.
Since their relocation to the city venue, with a capacity of nearly 20,000, Notts County Ladies have had one of the biggest average attendances in England's top flight competition.
The Lady Magpies are averaging crowds of just under 1,000 this season.
Last year Notts set a club attendance record of 2,057, while the biggest crowd at a women's football fixture in the city is 24,582, set across the River Trent at Nottingham Forest's City Ground for the 2008 Women's FA Cup final.
"It's good to have something like this on your doorstep," Alexander told BBC Radio Nottingham.
England Women have already qualified for Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.
