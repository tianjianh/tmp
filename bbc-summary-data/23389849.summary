The 56-year-old, who was married to Downton Abbey actor David Robb, appeared in Scottish drama Take The High Road for nine years.
Her body was found at the station just after 08:30 BST on Wednesday.
Her agent Katie Threlfall said the "well-loved" and "vibrant" actress had taken her own life, describing the death as "unbelievably shocking".
She said: "It's just a terrible, terrible loss of a wonderful woman. Nobody had any idea it was going to happen. Her husband is deeply shocked.
"She was a wonderful woman who had troubles and she will be very much missed. She was so well-loved and was the most vibrant character you could hope to meet. It is just a tragedy."
Fellow actors have paid tribute to the actress, whose television career included appearances in Taggart, EastEnders, The Bill and Heartbeat.
Gary Hollywood, who also appeared in the long-running soap Take The High Road, wrote on Twitter: "'Numb' RIP to my 'lady Laird' Briony McRoberts xxx."
British Transport Police said a file had been prepared for the coroner.
Her husband David Robb, who plays Dr Clarkson in Downton Abbey, has been a volunteer for The Samaritans in London for 25 years.
