It was top against bottom at Shamrock Park but Portadown put up stiff resistance against the champions.
The only goal came on 66 minutes with Whyte converting from the spot after Jordan Owens was fouled by Ken Oman.
Linfield had a much easier passage to their three points as they hit four goals for the second time this week.
Chris Hegarty's own goal set the Blues on their way before strikes from Jamie Mulgrew, Niall Quinn and Ross Gaynor.
Ballymena were the only other side to score more than a single goal but they had to wait until the 77th minute for the opener, courtesy of Kyle Owens.
Willie Faulkner hammered home to seal a win which keeps United third and restores confidence after the 4-1 home defeat by Linfield on Tuesday.
There was late, late drama at Solitude as McDaid popped up with a composed finish in the fifth minute of added time.
It was an eventful afternoon for Glenavon, which included Lurgan Blues keeper Jonathan Tuffey missing a penalty and striker Joel Copper dismissed late on for two yellows.
Greg Moorhouse ensured victory for the Lurgan side by slotting in after Rhys Marshall's shot was parried.
Jamie McGonigle hit the bottom corner early in the second half to give Coleraine victory and end Glentoran's unbeaten run of five games.
