[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham City 3-0 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham secured their first home win since March with a determined display against a toothless Norwich side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacques Maghoma crossed for David Davis to head in at the far post before Che Adams missed the target for the hosts after rounding the goalkeeper.
Robert Tesche hit the bar from close range but Clayton Donaldson netted from the spot after a Steven Whittaker foul.
Blues continued to dominate and Donaldson cut out a poor Alex Tettey backpass to slot home a third goal.
The Canaries, who started the afternoon unbeaten and in fourth, had not trailed in the Championship this season prior to Davis' opener, but lacked ideas in attack without the injured Cameron Jerome.
Gary Rowett's side had previously dropped five points from leading positions, but the closest Norwich came to scoring was a Jonny Howson effort which was ruled out for offside.
Birmingham could have had an earlier penalty, with Jonathan Grounds going down under an Elliott Bennett challenge, only for appeals to be waved away.
The result leaves Birmingham ninth in the table and Norwich 11th.
REACTION: Norwich City manager Alex Neil speaks to BBC Radio Norfolk
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett:
"With Clayton Donaldson going away on international duty I thought that might be at the back of his mind. He has come in for some criticism for not scoring but I thought he was magnificent.
"It was a really pleasing win after a disappointing home defeat against Wolves last week. The players showed a lot of character on and off the ball and it was the hardest we have worked, let alone the best we have played.
"Norwich did not have too many chances. They are a good team and not having Cameron Jerome available would make it more difficult the way they played."
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"It is never nice but it was the first away Championship game we have lost since I've been at the club and it was extremely frustrating. If you do not do the basics it is going to be difficult.
"The first goal was a cross which should have been dealt with while the second was a penalty which was unnecessary and the third was a loose pass which was a common theme in our play.
"To be fair some of these players have performed really well in the past but did not do themselves justice in this game.
"The game ranks as one of the poorest since I've been at the club, without question. I do not think we competed.
"It was a shock to watch that performance and for some of the players it was the poorest I have seen them play, which was disappointing."
