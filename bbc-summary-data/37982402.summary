Bear with tin can stuck in its mouth 'a litter warning'

The senior wildlife officer of a remote Russian island has called on people to be careful when discarding litter after the emergence of photos of a polar bear cub with a tin can stuck in its mouth.

Alexander Gruzdev, head of Wrangel Island's nature reserve, told the BBC the cub was unable to move the can for two weeks and was becoming stressed.
It is believed that the jagged edges of the can got wedged in the cub's mouth.
The can was removed after rangers shot the bear with tranquilisers.
The bear was spotted by them earlier in the autumn with the condensed milk can in its mouth as it was following its mother who was scavenging for food on the remote island, The Siberian Times reported last week.
The rangers tranquilised both the cub and its mother before carefully removing the can from the yearling's tongue with the minimum of bleeding.
"Happily, it all ended well and I hope there will be no similar situations in the future," Mr Gruzdev told the BBC.
"But the case highlights the risk to wild animals from man's garbage."
Mr Gruzdev said that there have been several other cases of human litter affecting the island's wildlife.
"Animals can eat plastic bags in which food has been stored," he said.
"We have even had a case of a fox thrusting its head into a bottle bank and being unable to free itself.
"We have to constantly remind people about the best ways of disposing of their rubbish."
Mr Gruzdev said the offending can was discarded by a group of workers who ironically were tasked with clearing debris on the island - some of it dating from from Soviet times.
"The workers used a barrel as a trash bin," he said.  "They gathered everything left from their camp, including empty cans, so later this could be collected and taken away along with other garbage they had collected.
"The bear cub found this barrel before it was taken away. It was unfortunate  - the cub's mouth got stuck in the can, probably with its tongue, while trying to lick the inside."
The rangers say no lasting damage was done to the cub. and efforts are continuing to remove tons of rubbish that could harm polar bears and other wild animals.
