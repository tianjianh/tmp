[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bronze sculpture discovered during a "routine house valuation" in the Scottish Borders has sold at auction for £386,500.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18th Century work, Ganymede and the Eagle, is by Italian sculptor Massimiliano Soldani-Benzi.
It was sold at auction in Edinburgh this week by Lyon & Turnbull.
It had been estimated to sell for between £100,000 and £150,000 but ended up going under the hammer for more than twice the top estimate.
