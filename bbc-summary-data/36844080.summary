A passer-by who stepped in to stop a woman being assaulted in an Alloa street may have saved her from serious injury, police said.

Officers said the woman was pushed to the ground before being repeatedly kicked to the head and body on Saturday.
The attack happened at 17:00 as the woman walked between Greenfield Street and Sutherland Avenue.
She believes there were four people present but only one assaulted her.
The woman said that the attacker wore blue trainers and a black Adidas tracksuit, but could not provide any more details.
A Forth Valley spokesman said: "However, the assault has been witnessed and indeed halted by a passer-by who has intervened.
"As such the identity of the person responsible is sought as is the witness who perhaps prevented this woman receiving a serious injury."
