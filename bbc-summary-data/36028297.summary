Thepchaiya Un-Nooh misses final-black maximum again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh missed the final black of a 147 attempt for the second time this season during World Championship qualifying.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world number 35 rattled the jaw of the pocket against Anthony McGill in the fourth frame of their final qualifying round to level at 2-2.
The miss cost him an £8,500 bonus, plus the £1,000 highest break prize.
He also missed the black on 140 against Neil Robertson in the third round of the UK Championship in December.
The 30-year-old later claimed he did not know that there was a £44,000 prize for a maximum.
Un-Nooh, who has never qualified for the World Championship, currently trails Scotland's McGill 6-3 at the interval.
