[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Essex Police officer was attacked by the driver in Chigwell, who got into the patrol car and drove off.
The police car was later found in Romford with the Labrador dog unharmed. The officer sustained minor injuries.
Police are searching for Tony Turner, 35, of Vincent Road, Dagenham, over the crash, attack and theft on Saturday.
The initial crash involved one vehicle - a grey BMW - and the officer was carrying out the breath test at the side of the road when he was assaulted.
Police said Vincent Road was Mr Turner's last known address and he was also known to frequent Romford and Barkingside in east London, Broadstairs in Kent and other towns on the border of Essex and Greater London.
Ch Supt Sean O'Callaghan said: "This was a nasty assault on a police officer carrying out his duties to keep the people of Essex safe.
"[Mr Turner] is not someone that we would advise members of the public to approach."
He was described as being 5ft 7ins tall, with short brown hair and a tattoo of the name Kirsten on his left arm.
