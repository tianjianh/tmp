[SN]TITLE[SN]
England's Joe Launchbury banned for two weeks for kick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England lock Joe Launchbury has been banned for two weeks for kicking an opponent during his side's victory over Fiji, ruling him out of the remaining autumn internationals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident occurred when Launchbury, 25, tried to kick the ball away at the base of a ruck but made contact with Fiji centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma.
The ban rules him out of England's Tests against Argentina and Australia.
Launchbury accepted the act, missed by the officials, warranted a red card.
The kick was deemed reckless rather than intentional by an independent disciplinary committee, resulting in what would have been a four-week suspension.
However, this was reduced to two weeks because of mitigating factors, including the Wasps forward's guilty plea, his previous clean record and good conduct at the hearing.
