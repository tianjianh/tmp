Goals in the second quarter from veteran Alan Sothern and fellow forward Jeremy Duncan gave the home side a 2-0 lead at half-time.
A Muhammad Rizwan Jr strike shortly after the restart made it a one-goal game before Sothern's fine solo effort made it 3-1.
Umar Bhutta scored a late consolation for the visitors.
It was Ireland's second win over Pakistan as they had won Saturday's match 3-2 after a draw two days earlier.
The series was part of Ireland's preparations for the World League semi-finals in Johannesburg.
Next month's South African tournament doubles up as the main qualifying tournament for next year's World Cup.
Later this month, Ireland will play against Germany, Spain and Austria at the Hamburg Masters which takes place from 22-25 June.
