[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crocketford man jailed over sex assault on young girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 61-year-old man who used sweets and toys to lure a six-year-old girl into sexual activity has been jailed for 45 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Berridge, of Stonehouse Cottage, Crocketford, was also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
He admitted sexually assaulting the girl over a 30-month period to May last year.
He also admitted filming another girl in a bathroom and possessing indecent images of children.
Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how the offences came to light when the girl revealed to her brother that Berridge had been touching her.
Solicitor Vicki McMinn told the court there was not much she could say in mitigation but added that he was genuinely remorseful for the effects of his behaviour on the girl and her family.
Sheriff George Jamieson said that the starting point for the sentence would have been five years, but this would be discounted because of the early plea of guilty which saved the young girl the distress of having to give evidence in court.
