[SN]TITLE[SN]
South Wales detective Christopher Evans cleared of £30,000 theft

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A detective has been cleared of stealing £30,000 seized from a safe during a raid in Swansea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Con Christopher Evans, 38, from Llangennech, had always denied taking the cash in Penlan in April 2011.
Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees directed the jury to find Mr Evans not guilty of two charges.
The case against ex-Det Sgt Stephen Phillips, 47, of Swansea, and Det Con Michael Stokes, 35, from Glynneath, continues. They deny the charges.
Mr Phillips is accused of two thefts, while Mr Stokes denies three charges.
After Mr Evans was acquitted, the jury at Cardiff Crown Court heard the final prosecution evidence against Mr Phillips.
The jury was told that Mr Phillips was dismissed from South Wales Police after admitting stealing cash in a separate incident.
It followed an "integrity test", in which the former officer was filmed during a staged scenario.
He was seen taking £240 from a coat and £10 from a bedside cabinet.
It was also claimed Mr Phillips stole £8,100 in cash from a police evidence storage room, which was said to be the money seized from from a safe during a raid at a house in Swansea in 2011.
The trial continues.
