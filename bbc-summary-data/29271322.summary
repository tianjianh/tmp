Scots No vote sparks call for more powers for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones has spoken about what the Scottish independence No vote could mean for future devolution in Wales.

Politicians across all parties have said the referendum will mean fundamental changes to the current devolution settlement.
Prime Minister David Cameron said Wales must have more say in its own affairs.
Mr Jones earlier tweeted he was pleased Scotland voted to stay in the Union.
In a speech on Friday morning he said Wales could not play second fiddle when the future of devolution was discussed.
The BBC announced Scotland had voted to reject independence at about 06:15 BST on Friday. Nationally, the margin of victory was about 55% to 45%.
The result brought an end to a two-year campaign and talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland.
Scotland has voted to stay in the United Kingdom - but that doesn't mean it 's back to business as usual.  Politicians have been falling over themselves to say that nothing will be the same again, and with good reason.
In Scotland itself there's a job of work to be done to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign.  It won't be easy when the country as a whole voted no but the largest city, Glasgow, went for yes.
But attention's already turning to what it means for the rest of the UK.  The prime minister is due to make a statement later this morning, and he's expected to announce a version of "English laws for English issues".
That would mean stopping Welsh MPs voting on some issues at Westminster; a beguilingly simple solution to English resentment, but there may be trouble ahead.  Working out what's exactly is or isn't devolved to Wales isn't easy - a few disputes have already ended up in the Supreme Court.
There have been more hints overnight that the Wales Bill will be altered before it becomes law, to remove restrictions on the income tax powers being proposed for the Welsh government.
And then there's the money question - has the Scottish referendum finally cleared the way for a new system of funding the Welsh government, to replace the Barnett formula that so many Welsh politicians argue is unfair?
There's a feeling that there's plenty up for grabs - but the exact shape of things to come is far from being decided.
