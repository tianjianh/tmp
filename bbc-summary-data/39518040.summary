Man to stand trial on terrorism charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of terrorism charges will go on trial at the High Court in Aberdeen later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Ward, 24, is charged with possessing a cache of weapons, manuals, racist flags and videos with the intention of committing acts of terror.
At a preliminary hearing, defence lawyer Drew Mackenzie said his client denied the charges, which are alleged to have been committed in Banff, Aberdeenshire, between 2011 and 2014.
The trial is due to begin in November.
Mr Ward was not in court for Thursday's hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
It is alleged that he had in his possession a quantity of neo-Nazi, anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish texts, images, videos, flags and audio files.
He is also accused of possessing knives, knuckledusters, batons, a stun gun, a mobile phone signal jammer, a bug detection device, a catapult and ball, a ninja star, rocket tubes and a battle club.
Prosecutors further claim that Mr Ward had steel ball bearings and instructions on how to use them to prepare an improvised explosive device, and had downloaded material on how to reactivate deactivated bullets.
It is also alleged he had manuals showing how to manufacture explosives and chemical and biological poisons, and that he had the address of every mosque in Aberdeen.
This offence under the 2006 Terrorism Act is alleged to have been committed between 26 February 2011 and 21 November 2014 at two addresses in Banff.
He has also been charged, under the 2000 Terrorism Act, of collecting or recording information likely to be useful to anyone committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism.
It is alleged he did this by downloading files about making firearms, manufacturing explosives and producing and using chemical and biological poisons, onto a hard drive, a flash drive, a pen drive memory stick and a laptop computer.
