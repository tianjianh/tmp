[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox has appeared in court charged with six new historical sex offences - taking the number of his alleged victims to nine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Fox denied six new counts of indecent assault - relating to three girls aged under 16 in 1987 and 1988 - at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
He has previously denied seven counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching without consent.
He is due to stand trial for the original charges on 5 November.
Another legal hearing on 6 October will decide where a trial for the new alleged offences, said to have occurred in Euston, north London, will take place.
He was released on bail on condition he does not contact any of the complainants.
Mr Fox, from Fulham in south-west London, rose to fame presenting the chart show on Capital Radio.
He was also a judge on ITV's Pop Idol talent show between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman.
At a previous hearing, prosecutors said allegations against Mr Fox show a "consistent and determined pattern of sexual predatory behaviour".
They include claims that he assaulted a girl as young as 13 at a theme park and allegations he repeatedly assaulted a complainant at Capital Radio's studios in London's Leicester Square.
