Kevin O'Brien believes Ireland can finally claim a home win over a top-ranked nation when they host Sri Lanka in two one-day internationals.

The teams meet in Malahide on Thursday and again on Saturday.
"We are missing that elusive victory against one of the top teams," said all-rounder O'Brien.
Captain William Porterfield added: "This is a big opportunity. There's no reason why we can't come away with a series win."
Ireland have taken some notable scalps at World Cups, memorably beating England at the 2011 tournament in Bangalore when O'Brien smashed 113 off 63 balls.
But Porterfield is aware Ireland to make a statement on home soil.
"We've played some very good cricket here and put ourselves in good positions," he said.
"We've had Australia, Pakistan and England on the racks, but we've got to follow that through for the full 100 overs and I've confidence we can do that this week."
Sri Lanka are coming off a Test series defeat by England and favourable weather conditions in Dublin should suit Ireland in Thursday's first ODI (10:45 BST).
"Sri Lanka are a young team, they've lost some experienced players but they'll still have some very good players in that line-up," said O'Brien.
"Even though it's a little green wicket they're still going to have bowlers who are very skilful and can get something out of that wicket.
"If we don't bowl as well as we can do, they'll have batters who can put the bad balls away.
"Everything is falling slightly in our favour but we still have to go out and perform well."
