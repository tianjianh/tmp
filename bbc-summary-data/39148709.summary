That means All-Star Mattie Donnelly will be on the bench at Healy Park, along with Sean Cavanagh, who has yet to start a match this season.
Last weekend's meeting with Cavan was postponed because of a flooded pitch.
There are two all-Ulster Division One games on Saturday night, with Cavan hosting Donegal.
Monaghan have named a strong side with Drew Wylie, Darren Hughes, Kieran Hughes, Shane Carey, Karl O'Connell and star forward Conor McManus all included.
Cavan are seeking their first win of the campaign, having had a draw and a defeat so far while Donegal, who drew with Dublin last week, have three points from three games.
Forward Patrick McBrearty is back in the Donegal team having recovered from a groin injury while Darrach O'Connor is also drafted in as Eoin McHugh and Jamie Brennan drop out of the starting line-up.
Monaghan are top of Division One with five points but their opponents Tyrone are also unbeaten having played one game less.
