A design by Malcolm Robertson showing Scottish commanders William Wallace and Andrew de Moray shoulder-to-shoulder was selected.
The project is backed by the Guardians of Scotland Trust, which seeks to promote recognition of the two men and their role in Scottish history.
De Moray died later in the year of the battle of injuries he had sustained.
Trust chairman councillor Fergus Wood said: "The Trust aims to create an icon at Stirling Bridge which will bring together a glorious past and an exciting future for public art in Scotland.
"We are working in partnership with various organisations and companies to gives this important site its rightful place.
"In the future, visitors will come here and experience a sense of the site in Stirling and its significant place at the heart of Scotland's story."
Mr Robertson said: "I felt the need to steer away from conflict with this design, even though it is based around a battle.
"It's about building bridges and the common endeavour of the two men and the way they came together in order to get a job done.
"I also wanted to take advantage of the site's midway relationship to the Wallace Monument and Stirling Castle by creating a figurative artwork that not only sits in the present, but looks back to the past and forward to the future at the same time."
The 1297 Battle of Stirling Bridge is one of the most significant in Scottish history but has had no prominent marker on the site until now.
Setting up a monumental artwork to honour Wallace and de Moray was a central purpose of the Guardians of Scotland Trust.
It was established in 2011 and is backed by the Andrew de Moray Project and the Society of William Wallace.
The Battle of Stirling Bridge was part of the first war of Scottish independence.
Wallace and de Moray had been fighting a guerrilla war against English forces. Wallace largely in the south and de Moray mainly in the north of Scotland.
They came together on the north bank of the River Forth on 11 September 1297, to protect a crossing point on the river.
Lined up against them was an English force led by the Earl of Surrey and Hugh de Cressingham.
The Scots allowed part of the English force to cross the river by the bridge, then attacked while their opponents were divided by the river.
The battle was considered a decisive victory for the Scottish forces. Wallace and de Moray were appointed Guardians of Scotland in the absence of a legitimate king.
