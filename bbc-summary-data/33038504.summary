[SN]TITLE[SN]
Champions League final: Agony and ecstasy of a Turin house party

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You're in Turin, it's nearly time for the Champions League final between Juventus and Barcelona and you're wondering where to watch the game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
So, what do you do?
Watch in the local fan park? Perhaps find a nice bar?
Nope... the BBC World Service's Steve Crossman got an invite to a house party to watch the game, and charted the range of emotions felt by his hosts throughout the evening as Barcelona won 3-1.
Barcelona score after four minutes - not the best start to any party!
Spirits are raised when Juventus begin to improve...
It's all a bit of a blur as Juventus level through Alvaro Morata...
Parity is short-lived as, 13 minutes later, Luis Suarez makes it 2-1...
Meanwhile, on the streets of Barcelona...
Who thinks the ref was right to chalk out a Neymar goal for handball?
It's all over - Barcelona win 3-1 - but the Juventus fans are still proud, and even let Steve (second from left) in to a picture
