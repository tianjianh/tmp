Forfar Athletic maintained their one-point lead at the top of Scottish League Two after beating Clyde 3-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Montrose replaced Elgin City in the promotion play-off places after a 1-0 win away to Berwick Rangers.
Elgin were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Stirling Albion.
Cowdenbeath remain three points adrift at the bottom after losing 2-1 at home to second-placed Arbroath while Edinburgh City are safe after beating Annan Athletic 2-0.
Last season's Lowland League winners Edinburgh won promotion to the Scottish Professional Football League after winning last season's League Two play-off final.
Former Scotland striker Craig Beattie fired the capital side in front against Annan and set up Lewis Allan for their second.
Both teams had players sent off in stoppage time, Annan's Darren Ramsay dismissed for serious foul play and City's Chris McKee picking up a second booking.
Headers from Danny Denholm, David Cox and Thomas O'Brien gave Forfar a comfortable win and left Clyde three points off bottom and above Berwick on goal difference.
Berwick fell behind to Chris Templeman's strike and could not recover.
Stirling were 2-0 up against Elgin, Darren Smith and Dylan Bikey netting, but Jamie Reid and Archie MacPhee replied for the hosts.
Shots from Steven Doris and Ryan McCord put Arbroath in control against Cowden, who pulled one back through Scott Rumsby's header.
