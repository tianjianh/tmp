Chelsea's attitude was not good enough in their 3-0 defeat by Arsenal, according to manager Antonio Conte.

Alexis Sanchez, Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil scored as the Blues suffered their first league loss against their London rivals since October 2011.
"We must work a lot because we are a great team only on paper. [From] the first minute we did not have the right attitude," Conte said.
Chelsea are eighth in the table, eight points behind leaders Manchester City.
Conte pinpointed Chelsea's defence as the area in most urgent need of improvement, after a run of four games in which they have conceded at least two goals.
"We have not got the balance and now is the moment to consider everything. It is incredible to concede three goals," he said.
"We must find a solution."
Conte refused to be drawn on whether his side were still title contenders, saying that they must rediscover their "continuity".
"The most important thing is to work and not think about the situation," he added.
