Sheila Boon, 55, transferred money from the woman, who was in a nursing home in Bournemouth, to herself.
She then claimed her relative had no money and made claims for care costs to the local borough council.
Boon, of Weybridge, Surrey, had denied fraud by abuse of position but was found guilty after a three-week trial.
She was sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Monday.
Boon spent the money on property, travel expenses and tried to buy a car, police said.
Det Sgt Paul Smith, of Dorset Police, said the investigation into Boon had been "protracted and difficult" due to the fact the victim could not be interviewed "because of her age and frailties".
"The defendant took the decision to secure her inheritance and invested her relative's money without her consent before it was all spent on care fees," he said.
