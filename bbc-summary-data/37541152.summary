Doncaster Rovers: Gary McSheffrey and Mitchell Lund out for several months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster pair Mitchell Lund and Gary McSheffrey will be out for several more months because of injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McSheffrey, 34, will miss 16 weeks after having surgery on a knee injury which has prevented him from making a senior appearance this season.
Lund, 20, has been out for a month with a kidney problem which was expected to keep him out until November, but his return has been pushed back to January.
Doncaster are second in League Two after their opening 11 games this term.
