The suspect was seen getting into a dark-coloured car being driven by an accomplice following the shooting, Det Ch Insp Ericson said.
No one has yet been arrested.
Police said a key witness was an "innocent member of the public" whose car was flagged down by the victim following the shooting.
The man was driven to the Volunteer pub, half a mile away from the hotel, where paramedics tried to save him before he died.
A post-mortem examination will be taking place on the victim's body later.
