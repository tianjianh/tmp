The former West Ham trainee had a loan spell with the U's in 2011 when he scored six goals in 14 appearances.
"He can play wide and up top with his pace and athleticism," Oxford manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford.
"He had such a good time when he was last here. He knows we've got ambitions to play in the Championship and that's obviously where he wants to play too."
Hall joined Bolton is the summer of 2013, and played 34 times for the Lancashire club, but only 16 of them were starts.
