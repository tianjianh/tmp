The colourful event, held on Monday, featured a parade from Potternewton Park through Chapeltown and Harehills.
The carnival, believed to be the oldest event of its kind in Europe, was launched by Arthur France who developed the idea after becoming homesick.
Organiser Susan Pitter, said the event marked 46 years of "sharing a love of carnival and Caribbean culture".
