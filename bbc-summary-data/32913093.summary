Casement Park: Stadium safety inquiry questions officials

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Stormont inquiry into safety concerns over the planned redevelopment of Belfast's Casement Park is questioning senior civil servants.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee is investigating claims by a Sport NI safety expert about emergency evacuation procedures being ignored.
Paul Scott also claimed he was bullied into dropping his objections to the plans.
However, Sports Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n has refuted those claims.
She said she first heard of his allegations when he appeared before the committee.
The inquiry is being briefed by the permanent secretary of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Dr Denis McMahon, and DCAL official Cynthia Smith.
