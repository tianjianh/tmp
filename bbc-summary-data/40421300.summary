Consultant paediatrician and deputy medical director, Dr Simon Frazer, said: "It was an honour to welcome The Princess Royal to our new children's wards and to meet our patients and staff so she could see for herself our impressive facilities.
"The wards have been designed to meet our patients' needs and have enabled children's inpatient services to be brought together, providing greater access to the latest technology for treatment."
The new wing provides 104 beds spread across the two elderly and two children's wards. It also has improved facilities for the family and carers of patients.
