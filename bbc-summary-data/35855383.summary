The man, 32, was descending the peak when he fell from Swirral Edge into Brown Cove shortly before 14:00 GMT on Saturday.
Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team, the Great North Air Ambulance and HM Coastguard took part in the rescue.
The walker, from the south of England,  is the third person to fall on the peak since the start of 2016.
A spokesman said: "Whilst many of the Lakeland Fells are without snow, Helvellyn remains covered in hard icy snow on many of its ascents and descents.
"Walkers and climbers should be adequately equipped for full winter conditions on Helvellyn."
The man was airlifted to Newcastle's RVI hospital with serious injuries.
