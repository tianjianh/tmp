Whoever wins Saturday's game will boost their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals from Pool A, which also includes Australia, Fiji and Uruguay.
Jones sang his hit Delilah ahead of Wales' famous 32-31 Five Nations Championship win at Wembley in 1999 - the day Scott Gibbs ran in a late try, converted by Neil Jenkins to seal victory.
