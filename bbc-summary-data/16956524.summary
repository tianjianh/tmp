Lord Mayor Frank Prendergast said the Liverpool Cancer Research UK Centre was a "deserving recipient" of the highest honour the city could bestow.
Cancer Research UK chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar attended a ceremony at the town hall to receive the award
The honour comes during the city's Action on Cancer Year.
Dr Kumar was joined by senior management from University of Liverpool, Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology, Royal Liverpool Hospital and NHS Merseyside for the ceremony on Wednesday evening.
The centre aims to boost key areas of research that will produce the greatest benefits for cancer patients in Liverpool, Merseyside and Cheshire.
It also focuses on tackling cancer in low income communities in the region, where more people die from the disease.
It is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust, Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology NHS Foundation Trust, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool City Council, and Merseyside and Cheshire Cancer Network.
Mr Prendergast said: "Those working tirelessly to find a cure for cancer have made and continue to make a huge difference to the lives of many people. Their commitment and drive cannot be commended highly enough.
"2012 is Liverpool's Action on Cancer Year, backed by the Council and Liverpool PCT, and Cancer Research UK's 10th anniversary.
"I can think of no better time to reward the efforts of those working in the cancer research field."
