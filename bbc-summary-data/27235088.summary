Who were the Disappeared?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during Northern Ireland's Troubles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite extensive and painstaking searches, the bodies have never been found of four out of 16 people listed by the commission set up to locate victims' remains.
Searches have been carried out by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, established in 1999 by treaty between the British and Irish governments to obtain information in strictest confidence that may lead to where the bodies are buried.

IRA 'was wrong' over bodies issue
