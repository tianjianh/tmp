A Newport County fan was plucked from the crowd to act as a fourth official during their EFL Trophy win over Wimbledon.

The good Samaritan ensured the match avoided being abandoned after an injury to referee Andy Davies.
Newport used their Twitter account to seek a qualified official after Davies pulled a hamstring.
An appeal was issued over the tannoy at half time and fan Paul Gobbett took over fourth official duties.
The supporter involvement spared the need for any action from Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock, who is a qualified referee and was part of the record low crowd of 368 at Rodney Parade.
"I put out the announcement at half time and a guy came pretty quickly from the Hazell Stand," stadium announcer Tim Thraves told BBC Wales Sport.
"The referee was injured so the fourth official had to step in. The fourth official became the referee and the fan became the fourth official.
"Neil Warnock was there as well, but we didn't need to call him."
This was the second time in just over a year that a fan at a Newport match has gone from the terraces to the touchline.
Portsmouth fan Mike Hurdle took over fourth official duties last year at his team's match against Newport after an injury to referee James Adcock.
