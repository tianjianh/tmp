Scott placed 11th in race five and won race six to go 12 points clear of second place with four races remaining.
Elsewhere, Welsh Nacra 17 duo Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves remain second, level on points with leaders Australia.
Luke Patience and Chris Grube went sixth in the men's 470, with Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark third in the women's event at Marina da Gloria.
In the men's RS:X windsurfing, Nick Dempsey dropped from first to second overall behind Dutch defending champion Dorian van Rijsselberghe.
Meanwhile, Bryony Shaw remains 10th in the women's RS:X despite impressive third, fifth and second-place finishes on Thursday.
In the sailing events, all classes race either 10 or 12-fleet races with each boat receiving points equal to their finishing position.
At the end of the fleet races the 10 boats with the lowest points totals compete in a medal race where points are doubled for each position at the finish.
