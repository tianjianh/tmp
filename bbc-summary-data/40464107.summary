The defending champions led 40-31 going into the final quarter of their semi-final in Koblenz, Germany, and extended their advantage to win 54-41.
They will play Sweden, who won possession and scored a winner in the closing seconds to beat Denmark 57-56.
Saturday's match (15:00 BST) is a repeat of the 2015 final, which Britain won 49-48.
