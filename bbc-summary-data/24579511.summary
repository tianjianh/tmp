100 Women: Who took part?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They hail from all over the world, and from walks of life. They do all kinds of things: they make music, save lives, raise children, run businesses, write, preach, act and tell jokes. They campaign for their causes and strive for a better world for themselves and their families.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Friday 25 October all these women came together at the BBC's London headquarters, Broadcasting House, for a unique day of debate and discussion.
We asked them to tell us where they think the world's women are today, and to set out their goals for the future. The day was broadcast on BBC TV, radio and online.
Here are the full details of who attended, arranged in order of their appearance in the picture above.
