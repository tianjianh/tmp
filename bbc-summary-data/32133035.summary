Ben Westwood's try put the Wolves ahead before a smoke bomb on the field caused a delay in play.
When play re-started, a try from Cameron Phelps and two from Stefan Marsh made it 14-6 at the break.
Lloyd White, Brown and Jack Owens then also crossed after half-time to complete a dominant Widnes display.
Warrington's third successive defeat means they slip to fifth in the table after being leapfrogged by Hull KR, who beat city rivals Hull FC 20-6.
Westwood's try on the back of Joel Monaghan's palm back from Gareth O'Brien's chip gave Tony Smith's side an encouraging start.
But both sets of players were taken off when a smoke bomb was launched onto the pitch, and the delay favoured the home side as they completely dominated once play restarted.
Rhys Hanbury and Brown combined to put Phelps in with a smart pass, then the former's break laid the platform for Marsh to cross from the returning Brown's kick.
Hanbury's hat-trick of assists was completed when a whipped ball wide to Marsh brought the winger's second score.
Owens missed a penalty goal on the hooter, but it did not stop the momentum when the second half began, with White darting over from dummy-half after lengthy pressure.
Brown was too clever for the Wolves defence when he dummied to go over for his own try and, although Ben Currie pulled one back for the visitors, Owens' score late on started the Easter period in perfect fashion for the Vikings.
