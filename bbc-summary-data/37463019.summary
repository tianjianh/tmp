The Northern Irishman shot a bogey-free four-under 66 while overnight leader Johnson carded a one-under 69 that included a double bogey at 16.
Victory for Johnson would see him secure the $10m (Â£7.7m) prize money on offer in the FedEx Cup.
McIlroy is one of three others who could claim that season-ending bonus.
Johnson, the US Open champion, had trebled his one-shot overnight lead by the turn thanks to birdies at the fourth, fifth and sixth.
But dropped shots at the 14th and 15th saw his advantage cut before a wayward tee shot at the 16th contributed to two more dropped shots.
McIlroy, meanwhile, continued his good form on the back nine at the East Lake Golf Club with birdies at 13, 16 and 18.
The world number three was joined on six under by American Ryan Moore, who also shot a 66.
Patrick Reed, Adam Scott and England's Paul Casey are the other players who could win the FedEx Cup at the final PGA Tour event of the season.
Of those, Casey is best placed, but a one-under 69 leaves him trailing the leaders by five shots.
World number one Jason Day was also a contender, until he withdrew with a back injury during Friday's second round.
