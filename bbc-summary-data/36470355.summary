The 29-year-old right-back joined Rovers on loan from Cheltenham in December and made the move permanent the following month.
The ex-AFC Telford and Kidderminster player scored twice in 24 appearances for the club last season.
"I'm delighted that Lee is staying at the club for next season," said Rovers manager Gary Brabin.
"He is an experienced defender who did really well for us after he joined last season, helping us to an improved second half of the campaign."
