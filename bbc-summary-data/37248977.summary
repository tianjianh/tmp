The correctional facility, which was home to Oscar Wilde during his two years hard labour, closed its doors in 2013 and is due to be redeveloped.
As part of the Berkshire town's Year of Culture, a recital of Wilde's poem De Profundis will take place in the jail.
The prison also housed prolific serial killer Amelia Dyer in 1896, who killed hundreds of unwanted babies in the 19th Century.
