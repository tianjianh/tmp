Two policemen have been killed in "a terrorist bombing" in Bahrain, the country's interior ministry has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six other officers were injured, one seriously, on the island of Sitrah.
Bahrain has suffered unrest since a 2011 uprising in which the Shia majority demanded reforms from the Sunni-led government.
The latest attack comes just days after Bahraini authorities said they had foiled an arms smuggling plot linked to Iran.
Two Bahrainis were arrested after they admitted receiving a shipment of explosives, automatic weapons and ammunition from Iranian handlers, officials said.
Bahrain's government has previously accused Iran of supporting Shia militants in the kingdom.
It also recalled its ambassador to Tehran on Saturday, over "hostile comments" by Iranian leaders.
The explosion in Sitrah is the latest in a series of blasts that have targeted police in villages with a predominately Shia population.
Roads leading into the town were blocked by officers, as the wounded were taken to hospital.
Iran has always denied interfering in Bahrain, although it acknowledges it does support opposition groups seeking greater political and economic rights for the Shia Muslim community.
