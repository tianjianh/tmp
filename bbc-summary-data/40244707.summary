Climber hurt in Cairngorms rockfall

A climber suffered a serious hand injury after being hit by a large piece of loose rock in the Cairngorms.

He was struck by the two metre by two metre block coming down off Pygmy Ridge.
The ridge was previously the scene of a fatal rockfall.
A small group from the Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team went to the man's aid on Sunday afternoon and escorted him to safety.
The incident came after an accident in the Cairngorms on Saturday when a climber injured an arm in a rockfall on Fingers Ridge.
