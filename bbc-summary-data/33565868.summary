[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-boxer Scott Harrison loses Spain extradition appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former boxer Scott Harrison has lost a legal bid to avoid extradition to Spain over assault charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former WBO Featherweight Champion was sentenced to four years in prison by a court in Malaga in 2012.
A European arrest warrant was issued by the Spanish authorities after claims he left before starting the sentence.
Earlier this year a Scottish sheriff ruled the 37-year-old, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, could be extradited. Appeal judges have upheld the ruling.
Earlier this year, Harrison's legal team argued at Edinburgh Sheriff Court that the Spanish authorities had not followed extradition law when they issued a European Arrest Warrant for him.
Sheriff Thomas Welsh QC, however, ruled that the former boxer should be extradited.
Harrison's lawyers sought leave to appeal that decision but their application was rejected by Lord Carloway, sitting with Lady Smith and Lady Clark.
Lord Carloway also said bail would be refused, after which Harrison was handcuffed and led away from court by security officers.
