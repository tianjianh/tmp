Spurs increased the pressure on the Foxes by thrashing Stoke City 4-0 at the Britannia Stadium on Monday.
"We are not going anywhere," said 22-year-old striker Kane, who took his Premier League goal tally to 24 with a brace.
"If we keep playing like that, there are not many teams who will beat us."
The England player added that, with four games left for the top two sides, Spurs still believe they can win the title.
"We think we can do it, otherwise there's not much point being involved," he said. "Leicester are still in the driving seat being five points ahead but there are four games left and we've reduced the gap. That's all we could have done."
Dele Alli also scored twice in the victory over Stoke as Tottenham cut the gap to Leicester, who drew 2-2 with West Ham on Sunday.
He also hit the post when he had the goal at his mercy, evoking memories of Ronny Rosenthal's extraordinary miss against Aston Villa in 1992.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino echoed Kane's sentiments about the title race, insisting his players "really believe" they can overhaul the Foxes.
"This is our dream, to win the title," he said. "Always we try. You must never give up. You can feel every day this season from the beginning was special."
Tottenham have won 10 of their past 13 Premier League games to keep pace with Leicester and play on Monday night again in each of the next two weeks.

"The most important thing is that the performance we showed was perfect," said Pochettino. "It was a big signal that we are there waiting and fighting."
Stoke boss Mark Hughes praised a "very impressive" Tottenham, describing them as stronger, faster and more powerful than his team.
"Sometimes you have to give credit to the opposition," he added. "They are quick and sharp and have got that edge that chasing major trophies gives you.
"You wouldn't bet against them catching Leicester."
