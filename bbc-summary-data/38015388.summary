[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The archaeological ruins of a medieval city in Monmouthshire could be turned into a tourist attraction, under new plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
For 10 years, amateur archaeologists have been digging up the 13th Century "Lost City" of Trellech, which has appeared on several TV programmes, including Digging for Britain.
Owner Stuart Wilson hopes to submit plans to Monmouthshire council to build a research centre and camp site there.
He said it could boost tourism.
Mr Wilson, 37, of Chepstow, is waiting for the council to remove a restrictive covenant on his 4.6 acre (1.86-hectare) plot, before he submits plans for a camp site with up to 200 places, amenities and an exhibition centre
"It would be adding a heritage site and a boost to tourism in the area," he said.
"It's an opportunity to come along to dig and get experience."
Mr Wilson, who used his Â£32,000 life savings to buy the site in 2004, has uncovered eight buildings which he believes form part of the footprint of an iron boom town dating to the mid-1200s.
He hopes that, if his forthcoming planning application goes through without much delay, the new attraction may be open by the summer of 2018.
