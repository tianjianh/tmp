Scots doctor overtime payments rise to £20m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Growing pressures on hospitals are forcing them to ramp up costly overtime payments to consultants to do extra work, a BBC investigation shows.

Scotland's health boards paid more than £20m in overtime and additional pay to some doctors in 2015/16, up from the £14m paid out in 2014/15.
The British Medical Association said there were not enough consultants.
But Health Secretary Shona Robison said overtime was a "tiny percentage" of the overall spend on consultants.
And she said the government was "determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland".
The BBC asked all 186 organisations running NHS hospitals in the UK about overtime and extra payments over the last three years.
Across the UK, overtime and additional payments have increased by more than a third, to £168m, in 2015/16 - with one doctor in Lancashire making almost £375,000 in the space of 12 months.
In total, 23 NHS trusts had to pay at least one consultant more than £100,00 for extra work, with another 39 paying at least one more than £50,000.
Much of the overtime work involves non-emergency procedures designed to meet waiting times targets. It is up to hospitals to negotiate their own rates for extra work, with the most lucrative ones in place for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.
Consultants doing overtime in these areas commonly make £600 for a four-hour shift - three to four times what they normally get. Overtime for urgent and emergency work tends to be much lower - around £300 for a shift.
Of Scotland's 14 health boards, 12 responded to the freedom of information requests. This showed spending going up from £14.27m in 2013/14 to £20.92m in 2015/16.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde paid out the most, with an outlay of £7,749,870 on higher rate payments for additional shifts, while NHS Orkney did not make any payments.
NHS Grampian had the greatest increase in payments, from zero in 2013/14 to £1.6m two years later.
There were also sharp increases at NHS Lanarkshire, from £1.8m to £3.4m, and NHS Lothian, from £1.3m to £2.1m.
A number of hospitals asked about the payments UK-wide said there was a shortage of consultants, meaning they had to try to get existing staff to do extra work.
They also said high emergency-room pressures had led to the cancellation of more routine treatments, increasing the need for overtime.
A spokesman for the British Medical Association said: "The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work."
However, Scotland's health secretary insisted that consultant staffing was at a record high.
Ms Robison said: "NHS consultant numbers have increased by almost 43% under this government to a record high level. This spend on overtime represents a tiny percentage of the overall spend on consultants.
"We are determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland, which is why we have launched a national programme for the effective management of all temporary staffing, to help boards move away from reliance on high cost temporary staff, reduce overall costs and ensure value for money for NHS Scotland.
"We have also set up and championed the use of local 'staff bank' systems, which are a pool of flexible NHS-employed staff who fill the majority of short term vacant shifts at NHS pay rates. Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across NHS Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff.
"In the meantime the use of overtime and locum staff allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness, unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times."
