A group of fundraisers has begun an attempt to swim the River Thames restricting themselves to doggy paddle.

The 10 swimmers set off from Lechlade, Gloucestershire aiming to complete the 155 mile (150km) route to Putney.
Hamish Reid said doggy paddle was the "perfect stroke" for river swimming. He added the biggest challenge would come in the tidal section of the Thames.
The team has so far raised almost Â£10,000 for the UK Stem Cell Foundation charity.
The relay swimmers are accompanied on the river by paddle boarder and a giant inflatable pink dog mascot during the six-day challenge.
Mr Reid said: "There are some strengths of the stroke - you keep your head out of the water, we're trying not to ingest too much of the Thames.
"It's good for chatting - with your head up you can chat to boaters and people on the sides."
He said he came up with the idea to raise money for stem cell research into spinal injuries after a friend was paralysed in a swimming accident.
It is hoped they will complete the challenge in Putney on 27 August.
