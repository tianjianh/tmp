Plans have been revealed for a Channel Islands university based in Guernsey.

UK-based education consultants Susan Jackson Associates said Guernsey was the "perfect location" for a privately-funded university.
Guernsey's government will be asked to support the principle at a States meeting in October.
But the Policy Council has warned impact issues such as housing and transport needed to be addressed.
Those behind the plans said students would be attracted by the prospect of studying in a safe and stable community and it would bring significant economic benefits to the island.
Susan Jackson Associates said the project would not require funding from the States and would start small, offering a limited number of postgraduate courses in its first year.
It would rely heavily on links with other top universities in the UK and Europe, which would also be responsible for awarding degrees, it added.
In a report to the States, the Policy Council said it considered the proposal to be "potentially an important boost" to the island's economy.
However, it also warned that the "impact on the community should not be underestimated" and that a number of issues, including the effects on housing, public services and transport, still needed to be addressed.
It said further discussions - particularly around island population, accommodation, immigration and employment issues - were "essential".
