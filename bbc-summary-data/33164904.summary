[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder after pieces of human bones were found by detectives investigating the death of a man 25 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Bedford, 27, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, was last seen in September 1990.
Officers reopened the investigation in April, and discovered human bones on land off Stocking Fen Road in Ramsey.
A 64-year-old man from Ramsey has been arrested.
Mr Bedford was last seen on the evening of 28 September at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte, Ramsey.
Three people were arrested in connection with his disappearance but no-one was charged.
In April, Cambridgeshire Police reopened the investigation as a murder inquiry, saying they believed he had been shot.
Detectives think Mr Bedford was killed with a shotgun sometime during the evening of 28 September at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in Ramsey.
They began searching land in the town in April.
Bones "consistent with being human" were found by scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists and detectives during the 13-day operation.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "The bones were discovered during a painstaking search of the area we had identified as being of interest.
"An expert in forensic anthropology has assisted the investigation and the bones will now be subject to DNA testing and much more intrusive forensic analysis."
Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car.
He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in (1.72m), medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.
Mr Brunning said he was "confident" local people held additional information that would help "bring resolution to Andrew's family".
