Ice alert weather warning issued after snowfall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A yellow "be aware" warning for ice has been issued for western parts of Wales as wintery weather conditions continue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wintery showers, moving offshore overnight on Monday, mean there is a widespread risk of ice on untreated surfaces on Tuesday morning.
Motorists are advised to be aware of possible hazardous travel conditions.
The Met Office forecast comes after snow closed schools in Gwynedd, Anglesey, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire on Monday, with roads also affected.
The alert covers coastal areas in north west, south west and mid Wales until 10:00 GMT on Tuesday.
