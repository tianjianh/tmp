David George, 21, Joshua Tiloye, 22, both from Hertfordshire, and Domingo Nsita, 29, from Wembley, raided Justice Jewellers in Winchester on 15 April.
The men pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear.
George and Tiloye were jailed for 10 years while Nsita received a 12-year sentence at Winchester Crown Court.
Police said George and Tiloye entered the store wearing motorcycle helmets and threatened the owner with a gas-powered BB gun.
They grabbed watches and jewellery but officers were already on their way after witnesses, including staff in a nearby travel agents, raised the alarm.
Getaway driver Nsita was arrested after he had his escape route blocked by a bin lorry, while the other two were caught on foot after members of the public pointed them out to police.
The gun, a hammer, face masks and all of the jewellery was recovered.
Judge Keith Cutler praised the role of members of the public in directing police towards the raiders.
He said the crime had "shocked Winchester to the core".
Det Con Darrin Carey said: "Thanks to the swift actions of our officers these three dangerous men have been taken off the streets of Hampshire.
"Within minutes of this raid starting our officers were on scene, ready to confront whatever they were faced with to protect the public."
