Ched Evans: Jury retires in footballer's rape trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury at footballer Ched Evans' retrial for rape has started its deliberations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chesterfield striker denies raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, on 30 May 2011.
Mr Evans, 27, was found guilty of rape at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, but his conviction was quashed in April.
On Friday, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies finished her summing up and invited the jury to retire after a two-week trial at Cardiff Crown Court.
On Thursday, she told jurors to make their decision "calmly, objectively and without emotion" and not to judge the morals of anyone involved.
Mr Evans denies having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent.
He insists she agreed to let him "join in" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27, after a night out in Rhyl.
His legal team argue the prosecution is "built around the myth" the complainant was too drunk to agree to sex.
But the prosecution alleges the victim did "not have the freedom or capacity to consent".
They have said Mr Evans treated her with a "callous, self-centred indifference essentially indistinguishable from utter contempt".
