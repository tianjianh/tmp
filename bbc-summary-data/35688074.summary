Kenyan officials have said reports that two lions had been seen in the capital Nairobi were false.

"Kenya Wildlife Service would like to confirm that there was no sighting or any signs of lions at the Ngong road forest," the organisation said.
It said it made the statement after "a thorough search of the area".
It added that traffic police - who reported the sightings - had received information from "a truck driver through other intermediaries".
The erroneous report appeared 10 days after at least four lions were reported to have escaped from a nearby wildlife park.
It was thought that they had all returned, but the "incident was not conclusively dealt with," KWS spokesperson Paul Udoto said earlier.

It is estimated about 30 lions live in the 117 sq km (45 sq miles) wildlife park which is situated within Nairobi's city limits.
