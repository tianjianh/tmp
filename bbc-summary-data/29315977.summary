[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stafford Hospital doctor 'unaware of spleen rupture'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient with a ruptured spleen was discharged from the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital despite a paramedic saying he had a "life-threatening condition", an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Moore-Robinson, 20, from Sileby, Leicestershire, had gone to hospital following a cycling accident.
He was told he had bruised ribs and was discharged but died the following day.
From 2005 to 2009, there were between 400 and 1,200 more deaths than would have been expected at the hospital.
The inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court heard that the telecommunications engineer's condition was assessed by a paramedic as being life-threatening before his arrival at hospital.
Giving evidence, Dr Girish Sharma said he would have had regard to the views of the paramedic but admitted the hour and 10 minutes it took to see his patient was too long.
Conceding that his notes about Mr Moore-Robinson did not reveal the full extent of his examination of the patient, Dr Sharma said: "There are a lot of things that are not in the documentation."
Dr Sharma, who ruled out bone fractures by ordering chest and pelvic X-rays but did not ask for a CT-scan, added: "I did carry out a full examination.
"At that point in time I wasn't aware of delayed rupture of the spleen. I was more concerned about an acute rupture or a very significant event."
Mr Moore-Robinson collapsed at his home in Sileby, Leicestershire, in the early hours of 2 April and was pronounced dead at Leicester Royal Infirmary.
An inquest held in 2007 recorded a narrative verdict, but it was later revealed a report that claimed his treatment may have been negligent was not used in evidence.
A senior NHS manager was sacked after she tried to suppress details of the engineer's treatment.
Last year the High Court quashed the findings of the original inquest and ruled that a new hearing could take place.
