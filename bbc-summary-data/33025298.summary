[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of serial killer Steve Wright has said he "feels responsible" for the deaths of his son's five victims, nearly a decade on.

Conrad Wright, 78, from Felixstowe, said he still feels "rough" about the murders committed by his son.
Wright was given a whole life jail term for murdering five women in Ipswich over six weeks in 2006.
Mr Wright, a retired RAF corporal, said his relationship with his son was now "non-existent".
A new film - called London Road -  is being released on Monday charting the story of the murders.
Wright, 57, killed Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls, before dumping their bodies around Ipswich in the winter of 2006. All five women worked in the town's sex industry, which has since been virtually eradicated.
The naked bodies of the women, aged between 19 and 29, were found over a 10-day period. Wright, who admitted having sex with four of the five women but denied killing them, was convicted after a trial.
Conrad Wright said he still found what happened "hard to believe".
"When someone gets found guilty, if you like, and you don't make a complaint or start crying out for help, you tend to think there must be some truth in it," he added.
"You feel sort of responsible in a way - you brought the boy on to the Earth - and if it weren't for you, he wouldn't have been there, and if he weren't here, they wouldn't be killed, would they?
"You can't just sit back and say it's nothing to do with me, because it is.
"It feels rough, really."
He said his relationship with his son is "non-existent" now.
"I haven't heard from him, even prior to the court case, not a word. All I had one day was a call from his solicitor asking if I could supply him with some cigarette money," said Mr Wright.
