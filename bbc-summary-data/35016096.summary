Having beaten Argentina 14-7 in the quarter-finals, England were soon 12 points behind against USA, who scored two tries in the opening four minutes.
But England, four times winners, most recently in 2011, had levelled by half-time and Phil Burgess scored a try deep in stoppage time to seal victory.
In Saturday's final at 15:48 GMT they face Fiji, who beat New Zealand 19-5.
