Firm offers to give stadium to Scottish football club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A construction company has offered to hand over control of a football stadium to the Scottish Premiership club that calls it home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC leases Tulloch Caledonian Stadium from Tulloch Homes, which built the ground at a cost of more than Â£6m.
The stadium was constructed in stages in 2001, 2004 and 2005.
Tulloch Homes has offered to give the stadium to Inverness. The club's board is due to meet to discuss the offer.
When ICTFC was promoted to the top flight in Scottish football the club first played its matches at Aberdeen FC's Pittodrie Stadium because its own ground did not meet required criteria.
Inverness Caley Thistle chairman Kenny Cameron said the construction of the second and third stands to comply with rules "utterly transformed the club's fortunes".
He said: "I will be discussing this incredibly generous offer with my fellow board members over the next few days and fully anticipate a speedy completion."
George Fraser, chief executive of Tulloch Homes and a former chairman of Inverness, said: "Inverness Caley Thistle is a true community club and at Tulloch Homes, as the largest local housebuilder, we consider ourselves an important member of the Inverness community.
"As every Inverness Caley Thistle fan knows, Tulloch Construction built the north and south stands in just 47 days, bringing the current capacity to 7,500.
"That was over a decade ago and when we completed the work we always hoped to one day be in a position where we could offer the stands to the club, enabling them to assume ownership and to safeguard the club's future."
