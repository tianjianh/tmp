Queen's birthday honours: Nursery owner 'humbled' by BEM

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a Swansea nursery has said she is "pleased and humbled" to be recognised in the Queen's birthday honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ann Khoshbin, owner of Rose Garden Day Nursery in Uplands, is to be awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to education.
She set up her business after being unable to find suitable childcare for her own children.
She said: "It's lovely, I'm pleased and humbled really.
She said of receiving the letter informing her of the honour: "It was such a surprise, I just cried, I couldn't believe it.
"I don't do the work to have a medal. I do it because I absolutely love it. It's a family business."
Mrs Khoshbin also provides work placements for college students and gives talks to students.
Unlike other honours, the BEM is not awarded by the Queen or Prince of Wales but by Lord-Lieutenants, who are the representatives of the Crown for each county in the UK.
Other recipients of BEMs from south-west Wales are:
Also recognised in the birthday honours list is Swansea councillor Peter Black who will be appointed CBE for services to politics and public life in Wales.
Mr Black was a Liberal Democrat AM between 1999 and 2016 and has represented the Cwmbwrla ward as a councillor since 1984.
British honours are awarded on merit, for exceptional achievement or service.
All of the recipients will be invited to a Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate their achievements.
