Some of the archaeological treasures of prehistoric Britain have been featured in a new set of eight stamps.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Issued by the Royal Mail, the stamps include illustrations of a headdress dug up in North Yorkshire and a bronze shield cover found in the River Thames.
The Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Orkney and the Avebury stone circles in Wiltshire also feature.
The stamps present a timeline from an ancient ritual of 11,000 years ago, to the Iron Age of around 300 BC.
Illustrated by London-based artist Rebecca Strickson, the stamps have been designed as overlay drawings, showing how people lived at the sites or used the objects.
For each of the stamps, Royal Mail will provide a special postmark on all mail posted in a postbox close to the site or where the artefact was found.
Featured items and places
Philip Parker, stamp strategy manager at the Royal Mail, said: "The UK has an incredibly rich heritage of prehistoric sites and exceptional artefacts.
"These new stamps explore some of these treasures and give us a glimpse of everyday life in prehistoric Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from the culture of ancient ritual and music making to sophisticated metalworking and the building of huge hill forts."
