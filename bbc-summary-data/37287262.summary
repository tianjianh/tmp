Joseph Pilates dedicated his life to refining the system of physical exercises he created whilst detained at the Knockaloe camp near Peel.
Organisers said Pilates' methodology had "benefited millions worldwide".
Pilates spent about three and a half years interned at the camp, which was designed to hold about 23,000 people.
The Knockaloe camp was divided into 23 compounds, each designed to hold 1,020 internees.
Organisers recreated that figure for the one-off 45-minute class.
A spokeswoman said the class had been inspired by seeing a postcard depicting internees putting on a Pilates display, just 15 days after he arrival at the Knockloe camp.
During his time in the camp it is believed the young Pilates worked in the camp's hospitals and was highly respected.
He spent his time developing a comprehensive system of physical exercise which he called "Contrology".
Mo Sherring, of the Isle of Man Pilates Studio, said it is "not just a series of exercises" but a "conceptual approach to movement".
Pilates invented his own unique apparatus formed from the springs from his dormitory bed.
He also studied the movement of animals.
After the war he dedicated his life to refining his methods which are still used widely across the world.
