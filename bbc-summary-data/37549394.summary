[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dilapidated Grade-II listed theatre, which has stood empty for over 20 years, is to be sold at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burnley Empire Theatre defaulted to the care of the Duchy of Lancaster as an "owner of last resort" after the ownership could not be established.
Last used as a bingo hall in 1995, the Cow Lane venue was recently named the fifth most at risk theatre in the UK.
Campaigners who want to restore the building to its former glory said the decision was a blow to their plans.
Sophie Gibson from the Burnley Empire Theatre Trust (BETT), said: "This news came as something of a surprise and a disappointment.
"The viability study, which the council contributed to as well, is currently taking place and the results are due very shortly.
"If, as we hope, the verdict is a positive one we can then move on to stage two, the architectural planning phase for the project, when we also begin applying for funding.
"All of this could have been for nothing if it is auctioned off before we are able to get that far."
The Duchy of Lancaster, said it had been left with "no alternative" but to put it to bidders after offering it free of charge to both Burnley Council and the Theatre Trust - an offer that "remains open".
A spokesman added: "The Duchy remains hopeful that the building will remain in local ownership."
BETT said it could not yet afford the legal costs that would be incurred to take on the building.
The four-storey building, designed by  G. B. Rawcliffe, opened in 1894 as a music hall, before being converted to a cinema in 1938.
It is to be auctioned in Manchester on 16 October.
