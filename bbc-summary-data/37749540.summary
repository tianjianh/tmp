Spain Women 1-2 England Women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England extended their unbeaten run to nine games with a friendly victory over Spain as they continued their preparations for Euro 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lionesses led when Karen Carney's shot was deflected home by Spain's Marta Torrejon Moya in Guadalajara.
England captain Steph Houghton curled in a free-kick before Torrejon whipped home a stunning set-piece, while Jordan Nobbs hit the Spain post late on.
The draw for Euro 2017 in the Netherlands will be held on 8 November.
Mark Sampson's England side, whose next match is against the Netherlands on 29 November, are in pot one for top seeds. They could be drawn against Spain, who feature in pot two.
England controlled the match in Guadalajara, with 12 shots on goal to Spain's eight and eight corners to the hosts' one.
Spain's defeat was their first in 13 matches, England's achievement all the more impressive given that the home side scored 21 unanswered goals in their previous three matches.
Sampson, who is among the favourites to become MK Dons manager, made only one change to the team that drew 0-0 with France on Friday as Nikita Parris replaced Rachel Daly in the forward line.
His reluctance to make widespread changes suggests he is close to settling on his best team for the Euros.
England, who finished third in the 2015 World Cup, are fifth in the world rankings.
Germany - unbeaten at the European Championships since 1993 - beat the Netherlands 4-2 at home in a friendly on Tuesday.
England manager Mark Sampson:
"It was a good win for us and up there with my favourite England performances in my time.
"We showed a variety of qualities, we looked like four different teams.
"We saw the resilience, character, organisation and adaptability of the team. At every point we looked in control of that game."
England captain Steph Houghton:
"We are in a really good place. This is probably the most together squad we have had over the last three years.
"We are always wanting to learn, we have got fresh blood in the camp, with a lot of experience as well, so it is about blending them together and making sure that every game we play we learn and we improve.
"We have got eight months now until the Euros, and hopefully we can be the best-prepared team there.
"Against Spain we dominated possession in the first half and controlled the game, then in the second half it was a different side to us and we were a little bit fatigued."
