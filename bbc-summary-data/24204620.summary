New material has reportedly been added to Salinger, a documentary about the author of Catcher in the Rye, after it opened in the US to mixed reviews.

Film-makers Harvey Weinstein and Shane Salerno announced they were making the changes to their film in a press release, Hollywood Reporter said.
The film was released earlier this month, but it is unusual for a movie to be edited after it has hit cinemas.
The new version is billed as a "special edition", the trade paper said.
It replaced the original cut at the weekend as the film expanded into "more than 60 markets across the US" after its initial run in New York and Los Angeles.
It added about 13 minutes of the original film were cut, while about eight minutes of new material was added, including "additional interview time with Joyce Maynard, who had a relationship with Salinger when she was 18 and he was 53".
There also is new footage of the author and the overall film is said to be five minutes shorter.
Hollywood Reporter said the original cut of the film "disappoints on many counts", adding "the picture ultimately turns out to be less revelatory than all the advance publicity promises". The Washington Post described it as "plodding and mostly pointless".
"Broad yet shallow" is how Variety reviewed the movie, stating it was "difficult to get past the film's restless, ill-fittingly bombastic style".
The documentary is being released at the same time as a new biography of Salinger, written by Salerno and David Shields, while the Weinstein Company is also developing a biopic about Salinger which will be written by Salerno.
It will focus on the writer's life, from serving in World War II to the publication of Catcher in 1951.
Salinger's only published novel, The Catcher in the Rye is a tale of teenage angst which has gone on to become one of the most influential American novels of the modern era.
He followed it with a collection of short stories and several novellas but stopped publishing in 1965 and withdrew from public view. He is understood to have continued writing before his death in 2010.
