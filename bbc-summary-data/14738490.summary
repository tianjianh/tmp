Cornwall Hospitals trust gets interim chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new interim chief executive has taken over the running of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lezli Boswell has replaced Peter Colclough in the post.
She has taken over at a key time for the trust as it struggles with shortfalls in funding while trying to achieve foundation trust status.
The RCHT said it would advertise for a full-time replacement later in September and hoped to make an appointment by the end of the year.
Ms Boswell has worked with the South West Strategic Health Authority for the past 10 months, helping other trusts gain the much sought-after foundation status.
She was chief executive of the Cornwall Partnership Trust when it became a foundation in March 2010.
Foundation trusts give NHS managers freedom to control their own budgets.
Ms Boswell has also been on the streets of Cornwall this week to meet the public and canvass support in the trust's bid for foundation status.
Mr Colclough was moving to a new post elsewhere in the South West, the RCHT said.
