Sevilla 1-3 Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City secured a place in the Champions League last 16 by tearing apart Group D rivals Sevilla with a blistering attacking display.

Raheem Sterling struck from a tight angle after eight minutes - and Fernandinho's header doubled City's lead just 170 seconds later.
Sevilla hit back through Benoit Tremoulinas' free header, but Wilfried Bony swept in for a 3-1 half-time lead.
City cruised through the second half to progress with two games to spare.
Victory for the Premier League leaders, coupled with Juventus's 1-1 draw at Borussia Monchengladbach in the group's other game, means they have reached the last 16 quicker than in any of their previous four campaigns.
Sevilla could still finish level on points with City, but the Blues would progress because their two wins over the Spanish side gives them a superior head-to-head record.
City have struggled in the Champions League over the past four seasons, twice failing to escape the group stage under Roberto Mancini and losing in the last 16 in each of Manuel Pellegrini's two campaigns.
But their victory in Spain maintained the Chilean's flawless record of reaching the knockout phase while managing City.
Pellegrini's side were rampant in a remarkable first half, cutting apart their hosts almost at will.
Sterling finished coolly after he was picked out by Fernandinho's accurate through ball, before the Brazilian headed into an empty net after pouncing on a rebound.
And, after Sevilla gave themselves a lifeline when an unmarked Tremoulinas was picked out at the far post by Coke, Bony swept in Jesus Navas's low cross from the right to restore the two-goal advantage.
Europa League winners Sevilla barely threatened after the break, with Yaya Toure, Bony and Sterling all going close to adding more away goals.
City have been beaten by Barcelona in the last 16 in the past two seasons, but they are now in a strong position to finish as Group D winners, which they will hope will give them a more favourable tie.
City have developed a reputation in recent weeks for pinching dramatic winners, but this victory was based on a lightning start rather than a scrambling finish.
The Blues needed late goals to beat Monchengladbach and Sevilla in their previous two Champions League matches, and to see off Premier League rivals Norwich at the weekend.
Pellegrini sprang a surprise by dropping £55m summer signing Kevin de Bruyne, arguably City's star performer in recent weeks, to the bench.
That may have hinted at a more pragmatic approach, but the Chilean's tactics were far from cautious.
Sevilla had not lost in their previous 10 European home games but had no answer to the pace of Sterling and Navas down the flanks, nor to the power and drive of Fernandinho and Toure.
City had six shots on target in the opening 20 minutes as Sevilla failed to muster one.
The visitors ended the first half with 16 efforts. Only Atletico Madrid have managed more in one half in this season's competition, with 17 against Kazakhstan minnows Astana.
Virtually every club side in European football would struggle to replace Sergio Aguero and City, despite their vast riches, are no different.
In the Argentine talisman's absence through injury, some City fans have not been convinced that £28m signing Bony is an adequate replacement.
The Ivorian had scored five in 24 appearances before the match in Spain, but he responded with an encouraging display.
As well as netting his first Champions League goal, Bony impressed with his link-up play at the focal point of City's counter-attacking set-up.
And he was given a rousing ovation by the travelling supporters when he was replaced in the final five minutes.
Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini: "It is important to be qualified two games before the end.
"Now we will still try to qualify in the first position of this group and if we continue playing in this way we will have more chances."
Sevilla coach  Unai Emery: "We have played against a fantastic team.
"They were very fast and good at converting their opportunities. Once they scored the first two goals that nullified us. We had our moments but not enough.
"We knew City and Juventus were going to be the favourites in this group, but we know there is still a chance we can get through. The group is still open."
A return to Premier League action. Leaders City, ahead of second-placed Arsenal on goal difference, visit bottom side Aston Villa on Sunday.
