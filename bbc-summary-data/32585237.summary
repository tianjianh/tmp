A plainclothes policeman has died two days after he was shot in the head in New York City, officials say.

Brian Moore, 25, was shot on Saturday while attempting to question a suspect from an unmarked police car in the borough of Queens.
Officials said he died from his injuries on Monday at Jamaica Hospital, where he was taken after the shooting.
Demitrius Blackwell, 36, was arrested soon after the incident and has since been charged on several counts.
Moore is the fifth police officer to be shot - and the third to be killed - in New York in the past three months.
Mayor Bill De Blasio praised the police officer for making "the ultimate sacrifice to the people of New York City".
"Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn the loss of Police Officer Brian Moore," he said.
Police said Mr Moore and his partner Erik Janssen were in an unmarked car when they saw a man adjust something on his belt.
Suspecting he was carrying a gun, the officers approached him. Blackwell pulled out a gun and fired several times at the vehicle, they added.
Blackwell was recently paroled after serving seven years in prison for attempted murder and reportedly has a history of assaulting police officers.
In December, two officers were shot dead in their car in New York by a man who then committed suicide. The gunman in that case had posted anti-police messages on social media but there is no indication of a similar motive in the latest shooting.
It comes amid heightened tensions in the US over the police's use of force, with riots sparked last week in Baltimore after the death of a black man in police custody.
Six police officers are facing criminal charges over the death of Freddie Gray, which has been ruled a homicide. They deny any wrongdoing.
