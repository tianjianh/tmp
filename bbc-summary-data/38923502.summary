Eileen Blane was thrown to the floor and punched during the burglary in Stretford, Greater Manchester.
David and John Blane said "bruises and injuries mean nothing" compared to losing the ring, given to her by her late husband 63 years ago.
They said the family had received thousands of messages of support.
Granddaughter Amy Blane shared pictures of her "brave Nana" on social media - her post has now been shared more than 83,000 times.
John Blane said: "Most people have been saying how despicable this character must be and how they really hope they do get caught.
"Everyone has a nana, everyone's got a mum who may be living alone and it could be anybody."
Mrs Blane managed to escape and alert neighbours while her attackers searched upstairs in Friday's burglary.
She suffered three cracked ribs and a damaged vertebrae and it is not known when she will be able to go home, her family said.
A CCTV company has installed cameras in her house for free so she will feel safe upon her return from hospital.
David Blane said she was most devastated to be without the ring given to her by her husband, who died 13 years ago.
"It's the only connection she has with my dad," he said.
His brother appealed for his mother's attacker to return the gold wedding band.
He said: "Even if you put the ring in an envelope and give it to us anonymously, just give it us back and that will take away most of the pain away for my mum."
Det Ch Insp Paul Parker of Greater Manchester Police said it was a "disgusting and intrusive" attack.
He urged witnesses to come forward.
