Julie, like a few others, was concerned when she spotted an advert in the local newspaper in 1999 warning that the club could be closing down and went along to the meeting to see what was going to happen.
"A gang of women ended up standing up at that meeting to be the new committee - we didn't want to lose it," she explains.

"On match days it's just really, really special to be part of," says media team volunteer Laura Jones.
