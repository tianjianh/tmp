[SN]TITLE[SN]
Archbishop of Canterbury to address Church of Scotland General Assembly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Archbishop of Canterbury is to become the first head of the Church of England to take part in a debate at the Church of Scotland's General Assembly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Most Reverend Justin Welby will speak to a landmark report proposing the two denominations enter into an ecumenical partnership.
An agreement was formally approved at the Church of England General Synod in London in February.
The Church of Scotland's six-day assembly opened on Saturday.
Under the terms of the proposed partnership, members from both denominations would be welcome in one another's congregations.
Ordained ministers will also be allowed to exercise ministry within the existing discipline of each church - though only within England and continental Europe.
The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev Dr Angus Morrison, said the assembly was looking forward to hearing Dr Welby speak about the Columba Declaration, which sets out the partnership between the churches.
Dr Morrison said: "It was my privilege to address the General Synod of the Church of England on the same document and by a very large majority the synod affirmed it.
"I am confident that our general assembly will do so too."
The moderator said the declaration was largely symbolic but paved the way for "further growth in fellowship and for extending partnership in mission as sister and national churches".
The assembly has the power to make laws and set the agenda for the coming months or years for the administrative councils, committees and departments of the organisation.
This year, it has already voted to allow ministers to continue to serve if they are in a gay marriage.
Ministers also overwhelmingly backed the case for remaining in the European Union.
Other topics of discussion are corporal punishment of children, climate change, the refugee crisis and exploring ways of growing the Church via the internet and social media.
The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, addressed the general assembly in 2012 but did not take part in a debate.
