[SN]TITLE[SN]
Religious education teacher Vasim Shabir struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A religious education teacher who swore and referred to pupils as "dickheads" has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A misconduct hearing heard Vasim Shabir, who formerly taught at the Vale Academy, Brigg, called students with learning difficulties "weirdos".
The panel also ruled the 33-year-old had "an overall disregard and lack of respect for women".
Mr Shabir who was not present at the hearing, was banned from teaching indefinitely.
The panel, which sat in Coventry, heard evidence Mr Shabir was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct whilst working at the school.
In one instance he was reported to have told boys in the classroom how he hated his wife and how to have more than one girlfriend and get away with it.
Mr Shabir was taken to have denied the allegations against him which dealt with the period 2011/12.
In its ruling, the panel said: "The findings against Mr Shabir included serious departures from the professional standards, a disregard for instructions, a clear abuse of the trust... a derogatory attitude towards women and intimidation of a member of staff."
The ban means Mr Shabir is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England.
