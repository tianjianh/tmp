Late tries from Justin Carney and Niall Evalds earned Salford Red Devils victory at struggling Huddersfield, who remain bottom of Super League.

A brace of tries from Ukuma Ta'ai, plus further scores from Jake Connor and Jermaine McGillvary, established a 24-18 lead with 12 minutes to play.
But Carney and Evalds both crossed in a three-minute spell late on to secure a fourth win of 2016 for Salford.
However, Salford players clashed with some of their own fans after the game.
The Giants have won only one of their eight games this season.
Former Giants prop Craig Kopczak had given Salford an early lead and Gareth O'Brien added another for the Red Devils, only for the visitors to trail 12-10 at half-time after tries by Ta'ai and Connor.
Josh Griffin's score restored Salford's advantage, but McGillvary's effort and a second for Ta'ai looked to have earned a second Super League win of the season for Paul Anderson's men, before the visitors snatched victory in the closing stages.
Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson: "We were way better than we were Friday but our defence is costing us. We have to stop missing one-on-one tackles and cut the individual errors out.
"The offence is not quite firing but we still scored 24 points which is enough to win games.
"I feel under pressure because I put it on myself and I'm not comfortable losing games - it's not something I'm used to. If we can cut out the mistakes and put in the same effort and take some of the opportunities we are creating we will get there."
Salford coach Ian Watson: "We pride ourselves on our defence and the mentality of the guys to stick in there today when it got tough and come through the other side.
"The Easter period is tough, backing up with two games in four days.
"We have a good group of players who have belief in what they do and the conditioning they have done during pre-season."
