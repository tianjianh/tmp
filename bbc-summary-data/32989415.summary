Claims of historical abuse at three boys' boarding schools are being investigated by two police forces.

The allegations centre on Dowdeswell Court and Badgeworth Court schools in Gloucestershire and Clouds House in Wiltshire - all privately run.
Pupils allege they were subjected to "horrific" abuse during the 1970s and 1980s, a BBC investigation found.
Staff who worked at the schools have "categorically denied" any involvement saying pupil welfare was a "priority".
The BBC has spoken to 18 former pupils, some of whom have been campaigning for action to be taken.
Some also claim they were sexually abused at Dowdeswell Court, but the BBC is not naming any teachers allegedly involved for legal reasons.
Det Insp Tim Corner, from Wiltshire Police, said they believe there could be a "number of victims" and were taking the allegations "extremely seriously".
Gloucestershire Police said it takes all "allegations of abuse extremely seriously and potential victims will be treated with dignity throughout any investigation".
"We continue to work alongside our colleagues in Wiltshire to ensure that any investigation is carried out thoroughly," the force said.
The NSPCC said the police "should leave no stone unturned in getting to the truth".
Former Dowdeswell pupil Roy Messenger said the owner of the schools, Anthony Hurley, oversaw a regime of terror and beatings, with others claiming the abuse there was "horrific".
Mr Hurley died in 2003. He appeared in court in 2000 on allegations of cruelty and sexual abuse of children, but was deemed unfit to stand trial.
"He would force food down people's mouths - his words were 'I'm not paying... for this food and [having] you not eating it'," Mr Messenger said.
Malcolm Millard, who had come from a broken home, said violence was "paramount" at Dowdeswell.
"Mental and emotional abuse was rife to extremes that we were told we were unacceptable in society. Next stop in our lives would be prison, which did happen," he said.
Another, Chris Hight, was sent to the school near Cheltenham in 1980, after his parents split up when he was 12 years old.
"I needed to be looked after loved and cared for but I wasn't," he said.
At Badgeworth Court, also owned by Mr Hurley, further allegations have come to light, with then head teacher John Derek Williams and his deputy head Ashley Pritchard, who is from Wales, are accused of carrying out violent assaults.
Pupil Nick Kaye, who now lives in Wales, said Mr Pritchard once caned him repeatedly, and also "smashed" his face into a bowl "continuously" after he refused to eat a meal.
Both Mr Williams and Mr Pritchard have denied any involvement in the alleged abuse.
"I was not responsible for or complicit in any abuse of pupils or in the cover up of complaints," Mr Williams said.
"Although the regulatory regime has changed considerably since then, pupil welfare has always been my absolute priority.
"I am saddened by the allegations and upset by the suggestion I was personally involved."
A statement issued on behalf of Mr Pritchard states he "categorically denies the allegations ... [which are] wholly without foundation".
Mr Williams and Mr Pritchard also worked at Clouds House in Wiltshire where further allegations have been made.
Former pupil David Salt said he witnessed one boy they "beat the living daylights out of".
"Basically, they terrorised us," Mr Salt said.
"Williams would come up and stand next to people and they'd just wet themselves. That's how bad it was - pure terrorism. That's what they'd installed."
Wiltshire Council said it would "constantly work with our partners to ensure safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do".
"Once we have received details of any specific allegation we will investigate it thoroughly."
Linda Uren, director of children's services at Gloucestershire County Council, said: "Badgeworth Court School was a privately-run school. It was not regulated by the council, however we did place children there, alongside other local councils.
"We became aware of allegations involving staff in the early 1970s and stopped using the school afterwards."
The Department for Education said the schools, which closed between 1982 and 1988, would have been inspected by the Department of Education and Science.
"Inspection reports held by the department are destroyed after seven years. There is no electronic archive dating back this far," a spokesman said.
