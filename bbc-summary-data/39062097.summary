Detectives investigating the shooting have appealed for help to trace a three-door silver/grey VW Golf, registration number PJ10 OJU, believed to have been used in the murder.
They are also keen to trace the movements of two Mercedes cars seen in the Daniel Hill area at the time of the shooting - a black C Class car registration number LP66 RUH, and a white C Class, registration number NU15 PZF.
Officers believe Mr Al-Essaie was in the black car at the time of the shooting and was taken to hospital in the other vehicle.
A 30-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder has been released on bail.
