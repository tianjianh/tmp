Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos, both 14, were last seen on Friday afternoon buying $110 worth of fuel near Jupiter, before setting off on a 19-foot boat.
Their capsized boat was found on Sunday morning more than 180 miles from where they set off two days before.
"I just want him home. I know he's coming home," said Austin's mother Carly Black on NBC's Today programme.
Pamela Cohen, mother of Perry, told NBC that she believes her son and his friend "are doing everything they can to stay afloat".
She said the two boys have worked with boats their whole lives and that it is natural for them to be on the water.
The two mothers said the boys went fishing offshore when the weather turned and "something went amiss".
The US Coast Guard expanded its search on Tuesday morning, searching up to Georgia and down to Cape Canaveral in Florida through the day and night.
A spokesman said they were still optimistic they can be found alive.
They were last seen buying petrol and authorities said they may have been headed toward the Bahamas.
Nick Korniloff says his stepson, Perry, and Austin were were supposed to stay on a nearby river and waterway when they set out to go fishing on Friday, but they ended up in dangerous waters.
Former American football player Joe Namath, Ms Cohen's neighbour, has offered a $100,000 (Â£64,100) reward for information on the missing boys.
Mr Namath said during a press conference "We've got to believe in their wherewithal".
