The New Zealander, 36, retired from playing at the end of the season after becoming Quins' record points scorer in his nine years at The Stoop.
"I am delighted Nick has agreed to the offer to join the Harlequins coaching team," the Premiership side's director of rugby John Kingston said.
"His role will allow him to bring new and innovative ideas which will benefit the team massively."
Evans won 16 caps for New Zealand and was one of the most successful overseas imports to the Premiership, winning the title with Quins in 2012.
The fly-half scored 2,249 points in his 208 senior appearances.
During the past two years he has coached Wimbledon RFC, guiding them to promotion to National Two last season.
"He was an unbelievably intelligent player and has already met considerable success coaching Wimbledon over the last few seasons," Kingston added.
