The agency that investigates serious environmental crime needs to deal more rigorously with offenders, a review has found.

The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) also needs to step up its enforcement and regulation activity, the review said.
The NIEA's responsibilities include illegal waste.
The recommendations are in a report by Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland.
The report examined the work of an NIEA unit responsible for major criminal investigations.
Its recommendations have been welcomed by Environment Minister Mark H Durkan who said they "mirror my approach".
Criminal Justice Inspection was called in to review the Environmental Crime Unit after concerns were raised last year about the way cases were being conducted.
It found there was nothing to suggest "systematic malpractice" and said claims of "criminal interference" were "unproven".
But it did suggest measures that could improve the unit's performance, including the prioritisation of serious cases.
James Corrigan of the Criminal Justice Inspection said: "The unit needs to apply a much more robust and rigorous approach to enforcement.
"That mean's much more focus on gathering evidence, a greater focus on case preparation and a greater focus on effective prosecution."
The report said more staff with an investigations background should be recruited.
It also recommended that there should be a strategic assessment of the waste industry to establish the scale of environmental crime in it.
It also said that when deciding which cases to pursue, persistent serious offenders should not benefit from discretion.
"The underlying principle of full compliance and respect for the law should be clearly stated and emphasised," it said.
Mr Durkan said the inspection team had been called in at his request.
"We already have a business plan in place to build strong partnerships with other law enforcement agencies to get tougher on those who damage our environment and heritage," he said.
"I accept all the report's recommendations in principle and, subject to some issues of resourcing, look forward to helping drive these forward, in partnership with our stakeholders. "
The waste sector in Northern Ireland has seen some major abuses.
Three years ago, 516 tonnes of waste were found in an area near the River Faughan in Londonderry.
It is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the Environmental Crime Unit.
It could end up costing the taxpayer anything up to Â£100m in clean-up costs and fines.
