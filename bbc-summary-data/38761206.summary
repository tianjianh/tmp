[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norma Bell death: Gareth Dack 'trying to hoodwink jury'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drug dealer accused of murdering an elderly woman tried to hoodwink the jury in his account of his movements in the run-up to her death, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norma Bell's body was found in her burning home in Westbourne Road, Hartlepool, in April. The 79-year-old had been strangled with a cable.
Gareth Dack told Teesside Crown Court he was selling cocaine on the night of Mrs Bell's death.
Mr Dack, 33, denies murder and arson.
Under cross-examination, he said he had been selling the Class A drug from his parents' garage but refused to name any buyers as he claimed they included solicitors and police community support officers.
The prosecution said revealing their identities could provide Mr Dack with an alibi and were crucial to his credibility.
It alleged he lied to the jury to cover his tracks.
Mr Dack, of Windermere Road, Hartlepool, is accused of trying to blow up Mrs Bell's home after killing her.
It is also alleged he stole a boxed TV and Â£700 and called sex chat-lines from her landline as she lay dying or dead.
The father of four's DNA was found on a number of items including a spent match on a gas hob and a ligature around Mrs Bell's neck.
However, he told the court that was a result of carrying out odd jobs for her rather than the items being left during a fatal attack.
He said he visited her house to fix her gate on the night before her body was discovered and added she was alive when he left.
The trial continues.
