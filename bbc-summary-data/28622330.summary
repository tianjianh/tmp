Coastguards are urging people to take care in "choppy" seas after three incidents in the space of an hour.

Holyhead coastguards, an inshore lifeboat and an RAF rescue helicopter helped four kayakers after they capsized off Church Bay at 13:12 BST.
At about the same time, Swansea coastguards said teams rescued two people in capsized dinghies and another three people when a catamaran capsized.
A spokesman urged caution, adding the winds were a 'choppy' force six.
He said two dinghies capsized off Penmaen, which resulted in two people in the water.
Oxwich coastguard rescue team, Mumbles all-weather lifeboat and the Horton inshore lifeboat were scrambled, but the casualties were picked up by a passing vessel and taken to Oxwich Bay safely.
As the teams finished dealing with that incident, they were scrambled to reports of a capsized catamaran off Port Eynon point.
Two adults and a nine-year-old girl were in the water, but again were picked up by a passing vessel.
A Swansea coastguard spokesman said: "They could have been two very nasty incidents.
"It's a bit choppy out there. There are force six winds so we would advise people to stay within the limits of what they are capable of."
The Holyhead incident involved a man and three children, but all were uninjured.
