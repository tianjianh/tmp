A statement released by the club said the 51-year-old man was taken ill during the 1-0 win against Stoke City.
He was taken to Aintree Hospital in Liverpool, but died shortly after.
Everton said it was "deeply saddened", adding: "The thoughts and prayers of everybody at the football club are with his family and friends."
It said: "The fan, who was seated in the Sir Philip Carter Park End Stand for the game, became unwell just after 16:15 BST.
"Police officers, an off duty doctor and paramedics performed CPR on the supporter prior to the arrival of an ambulance."
The club added that it would "continue to provide all the support possible to the family".
Liverpool Echo reporter Greg O'Keeffe, who was at the match, said as the man was carried away on a stretcher, fans in the stand stood and applauded paramedics who had tried to save him.
