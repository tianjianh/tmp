Kylie Minogue, Katherine Jenkins and Gary Barlow were among those who sang on a night of military and musical displays in Windsor Castle's grounds.
Actors including Dame Helen Mirren and Damian Lewis narrated historic moments from the Queen's life during the show.
The Queen's birthday was on 21 April, and formal celebrations will take place next month on her official birthday.
Sunday's show was hosted by Ant and Dec and broadcast live on ITV.
The Queen was joined at the event by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.
Writing in the official programme, Prince Charles wished his mother "the happiest of very special birthdays".
The show included hundreds of horses, a dancing Shetland pony, a pantomime horse and a pantomime corgi.
Acts from around the world entertained the 6,000 spectators, and the performers all gathered on the showground as a giant model birthday cake was brought out for the ending.
Dame Shirley Bassey sang the James Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, before Happy Birthday was played, followed by the National Anthem.
