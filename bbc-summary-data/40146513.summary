Sussex v Worcestershire: Visitors collapse at Hove after double-century opening stand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire's winning run looks set to come to an end after being made to follow on against Sussex at Hove.

After resuming on 139-0, openers Daryl Mitchell and Brett D'Oliveira extended their first-wicket partnership to 215.
But Mitchell (121) and D'Oliveira (80) went in quick succession as, stung by the second new ball, the visitors lost all 10 wickets for 97, all out for 312.
Second time around, Worcestershire are on 124-4, with Mitchell gone for 54, still trailing Sussex by 143 runs.
After their second double-century opening stand in three matches, Worcestershire still looked well set on 228-3 at lunch, despite another cheap dismissal for Tom Fell.
But, when Sussex took the new ball, the hosts' multi-national attack suddenly looked a different proposition.
Jofra Archer (4-91) and Vernon Philander (3-72) were the main protagonists as, coupled with some uneven bounce, the last seven wickets went down for 52 runs inside 15 overs.
Mitchell now has 534 runs from his last five innings in three matches but it will not prevent Worcestershire's six-game winning run in the Championship, going back to last season, coming to an end.
Sussex and England all-rounder Chris Jordan told BBC Sussex:
"It has been a brilliant day for us. Even when their openers were putting on 215 we created chances but once David Wiese got us the breakthrough with two quick wickets we never looked back.
"We just needed that bit of luck. With the bowlers we've got we knew we could get enough out of the wicket and run through them and that's what happened.
"When they followed on, it was pretty similar and to get Daryl Mitchell out again just before the close was very important. It has given us an end to attack."
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Our two openers toiled manfully at times and also took the opportunity to score runs. They batted really well but we lost three wickets before lunch.
"Then it became increasingly difficult for new batsmen to come in for two reasons. The Sussex bowlers produced a really good effort and the pitch started to go up and down a bit.
"You have to give Sussex's bowlers credit. They bowled well and have really turned up this game but we are still fighting. Any runs we can get that give us a lead are going to be worth double."
