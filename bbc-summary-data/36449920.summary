Nordea Masters: Matthew Fitzpatrick leads by three in Sweden

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Matthew Fitzpatrick leads a group containing a strong British contingent by three shots in the Nordea Masters in Sweden.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fitzpatrick followed his opening round of 68 with a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 to go 11 under on Friday.
Compatriots Ross Fisher (68) and Andrew Johnston (69) and Scott Henry (69) of Scotland are part of a group of five players on eight under.
Another Englishman, Lee Westwood, is five under following a round of 71.
"It's always nice to have a bogey-free round and particularly seven under," said Fitzpatrick, who claimed his first European Tour title with victory in the British Masters at Woburn last year.
"More often than not it might be bogey-free and one or two under, but to have seven birdies today is a nice start to the tournament.
"I just gave myself a lot of chances today. Everyone will probably laugh when I say it but I missed a couple of chances on 13 and 14, so roll those in and all of a sudden you are nine under, but I just putted really solidly and played well overall."
