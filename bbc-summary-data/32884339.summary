[SN]TITLE[SN]
SNP rules out Moray Council administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP will not take on administration of Moray Council after exploring possible alliances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The SNP is the biggest party on the authority, holding 11 out of the 26 council seats after winning two recent by-elections.
The nationalist group has now said it did not have enough support from other councillors to make running the council a viable option.
The Independent and Conservative coalition will remain in charge.
