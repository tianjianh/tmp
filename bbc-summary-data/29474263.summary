Lindsay Lohan 'not a car crash' in new West End play

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lindsay Lohan has always divided opinion and last night she was at it again.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Over the years she's made headlines for drug abuse, depression and spending time in prison but this time it's for her debut in a West End play.
Even her casting, as Karen the secretary in Speed-the-Plow, was controversial and critics questioned her ability to do the role justice.
And those arguments look set to continue long after opening night.
But given this was her first performance in the prestigious theatre district of London, surely she can be excused a few opening night nerves?
After the play's press night on Thursday there's been a mixed response to her performance.
For starters, at one point Lohan forgot her lines. "Not the biggest deal," said critic Mark Shenton, "but she's kind of an embarrassment compared to the very professional actors with her."
Ouch.
Others were more generous.  The Daily Mirror's Fay Strang says she "pulled it back" after fluffing her lines, "showing she's a true professional."
We'll call it a tie so far.
One of Karen's most famous lines is "I know what it is to be bad, I've been bad", and Lohan knows a thing or two about that.
Her ability to relate to Karen meant many thought the casting was a stroke of genius, but not everyone agreed.
Maybe Lilo should avoid the Daily Mail's review.  Their notoriously tough critic Quentin Letts didn't hold back.
"Lindsay Lohan's acting is like that of a not specially gifted schoolgirl," he wrote.
That's not too bad, but he keeps going: "The director should be ashamed for even putting on this travesty of art".
A little strong?
"The casting of Miss Lohan was was the work of agents and producers and commercial sharks who thought they could turn a few quid."
"By any normal measure, what with her lack of fluency, her inexperience on stage, it would have seen her discarded at the first audition."
Wow, let's just say he didn't enjoy it, shall we?
Thanks to Lilo this play has had more attention than most before it opened.
Her face is plastered across promotional billboards for the play leading to suggestions they were "exploiting" her notoriety and emotional past.
But as the Independent's Paul Taylor wrote, there's no proof notoriety "necessarily puts bums on seats".
"So bravo to Lindsay Lohan for transcending these considerations and turning in a deftly delineated characterisation." (I think that means she did good.)
Put more simply, Taylor said she "silenced the doubters".
But the opinions continue to be split.  In the Telegraph she "made her stage debut with a surprising - and smouldering - degree of style", only to be told she was "out of her league" elsewhere.
The Daily Express' Simon Edge sat on the fence a little more, saying it "wasn't a great performance" but also suggesting it "wasn't a car crash", which is good, because she's been in a few of those.
But Edge also said the weight of expectation probably didn't help with her nerves.
So, was she any good?  Probably best to judge for yourself, but if you want to go and see the play remember this is Lindsay Lohan and car crash or not, tickets will sell out fast.
Love her or hate her, Lindsay Lohan is back in the headlines, but we're still not sure if it's good news.
