The movie, which sees the actor play a sheriff chasing an escaped drug baron, took just £539,000 from 356 cinemas.
The Last Stand, which had an estimated budget of $30m (£19m), averaged £1,514 at each screen.
Les Miserables remains the top UK film for a third successive week, raking in £4m for an overall total of £24.61m.
Tom Hooper's critically acclaimed production, based on the West End musical, opened with £8.13m but saw a 46% drop from last week - blamed largely on snow deterring potential cinemagoers.
Last year saw just four films - Avengers Assemble, The Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - top £4m for three consecutive weeks. All of them went on to make more than £50m.
Les Miserables is now the second highest-grossing musical in UK box office history behind Mamma Mia! (£69.2m), after overtaking Moulin Rouge (£18.5m) and High School Musical 3 (£22.8m).
Films nominated for best picture at next month's Oscars filled the top five places at the UK box office, with Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained at number two after taking £2.4m for a total of £7.18m.
Lincoln debuted at three with £1.65m, while Zero Dark Thirty opened with £1.05m. They were separated by  Life of Pi, whose £1.19m took its overall UK takings to £25.9m.
Tsunami drama The Impossible, raunchy comedy Movie 43, the 3D re-release of Monsters, Inc. and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey complete a Top 10 rounded off by The Last Stand in 10th place.
