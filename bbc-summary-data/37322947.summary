The 29-year-old undefeated Belfast man took the WBA title from Santa Cruz in a superb contest in Brooklyn in July.
Immediately after that contest Frampton said he would be prepared to fight the Mexican again.
"It is the fight people are talking about and potentially it is going to be the next one for me. There is to be a meeting next week," said Frampton.
"Santa Cruz is the fight I am keen for and I feel I can beat him anywhere in the world."
Frampton had previously said he would love to take on Santa Cruz in front of a Belfast audience, but accepted the rematch was more likely to be in the US.
"America is the most likely destination," he said.
"If it had been the summer we could have done outdoors in Belfast, but Windsor Park in December is not going to work.
"I would like to have the fight before Christmas because I have not had Christmas off since I turned pro and I would like to spend it with my kids."
