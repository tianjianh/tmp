Wales basked in sunshine on Saturday with top temperatures of 27째C (80F) in Hawarden, Flintshire, and 25째C (77F) in Cardiff with beaches packed.
It was a cooler 18째C (64F) at Mumbles Head, Swansea.
BBC Wales forecaster Derek Brockway tweeted: "Super sunny Sunday. Very warm or hot with sea breezes."
Sunday is predicted by some to be the hottest June 18 on record in the UK.
While the BBC weather forecast says Wales will be "hot and sunny day with light winds", it did warn of a "very slight chance that the heat will trigger an isolated thundery shower during the afternoon."
BBC Wales presenter Behnaz Akhgar warned the public: "Take care. High UV and high pollen count."
As temperatures soared on Sunday, mountain rescuers helped a black Labrador after its paws got hot while being walked in Snowdonia.
The dog was being walked by two men when it started struggling on Glyder Fach at about 13:50 BST.
Volunteers from Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue tied bandages around its paws during the three hour rescue.
Meanwhile in Swansea, firefighters are battling a grass fire on a cliff between Rotherslade Beach and Limeslade Bay in Mumbles.
Mid and West Fire Service were called to the blaze, which can be seen from the beaches, at 11.50. Three fire engines are at the scene.
