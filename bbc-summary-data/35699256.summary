A witness who tended to the victim, has described how up to 12 men ran away from the scene in Percy Road.
Some of them shouted "Ravi", which it is thought could be the name of the injured man.
Police describe the victim as being in his mid-20s with a dark complexion and say he could be of Eastern European or Asian ethnicity.
He is clean-shaven, of medium build, with dark hair around half an inch in length, detectives said.
Sgt Simon Hanlon, from Force CID, said: "We are following up a number of lines of enquiry to try and trace the people responsible but understanding the identity of the victim is clearly a top priority."
