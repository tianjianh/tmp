Wales assistant manager Osian Roberts hopes forward Hal Robson-Kanu finds new club "sooner rather than later" but that it must be the right move.

Robson-Kanu, who scored twice as Wales reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, is a free agent after leaving Reading at the end of 2015-16.
The 27-year-old remains without a club with the domestic season now underway.
"The important thing is that Hal gets the right move," Roberts told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"There's no point rushing into something if he feels it's not the right one or if he's convinced it's not the right one for his career to progress.
"Everybody understands that's the most important thing but at the same time, he like us, hopes that happens sooner rather than later because everyone's back training and playing games regularly.
"It's important for him that he gets back in the swing of things."
He has been linked with Premier League sides Hull City and Crystal Palace and has said he has received offers from "around the world".
Robson-Kanu left Championship club Reading after nine years when his contract expired during a summer in which he played a key role for Wales.
He scored the winner in the opening game against Slovakia, but grabbed the headlines with a stunning goal in the 3-1 quarter-final win over Belgium.
Wales begin their World Cup qualifying campaign against Moldova at Cardiff City Stadium on 5 September.
