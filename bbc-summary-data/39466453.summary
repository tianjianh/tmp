A convoy of 100 cars has driven through Bibury in an act of solidarity towards Vauxhall Corsa owner Peter Maddox, 84.
Mr Maddox has come under fire for parking his car outside his cottage in Arlington Row.
Tourists have complained that it "ruins" the view and, earlier this year, the vehicle was vandalised.
