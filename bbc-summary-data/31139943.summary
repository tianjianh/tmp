[SN]TITLE[SN]
New hope for blood cancer patients in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blood cancer patients in Wales will be offered a new treatment as an alternative to chemotherapy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patients will be offered Imbruvica, which needs to be swallowed once a day.
It will treat relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and certain types of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), which affects 3,000 people in Wales.
The drug targets cancer cells, stopping them in their tracks before they have time to multiply and travel through the body.
Around one in every 25 people will be diagnosed with blood cancer during their lifetime.
