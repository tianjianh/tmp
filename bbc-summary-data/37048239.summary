Original features at Hyde Park Picture House in Leeds will be restored and accessibility is to be improved.
The 102-year-old cinema is receiving £2.4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Kelmscott Manor in west Oxfordshire, which inspired arts and crafts designer Morris, receives £4.7m to help double its opening days and visitor numbers.
Hyde Park Picture House opened in November 1914, just after the outbreak of World War One, when it broadcast news bulletins and morale-boosting dramas. It still has nine working gas lights, which are used every day when the cinema is open.
General manager Wendy Cook said staff were "delighted" about the grant.
"We are so grateful, so happy and every other possible positive descriptive word there is," she said. "We are doing a lot of work to preserve the fabric of the building - the wonderful period features like the gas lighting and the beautiful balcony and plasterwork.
"We're making sure this heritage site is preserved for the next 100 years."
She said upgrades were being planned because there are currently no accessible toilets and there is limited access to the cinema.
"It means there's a whole section of our community who aren't accessing our films and the events we put on - this is our opportunity to open up to them," Ms Cook added.
The cinema's archives, including film programmes dating back to its opening, will also be shared with the public as part of the project.
Meanwhile, two of Kelmscott Manor's rooms, which are currently closed, will be opened as exhibition and archive spaces, and historic buildings in the grounds are to be restored as a cafe, learning centre and activity space.
The manor's buildings were described by Morris, a writer and social activist as well as a designer, as looking like they had "grown up out of the soil".
Gill Andrews, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, which owns and manages the manor, said: "For William Morris, Kelmscott was a 'heaven on earth' and our aim is to offer visitors of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to explore the inspirational impact that Kelmscott had on Morris and to appreciate his enduring worldwide legacy."
A total of 12 projects and places are receiving a share of the HLF funding.
Other recipients include:
HLF chief executive Ros Kerslake said: "Whether sharing the source of William Morris's inspiration or saving a century of cinema and community heritage, the impact of National Lottery players' money reaches far and wide.
"Today's investment will boost tourism and local economies, secure some of our nation's heritage for future generations to enjoy and provide some fantastic opportunities for volunteers and visitors of all ages."
