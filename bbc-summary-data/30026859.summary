[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jasmyn, 14, was hit by a car when crossing Normanton Hill near Richmond Park, Intake, Sheffield, on 9 May.
Sheffield City Council said the Â£250,000 crossing would be installed in the next financial year.
A man appeared in court in October charged with causing her death by dangerous driving.
She was crossing the road with another girl, aged 12, at about 21:20 on 9 May when both were hit.
The younger girl was seriously injured and had to be treated in hospital.
Police said Jasmyn's last actions had been "to push her friend from danger".
In July, a petition of 12,571 signatures was submitted to the council requesting the crossing and speed restrictions.
The council said extra land was needed to fit in the crossing and a date for its completion was yet to be confirmed, but work will start in the 2015-16 financial year and would take about a year to complete.
Meanwhile, other road safety measures will be installed - including speed cameras, signs and a skid resistant surface. The council is also looking for a school crossing patrol warden.
Since speed cameras were installed on 1 July, police have recorded around 470 speeding offences, the council said.
A council report said: "The introduction of road safety measures on Normanton Hill will bring about a reduction in the number and severity of road traffic collisions."
It also said Normanton Hill had been placed on the council's list of most serious accident locations in the city.
In October, the Jasmyn Chan Foundation was set up to raise money for good causes.
