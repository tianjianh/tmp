Newtownabbey incinerator appeal date pushed back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The date for an appeal against a controversial waste incinerator on the outskirts of Belfast has been pushed back.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ARC21, the group behind the Â£240m development in a former quarry in Newtownabbey, is appealing the decision to deny it planning permission.
The facility had been intended to deal with black bin waste from six councils.
The refusal is being reviewed by the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC).
The hearing had been due to take place in May, but has now been rescheduled for October.
The PAC agreed to the new date after being told that a report on the environmental impact of the project needed to be reviewed.
Planning consultants for ARC21, representing the councils involved in the project, said surveys on newts and bats needed to be looked at again.
The head of ARC21 had also written to the commission saying it couldn't complete "due process" with its constituent councils in time.
ARC21, is the umbrella waste management group for the six councils, but there's a dispute about the appropriateness of the appeal.
The chief executive of Antrim and Newtownabbey Council, a member of ARC21, has written to the Planning Appeals Commission to say ARC21 has "no authority to proceed with the appeal" unless the council approves.
That approval has not been granted.
