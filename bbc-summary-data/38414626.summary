Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale says he would not be surprised if offers come in for striker Ollie Watkins during next month's transfer window.

The 20-year-old has scored six goals this season, including both in City's 2-0 win over Mansfield last week.
Championship clubs are reportedly interested in signing the striker.
"I'm sure there'll be lots of clubs interested in him one day, but at the moment he's our player and I don't really want him to go," Tisdale said.
Watkins made his City debut as a teenager in May 2014 and was given his first start in the Devon derby at Plymouth Argyle in November 2015.
"He's a good young player and he's a very good age for someone who's playing regular league football and scoring goals," Tisdale told BBC Sport.
"He's athletic and I'd be amazed if there aren't clubs looking at him, but that's the same for other players as well and I'm not looking for players to go, we're just getting things going, but we'll see what happens."
Exeter have done major deals in the last two January transfer widows - Matt Grimes left for Swansea City in a club-record Â£1.75m deal in 2015 and Tom Nichols joined Peterborough United for an undisclosed fee - believed to be six figures - at the start of this year.
"You can't get ahead of yourself, you just have to keep working hard and if people are talking about you then you're obviously doing something right," said Watkins.
"I just want to keep working hard and help the team climb up the table."
