The blaze sent up a pillar of black smoke that could be seen across the city.
There are no known injuries, and the facility has been evacuated, according to a GE official.
About 200 fire-fighters were deployed to the facility, which is primarily used for storage and office space.
GE Spokesman Dominic McMullan said that it is not yet known what caused the fire.
"We feel very fortunate that due to Good Friday being a holiday for employees that there were limited personnel working in Appliance Park today," he said.
Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said that the area has been evacuated.
The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that "leaf-sized" pieces of charred insulation and soot were raining on residents up to three miles away from the scene.
People living within a half mile of the fire were told to remain inside, the paper reported.
