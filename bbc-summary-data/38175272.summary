Jonathan Mitchell: Derby County goalkeeper extends contract

Derby County goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell has extended his contract with the Championship club until the end of the 2018-19 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England Under-21 international Mitchell's previous deal was set to expire at the end of this season.
The 22-year-old, who played in five game on loan at Luton last term, has made two appearances for the Rams.
"He is a promising young goalkeeper with a lot of potential," manager Steve McClaren told the club website.
"He's still learning and gaining valuable experience, but he has a number of excellent qualities and we're really happy to extend his stay with us."
