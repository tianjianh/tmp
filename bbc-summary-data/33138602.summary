Save the Children's offices in Pakistan are still shut, a day after the government apparently suspended moves to close the charity.

"As of now, our offices remain sealed off," a Save the Children spokesman told the BBC.
The charity's main office in Islamabad was closed by police last Thursday, with no formal reason given.
Officials have previously accused the charity of involvement in "anti-state activities".
Pakistan had linked the charity to a fake vaccination programme used by the CIA to track down Osama Bin Laden.
Save the Children has always denied being involved with the CIA or Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi, who carried out the programme.
"We have not been officially notified that we can go back to our offices or resume our operations. So we are staying put," Saeed Ahmed, a spokesman for Save the Children Pakistan, told the BBC.
