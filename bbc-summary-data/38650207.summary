The blast reduced much of the end terrace property in Cecil Road, Blackley, to rubble on Monday afternoon.
Two men were taken to hospital. One is critically ill and the other is in a stable condition.
The latter, a 33-year-old man, is being held on suspicion of causing an explosion to endanger life.
Police said the investigation continues at the property and inquiries are ongoing.
Three people were also treated at the site of the blast, which badly damaged the house next door.
Residents in surrounding homes were evacuated for a short time.
The precise cause of the blast is not yet known but was being treated as gas-related, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said.
Det Insp Dave Sinclair said: "This was a devastating incident which has left two people in hospital with serious injuries and destroyed part of a terraced street.
"The house is now being treated as a crime scene. Given the problematic working conditions, it may be several days before we will be able to return the street to normality."
Police are appealing for witnesses to contact them.
