The Tandragee man was killed while providing medical cover at a Skerries 100 practice session in County Dublin.
His family asked motorcyclists to join the cortege as it travelled north on the Dublin-to-Belfast motorway.
The convoy did a lap of "John's favourite" Tandragee 100 circuit.
Bikers joined the family as the cortege passed a service station on the M1 near Castlebellingham in County Louth on Tuesday.
Dr Hinds, originally from Portaferry, County Down, was a consultant at Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh.
The 35-year-old and his colleague Dr Fred McSorley were dubbed "the flying doctors" of Irish motorcycle sport.
The pair would follow racers, travelling almost as fast as many of them on their own high-powered motorcycles.
The statement, issued on behalf of his partner, parents and brothers, said: "John lived for his family, his patients and the biking fraternity."
They said they were "only now beginning to understand just how many lives John touched during his 35 action-packed years".
"The widespread support and acknowledgement of John's work, both nationally and internationally, has been incredibly heartwarming and a great source of comfort to us all at this terribly sad time," they said.
His funeral is due to take place in Portaferry on Thursday.
