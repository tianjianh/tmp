L/Cpl Trimaan "Harry" Dhillon denies murdering 24-year-old Alice Ruggles at her flat in Gateshead in October.
The jury was shown CCTV footage of him accosting Eniko Nemeth after she ended their relationship, in which he called her a bitch and spat in her face.
Police were called and he was later given a year-long restraining order.
Prosecutor Richard Wright QC said the 26-year-old signaller confronted Ms Nemeth in a street in Faversham, Kent, demanding to know why the relationship had ended.
He said: "She warned him she would call the police but he continued to block her path, he appeared worked up and tense.
"She was joined by a male friend and he said 'is this who you are sleeping with? I cannot believe you would leave me for this. Why did you take my girlfriend away?'"
Police were called and he was charged with common assault, but the case was discontinued after he accepted a restraining order.
The trial had previously heard that Mr Dhillon - a serving soldier with the 2 Scots, who lived in barracks outside Edinburgh - had been given official warnings by police and the Army to stay away from Ms Ruggles.
Beginning his defence, he told the jury that he had been "behaving immaturely" when he was given the restraining order against Ms Nemeth.
He said that his relationship with Ms Ruggles had begun over Facebook while he was serving in Afghanistan.
Under questioning from the defence QC, Jamie Hill, he said: "She brought marriage up, she showed me a ring with a blue gem on it and said do you like this kind of ring?"
He claimed she was insecure and accused him of looking at other women, making him delete as Facebook friends girls he had previously dated.
The trial continues.
