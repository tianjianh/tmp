[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 2-3 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Jordy Hiwula grabbed a 90th-minute winner as Wigan Athletic scored three goals in the final nine minutes to fight back from 2-0 down and beat Chesterfield in a compelling match.

Dan Gardner's fabulous 30-yard strike put the Spireites ahead and Leon Barnett's own goal put them in control.
But Barnett's fine low shot and a Craig Davies penalty levelled things.
And, as the Wigan pressure grew, Hiwula stole the points when he scored with a coolly-taken right-foot strike.
The victory, which puts Wigan level with their hosts on 10 points, looked a near impossibility as the hosts seized control after a goalless first half.
The Latics were on top before the interval but trailed when Gardner cut in from the left flank and crashed a superb shot high into the net.
Barnett's bizarre headed own goal looked like deciding the match, but he made amends when he netted at the right end on 81 minutes.
And, after Davies scored from the spot following Sam Hird's foul on Chris McCann, Hiwula's strike ensured a first away league win of the season for Wigan.
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell told BBC Radio Manchester:
"Crazy game. I thought we deserved to be in front before they scored but in the second half we just had a crazy 10 minutes.
"Character and desire is something you need in any successful football team. The way they played in the last 15 to 20 minutes was phenomenal and we deserved to win at the end.
"I'd look like Graham Barrow, with grey hair, if we keep doing that so that's not how we want to win games.
"But at times you need to have the desire to keep going. We're going to need that throughout the season."
