Zion Harvey described waking up with new hands as "weird at first, but then good.'"
He lost his limbs due to a severe infection when he was two-years-old.
Zion had told his doctors and his mother that more than anything he wanted to be able to play on the jungle gym and throw a ball.
Four teams of surgeons worked over 11 hours to complete the complicated operation.
