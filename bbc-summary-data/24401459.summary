Paul Eastment and Chris Missen, from Porthcawl in Bridgend county, along with Poole-based crewman Martin Blaker-Rowe, rescued Vanessa Glover when water swept her from her car.
The crew will be presented with the Pride of Britain Emergency Services Award in London on Monday.
They were nominated by Mrs Glover.
She told the ITV programme Daybreak: "They know how proud of them I am and how very grateful I am to be alive.
"I'm so grateful for this showcasing and nomination. They are volunteers and... risked their own lives."
The rescue took place in the early hours of 23 December last year when the River Taw had reached 3.5 metres (11ft) above its normal range.
Mrs Glover, a mother of one, had been swept from her car in Umberleigh after it was forced off a road by flood water, leaving her husband and seven-year-old son holding onto the car roof.
She was left clinging to a branch.
At 01:51 GMT the RNLI's flood rescue team launched its boat with Mr Missen at the helm.
Boat team leader Mr Eastment and crew member Mr Blaker-Rowe guided Mr Missen along the safest route to reach Mrs Glover with only head torches for light.
They reached her and at 01:57 GMT she was in the rescue boat, very cold and receiving treatment.
The men previously won the RNLI bronze medal for gallantry - one of the institution's highest accolades - for the rescue.
