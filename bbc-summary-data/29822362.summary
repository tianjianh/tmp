The Everton duo missed the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany because of injury.
Norwich's Wes Hoolahan is out with an injured ankle but Glenn Whelan and Darron Gibson are both included despite being injury concerns.
Whelan has a leg fracture while Gibson jarred a knee in training this week.
The Irish face Scotland in a Euro 2016 qualifier on 14 November and a friendly with the United States four days later.
Whelan suffered the fracture in the 1-1 draw with Germany earlier this month and the Stoke City midfielder was expected to be sidelined for around six weeks.
However, he is part of the 36-man provisional squad named by Republic boss Martin O'Neill.
O'Neill said on Wednesday that Everton midfielder Gibson had sustained a knock to his knee in training this week, although the extent of any possible damage was not yet known.
Uncapped Hull City defender Brian Lenihan is again included after being drafted in as cover for Coleman before the Gibraltar and Germany matches.
This is no place for Aston Villa winger Jack Grealish, who has yet to commit his future to the Republic and is eligible to play for England.
The Republic are level on points with Group D leaders Poland after three qualifiers, with the Scots three points behind in fourth.

The Glasgow qualifier is followed by an Aviva Stadium friendly with the Americans.
"I am looking forward to assembling the squad for the last time this year in preparation for our final games of 2014," said O'Neill
