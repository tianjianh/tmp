West Brom's Saido Berahino attracting transfer interest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom forward Saido Berahino is attracting interest from clubs in England and overseas with January's transfer window set to open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Berahino, 23, is back at the club after being sent to a conditioning camp in France to help him lose weight and regain fitness.
He played for West Brom's U-23s against Brighton on Monday, his second reserves game since returning to the club.
Berahino is out of contract at the end of the season.
He could sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas club from 1 January that would allow him to leave for nothing. If he joined another English club, his fee would be decided by a tribunal.
It is the same situation Danny Ings was in when he left Burnley for Liverpool in 2015. Liverpool could end up paying £8m for Ings, the biggest fee awarded by a tribunal.
Berahino has not played for West Brom since 10 September and his last goal came against Chelsea on 27 February.
The Burundi-born player reacted angrily after being denied a move to Tottenham, who had three bids for him, including one of £22.5m, turned down in 2015.
Stoke and Crystal Palace both failed with £20m offers to buy Berahino last summer.
