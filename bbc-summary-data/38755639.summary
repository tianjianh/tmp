Major Peake became the first British astronaut to live on the ISS, when he spent six months on-board carrying out experiments last year.
Speaking at London's Science Museum on Thursday morning, he announced he will be taking on a second European Space Agency (ESA) mission in the future.
The timing is yet to be decided, but his second space mission would likely happen in the period 2019-2024.
Major Peake was at the Science Museum for the opening of the display of the space capsule that carried him to and from the International Space Station last year.
He said the Russian capsule is an important part of UK space history and hopes it will inspire future astronauts.
The Soyuz TMA-19M has been repaired since its landing, but is still slightly scorched from re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
