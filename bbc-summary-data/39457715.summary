A "charismatic and beautiful" girl who suffered brain damage due to treatment delays as a newborn has been awarded a multimillion-pound compensation deal at the High Court.

The 12-year-old, who cannot be named, was born healthy at Warrington Hospital, but became ill shortly after.
Delays in her care left her with extensive needs, the High Court heard.
Judge Mr Justice Goss awarded her a one-off payment of £2.5m and an annual allowance of £260,000.
This yearly allowance will rise to £312,000 when she reaches her nineteenth birthday.
Christopher Johnston QC told the court she would have suffered no lasting effects if she had been swiftly diagnosed.
However, alleged delays in diagnosis and treatment left her needing extensive help.
Mr Johnston added that despite her severe difficulties, the girl's intellect is unaffected.
He said her mother had described her as "charismatic, sociable and beautiful" and hoped she would see Professor Stephen Hawking, who suffers from Motor Neurone Disease, as a "role model".
Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the Cheshire hospital, admitted liability and agreed to settle the girl's claim, which was made through her mother.
Representing the trust, Margaret Bowron QC said an apology had been made to the family and it was hoped the financial settlement would bring them "peace of mind".
Addressing the girl's parents, Mr Justice Goss said it would be "a small measure of comfort".
"Nothing that the law can do can undo what has taken place, as you well know, and I am sure not a day has gone by when that hasn't crossed your minds," he said.
"Your daughter is clearly a remarkable child and that, in a sense, is a blessing for you - it is also plain to see that the love and affection you have for her is remarkable."
