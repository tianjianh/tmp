Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right VVD party had sought to strike a deal with the liberal D66, the Christian Democrats and the Green-Left.
The talks had been ongoing for 61 days since an election in March.
The Green-Left support open borders, while the other three want stricter controls.
The minister who had been tasked with forming the new government will submit a report to parliament before the members discuss how to proceed.
Geert Wilders, the leader of the anti-EU, anti-Islam Freedom Party, welcomed the news, saying he was ready to talk.
His party came second in the polls.
In 2012 it took 54 days for two parties to form a government in the Netherlands, the sixth-biggest economy in the EU.
