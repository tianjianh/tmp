A rare Broadway musical penned by legendary composer Irving Berlin is to get its UK "premiere".

Miss Liberty was first performed in New York in 1949 and was written by Irving Berlin, who also wrote Annie Get Your Gun and White Christmas.
The University of Sheffield claims it is the first performance of the show in Britain.
Its special performance will feature four numbers cut from the original which were rediscovered by researchers.

Dr Dominic McHugh found the lost songs in Berlin's archive papers in the Library of Congress.
The musical is a fictionalised account of the Statue of Liberty's arrival in New York in 1885, he said.
"The show is all about two newspaper companies, great rivals, who raised the funds to have the statue constructed on its plinth," he said.
"Because although the French sent the statue to America they didn't provide the funding to put it on it plinth."
The two performances will feature more than 60 singers and musicians drawn from the university's Department of Music.
Co-producer Matthew Malone said the concerts would be a chance to recreate the "traditional Broadway sound", which had been lost over the years as theatre orchestras grew smaller.
"Because of the influence of technology there's extensive use of things like synthesizers and click tracks in the West End," he said.
"What we're aiming to do is perform the shows as they were, with anything from 26 to 40 musicians to achieve that period 1940s and 1950s sound."
The shows will take place in the city's Firth Hall on the 9 and 10 December.
Berlin's estate gave permission to use the songs.
