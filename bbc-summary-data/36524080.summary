World number two Jordan Spieth says he will play at the Rio Olympics, despite the concerns over the Zika virus.

Australians Marc Leishman and Adam Scott will not attend because of the infection, which is linked to brain deformities in newborn babies.
However, Rory McIlroy's fears have eased and US Open champion Spieth, 22, said he was "pretty confident" over information received from the PGA Tour.
"Being an Olympian is a tremendous honour," the Texan said.
"Do I think being an Olympian outweighs any significant health threat? No. If I thought that the threat was significant, I certainly would not go," added Spieth, who will defend his US Open title at Oakmont this week.
"But based on what's come to my knowledge at this point, it seems like it's going to be an extremely memorable experience and I look forward to trying to win a gold for the United States."
