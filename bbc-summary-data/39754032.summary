[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester City v Crystal Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City top scorer Sergio Aguero is sidelined with a groin injury picked up in Sunday's draw against Middlesbrough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is hoped Aguero will be fit for the game with Leicester on 15 May but Claudio Bravo will play not again this season because of a calf problem.
John Stones is out and David Silva is doubtful with a hamstring injury.
Andros Townsend is a doubt for Crystal Palace after experiencing discomfort in his Achilles during training on Friday.
Palace are still missing a raft of key players including Scott Dann, Mamadou Sakho, James Tomkins and Yohan Cabaye.
Steve Bower: "Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's home form will determine their Champions League fate, and with three consecutive home games before a final day trip to Watford they have an inviting opportunity to clinch their target.
"Guardiola has still only lost once at the Etihad in the Premier League, although any repeat of some of their frustrating draws may make it too close for comfort. The return of the exciting Gabriel Jesus has certainly come at the right time.
"They will be wary of what Crystal Palace have achieved recently at Stamford Bridge and Anfield, and mathematically Sam Allardyce can't pop the survival champagne just yet, although the cork will be loosened if he can upset another one of the big boys."

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: "We will see if we are able to make our step forward to qualify.
"If we win all four games we will definitely be in the Champions League and maybe in the third position. It depends on us.
"Our home games have not been perfect this season. We have to change it in three home games if we want to play in the Champions League next season."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "It's nonsense (to say anyone is too good to be relegated).
"I was at Bolton when Leeds went down. They were an outstanding talented side at the time. The negativity had sunk into the team, no matter how good they were.
"Alan Smith, Mark Viduka, what players they were and they still got relegated. 'Too good' is not a term I like to use.
"What we have to do now is try to finish it off as quickly as we can."
I was a bit surprised to see Burnley win at Crystal Palace last weekend. The Clarets deserved to win too, but Palace were safe already - or as good as - so I don't think that defeat puts them back in trouble.
Mamadou Sakho's injury has weakened the Eagles at the back and, if Burnley can get through them, then Manchester City will too.
