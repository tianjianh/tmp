The 25-year-old made 50 appearances for the League Two side after joining from non-league Aldershot last summer.
He started his career at Millwall and spent time at the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain before resuming his career.
"I like to say I'm a ball playing centre-half that's capable of playing both sides of the game," Beckles said.
