Kenneth Noye: Parole board considers M25 killer's release

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A parole hearing is under way for notorious criminal Kenneth Noye which could see him released from jail on licence by the end of the year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was jailed for life for the road rage murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in 1996 during a fight on an M25 slip road in Kent.
The 68-year-old fled to Spain but was extradited later and convicted in 2000.
A spokesman for the parole board said it was not known when the result of the hearing would be made public.
Noye, who is in Wayland Prison, Norfolk, was due to be granted hearings earlier this year but they were cancelled.
In February, the victim's mother, Toni Cameron, described Noye as a lifelong "villain" who should never be let out of jail.
"We just feel that it's not fair that he should come out and have parole. He's a villain and he always has been. His whole life is criminality," she said.
Noye was involved in the Â£26m Brinks Mat raid in 1983 - one of the UK's biggest robberies - when six armed men posed as security guards and stole 6,800 gold bars from a warehouse at Heathrow Airport.
During the police investigation in 1985, Noye stabbed to death undercover officer Det Con John Fordham in the grounds of his mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent.
He admitted killing the detective in self-defence when he found him in shrubbery at his home.
Noye was cleared of murder but jailed for 14 years for handling stolen bullion.
Two years after his release, he murdered Mr Cameron during the M25 slip road fight with a knife he kept in his car.

A range of prison and parole staff reports will be considered before the parole board makes a decision on whether Noye should be released.
If it decides that Noye is fit for release then its decision is final.
It can also recommend that he is moved to a low category open prison but this would be open to challenge.
