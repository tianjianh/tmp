The oldest tiger in the UK has reached his 20th birthday after being rescued from a German circus and going into retirement.

Tango and his partner Julia were only hours away from being put to sleep when they were saved by Woodside Wildlife Park in Lincolnshire.
Tango was given a cardboard birthday cake filled with meat to celebrate his milestone.
Ben Pascoe, head keeper at the park, said he was in good health for his age.
"He's got a little bit of arthritis in his elbows which is to be expected of a cat of that age, but everything else is fine," he said.
"On a particularly cool day he can be seen chasing butterflies around in his enclosure and he's quite proud of himself when he catches them."
As well as the cake, Tango was given present boxes filled with meat and was thrown balls smeared in horse dung to play with.
But he preferred a quiet birthday resting in the sunshine, while nine-year-old Julia played with the cake and presents instead.
Tango is less active than when he was younger.
"Generally they live into their late teens and he's currently the oldest tiger in the UK," said Mr Pascoe.
"He's the equivalent of about an 80-year-old man and I don't know of any 80-year-old men that are still running about, so he's generally quite docile.
"But he's still eating and he's healthy, so he's quite happy to retire here for hopefully many years to come."
