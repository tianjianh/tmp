As a player, Maldini won four Serie A titles with Milan, as well as their first European Cup in 1963. He then managed the club between 1972-1974.
In 1996, he became the coach of Italy - with son Paolo captaining the team - before going on to lead Paraguay in the 2002 World Cup.
AC Milan tweeted: "Goodbye dear Cesare. Today the world loses a great man and we lose a page of our history."
