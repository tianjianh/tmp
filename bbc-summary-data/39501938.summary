A lack of media coverage of women's sport has been highlighted in a message on a new away kit for Scotland's most successful women's football team.

Glasgow City, who have won 10 Scottish titles in a row, launched a purple and white kit featuring the words "You can't be what you can't see".
Club manager Laura Montgomery said more women on sports pages would create role models for the next generation.
She said female athletes were too often consigned to media lifestyle sections.
In a 2014 TEDx talk, Ms Montgomery said: "Quite simply you can't be what you can't see without visible role models.
"How do girls grow up thinking they can be anything other than sexualised objects, which is how the media currently portrays women."
She said she wanted to inspire future generation of women to be active, healthy and to work hard to achieve their dreams.
Ms Montgomery set up Glasgow City Football Club in 1998 with Carol Anne Stewart.
She said the pair were ridiculed when they pledged to create the best team in Scotland and one of the best teams in Europe.
It is now the most successful Scottish women's team of all time.
She said youth players were supported by the first team and also trained alongside them.
"Every single youth player that we have absolutely idolizes all our first team players and that's because they want to be what they can see," she said.
The strip was launched with a promotional video featuring players Leanne Ross and Jo Love.
The club pointed to Women in Sport statistics which suggested that women's sport makes up 7% of all sports media coverage in the UK.
As a result, it said commercial investment in women's sport was lacking, with women's sport sponsorship accounting for 0.4% of total sports sponsorship between 2011 and 2013.
