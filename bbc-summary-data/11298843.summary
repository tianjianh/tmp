Jay Hunt is to leave her role as controller of BBC One to become chief creative officer at Channel 4.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hunt said she was "proud of what has been achieved on BBC One" but "could not resist the chance to join Channel 4 at such an exciting time."
Jana Bennett, the BBC's director of vision, said Hunt had "led BBC One with great commitment and creative flair."
Her appointment follows that of David Abraham, who was made Channel 4's new chief executive in January.
"Channel 4 requires a fearless creative leader to help steer us through our next phase," he said.
"Jay has demonstrated... her appetite to challenge the status quo, create and lead change, and promote new talent."
Julian Bellamy is currently Channel 4's acting chief creative officer and will leave the station after "a short period of transition".
The newly created chief creative officer role combines the channel's former two most senior creative posts, Head of Channel 4 and Director of Television and Content.
Hunt's successes at BBC One include the modern update of Sherlock Holmes, crime thriller Luther and hard-hitting drama Five Daughters.
She was previously controller of BBC Daytime and worked as editor of the One O'Clock and Six O'Clock News.
Hunt was director of programmes at Five when she was appointed BBC One's controller in 2007.
