Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has "had a lot of offers from lots of different clubs and places" but "nothing is decided" on his future, says his agent Mino Raiola.

Ibrahimovic, 35, is contracted to the club until 30 June.
The Swedish striker is yet to agree an extension to his one-year deal.
Raiola said: "It is right that we talk to Manchester United and see what they are thinking and whether he is of value to them."
Ibrahimovic, who joined the club on a free transfer from Paris St-Germain last summer, has been out injured since suffering cruciate knee-ligament damage in April.
Raiola says he expects the player to make a full recovery for next season, but not necessarily in time for the first round of Premier League matches in August.
When questioned on whether Ibrahimovic is happy at Old Trafford, Raiola said: "Wherever my boy scores he is happy and hopefully the team is too."
Ibrahimovic has scored 28 times in 46 appearances for the club in all competitions.
