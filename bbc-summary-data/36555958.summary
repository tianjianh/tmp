Newly promoted Rangers are at home to Hamilton, while last season's runners-up Aberdeen travel to St Johnstone.
The first Old Firm derby of the season, following Rangers' four-year absence from the top flight, is scheduled for 10 September at Celtic Park.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle host Highland rivals Ross County on the second weekend of the campaign.
County and Caley Thistle meet again in the New Year fixtures, with Celtic travelling to Ibrox and Hearts taking on Aberdeen at Tynecastle.
There will be a winter break after the New Year games, with the action resuming on 28 January.
Celtic were scheduled to face Partick Thistle on 13 August but the champions will use an opt-out option for a friendly with Inter Milan to mark the 50th anniversary season of their 1967 European Cup triumph against the Italians.
The champions are aiming to win their sixth consecutive Scottish title, with Brendan Rodgers the man charged with maintaining their domestic success.
The former Liverpool boss was named as successor to Ronny Deila, who resigned at the end of the season after delivering two Premiership titles during his spell at the club but was undermined by failures in Europe.
Rangers secured their Premiership place by winning the Championship, their third promotion in four years.
Kilmarnock, at home to Motherwell on the opening weekend, retained their top-flight status by winning the play-off final against Falkirk.
Hearts manager Robbie Neilson: "It's a great one to look forward to. It's what we want, big games. It's a great one for the players, a great one for the fans and one for us all to look forward to."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "It's exciting, the start of a season always is. It's a chance to get some points on the board but all the clubs will think that. On paper, the second quarter looks a little trickier so it'd be good to get points on the board early if we can."
Weekend of 6 August:
Partick Thistle v Inverness Caledonian Thistle
Kilmarnock v Motherwell
St Johnstone v Aberdeen
Ross County v Dundee
Heart of Midlothian v Celtic
Rangers v Hamilton Academical
Weekend of 31 December
Partick Thistle v Kilmarnock
