The 31-year-old central midfielder did not travel to Germany on Cardiff's pre-season tour and manager Paul Trollope has confirmed Dikgacoi can leave.
Adam le Fondre and Federico Macheda have already been told they can go and Trollope: said: "He's in a similar situation to Le Fondre and Macheda."
Dikgacoi has played 17 league games since signing for Cardiff in 2014.
"If the right thing comes along in terms of a move away then it's something we'll consider," Trollope told the South Wales Echo.
The 54-times times capped international, who has one year left on his Cardiff contract, played 30 minutes of the pre-season friendly win at Shrewsbury Town but did not travel to Germany as he worked on his fitness.
"He stayed back with the younger group to stay and train there, I thought that would be a move which would benefit all parties," added Trollope.
Dikgacoi, who was part of the South Africa squad for the 2010 World Cup finals, has suffered long-standing knee problems since joining the Bluebirds from Crystal Palace in June 2014.
