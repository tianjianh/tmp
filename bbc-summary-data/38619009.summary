[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town 2-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Isaiah Brown and Christopher Schindler saw Huddersfield climb to third in the Championship and pile more pressure on Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chelsea loanee Brown put the Terriers into the lead towards half-time with a curling shot past Dean Gerken.
Schindler doubled the score after the break, pouncing close-in after Gerken saved a Philip Billing shot.
Michael Hefele failed to make the win more convincing when he was unable to convert Elias Kachunga's cross.
Huddersfield's grasp on third place may only last a matter of hours with fourth-placed Leeds United in action at Barnsley later.
David Wagner's side have lost just once in their past eight Championship games, but Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were defeated for the second time in five days following their FA Cup exit to non-league Lincoln City.
McCarthy handed debuts to new signings Jordan Spence and Kieffer Moore but his side produced just two shots on target.
Kachunga could have scored a hatful himself for Huddersfield - twice he saw headers saved by Gerken and he also shot just wide on a couple of occasions in the second half.
After the game, Mick McCarthy confirmed he was close to signing Leeds midfielder Toumani Diagouraga on loan for the rest of the season.
Former Newcastle defender Steven Taylor, who has been playing in the United States, is also expected to arrive on trial next week.
Huddersfield Town head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"Not only was it a huge result for us today, in my opinion it was a world-class performance from us.
"We needed maybe five to 10 minutes, but after that, we showed what we stand for. We showed our identity, we were very energetic and very aggressive.
"We created two very good chances and scored two wonderful goals. The players have to be proud about what they delivered today.
"It's one thing to speak about a response, but it's another to deliver it."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"There was nothing wrong with what we did. Huddersfield are a very good side. You need to keep doing what you believe in and hopefully nick a few results.
"We were beaten by a better side and I've told the players now is not the time to be falling out with each other. We had a togetherness but we need to add a bit of quality.
On speculation regarding his future at the club: "Anything can happen in the FA Cup and the underdog can turn on you and make you look rubbish.
"Why it happens, I don't know.
"The fans voice their opinions, but I'm here until something changes. I will be here on Monday morning with funny hat and red nose trying to pick everyone up."
