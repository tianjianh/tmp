Top seed Williams won the first set 6-4 and was a tie-break away from defeating the 26th seed when they came off.
After a two-and-a-half hour delay, Williams converted a fifth match point to win 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in Paris.
The American, 34, aiming for her 22nd Grand Slam title, was joined in the next round by older sister Venus.
Venus's match against France's Alize Cornet was stopped at 2-1 because of the rain but the 35-year-old came back to seal a hard-fought 7-6 1-6 6-0 win.
Serena had dropped just five games in her first two matches at Roland Garros, but faced a tougher test against the French number one.
Each player held their serve in the opening set until Williams edged ahead in the 10th game by taking her third break point.
Neither could gain an advantage in the second set, with Mladenovic thumping down an ace in the rain to set up a tie-breaker.
When the match finally resumed on Court Philippe Chatrier, Mladenovic led 5-3 in the decider - and spurned a set point at 9-8 - before two wayward forehands saw Williams through.
"It was very difficult, she played really, really well," Serena said. "She forced me to bring out my best tennis."
She will play in the fourth round against Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina, who won 6-4 6-4 against 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic.
British number two Aljaz Bedene and top seed Novak Djokovic were set to play later on Chatrier.
