The Greater Manchester Police officer crashed the £33,000 VW Golf R on Wharfside Way, Old Trafford, at about 01:50 GMT on 15 December.
The driver was taken to hospital and treated for a back injury.
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman refused to reveal details of how the crash happened.
He said that "as a result of the incident, GMP is reviewing its policy on officers test driving cars".
The officer, who has recovered from his injuries, is currently suspended from driving duties while an internal investigation takes place.
No other vehicles were involved in the crash involving the high-performance car, which is billed as the fastest accelerating Golf going from 0 to 62mph in 5.7 seconds and with a 155mph top speed.
The officer was a member of the force's automatic number plate recognition intercept team, which works to disrupt the criminal use of motor vehicles.
