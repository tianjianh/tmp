Williams knocked the Londoner down with a huge right hand as Corcoran suffered the first loss of his five-year career.
The 24-year-old's first defence of both belts, the first time he had been past eight rounds, was a grudge match.
Williams' trainer Gary Lockett said: "That is one of his worst performances. He lets his emotions get to him."
And Williams admitted: "I was one of my worst performances and I knocked him out. I wasn't even tired."
Both boxers suffered cuts above the right eye but Williams' class ensured he extended his unbeaten professional record to 17 fights as the fighter from the Rhondda Valley hopes for a world title shot.
And his promoter Frank Warren acknowledged: "This young man has a big future ahead of him."
