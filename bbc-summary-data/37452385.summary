The litter of Asian short-clawed otters, is made up of two boys and three girls - all yet to be named by their keepers at Chester Zoo.
Zoo keepers put a camera in their enclosure to seek what they'd get up to.
The pups were pretty playful, looks like these parents have their paws full.
We think they're otterly adorable, so why not take a peek..?
