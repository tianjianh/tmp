A gang of armed robbers threatened to kidnap a child during a "terrifying" robbery at a family home in Leeds.

The 32-year-old mother was at home with her three young children on Thorpe Crescent, Middleton, when she answered the door to four or five masked men at about 20:00 GMT on Monday.
One was armed with what appeared to be a handgun and at least two others had knives, West Yorkshire Police said.
The gang drove off in the family's Range Rover with cash and jewellery.
Police said the car, registration RF58 WYK, belongs to the woman's husband who was out of the house at the time.
It is still missing along with a large amount of cash, jewellery, bank cards and a mobile phone.
Det Insp John Dexter said: "This was an absolutely terrifying experience for the victim to be confronted in her home by a group of masked men armed with weapons.
"Her children were at home at the time and this will have been a really upsetting ordeal for this family.
"At one point the offenders even threatened to take one of her children if she didn't comply with their demands for money.
"The people involved are clearly dangerous and we urgently need to identify them and arrest them at the earliest opportunity. I would like to hear from anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously in Thorpe Crescent in the time leading up to the incident or around the time of the incident itself."
Anyone with information about the grey Range Rover should contact West Yorkshire Police on 101.
