What is thought to be the last surviving ferry of its kind in the world is 45 years old.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MV Glenachulish, which was built in Troon by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, operates on the oldest crossing to Skye from the mainland.
An event to mark the anniversary of the manually-operated turntable ferry will be held in Glenelg on 8 August.
The Chicago Stock Yard Kilty Band, one of America's oldest pipe bands, is to play at the celebration.
In 1921 the band was set up by brothers Robert and James Sim, who served with Scottish regiments during World War I and whose family came from Aberdeen.
Between April and October, the Glenachulish makes a short crossing of the Kylerhea Straits between Glenelg on the mainland and Kylerhea on Skye.
A car ferry has crossed the straits since 1934.
The service has been run by Skye Ferry since 2007. The community-owned company was set up after long-time ferryman Roddy MacLeod retired.
