Victoria Derbyshire programme reporter Catrin Nye accompanied the club's ladies' captain Alex Scott as she trained with some of the children.
The tragedy of children forced from their homes by war and the wealth and vast fame of a Premier League club may not have much in common. But Arsenal says it hopes this project will help children in the worst of circumstances experience the joy of football.
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
