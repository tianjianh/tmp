Kohli, who has a career Test batting average of over 50, averaged only 13.40 in England when India were beaten 3-1 in a five-match Test series in 2014.
He said he wanted to "get used to playing in those conditions" and "understand how the wickets behave".
"Those things matter a lot. Preparation time is something that is very crucial," added the 28-year-old.
Kohli scored a career-best 235 in the fourth Test of the current five-match series against England in India as the hosts took an unassailable 3-0 lead.
He has racked up 640 runs at an average of 128 going into the final Test but England bowler James Anderson believes Kohli has "technical deficiencies" which are exposed in English conditions, but cancelled out by the pitches in India.
Kohli is the only player to average more than 50 in all three forms of international cricket - Tests, one-dayers and Twenty20s.
He is currently second in the ICC Test and ODI rankings, while he tops the T20 category.
On playing county cricket, Kohli added: "I have actually been thinking about it, trying to work out how I can make that happen.
"Most definitely, if I have time I would love to go and play there."
