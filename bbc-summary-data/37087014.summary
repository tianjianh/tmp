In a tight contest the Irish fighter lost on a split decision after a 39-37, 38-38, 37-39 scoreline.
"It is very disappointing - it's very hard to take but I gave it my best shot," Taylor told RTE.
It is another blow for the Ireland team with Michael Conlan the only boxer still involved in the Games.

A positive drugs test for middleweight Michael O'Reilly got Ireland's Rio boxing campaign off to a bad start.
London 2012 bronze medallist Paddy Barnes made a shock exit, while there were also defeats for David Oliver Joyce, Joe Ward, Steven Donnelly and Brendan Irvine.
Bantamweight Conlan clinched a place in the quarter-finals with a unanimous win over Armenia's Aram Avagyan on Sunday.
Taylor produced a busy performance against Potkonen but her opponent landed the bigger punches, giving her the edge and a guaranteed medal as a semi-finalist.
