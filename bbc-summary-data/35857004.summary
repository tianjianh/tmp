Nicholls scored 87.14, just 0.01 points ahead of USA's Chris Corning, with Briton Billy Morgan claiming a bronze medal with 84.91 at the Audi Snowjam.
Nicholls' cousin Katie Ormerod finished second in the women's event behind German veteran Silvia Mittermueller.
"I am so happy to finally win a World Cup," Nicholls said.
"It's a first for me to get on a podium at a World Cup and I am just so pleased with how today went.
"I felt great all day and I was really happy with the run I put down."
In alpine skiing, Dave Ryding finished 15th at the World Cup finals.
The result cemented Ryding's place as one of the world's top-15 slalom skiers and completed an impressive World Cup season, which included a 12th in Val d'Isere and a 13th in Santa Caterina.
