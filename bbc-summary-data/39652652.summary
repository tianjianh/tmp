[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A literature festival is kicking off its seventh year in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Comedian and poet John Hegley is among the headliners for the Big Lit event in Gatehouse of Fleet.
The programme of workshops, talks, readings and entertainment runs until Sunday.
Organisers said that from small beginnings it had evolved into a "mighty four-day festival of wall-to-wall events".
Convener Chrys Salt said the event had started out over one day as part of another festival but had continued to grow and grow.
She said it made sense for it to become a stand-alone festival as it grew in size.
"Now we are four days, wall-to-wall, anything literary, musical, you name it," she said.
Author Karen Campbell and broadcaster Billy Kay are among the others taking part this year.
