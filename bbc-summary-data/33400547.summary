Wayne Powell, 39, who worked as a DJ, was shot several times in Higham Station Avenue, Chingford, east London, by a lone gunman on 5 July 2010.
His partner was expecting their baby at the time of his murder.
Police said allegiances could have changed over the years and someone may now feel they could come forward.
Det Insp Tim Cuthbert said: "We are hoping that anyone with information, who felt they couldn't come forward and assist in 2010, may feel able to finally help us and the family now."
Mr Powell, known as DJ Connoisseur, also worked as a customer assistant for London Underground at Seven Sisters.
He was sat in his black BMW when the gunman approached him.
Police said when he got out of his car the suspect fired four shots before "calmly making off" in the direction of Coningsby Gardens.
The gunman is described as possibly black, about 5ft 10ins tall and was wearing a tracksuit. The weapon used is believed to have been a handgun.
Mr Powell's partner Anne Boriel appealed to the public for help.
"My children have no daddy and are still asking questions to which I have no answers.
"Some brutal coward took him away. We will always remember my partner but we need justice."
