Successive defeats by Manchester United and Swansea saw Arsenal slip off the Premier League pace, but they fought back from a goal and a man down to draw away to Tottenham last weekend.
"We know as a unit it has been tough and we all had a good chat amongst us behind closed doors," Walcott said.
"It was a meeting to express how everyone was feeling and it worked."
With nine games remaining, Arsenal are third in the Premier League, three points off Tottenham and eight behind leaders Leicester.
Walcott believes the meeting helped his side show the spirit needed to claim a point after Francis Coquelin's red card at White Hart Lane.
"I'd like to keep what was said among ourselves but it was very important. We have had a reaction from it," the 26-year-old added.
"It is important that as a team to know we have got it in us. We just have to produce it more often."
As well as retaining hope of landing their first Premier League title in 12 years, Arsenal are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup as they attempt to lift the trophy for a third successive season.
They are 2-0 down against Barcelona before the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Barcelona next week.
