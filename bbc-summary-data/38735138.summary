Hearts head coach Ian Cathro has expressed regret over the manner in which he conducted his post-match television interview after the 1-1 draw against Raith Rovers.

Cathro admits he did not deal with Sunday's Scottish Cup disappointment in the best way on camera.
"Nobody's sent me a copy of the clip yet and I don't think I'm going to watch it," he said.
"I would be cringing more than anybody else in the room."
BBC Scotland had live coverage of the fourth-round tie at Stark's Park, where Declan McManus's late, flicked header cancelled out Jamie Walker's opener, forcing a replay at Tynecastle on Wednesday.
Cathro took part in an awkward interview afterwards and offered an explanation on Tuesday.
"Your mind's in a different place and it shouldn't be, but sometimes it is," he said. "You're going to feel that way at times. I wasn't happy.
"Whether you should try and hide that, maybe you should. You should probably do it better than I did, but that's for me to recognise as well and that will be part of this.
"If there's any reason for it, it's because you take the frustration and disappointment that the fans felt in that moment, you've probably got to times that by 1000 to get to where I was."
Hearts will have a home tie against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian if they beat Raith, but Cathro insists the team's focus is on nothing beyond Wednesday.
New signings Malaury Martin, Lenny Sowah, Andraz Struna and Aaron Hughes were all involved in Sunday's match and Cathro has his eye on adding a couple more before the end of the month.
A striker and a centre-back top his list of priorities
"Yes, we're working, we're working," Cathro said. "Every day we're making progress.
"There are still a few things we'd like to do. The fact we're getting closer to the end of the month, everything does become a little bit more difficult, or complicated.
"You start to see the end of the month and sometimes it changes the conditions and maybe some people's behaviours, and the whole game gets a little bit more, not murky, but more difficult.
"We're in a position where more players will join us, we've just got a bit of work to do. If we bring in another couple of players then we begin to say we have the balance that we would like.
"I don't want to get obsessed about a certain number of players."
