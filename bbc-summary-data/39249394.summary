The footballer went into the studio to lay down a new version of the England squad's 1982 recording of  "This Time We'll Get It Right".
Keegan, who featured on the original which reached number two in the charts, declared the remake with athletes from north-east England "much better".
The Special Olympics GB National Summer Games begins in August in Sheffield.
Keegan, who lives at Wynyard on Teesside and captained both Newcastle and England's 1982 squad in Spain, said: "I think it's a better song now. These guys are definitely better singers than the England football team were.
"Sport's all inclusive, that's what everyone says. Sometimes you wonder, but the Special Olympics follows through on that."
Held every four years, the Special Olympics is the largest multi-sports competition for athletes with learning disabilities.
Keith Hogan, chair of Special Olympics Gateshead Tyne and Wear, added: "Our athletes are already incredibly excited about Sheffield.  Recording this song with Kevin's help is the icing on the cake.
"We're extremely grateful to him helping with the song. Kevin was wonderful, really enthusiastic and interested in what we're doing here."
About 130 athletes have been selected to represent the Northern Region at the 10th National Summer Games, where a total of 2,600 athletes will compete in 20 sports across a dozen venues in Sheffield between 7th and 12th August.
