County Championship: Derbyshire complete win over Kent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesney Hughes and Billy Godleman steered Derbyshire to their second Championship victory of the season as they beat Kent by eight wickets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After 31 wickets on the first two days at Canterbury, the visitors reached 232-2 to wrap things up before lunch.
Hughes fell for 94 when he was bowled by Matt Coles, ending a 186-run stand for the second wicket.
Captain Godleman was left unbeaten on 82 as Tillakaratne Dilshan (27 not out) finished the job with two fours.
The result was a big disappointment for Kent, who led by 119 after bowling Derbyshire out for just 86 in their first innings.
They were unable to engineer a similar collapse as the visitors began day three on 169-1 and the loss of Hughes, who hit a six and 13 fours in his 179-ball innings, was only a blip as they knocked off the 63 runs needed overnight in just 13.2 overs.
It was Derbyshire's first win at Canterbury since April 1999.
Kent captain Sam Northeast:
"I'm very disappointed. When you're almost 120 runs ahead, you expect to go on and build in a game.
"Even at lunch on day two I felt we were in a decent position, but then the big collapse came and we've already had a chat about that as a group.
"I felt the bowlers didn't get the luck they deserved or the support from our attack and the game just drifted away from us."
Derbyshire's acting captain Billy Godleman:
"It was an incredible game of cricket and really enjoyable to be a part of. I'm so pleased we were able to see it through this morning.
"I think Coles bowled very well for Kent in our first innings, but our new-ball bowlers (Mark) Footitt and (Tony) Palladino, together with (Wayne) White in their second innings, were all high-class for us.
"I'm fortunate to have Footitt and Palladino and they make my life as skipper much easier than it might be otherwise.
"You just never know what can happen in cricket if you keep on believing. The trend of the game was for wickets to fall in clusters, so that was our focus second time around, to be patient, and that paid dividends."
