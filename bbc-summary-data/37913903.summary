[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Auchterlonie, 27, has been jailed for 40 months for attacking Casey Thomson, 32, between Rutland Square and Festival Square on Tuesday 12 July.
Auchterlonie had pleaded guilty previously to assault and robbery.
Ms Thomson's mother could hear her calling out: "Mum, mum, I'm being mugged". Ms Thomson suffered facial injuries and her purse was stolen.
Sentence had been deferred at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for a background report and risk assessment.
Fiscal Depute, Gerard Drugan, told Sheriff Thomas Welsh, Ms Thomson was talking to her mother on her mobile phone as she walked from George Street to Rutland Square in the early evening.
"It was unusually quiet" said the fiscal. Ms Thomson had two bags over her shoulder.
She looked behind her and saw a man approaching her. He said: "Give me the bags", there was a struggle and he repeatedly hit her in the face and head.
Ms Thomson gave her purse to Auchterlonie to stop the attacks. He grabbed it and ran off.
The fiscal said the attack lasted only 80 seconds and all that time Ms Thomson's mobile was still active.
Ms Thomson, who was covered in blood, was treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
CCTV footage showed Auchterlonie hiding as his victim walked past, running after her, carrying out the attack and running away.
He also dropped his pen which provided DNA evidence.
Defence solicitor, Steve Donald, told Sheriff Welsh his client had no recollection of the incident.
He said Auchterlonie was currently subject to a supervised release order.
Sheriff Welsh said that in the recent past Auchterlonie had committed four offences of assault, robbery and assault to injury.
Det Con Alison Wyllie, of Police Scotland, said: "I am very grateful for the public response to the media appeal.
"As a result of this appeal we received information that ultimately led to his arrest and conviction."
