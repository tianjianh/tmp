[SN]TITLE[SN]
Essex enquire about Nottinghamshire's Alex Hales and Warwickshire's Varun Chopra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Division Two side Essex have requested to speak to Nottinghamshire's Alex Hales and Warwickshire batsman Varun Chopra, reports BBC Essex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England opener Hales, 27, and Chopra, 29, are both out of contract with their respective Division One clubs at the end of the county cricket season.
Hales is England's first-choice opener across all three formats after making his Test debut in December 2015.
Chopra has made 527 runs in eight County Championship matches this term.
He began his first-class career with Essex, leaving for Edgbaston in 2010.
A move for Hales would see him join the same county as his England Test opening partner and captain Alastair Cook.
