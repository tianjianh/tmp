[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guns Village school in West Bromwich to change its name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school called Guns Village, named after its historical links with the gun manufacturing trade, is to change its name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The primary school in West Bromwich dates back to 1878 and the name reflects the links of its former site to the manufacture of gun parts.
But a recent spike in gun crime across the Birmingham led governors to consider a name change.
It will be known as Hanbury Primary from September 2017.

Dawn Cooper, head teacher, said: Many visitors to the school from outside the area have expressed surprise at the school's name and frequently it is misspelt as 'Gunns' in correspondence due to the disbelief that a school carries the name 'Guns' within its title."
She claimed staff were hindered when using IT systems as use of the word "guns" would see them blocked by sites.
A petition against the change attracted several hundred signatures.
