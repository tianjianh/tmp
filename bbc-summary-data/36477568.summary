After newspapers carried a picture of England assistant manager Ray Lewington yesterday carrying a team sheet, Coleman did the same on Wednesday.
But closer inspection revealed his team was a spoof and included legends Pele, Maradona and Bobby Moore.
Wales play Slovakia on Saturday before facing England on 16 June.
