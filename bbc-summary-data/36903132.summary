It happened when their car was in collision with a van at about 04:45 BST on Wednesday on the N13 at Trimragh, just outside Letterkenny.
It is understood the car was being driven in the wrong direction.
The driver of the van, a 40-year-old man, is in a serious condition at University Hospital.
Insp Michael Harrison said he believes the two dead men are from the Letterkenny area.
"The collision occurred on the inbound lane and it was between a grey Mitsubishi Carisma hatchback and a yellow Renault master van.
"We're in the process of making identification and contacting the families. We believe they are from the Letterkenny area."
Insp Harrison told BBC Radio Foyle the driver of the van may have "life changing" injuries.
"His condition is serious but at the moment we have been told that his injuries are not life threatening but possibly life changing injuries.
"It's a tragic day, to lose two young men in one incident is very sad," he said.
The inbound stretch of the dual carriageway is closed to traffic and diversions are in place.
Police have said the road will remain closed until 18:00 BST.
