Ricky Burlton death: Europol issue appeal over A10 crash death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The European Union police agency Europol has issued an appeal to trace a man in connection with a fatal crash in Hertfordshire five years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Burlton, 20, from Enfield, London, died after he was hit by a car on the A10 exit slip road at Hoddesdon on 4 June 2010.
Officers want to question Alexi Shyti, who is thought to have been living under an assumed name at the time.
Europol said Mr Shyti may now be living in southern Europe.
Mr Shyti, believed to have been driving a Rover involved in the crash, fled the UK the next day.
A Europol spokesman said: "The suspect is believed to have been in Albania, and may have travelled to Greece and Italy under different names."
He said anyone with any information should call Hertfordshire Police.
