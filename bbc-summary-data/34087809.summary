The singer already has five number one singles to her name, including Rather Be with Clean Bandit and her Tinie Tempah collaboration Not Letting Go.
"It's the most insane feeling to have your whole album accepted by the British public," said Glynne.
Fight Song singer Rachel Platten said she was "excited and proud" to top the UK singles chart.
After a close race she sold almost 3,000 more copies than this week's number two, Felix Jaehn's Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better) ft Jasmine Thompson.
Fight Song has made the top 10 in the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Belgium so far.
"It's amazing to me that this song that I wrote when I was going through one of the hardest times in my life is also the thing that made my dreams come true," Platten told the Official Charts Company.
"I'm just kind of overwhelmed and really grateful."
Last week's number one single - Jess Glynne's Don't Be So Hard On Yourself - was at three.
Calvin Harris & Disciples' How Deep Is Your Love was number four, while also being the UK's most-streamed track for a third week running with 2.44m listens.
The Weeknd's Can't Feel My Face - this week's number six - also broke the two million streams barrier this week, with a total of 2.18m.
Also in the singles chart, Charlie Puth's Marvin Gaye ft Meghan Trainor was number five.
Last week's number one album, The Very Best of Cilla Black, slipped to number two, while Bon Jovi's 13th studio album Burning Bridges entered the chart at three.
Britain's Got Talent duo Bars & Melody's debut album 143 entered the chart at number four, while Dr Dre's Compton is number five.
Glynne's number one album sold just under 60,000 copies - giving her the second biggest opening of the year for a debut artist, behind James Bay's Chaos and the Calm, which sold 64,000.
"To see how well it's been received is possibly one of the most overwhelming feelings I've ever had," said Glynne.
"I'm so proud and excited about this album - I love every song on it. The fact that people are buying it and loving it as well is like some insane dream."
The Official Chart with Greg James is on BBC Radio 1 every Friday from 16:00 BST.
