Mainland Chinese shares were the lone winners in Asia on Monday as the rest of the region headed lower on lingering worries about weaker global growth.

The Shanghai Composite ended up 1.9% to 3,156.54 despite the US Federal Reserve's decision to hold off raising interest rates last week, in part due to a slowing Chinese economy.
Shares in small-cap companies rebounded strongly, making up for recent losses.
But Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.8% to 21,756.93 points.
"The real dovish tone of the [Fed's] statement, press conference and the Q&A has led to the conclusion that the Fed is becoming increasingly concerned about the global backdrop," said market strategist Evan Lucas.
Trading was also lighter than usual with the region's biggest market, Japan, closed until Wednesday for public holidays.
In the meantime, investors are looking ahead to flash manufacturing activity readings from China and the euro zone on Wednesday for an indication on where the global economy is heading.
In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed down 2% to 5,066.2 - leading the region's losses.
South Korea's Kospi finished down 1.6% to 1,964.68 after hitting a five and a half week high in the previous session.
The benchmark index also ended a four-day winning streak.
