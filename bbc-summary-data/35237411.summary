[SN]TITLE[SN]
Martin heads to Chester Zoo for the annual animal count

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keepers at Chester Zoo are making sure every creature, from the biggest elephant to the smallest beetle, is present and correct as part of their annual animal count.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of animals, many of them endangered, are part of the count which is required by law as part of the zoo's licence.
Important details about each and every individual are noted down so that the zoo can help worldwide breeding programmes.
Newsround's Martin headed to the zoo, which houses over 400 different species, to find out how it's done.
