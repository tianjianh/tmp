A woman has been awarded £75,000 after successfully representing herself in an equal pay dispute against Network Rail.

Tracey Myers, 50, from Warrington, took the company to an employment tribunal in Manchester on grounds of unfair dismissal, harassment and over equal pay.
She lost the first two claims but proved she was getting paid less than the men in her office.
Network Rail said it would ensure "lessons are learned" over equal pay.
A court ruled on Monday Ms Myers, who worked as a training assurance specialist, should be awarded £75,000 because she had a lower salary than her male colleagues.
She said she had been "aware" there was a difference in pay but did not know the extent of disparity until it was described in evidence at a hearing in May.
"That's when I was shocked at just how different some of the salaries were... I thought that's just unfair".
Ms Myers said that from the end of 2007 the salary difference between her and a male colleague was 37%.
This same colleague was still earning 15% more than Ms Myers when she was made redundant in 2014.
She added: "I'm not triumphant, I am pleased something came out of it - that's my living expenses. I'm so relieved it's over."
A Network Rail spokesperson added the company "aspires to be an inclusive and diverse organisation that works hard to ensure we embrace equality at every level".
Ms Myers started working as a contractor for the company in Liverpool in June 2006 and became a permanent employee in Stockport in March 2007.
She was made redundant as part of the company's restructure in 2013, but claimed she had been "better qualified and skilled" than colleagues who retained a job.
Ms Myers said she had also been subjected to "intolerable harassment" by two colleagues and was denied equal training opportunities.
The tribunal found in Network Rail's favour over both these claims.
