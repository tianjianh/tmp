The South African was injured during the Welsh region's 25-23 Pro12 defeat by Munster on 18 February.
Dirksen, 25, missed the start of the 2016-17 season as he recovered from surgery after a previous knee injury.
"At this early stage, the initial prognosis is a lay-off of around six months," said Ospreys medical manager Chris Towers.
