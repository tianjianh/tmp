Head coach Jason Strange says Wales Under-20 can take positives from the 34-22 defeat by England in World Rugby's Junior Championship.

Strange's side suffered a second defeat of the tournament as the holders proved too powerful in Tbilisi, Georgia.
"We've got to really focus on a lot of the positives the players produced," Strange said.
"At times they played some excellent attacking rugby and defended well for long periods."
Strange added: "There's a lot to take from that performance
"The main learning for us is to show a little more composure and maturity at certain parts of the game and the most critical moments if we are to go over the finishing line in these big games.
"It was a similar scenario to the Australia game, not making good decisions at critical times."
Having also lost to Australia, Wales will face Samoa in their final Pool A game with both teams aiming to avoid being bottom of the group.
