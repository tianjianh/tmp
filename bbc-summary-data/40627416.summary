The 23-year-old, a former US amateur champion, carded 65 and finished at 18-under-par to win his first PGA Tour tournament in just his 40th start.
Fellow American Patrick Rodgers, 25, who had led by two strokes after the third round, bogeyed the par-five 17th to finish on 17 under.
The Open will take place at Royal Birkdale from 20-23 July.
An emotional DeChambeau said: "I don't even know what it means right now, I've been working so hard in my whole life to do this.
"Finally it's happened, it's incredible."
