That was enough to leapfrog Alloa, who were beaten 3-1 away to Livingston.
Iain Russell scored a hat-trick of penalties as Airdrieonians thrashed Queen's Park 4-1.
And Albion Rovers' three-match winning run came to an end after they lost 1-0 at home to Peterhead, while Stranraer drew 1-1 with East Fife.
Stenhousemuir were reduced to 10 men in the first half when Willis Furtado was shown a straight red card for a foul on Euan Smith, but the division's bottom side still managed to take the lead through Mark Gilhaney's 56th-minute strike.
Brechin hit back with two goals in three minutes from Alistair Love and Paul McLean before Darren McCormack's late header made sure of the points.
At the Tony Macaroni Arena, Alloa fell behind to Michael Miller's 55th-minute goal.
That was added to by Liam Buchanan's brace before Greig Spence's stoppage-time consolation from the penalty spot.
At the Excelsior Stadium, the first of Russell's treble was cancelled out by a penalty from Ross Millen, but the Airdrie striker restored his side's lead before Scott Stewart added the game's only goal from open play in first-half stoppage time.
Russell completed his treble by beating William Muir from the spot for a third time before Kevin Schmidt's late dismissal meant the victors ended with 10-men.
Jordon Brown's 79th-minute strike earned Peterhead a 1-0 away win over Albion Rovers.
And Steven Bell's second-half header for Stranraer ruled out Ross Brown's opener as they drew 1-1 at East Fife.
