Centre-back Jerome Boateng gave the world champions an eighth-minute lead with a superb 25-yard volley before Mario Gomez poked in the second.
Julian Draxler, who provided a superb assist for the second, made it 3-0 with a near-post volley after the break.
Mesut Ozil also missed a penalty for Germany in the 14th minute.
Slovakia's best chance fell to Juraj Kucka, whose header was brilliantly tipped over by Manuel Neuer.
The last-eight tie between Joachim Low's side and one of the other fancied teams takes place in Bordeaux next Saturday.
Relive Germany v Slovakia as it happened
The three-time European champions have set a standard. Their performance in Lille was arguably the most dominant by a team at this championship.
After three average group displays, this was more trademark Low. The 56-year-old is a coach who does not believe in rigid roles, and against Slovakia the movement of his attack stretched the opposition defence.
Germany started in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Draxler on the left, Ozil in middle and Thomas Muller on the right of the attack, just behind striker Gomez.
But Draxler often interchanged with Ozil, and Muller spread himself about the Slovak half.
Jan Kozak's side spent the match chasing the Germans, and the game, after Bayern Munich's Boateng rifled in the first with a brilliant piece of opportunism.
They should have made it 2-0 but Ozil's tame spot-kick was easily saved by Matus Kozacik, after Gomez had been fouled by Martin Skrtel.
That miss did not knock the Germans off their stride, however, as the excellent Draxler teased Kucka down the left before finding Gomez, who scored his second of the tournament.
And despite playing at a lower tempo after the break, Germany still managed to score a third when Draxler placed a near-post volley high past Kozacik.
Although Draxler is only 22, he has been deemed as one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe since his 2011-12 breakthrough season at Schalke.
In an interview with the BBC in 2013, he spoke about improving his game without the ball, and now in 2016 the Wolfsburg player is almost the finished product.
His runs allowed Toni Kroos and Ozil to find space and influence the attack. And his final ball has also improved, as demonstrated when he set up Gomez for the second goal. The well-taken volley in the 63rd minute was deserved reward for an impressive performance.
Having played a peripheral role at the 2014 World Cup, he is now a major part of Low's side.
Draxler on his display: "I am happy that I put in a good performance today and that I was able to help the team.
"It is hard for me to say if this was my best or second-best game in a Germany shirt. Others can judge that better.
"We have a very capable side. So it's no problem if you are not playing in one game or the other. I tried not to let it get to me and to show in training that the coach could count on me.
"In the team talk the coach told me to look for one-on-ones. He has given me a lot of confidence and made it clear to me that I am a good player."
Slovakia goalkeeper Matus Kozacik: "We feel sorry because, from the beginning, the Germans dominated. We did not make them suffer at all. It is a pity.
"Perhaps after we defeated them in the [pre-Euros friendly], they prepared better. They played in a disciplined way and showed their greatness.
"If Kucka could have scored, we might have done something but their second goal was decisive.
"We have achieved a lot, I am very happy I could be here. After some time, we will appreciate it even more."
