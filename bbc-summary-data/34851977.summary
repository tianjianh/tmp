Lewis Dunne, 16, was found on a towpath near Burrows Court in Vauxhall, Liverpool, on Sunday evening and died later in hospital.
A post-mortem examination found he died from a single shotgun wound to the back, Merseyside Police said.
A family tribute said he was "the love of our life" and was "so kind and gentle..always giving hugs out."
"Most people wait years to find their soul mate but the day our Lewis was born was the day our hearts and souls were complete," it added.
The statement said Lewis "had values that weren't compromised by anything" and "he was deep and he was sensitive. He was not just academically smart, he was wise."
A murder investigation was launched on Monday and police divers trawled a nearby canal for evidence.
The teenager's family appealed for any witnesses to come forward, saying "our family is broken".
Detectives have retrieved CCTV footage of the surrounding area.
