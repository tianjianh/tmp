[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planned cuts to library services in a West Yorkshire town have been scrapped following campaigns by residents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kirklees Council had been consulting on plans to replace paid staff at seven sites in Huddersfield with volunteers.
Protesters who gathered outside a council meeting on Wednesday said a survey had showed 66% of people were opposed to the plan.
The council later said there would be no changes for three years. Campaigners said the decision was "wonderful".
The changes would have affected libraries at Honley, Golcar, Slaithwaite, Lepton, Kirkheaton, Denby Dale and Shepley.
Campaigner June Jones said replacing professional library staff with volunteers was not sustainable and was likely to have led to library closures.
Ms Jones, of Save Slaithwaite Library, said: "It's wonderful for our communities and we are going to be drinking champagne for the next week."
