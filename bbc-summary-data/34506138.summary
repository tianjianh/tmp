The woman accused of murdering teenager Becky Watts did not see her on the day she was killed, a court has heard.

Shauna Hoare said she heard Becky "stomping down the stairs" and the front door slam at her home in Crown Hill, St George, Bristol.
Ms Hoare, 21, said she and her boyfriend, Becky's stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, visited the house on 19 February - the day she disappeared.
Becky's body was later found cut into pieces. The pair deny murdering her.
Bristol Crown Court was played a police interview, recorded before Ms Hoare's arrest, in which she described arriving at Becky's house with Mr Matthews at about 11:00 GMT before letting themselves in.
The jury was told Ms Hoare heard music playing from Becky's upstairs bedroom, so assumed she was in, and then headed outside for a cigarette.
"I heard stomping down the stairs. That's what made me think Becky left in a mood," she said, before recalling the sound of the front door slamming.
"I assumed she was in one of her tantrums," she added.
The prosecution allege Becky was killed at the house that morning, some time before her stepmother Anjie Galsworthy arrived back from a hospital appointment.
Mr Matthews has admitted the manslaughter of his stepsister but insists his girlfriend had no part in it.
He has admitted storing body parts in a garden shed at a Bristol address.
The jury also heard from Benjamin Fairley, the manager of Donovan Demetrius who denies assisting an offender.
Mr Fairley told the court Mr Demetrius, 29, of Marsh Lane, Redfield, appeared "more tired than normal" at the Home Bargain Store in Brislington on 24 February.
The prosecution say Becky's body parts were moved in the early hours of 24 February from Ms Hoare and Mr Matthews' home to another address nearby, in Barton Court, where Donovan Demetrius was staying at the time.
Donovan Demetrius and another man, James Ireland, deny involvement.
Donovan's brother Karl and Karl's girlfriend Jaydene Parsons, who lived at Barton Court, have pleaded guilty to assisting an offender, but say they did not know what was in the bags stored in their shed.
The trial continues.
