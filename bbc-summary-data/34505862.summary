Ivan Toney has admitted he struggled with homesickness following his summer move from home-town club Northampton Town to Newcastle United.

The 19-year-old striker has appeared three times for Newcastle's first team.
"It was my first time away from home. My mum's not there to do everything for me, so I've got to be a big man for myself," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"The football's obviously a bit different tempo-wise but I've managed to adapt to it and I'm enjoying it."
He continued: "A little bit (of homesickness), missing my family a lot but other than that it's alright."
Toney came through the Cobblers' youth ranks and scored 13 goals in 60 senior games, and is also the youngest player to represent Northampton.
He was named the Under-21 Premier League's player of the month for September after two goals in three appearances for Newcastle legend Peter Beardsley's side.
He also appeared in the Premier League as a substitute in September's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, and says that he is working on physical strength to compete in the top flight.
"If you're not sharp, you're not involved," he said. "I wouldn't try to disrespect the League Two standard, but they are sharper (mentally) and know what they are doing a lot more.
"You're trying to get stronger every day, especially at that level you need to be strong and fit, and that's the main thing I'm working on."
