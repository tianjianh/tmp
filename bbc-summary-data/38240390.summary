[SN]TITLE[SN]
Michael Barrymore compensation claim to go to High Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Entertainer Michael Barrymore's arrest in connection with the death of a man at his house was "devastating" to his career, the High Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Barrymore, 64, sued Essex Police for damages to his reputation and career after he was detained for questioning about the death of Stuart Lubbock.
Mr Lubbock was found in the pool at Mr Barrymore's former home in 2001.
Mr Barrymore has asked the High Court for compensation. He will find out how much in the New Year.
Mr Barrymore, who in recent years has lived in New Zealand, was not charged with any offence as a result of the arrest, the court heard.
The entertainer, who has taken the legal action under his real surname Parker, did not appear at a preliminary hearing at the High Court where a trial was scheduled for next year.
Mr Barrymore's barrister Lorna Skinner told the court Essex Police was arguing he should receive "nominal" damages.
The court heard the "widespread publicity had a devastating effect on his career and hence his earnings".
In a written statement she said: "The claim arises out of the arrest and detention of the claimant... on suspicion of rape and murder on 14 June 2007.
"It has never been established that the deceased, Mr Stuart Lubbock, was either raped or murdered."
Miss Skinner said the judge would have to decide if there were "reasonable grounds" for the entertainer's arrest.
