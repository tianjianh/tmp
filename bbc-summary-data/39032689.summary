James Bisset, 23, of Yatton, struck the pedestrians with his Volvo in Nailsea near Bristol, last February.
Alex Gould, 18, later died in hospital and another man was seriously injured.
At a previous hearing at Bristol Crown Court, Bisset admitted causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and possessing a Class A drug.
He was jailed for seven years and four months.
The court heard he was driving along Clevedon Road in the early hours of 14 February 2016 when his car hit Mr Gould and another man before striking a man and a woman and smashing into a telegraph pole.
Bisset was also disqualified from driving for seven years and ordered to take an extended re-test.
Speaking after the crash, Mr Gould's family said he had been "the perfect son, brother, nephew, grandson and cousin".
Sgt Peter Truch, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "This incident has had a huge impact on all those involved and the wider community in Nailsea."
