Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray needed stitches after Brown attempted to kick the ball from his grasp.
The decision not to cite Brown means he can play against Wales in a crucial match on 12 March.
"I am surprised that he hasn't been cited but in reality he's got away with it," said Probyn, who made 37 appearances for England.
Referee Romaine Poite took no action after a review during the game, and the citing commissioner agreed none was merited as the contact with Murray's head was accidental.
"He's a good player and England would have missed him had he been banned from the game," added Probyn.
"I was at Twickenham and the big screen showed it over again and everyone was a little bit puzzled why Danny Care, not Brown, got yellow carded."
England top the table after wins over Scotland, Italy and Ireland - one point ahead of Wales who have beaten Scotland and France but drew with Ireland in Dublin.
Probyn believes the current team and new coach Eddie Jones still have room for improvement in their bid for a first Grand Slam since 2003.
"Against Ireland England improved on what they have done before, but they have still got a long way to go," said Probyn, a Grand Slam winner in 1991 and 1992.
"We're seeing the benefits of a squad that has been together for a while with a little bit of Australian flair being thrown into the mix.
"It's working well, but it's still not quite there yet and that is what the worry is against a fairly established Welsh side.
"Wales are putting pressure on sides and they are putting the scores up.
"I think Jonathan Davies coming back into the mix has strengthened them. His return means a little bit more flair.
"Wales have a good front row, a solid scrum and big, fast players out wide.
"The good news for England is it's Twickenham and I know we lost there in there World Cup, but I don't think we'll make that mistake again."
Wales are chasing back-to-back victories at Twickenham for the first time since 1978.
