Northampton Town set a club record of nine successive league wins with a narrow victory over Wycombe Wanderers.

Despite Northampton's first-half dominance, Jason McCarthy's drilled shot could have put Wycombe in front.
But the Cobblers went ahead on 63 minutes when Ricky Holmes set up Danny Rose to rifle in his first goal for the club from 12 yards out.
Substitute Ryan Sellers almost rescued a late point, but he was unable to convert Sido Jombati's cross.
The result saw the Cobblers surpass the previous record of eight victories, set in their Division Four-winning season in 1960-61.
It also extended their lead at the top of League Two to 10 points, with closest rivals Plymouth Argyle held 1-1 by Crawley Town.
Wycombe Manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"Anyone who's here knows it was on a knife edge. Great bit of play for their goal, which is disappointing for me because we worked on that in the week.
"Ricky Holmes is a match winner and he's produced a bit of skill and a great finish.
"We'll take it. We had chances, I'll never ever be able to say that none of my players didn't give absolutely everything and that's great for me as a manager. You can't say they didn't fancy it today or anything.
"Just been reminded that three years ago we were bottom of the league here when we lost. From those days to these days is just a huge, huge change so thank you to everyone involved with that."
