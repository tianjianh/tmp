[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 3-2 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Hopper came off the bench to fire Scunthorpe back to the top of the League One table with a 71st-minute winner in their 3-2 victory at home to Port Vale.

But they did it the hard way, twice having to come from behind after the visitors had impressed in the early stages.
Beaten only once in their previous four games, Port Vale looked well organised and enjoyed some good first-half possession.
They came close to snatching a 26th-minute lead when striker JJ Hooper rifled a 25-yard effort just inches over.
Hooper was involved again when Vale did open the scoring in the 38th minute.
His low angled shot from the right was well pushed away by home keeper Luke Daniels, but straight into the path of Tyler Walker who produced a clinical finish.
Scunthorpe, with their new-look strike force of Craig Davies and Ivan Toney both making their full debuts, looked out of sorts.
But they came storming out in the second half and were back on level terms in the 49th minute when Josh Morris crashed home his 19th goal of the season from the penalty spot after a needless foul in the box on Davies by centre-back Remie Streete.
But Vale stood firm and were back in front in the 59th minute when slack marking in the Scunthorpe defence allowed Hooper to find room in the box to steer home his shot from a low right-wing cross.
Three minutes later and Scunthorpe were back level again when a flick-on from Davies saw Toney net a debut goal with a measured lob from the edge of the box beyond the outstretched reach of keeper Jak Alnwick.
And they edged in front for the first time in the 71st minute when substitute Hopper raced in at the edge of the six-yard box to crack home a glorious low left-wing cross from full-back Harry Toffolo for what proved to be the winner.
