On Monday he said Muslim people should be banned from entering the US.
But in response to Trump's comments, Hopkins wrote in her newspaper column that he should not be demonised.
So does she simply speak her mind or is she an attention seeker? Here are five things about Katie Hopkins.
Katie Hopkins first came under the public gaze when she was a contestant on the BBC TV series The Apprentice in 2007.
She quit the show despite being offered a place in the final as she could not commit to a possible move to London.
In 2013 she caused upset when she said she would not let her children play with lower class children with names like Chardonnay and Tyler.
She made the remarks during an appearance on ITV's This Morning programme.
She admitted that she judges children by their names.
But when she said she did not like children with geographical location names, it was pointed out that one of her children was called India.
In a 2014 TV documentary, Katie raised more eyebrows when she said fat people were lazy. She added that she would not employ fat people because they look lazy.
She illustrated her point by managing to gain and lose three stone in weight.
Before the UK general election in 2015, she tweeted she will leave the country if the Labour Party were elected to power.
In November, students from Brunel University walked out of a debate where Katie was invited as a guest.
Objections were raised to her attendance while during the debate about the future of welfare, students turned their backs to her and later walked out.
