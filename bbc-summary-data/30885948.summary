Mary Earps: Bristol Academy keeper among four to re-sign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Mary Earps has become one of four first-team players to commit to Bristol Academy for 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earps, 21, became the first signing for Vixens manager Dave Edmondson in March and made 19 appearances in all competitions last season.
Jasmine Matthews, 21, has also agreed a new deal with the Women's Super League side, along with fellow defenders Loren Dykes, 26, and Frankie Brown, 27.
Grace McCatty and Sophie Ingles have already secured new contracts.
But Edmondson may still look for further additions following the departures of Corrine Yorston, Jemma Rose, Alex Windell, Laura Del Rio, Natalia and Natasha Harding.
