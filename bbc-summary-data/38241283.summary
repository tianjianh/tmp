West Ham boss Slaven Bilic expects his side to finish in the top half of the Premier League, despite sitting one place above the relegation zone.

The Hammers are winless in their past five league games and are just a point away from the bottom three.
Speaking to BBC Sport's Gary Lineker before Saturday's 5-1 loss to Arsenal, Bilic, 48, said he was "confident" that his side will finish "minimum top 10".
"We are not happy with the position we are in at the moment," he added.
The interview features on The Premier League Show at 22:00 GMT on Thursday on BBC Two.
West Ham, who relocated to the former Olympic Stadium over the summer, finished seventh last term but have won just two home games in the league this season.
Bilic, who received the backing of club owner David Sullivan at the weekend, accepts that there is pressure to improve results.
"We are in a position we are not happy with and where we have to bite our nails," said the Croat.
"We are not directly talking about relegation but straight after your game you have to look at the results here and the results there. It's not ideal.
"I feel the support of the fans, the team and the board. My next few games are my test."
