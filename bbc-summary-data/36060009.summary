Welsh election: Carwyn Jones defends Labour record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carwyn Jones has defended the Welsh Labour Government's record on health and education, blaming Westminster budget cuts for some of their problems.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health spending was higher than ever before, and most people got a good service, he told the audience of a live BBC TV special in Llangollen.
When problems arose, he said ministers took action, such as putting the local health board into special measures.
He said more schools were being built and students got more support in Wales.
Taking questions on BBC Wales TV's Ask the Leader programme, Mr Jones said: "Our budget was cut 10% from a Conservative government.
"Despite that, we are spending more on health than ever before."
The proportion of the Welsh Government budget spent on health has risen from 42% to 46%, he said.
"We know that in the health service most people get a good service most of the time," he added.
"Sometimes it doesn't happen that way. We've seen it in Tawel Fan [care concerns on a mental health ward]. We've seen it in other parts of Wales.
"As soon as we know there's a problem, we take action."
Mr Jones faced interruptions from the audience over the Betsi Cadwaladr health board being into special measures - the highest possible level of Welsh Government intervention.
"That's action, that's the point," he replied.
On education, Mr Jones said: "We will never, ever let our young people down," saying more was spent per head on education in Wales than in England.
"We will never be in a position where Welsh students are in the same difficult position as English students," he added, referring to the policy of subsidising tuition fees for students from Wales.
The Welsh Labour leader faced questions from one audience member who said testing was an "interruption" to real progress in children.
"I'm a parent. I want to know how my kids are doing. I want testing," Mr Jones replied.
"I want to know how my child is doing at seven. I want to know how my child is doing at 14."
