Fans queued overnight for a chance to get on-the-day tickets for the sold-out production at the Barbican Centre.
Although the official press night is not until 25 August, some early reviews of the performance emerged on Thursday.
Writing in the Daily Mail, Jan Moir called Cumberbatch "electrifying" and "completely amazing" and gave the production five stars.
"By the time he took his bows... drenched in sweat, the audience were on their feet, clamouring for more," she wrote.
But The Times' Kate Maltby was less impressed, writing: "Cumberbatch has all the energy Hamlet requires, sweating around the Barbican stage like an oleaginous electric eel, but there's little subtlety in this performance."
"This is Hamlet for kids raised on Moulin Rouge," her two-star write-up continued.
"It's a wasted opportunity: Pure theatrical self-indulgence."
The appearance of reviews based on the production's first preview performance provoked dissent on Twitter.
Times columnist David Aaronovitch suggested his colleague Kate Maltby had shown courage in writing a negative appraisal of such a keenly anticipated production.
But actor Kerry Shale called her actions "unprofessional", while comedian David Baddiel said it set "a frightening precedent".
In a statement, the show's producers said: "No critics were granted access to the first preview of Hamlet. Our opening night remains 25 August 2015.
"Official photography from the production is due to be released early next week and therefore any current photography from the production is unauthorised."
Three years ago, Cumberbatch told the Daily Telegraph that the role of Hamlet was one he had "been interested in for a long time."
"I don't know if there is such a thing as a right age to play the part, but 36 or 37 seems appropriate to me, so I need to do it before long," he said.
The production is directed by Lyndsey Turner (Posh, Chimerica) and produced by Sonia Friedman Productions.
Friedman said she was "thrilled" to be producing the show, describing its star as "one of the most gifted and exciting actors of his generation".
The 39-year-old was last seen on stage in 2011, in the National Theatre's production of Frankenstein, directed by Danny Boyle.
He won an Olivier Award for his performance.
Cumberbatch earned an Oscar nomination for his performance as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game.
