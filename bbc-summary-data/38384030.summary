The former Derry City player joined the Bannsiders in January but has endured a frustrating time with injuries in recent times.
The 32-year-old is planning to take a couple of weeks before deciding on his future.
"From the fans to the players, Oran (Kearney, manager), the coaching staff and the board, I can't speak highly enough about the club," said Higgins.
Boss Kearney thanked Higgins for his contribution during his time at the club.
"I'd like to thank Ruaidhri for all he did here at Coleraine and wish him well for the future in whatever he decides to do," he said.
