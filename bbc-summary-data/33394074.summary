Police are hunting for two men who have absconded from an open prison in Sussex.

Lee Fudge, 29, and Mark Chatfield, 39, were last seen at Ford Prison - which is a category D jail - on Thursday.
Fudge was jailed for life in 2007 for the robbery of a BP garage in Kent. Chatfield was jailed for four years for burglary in August 2014 after he broke into a home in Guildford.
Police say anyone who spots the men should not approach them but call 999.
Det Insp Dave Grover said "We need the public's help to find both men so they can be returned to custody to serve the remainder of their sentences.
"Neither man was from Sussex but we do not know if they have left the county to go back to where they are from, or if they are still here."
Police have said the photograph of Fudge is the best they have available.
