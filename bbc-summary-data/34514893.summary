Andrew Batten, 42, died after being punched by a man at a taxi rank in Vicar Lane, Leeds, on 13 October 1995.
Detectives have now released several images of people they want to talk to in connection with the investigation.
Det Ch Insp Jim Dunkerley said: "We believe that the answer of who was responsible probably still lies locally."
Vanessa Batten, Mr Batten's sister, said: "There is someone out there that can bring closure to the surviving members of this family.
"The people involved that night have enjoyed 20 years of life that Andrew was denied."
The "aching of his loss still cripples me", she said.
Mr Batten, who lived in Beeston, had gone out after finishing work and was still wearing his Royal Mail uniform, police said.
He was found on the pavement by an ambulance crew after an anonymous call and was taken to Leeds General Infirmary with a fractured skull. He died two days later.
He was believed to have been punched by a man, who was with a woman, in the taxi queue at the rear of the Victoria Quarter, said police.
The CCTV images are from Albion Street and Briggate
The force urged anyone with information to come forward.
