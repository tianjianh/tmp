[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 1-0 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Lenell John-Lewis scored a 92nd-minute winner as Shrewsbury Town began their League One campaign with victory over Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Experienced striker John-Lewis, one of Shrewsbury manager Paul Hurst's 11 summer signings, converted Alex Rodman's low cross from the left to wrap up three points with time running out.
Shrewsbury enjoyed more of the possession in a goalless first half but the best chance fell Northampton's way in the 17th minute when Dean Bowditch's effort was cleared off the line by Toto Nsiala.
Big defender Nsiala then had a shot blocked at the other end before heading a Shaun Whalley cross wide.
Rodman was next to threaten for Shrewsbury when he cut inside and fired wide of the near post from 20 yards.
Junior Brown headed off target for the hosts early in the second half while Northampton found chances hard to come by with little to concern Shrewsbury keeper Dean Henderson.
Just as deadlock looked likely, Shrewsbury were rewarded with time almost up when Jon Nolan, classy in midfield, set up Rodman to cross for John-Lewis to fire home from 12 yards to seal the club's first opening day win since 2010.
