Michael Forbes' art portrays the US President-elect and also Madonna, who is shown as the Statue of Liberty.
Black Isle-based Forbes created the piece this week.
Madonna, who opposed Trump's election campaign, has posted an image of the painting on her Facebook and Instagram pages.
Her post to Facebook has had more than 57,000 "likes" and her Instagram post more than 40,000.
Pop surrealist artist Forbes is part of the Tripping Up Trump movement which protested against the building of Trump's golf resort at the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire.
The artist painted a mural on a barn of a farmer, also called Michael Forbes, who refused to sell land to Trump for the golf course.
Artist Forbes has a gallery in New York and his work in Scotland includes posters for the Highlands' Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, created his painting of Trump this week.
Among the latest Trump piece's references are the US election's popular vote won by Hillary Clinton. She lost the election due to the electoral college system.
American comic book superhero and pop culture icon, Superman, also appears in Forbes' piece.
Madonna features because of her views on Trump and also Forbes' admiration of her activities in the gay community in the US.
The artist, who in his youth worked as an assistant to British Pop artist Gerald Laing, has been amused and pleased with the reaction to his Trump painting.
He said: "After Madonna posted it on Instagram my phone has been ringing repeatedly with people telling me about it."
President-elect Trump takes the oath of office on Friday with an estimated 900,000 people expected to gather in Washington for the induction and related activities.
