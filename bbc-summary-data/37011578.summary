The exhibition will feature material from JK Rowling's archives, a range of wizarding books and information about the origin of the philosopher's stone.
It will run from 20 October 2017 until 28 February 2018.
"We are thrilled to be working with JK Rowling and Bloomsbury," said curator Jamie Andrews.
He added that the aim was "to inspire fans with the magic of our own British Library collections".
"We're (the British Library) absolutely the right place to be doing this exhibition... we're the home of stories, we're next door to King's Cross - platform 9 and three quarters - and we have one of the greatest collections on the history of magic," Andrews, who is the library's head of culture and learning, told the BBC.
"That feels like a pretty unbeatable combination."
Tickets for the exhibition can be bought from spring 2017.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first book in Rowling's hugely successful series, was first published in 1997.
Six other Potter novels were subsequently written and the series spawned a hit film franchise.
The play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, is currently running in the West End in London.
The script, published last month, has become the fastest-selling book in the UK this decade, selling more than 680,000 copies in its first three days alone.
