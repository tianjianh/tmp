Leanne Wood: Dog mess trumps Brexit in local elections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters are more likely to want to talk about cleaning up dog mess than Brexit before May's local elections, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said.

Before Plaid's spring conference, she said "two-way conversations" between grassroots activists and local people were crucial to success at the polls.
Ms Wood said she did not see her push for a soft Brexit harming party chances in areas that voted to leave the EU.
The two-day conference begins in Newport later on Friday.
Ms Wood won Rhondda from Labour at the May 2016 assembly election, a constituency which voted Leave in the EU referendum the following month.
She will use the conference to accuse Labour Welsh Government ministers of concentrating on the economy in Cardiff at the expense of the rest of the Wales.
Plaid Cymru is on a "mission to rebalance Wales", she will say in a speech later.
Speaking to BBC Wales at her office in Cardiff Bay, she said: "Most people on the doorstep, they are not talking about Brexit, they are not talking about what goes on here, or really what goes on in Westminster.
"It comes up a bit, but you can have conversations with people that go to the local issues - and people then might disagree with me on something I've said on Brexit, but then they will still say 'I'll vote Plaid because you've done this locally for us'.
"So, if it comes up it's not stopping people - even if they are against what I've said - stopping them from voting Plaid.
"I'm not concerned that's going to be a major issue in the elections or any other of the big things we are all concerned about.
"Most people talk about dog poo."
Her party struck a deal with Labour in the assembly, rather than go into coalition.
That allowed Carwyn Jones to return as first minister, in exchange for including Plaid in preparing policies and budgets.
But Ms Wood said where Plaid has a strong grassroots campaign they hoped to pick up votes from Labour.
In her speech, Ms Wood will accuse Labour of repeating the mistakes of UK ministers by concentrating on the capital city and neglecting the rest of the county.
She will say: "Plaid Cymru would ensure every part of Wales gets the chance to succeed.
"Existing plans lack the ambition needed to rebalance the country."
