Anni Dewani: Coroner rules out full UK inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has ruled he "does not have sufficient cause" to open a full inquest into the death of Anni Dewani, who was killed on honeymoon in South Africa in 2010.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A murder case against her husband Shrien Dewani, from Bristol, was thrown out by a South African judge last year.
Three South African men were given jail terms for their role in her death.
Mrs Dewani's family had asked for an inquest to resume, claiming there were still unanswered questions.
But senior coroner Andrew Walker, at North London Coroners' Court, said he did not have sufficient cause to resume an inquest.
"In these proceedings, the matter will now rest," he said.
"The fact that there are differing accounts of how Mrs Dewani came by her death does not, in my view, mean that the matters have not already been sufficiently established in public proceedings."
He said he was "prohibited" from reaching a conclusion which was inconsistent with the findings of the South African courts, and added if new evidence came to light it would be up to Mrs Dewani's family to ask the Attorney General to reopen the matter.
Shrien Dewani, 34, did not appear at the court. Instead he sent a letter to the court for Mrs Dewani's family to read.
Timeline
Speaking outside the court, Mrs Dewani's uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said the family still needed questions answering to allow them "to move on with their lives".
"This battle is not over. We need answers," he said.
Mr Hindocha also called for Mr Dewani to "speak up".
"This is not a legal court, he should have just come here and said 'Look, this is what happened'," he added.
Anni Dewani, 28, was shot dead after the newly-married couple were hijacked during a late-night tour through Gugulethu township near Cape Town in November 2010.
Mr Dewani was released unharmed, but Mrs Dewani's body was found on the back seat of their taxi the following day.
