He played a leading role in the winning bid and carried the Olympic flame by speedboat to Friday's opening ceremony.
"The excitement building throughout the city is incredible," said Beckham, 37.
"To have an Olympic Games in London is amazing but to have it in an area where I grew up, I'm very proud to have been part of that for the last eight years."

Beckham, England's most-capped outfield player with 115 appearances, added: "I think we are all ready now."
His hopes of competing at the Games were ended when Stuart Pearce did not select him for Great Britain's football team, although he insists the pain of his omission will not stop him enjoying the Olympics.
"I made it very clear that I'm very disappointed and people around me like my family and friends know how hard it was not being involved," he explained.
"But I've always been a fan of the Olympics and I always said before it was announced that if I wasn't in the team that I would be here as a fan, I would be here to watch the rest of the athletes perform and that's where I'll be."
GB drew their opening game of the Olympics 1-1 with Senegal and will face UAE in their next game on Sunday.
"I haven't spoken to anyone [after the game on Thursday]," Beckham said.
"It's just one of those things where they have got a big game on Sunday and I'm sure the players will be ready but there are quite a few things happening before that."
Former England captain Beckham will return to play for his club side LA Galaxy during the Olympics but will be back in England before London 2012 is over.
He added: "Our season continues throughout the Games and the summer.
"I go back next week and then come back just before the closing ceremony. Hopefully, I am going to be able to get to as many events as possible."
