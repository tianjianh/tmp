Dundee council mulls compulsory purchase of fire-hit house

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee City Council is considering enforcing a compulsory purchase order on a fire-damaged property near the city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The listed building on Roseangle has been empty since a fire in 1998. The council had previously imposed a repair notice as it is in a conservation area.
However, the authority said no work had been done at the 1830s building since.
Councillors on the city development committee will be asked to approve the purchase order on Monday.
Committee convener Will Dawson said: "This is another significant step in a long process, during which we believe we have given the owner of this property every chance to carry out the repairs needed.
"It is category C listed after Historic Scotland recognised its significance in 1989, and is in the heart of the West End Lands Conservation area.
"The prominent location and significant deterioration of the building over the past few years have raised concerns not just with council officers but also among local people unhappy at the way it has been left.
"That situation is not sustainable so we are looking to take the building and its future under council control."
