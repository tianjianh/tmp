Robertson knocked in breaks of 60 and 86 to go 2-0 up and led 55-0 in the next only for 11th seed Allen to make a 63 clearance to reduce his arrears.
The Sussex man won the fourth frame but Allen hit back with a 105 to trail 3-2.
A break of 78 gave Robertson frame six, but Allen took the next two, before winning the last with a century break.
Robertson, who has lost in the first round on his two previous appearances at the Crucible Theatre, compiled a 61 in winning frame four.
The seventh was a scrappy affair but Northern Irishman Allen cleared from yellow to pink to level at 4-4.
An even 100 in the ninth saw the Antrim man enjoy a narrow advantage going into Monday evening's second session.
