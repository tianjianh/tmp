Q&A: Birmingham bombings inquests reopen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has reopened the inquests into the deaths 21 people killed in the Birmingham pub bombings more than 40 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Many of the families regard the inquests as their last chance to find out exactly what happened on the night of 21 November, 1974.
Six men were convicted and then acquitted of the atrocity and no-one has since been convicted of involvement in the bombing, which is widely attributed to the IRA.
The role of a coroner is to determine who the deceased was and how, when and where they died. If they feel they need further investigation, an inquest is held.
Inquests were therefore opened into the 21 victims but adjourned to allow for a criminal investigation. Because that investigation resulted in a conviction, it was concluded the questions about the deaths had been answered by the trial.
However, when the convictions of the Birmingham Six were quashed in 1991, the inquests remained closed.
Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the attacks, said: "The lives of 20 families changed on that night and they have never been told the truth about what happened.
"There are many more - the casualties and those who came to their aid on the night - whose lives were changed forever, too".
The move to reopen the inquests follows a campaign by the Justice 4 the 21 campaign group, led by family members of victims of the bombings.
They met Home Secretary Theresa May and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers in March 2015 to lobby for an inquest. An application for a fresh inquest was also lodged with the attorney general.
Relatives of Maxine Hambleton, Trevor Thrupp and James Craig made an application to Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, for the hearings to resume.
Human rights lawyer Kevin Winters, who has represented families of victims of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, said he believed there was a basis for an inquest, which would provide families with access to certain "disclosure materials" he claimed had been kept from them.
This could be the last chance, in their lifetimes, for campaigners to have evidence heard in public which was not available in 1974.
They hope Ms Hunt will call key witnesses, who the families believe can identify the bombers.
Ms Hambleton said: "All we want is one thing - justice. No more, no less. We don't want money, we don't want an apology. All we want is justice."
On the evening of 21 November 1974, hundreds of people, many who were young and out with friends, family and work colleagues, were inside two busy Birmingham city centre pubs.
Meanwhile, a man telephoned the Birmingham Post and Mail newspaper to warn two bombs had been planted in the city centre. Officers in Birmingham, which had seen a spate of IRA bombings during the mainland campaign, rushed to the scene, but were too late.
At 20:17 GMT a bomb exploded in a duffel bag in the Mulberry Bush pub at the base of the city's iconic Rotunda building, killing 10 people. Ten minutes later, a second bomb went off in the Tavern in the Town, leaving 11 more dead.
A total of 182 people were also injured in what was, at the time, the worst terrorist atrocity on English soil.
The 21 people killed - seven women and 14 men - were aged between 17 and 51. Thirteen of the victims were under 30, including five in their teens.
Over the decades, stories have emerged of those who died and some of the people seriously injured have spoken of their experience and the lasting affect it had on them.
Ms Hambleton, who has led calls for a public inquiry into the attacks, recalled how her "world fell apart" aged 11 when her 18-year-old sister Maxine - who she described as being "like another mother" - was killed while handing out party invitations in a pub.
Six men were wrongly convicted of the two pub bombings but were finally released in 1991. During the near 17 years they spent behind bars the case of "The Birmingham Six" became known as one of the worst miscarriages of justice seen in the UK.
The IRA is believed to have carried out the bombings, although no-one has ever admitted responsibility.
However, no-one has ever been brought to justice for the 21 murders.
West Midlands Police began re-investigating the case in 1991 and officers generated 5,000 documents, statements and reports. But in 1994, the force said there was insufficient evidence for any prosecutions.
