Juventus face Real Madrid in Saturday's sell-out game at Cardiff's renamed National Stadium of Wales.
Grange Gardens in Grangetown was chosen for the pitch by UEFA, Cardiff council and the Football Association of Wales.
Wales legend Ian Rush praised the facility, saying it would help get more kids into football.
The 2017 UEFA Champions League final ambassador said it was important to have facilities in the inner city to give young people the "best chance possible".
He added: "Somewhere like this you go in with a positive, but where you've got muddy pitches and all that, you go in with a negative."
Rush said the next big football superstar could come from the area, adding: "We all came from places like this but unfortunately we didn't have these facilities."
