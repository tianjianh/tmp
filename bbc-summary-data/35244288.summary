Sports car maker McLaren Automotive has announced it will create 250 new jobs following a "record year".

The supercar manufacturer said it had delivered 1,653 of its cars to 30 different countries in 2015.
A second shift has been created in its Woking factory to cope with demand for its cars, some of which retail for £900,000.
Business Secretary Sajid Javid MP said the announcement showed Britain's auto industry was "thriving".
The new roles will be created in the Surrey company's production, quality and logistics departments.
The company currently employs about 1,500 people, with 500 working in production - where the majority of the new jobs will be created.
McLaren said the second shift is scheduled to start in February and will take production rates from 14 to 20 cars per day.
Chief Executive Mike Flewitt said the increase in sales was partly driven by the introduction of the firm's cheapest model the "Sports Series", which costs from £150,000.
The other two models of car they produce are the more expensive "Super Series" and "Ultimate Series".
He said: "The levels of customer orders tells us that now is the time to invest in the second shift and 250 new production team members to ensure that we are able to reach our assembly objectives once the full model range is available."
Mr Javid, who was due to visit the plant on Thursday, said: "I was particularly impressed to hear that over half of all the components and parts that go into their cars are manufactured here in the UK, and this is creating countless more jobs in the supply chain."
In June 2015 the company announced its annual turnover was £475.5m.
