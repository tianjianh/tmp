[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 1-1 Queens Park Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sebastian Polter scored QPR's first goal from open play in the Championship this season to earn a draw at Burton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a tame first half, Jon McLaughlin thwarted Rangers pair Pawel Wszolek and Tjaronn Chery, while Jamie Ward's free-kick was tipped wide for the hosts.
Ward put the Brewers ahead, stooping to head his first goal for the club after Lloyd Dyer's deflected shot.
But just after coming on, Polter poked home Massimo Luongo's cross on Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's return to Burton.
Both sides remain in the bottom half of the table and are on five-game winless runs in the league.
In the first ever league meeting between the sides, Dyer had the best chance to claim all three points, blasting over from 20 yards after a Lucas Akins cutback.
Polter, who had been an injury doubt, headed just wide for QPR late on as Hasselbaink's side chased victory in his first match at the Pirelli Stadium since leaving Burton in December 2015.
