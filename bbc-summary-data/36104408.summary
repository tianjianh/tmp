Non Stanford and Vicky Holland had already qualified for Rio and Stanford's Welsh team-mate Jenkins is expected to complete the women's squad.
They were competing for a last spot but Stimpson admits she has not made it.
"I would like to personally congratulate both Helen and her coach Marc on selection," said Stimpson.
"And wish them both a successful training block until the Games."
British triathlon are expected to confirm Jenkins as their nomination for to compete for Team GB at Rio in August.

Jenkins, who won world triathlon titles in 2008 and 2011, helped her Olympic selection push by winning the Gold Coast World Series event in Australia earlier this month when Stimpson finished 12th.
Rio 2016 is to be Jenkins' second Olympic Games following a fifth placed finish at London 2012 while double Commonwealth champion Stimpson was hoping for an Olympic debut in Brazil.
But the 27-year-old conceded in a blog on her personal website: "'We regret to inform you that you have not been selected to represent Team GBR in the Rio Olympic Games'.
"This was the hardest email I have ever had to read in my triathlon career so far. Not because it wasn't what I was expecting - I knew after my performance on the Gold Coast that I wouldn't be going to the Games but it is hard to read, and hard to digest."
Stimpson will compete alongside 2013 world champion Stanford in the latest ITU World Triathlon Series event in Cape Town on Sunday while Jenkins will sit it out as the 32-year-old continues her Olympic preparation.
"The Gold Coast race itself, I went in ranked number one based on the Abu Dhabi result," continued Stimpson.
"I felt fine before the race, yes swimming was a doubt of how I would fair, but this is mainly because my team mates are so good in the pool. I was hoping for the best, dived in and felt flat.
"Helen had the most amazing race, she raced tactically, and won in style. What a great way to gain an Olympic spot.
"Team GBR are sending three amazingly strong women to Rio, Non, Helen and Vicky all deserve to be on that start line.
"I am privileged to be in such a successful GBR women's sport and I am sure that our ladies will deliver the goods in August. I wish them all the very best of luck."
