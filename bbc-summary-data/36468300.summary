Staff shortages close Montrose maternity unit for births

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff shortages have forced the closure of Montrose's community maternity unit for births for a three-month period.

The closure has now taken effect but the unit will remain open as usual from Monday to Friday for antenatal and postnatal care.
NHS Tayside said the unit, which supports about 12 births a month, will resume births in September.
Justine Craig, head of midwifery for NHS Tayside, said the move had been a "difficult decision."
She said: "We know that this may be upsetting for some women who had planned to give birth at Montrose, however, we must provide a maternity service with appropriately-skilled staff which is safe for women and staff."
She added: "Our Montrose maternity team and other support staff will be working out of the community maternity unit at Arbroath Infirmary, alongside the Arbroath maternity team, and this will ensure continuity of care."
Ms Craig said that a "full range of options" of places of birth were available to women, including Arbroath community midwifery unit, Dundee midwifery unit, home birth or the unit in Ninewells Hospital.
She said: "Women who were due to give birth at Montrose are being contacted and advised about the new arrangements and will be able to discuss birth options with an Angus community midwife, where further information will be provided and any concerns discussed."
