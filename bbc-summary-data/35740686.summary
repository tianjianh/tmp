Bangladesh posted 120-5 in a rain-hit game that was reduced from 20 to 15 overs after a two-hour delay.
India won with seven balls to spare, reaching 122-2 to win the competition for the sixth time.
Dhawan and Virat Kohli combined for a 94-run partnership for the second wicket after India were reduced to 5-1.
Kohli remained 41 not out, while captain MS Dhoni smashed a towering six to clinch the game in style and finish 20 not out.
Earlier, Mahmudullah had offered Bangladesh some hope with a blistering 33 not out off just 18 balls.
