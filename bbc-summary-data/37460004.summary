[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot extended their unbeaten run to eight matches as they claimed a narrow victory over York at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side came close with the first real chance of the game early on as Jake Gallagher forced Kyle Letheren into a smart save from just inside the 18-yard box.
The Shots took the lead on the half-hour mark as Bernard Mensah beat the offside trap before firing past Letheren and into the back of the net from 10 yards out.
On the back of a four-match winless run, hosts York tried to come back into the game with Jack Higgins firing Aidan Connolly's corner over the crossbar, while Scott Fenwick had a goal ruled offside five minutes after the break.
But despite all the home side's efforts, Aldershot held on to take maximum points home.
