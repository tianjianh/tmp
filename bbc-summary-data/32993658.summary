This year's Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival may have been the most successful to date, organisers claim.

Now in its 36th year, it showcased a diverse range of theatre, music and performance art at venues across the region last month.
Many were sell-outs and early indications show a 45% rise in ticket sales on last year's event.
Programme director Peter Renwick said: "The feedback from this year's festival has been absolutely brilliant.
"We had some huge audiences for the Scottish Ensemble, Macmath - Silent Page, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and Dogstar Theatre, right across the region."
A total of 82 acts performed at 42 venues across the south-west over 10 days at the end of May.
Folk singer Bella Hardy, Scotland's Makar Liz Lochhead and comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli also put on shows during the festival.
The festival also supported local performers and venue managers to put on their own productions, resulting in events such as the Poetry in the Countryside event at Crichton Farm.
Mr Renwick added: "At present, it's clear that this year's festival has grown significantly and has also attracted new audiences. We are so pleased with the support of what was a very diverse programme."
Festival chairman Ken Gouge said it had been an "outstanding success".
He added: "The success of this year's festival came together because the people of Dumfries and Galloway got behind it, involved themselves with it and turned out to attend the performances."
