Ryan McKinlay, 36, from Gosport, was as a passenger on a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) when it collided with a larger motorboat, which had been carrying the RIB earlier the same day.
Mr McKinlay was pulled from the sea in Osborne Bay at about 17:00 BST on Friday after a Mayday call.
He was airlifted to hospital where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination is due to be held.

Louie Martin tweeted: "Ryan McKinlay... Absolute Gentleman. RIP".
The other person on the RIB was pulled from the water and treated for head and chest injuries, along with some cuts, before being taken to hospital by ambulance.
It is understood the RIB was the tender for the larger motorboat, which has been named locally as True Blue.
The RNLI said the RIB was towed from the scene by Cowes lifeboat.
The motorboat, which had about 12 people onboard, was brought into Cowes by its own crew escorted by a police launch.
The incident has been reported to Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB)
Police are also investigating.
