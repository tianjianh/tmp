[SN]TITLE[SN]
Window cleaner Gavin Tainton guilty of OAP robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A window cleaner who tied up a pensioner, threatened her into silence and stole Â£15 has been found guilty of robbery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Constance Davies, 88, was watching television at home in Maesteg, Bridgend county, when Gavin Tainton burst in demanding money on 4 August last year.
Debt-ridden Tainton, 32, denied robbery and erupted in rage at a Cardiff Crown Court jury which convicted him before kicking a door on his way to the cells.
He will be sentenced on Friday.
Tainton used thick electrical cable to tie up Mrs Davies, pulled out her phone line and told her to stay quiet.
The shaken pensioner, who sustained a broken finger as well as numerous cuts and bruises, managed to wriggle free but remained silent until the following day when she summoned enough strength to go to see her doctor.
She begged a nurse that she "didn't want anyone to know" about her terrifying ordeal.
Tainton's fingerprints were found on the inside back-door handle of Mrs Davies' home.
But claimed he had been invited into Mrs Davies' home two weeks before the break-in after agreeing to clean her windows.
Tainton, who has previous convictions for burglary, insisted he had not carried out what he called a "junkie's crime".
