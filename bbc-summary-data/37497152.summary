Labour conference: Are immigration levels too high?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn says he is happy with current net migration and Labour's focus should be not on reducing levels but helping individual communities to manage the pressure on public services from migrant inflows.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Do Labour activists agree with him that overall numbers are not a problem?
Steve Triner, Croydon
Net migration is probably too high but that should not distract from the bigger issue of under-investment. I suspect this is a pretty common view.
I think immigration is too high in relation to the investment in public services but whether it is too high out of context is more difficult to answer.
I don't think there is a huge benefit to huge numbers of relatively unskilled people coming into the country. It must have some impact on wages and there are issues of community cohesion.
But it is wrong to blame issues around the health service and education on migrants.
Migrants pay more into the system in tax than they take out in public services.
Adam Higgins, Swansea
We obviously have to recognise there is dissatisfaction with the amount of immigration in the UK.
I don't have anything against current levels personally, but we do have to understand the electorate as a whole do seem to have concerns which do need to be recognised.
It is good policy to find extra funds for communities that are under stress because of immigration, but whether or not Jeremy Corbyn can communicate that effectively while then saying he is happy with the current levels - will the public believe that?
People will hear he is happy with things as they are now and they may not hear about the extra funding.
We know left-wing parties tend to be pro-immigration in their stance but they do have to win votes from the wider electorate. With Brexit we have seen a shift in attitudes or an appearance in the shift of attitudes. They have always been there to be honest.
Rachel Mullen, Gateshead
I would not necessarily agree levels are too high, they just need to be managed more effectively and in the right way.
You can't discriminate against people from different parts of the world because that is not equitable and would pit different groups against each other.
You have to remember the economic benefits migrants bring. The NHS would collapse, for a start, if you didn't have the migration we have. It is important we are continuing to welcome people from different parts of the world because they bring different skills and contribute to society in different ways.
Brexit has brought the worst out of a small minority of people. It is only a small minority of people who wanted to break free from Europe on the basis of immigration - not on the basis of other factors such as the amount of money we pay to the EU.
The press picked up on that hard line and that is what has stolen the limelight from other factors round Brexit - for instance what it will mean for jobs, particularly around the north-south divide.
Andy Dams, Sefton
The issue of immigration has always been about what kind of country we are. Britain has always been a country that has welcomed the lost, estranged and battle-hardened from lots of other countries.
I think frequently immigration is used as a cover for various kinds of discrimination and prejudice. If you accept that as your starting point, you then start to look at whatever is unsustainable in our communities by what anyone might define as too much immigration.
If our communities are not sustainable because of some directly-related link to a burden of incomers, I don't think we have any choice to look at that - but I don't think we have the evidence that is happening.
In the post-Brexit world, we are faced with the new reality that a central part of that vote was about immigration and Labour has to grapple with that reality.
You can do that by pulling up the drawbridge or by recognising the contribution incomers have made to our society, economy and culture and reaching out to the fearful and making them feel less fearful.
Robert Parker, Ashford
Many migrants are excellent trades people who bring excellent skills and quality service delivery to the construction sector in the UK, which has regrettably suffered from a lack of investment in apprentices.
It is good to hear Jeremy talking about investing in young people and the construction industry.
If you were to take foreign nationals out of the health service and public services in general, it would have an adverse effect - it would be a similar effect in the construction sector if the massive amount of Eastern European workers were to leave that sector because they bring excellent skills.
