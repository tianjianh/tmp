[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another weather warning comes into effect across Wales on Friday as more heavy rain sweeps across the country.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for parts of mid, south and west Wales.
It is in effect from 18:00 GMT and lasts throughout the weekend.
Forecasters said 10mm - 20mm (0.3in - 0.7in) of rain is expected across a large part of Wales, with up to 50mm (1.9in) on high ground in the Brecon Beacons.
Following on from weeks of heavy rain, the latest weather front will heap yet more water on flooded and saturated ground.
The chief forecaster said: "While these amounts of rain wouldn't usually lead to many impacts, given the saturated nature of the ground there is a greater risk of localised surface water flooding that might normally be expected."
The weather warning covers Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan.
