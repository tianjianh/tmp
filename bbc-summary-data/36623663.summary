Triple child killer David McGreavy denied prison release

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who killed three children and impaled their bodies on garden railings has had his application for release from prison turned down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David McGreavy was jailed for life in 1973 for the murders of four-year-old Paul Ralph, two-year-old Dawn and nine-month-old Samantha.
Their mutilated bodies were found on garden railings at their home in Gillam Street, Worcester.
The Parole Board rejected his application for release.
A board spokesman said McGreavy - who became known as the Monster of Worcester following the attack - would next be eligible to apply for parole in two years.
