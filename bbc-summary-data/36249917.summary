Flying Scotsman summer tour begins with trespass warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A warning has been issued to Flying Scotsman fans to stay clear of the tracks as it begins a summer tour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In February, Flying Scotsman made the journey from London King's Cross to York, on its inaugural run after a decade-long, Â£4.2m refit.
It arrived in York an hour later than expected after it was twice held up by reports of people on the line.
Network Rail said the day was marred in parts by "several dangerous incidents of trespass".
The firm said photographs shared online showed crowds of people, including young children, stood in the path of oncoming trains, with their view obscured by plumes of steam and smoke from the engine.
Phil Hufton, Network Rail managing director, England and Wales, said: "While the turnout to see Flying Scotsman so far has shown the passion and support for steam engines... the images of people stood on the railway taking photographs were deeply concerning.
"I cannot stress enough how dangerous it is to go onto the railway without training and permission."
Flying Scotsman, which retired from service in 1963, starts its summer tour programme later with a sold-out run from York to Newcastle.
During its inaugural journey in February, it was brought to a standstill near St Neots after reports of around 60 people trespassing on the track. No arrests were made.
The train was halted a second time north of Doncaster following further reports which were later found to be false.
