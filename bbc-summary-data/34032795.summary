[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The skull of an adult male was found by the M54 slip road on Thursday by workers surveying a roundabout near Telford.
The find sparked a West Mercia Police inquiry and led to the discovery of "further skeletal remains".
The remains have now been recovered and post-mortem tests on Tuesday will help to identify him, police said.
Officers said the remains had been there for at least two years.
Police have contacted neighbouring forces asking for information about people who had been reported missing.
