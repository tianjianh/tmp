[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus drivers have reached a pay deal with the Oxford Bus Company in a long-running dispute over Christmas pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walkouts took place on 2 and 6 March after earlier talks between the Unite union and the company broke down.
Drivers were angry they were only paid for three bank holidays over Christmas, instead of five.
Now the union has said a new pay deal has been agreed and drivers would get a lump sum to settle the 2016 Christmas dispute.
It added the settlement was reached with the help of conciliation service Acas and the specific details of the package were not being disclosed.
Unite regional secretary Jennie Formby thanked the union's members and said it now wanted to work with the company to provide "the best possible bus services for the people of Oxford".
Oxford Bus Company managing director Phil Southall said he was looking forward to "returning to the regular, constructive dialogue with Unite we've enjoyed in the past".
Unite has nearly 450 members at the company, including drivers, maintenance staff and admin workers.
