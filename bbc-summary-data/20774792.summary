[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paralympic sport has received a dramatic increase in funding for Rio 2016 following the success of British athletes at London 2012.

UK Sport has made a record £347m available for Olympic and Paralympic sport for the four-year cycle, with the latter receiving a 43% rise in funding.
Athletics is the biggest beneficiary as their funding is increased by over £4m - from £6.7m to £10.7m.
Swimming and cycling have also been rewarded for their London performances.
Investment in swimming increases from £10.5m to £11.8m, while cycling is up to £6.7m from £4.2m.
However, wheelchair fencing and sitting volleyball have had their funding programme cut completely.
Five-a-side football has been included, while para-triathlon and canoeing, which will be making their debuts in Rio, have been guaranteed funding for one year.
ParalympicsGB won 120 medals in London, and have been challenged by UK Sport to win one medal more than that tally in Rio.
The British Paralympic Association said in a statement: "The BPA has always maintained that, for the Paralympic movement in the UK, London should be a springboard onto greater things.
"UK Sport's increased level of investment into Paralympic sport as a whole reflects that and we are delighted that the strong performance of the ParalympicsGB team in London has acted as the catalyst."
Disability athletics won 29 of those medals, and UK Athletics Paralympic head coach, Paula Dunn, said the funding they receive was vital to their success.
"Funding from UK Sport and the National Lottery was an integral part of our success in London this summer," she said.
"We are absolutely delighted to be receiving an increased investment of 59% into the Paralympic programme."
