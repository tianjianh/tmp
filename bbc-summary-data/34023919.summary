Ashes 2015: Geoffrey Boycott angry at England against Australia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott blasted "a pathetic display of batting" as they collapsed to 107-8 on day two of the final Ashes Test at The Oval.

Boycott said on BBC Test Match Special: "There was some really, really bad cricket. Three of them were out pulling or hooking.
"You need to know when to attack and when to defend, but England have committed hara-kiri."
England have already won the series but Australia lead this game by 374 runs.
Boycott continued: "If I was the chairman of England cricket, I'd be going in to talk to the coaches. I'd want to know what you're going to do about this. Because if you don't solve it, I will - I'll get somebody else.
"England will follow on tomorrow and it will be all over by Saturday night."
The hosts had reached 46-1, having lost captain Alastair Cook when he was bowled by a turning delivery from Nathan Lyon for 22.
But that was the cue for his side to lose seven wickets for 46 runs in 22.3 overs - with the manner of nearly every dismissal drawing Boycott's ire.
"Adam Lyth grafted and played nicely, but Peter Siddle came on, his second ball was a loosener, a lollipop outside off stump and he went to pull it and it looped to mid-on. Your career is at stake here," he said.
"Jonny Bairstow came in and they set the trap for him - they put two back and he knocked it straight down his throat.
"Then Ben Stokes came in - almost every second or third ball he was whooshing at it, almost as if he was trying to win the match.
"Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series.
"He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It looks to me like his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket - it's pathetic."
Pace bowler Steven Finn, the only England man yet to bat, said: "We had a very poor day, there is no hiding away from that.
"We have to make sure tomorrow is a very good day to make sure we stay in this game."
With the Ashes gone, Australia batsman Steve Smith, whose 143 put the tourists in the driving seat, hopes his side can give retiring skipper Michael Clarke a good send-off by winning this game.
"It is disappointing that we can't win the series but Michael said before this Test match that he wanted a lot of fight and character from us," said Smith.
"The way we batted and grinded out in the first innings showed that, and to have them 100-8, it's been a very good couple of days for us."
Meanwhile, Boycott also felt England were guilty of "believing their own publicity" after their limited-overs success against New Zealand earlier in the summer.
"After they played well in the one-dayers, they said we're going to play positive, attacking, aggressive cricket," he said.
"We want application, we want fight, we want some adaptability to the conditions."
