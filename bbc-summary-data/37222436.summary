[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Felix "Joe" Tsotoovor, who is from West Africa, could now face being deported after he has served his sentence.
The attacks took place at a house in Edinburgh in 2010 and at a building site at Dalkeith, Midlothian, in 2012.
One woman in the public benches shouted "justice" as Tsotoovor, 40, was led to the cells at the High Court in Edinburgh.
A judge told him: "These are serious crimes which require me to impose a substantial custodial sentence."
Tsotoovor had denied raping the woman in Edinburgh and carrying out an assault with intent to rape the girl, but was found guilty after an earlier trial.
The trial heard he had ignored the woman's pleas to stop and pinned her down on a bed.
She said she was six or seven months pregnant at the time and was left crying after the assault.
The child victim told the court that Tsotoovor took her to his place of work in Dalkeith, Midlothian.
She said: "It was like a building site and he was guarding it."
The girl said Tsotoovor had pushed her to the ground and assaulted her but she eventually managed to push him off and run away.
Judge Lady Scott said the rape victim now suffers from depression and, as a result, had lost her employment. She added: "She has lost trust in others and confidence."
She said that Tsotoovor had robbed the 12-year-old victim of the innocence of childhood.
"You only stopped when your victim, with admirable bravery and spirit, fought you off," said the judge.
She said she had taken to account that he was a first offender and that he could be deported after serving his sentence.
Tsotoovor, formerly of Green Park, in Edinburgh, was told that he would be put on the sex offenders' register for an indefinite period.
