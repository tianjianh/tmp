Murray, 27, and Ms Sears, 26, have been a couple since 2005 and she regularly watches his matches.
It is thought the Wimbledon champion popped the question to Ms Sears last Wednesday.
Earlier this year Murray, from Dunblane in Perthshire, joked during a question and answer session with fans that he was getting married after Wimbledon.
About an hour later, Murray told his 2.3 million followers: "3 things.. I don't smoke grass, I'm not getting married(yet) and I don't want to kill rafael Nadal.."
It would appear that Murray has now proposed to Ms Sears, his partner of more than nine years.
Sussex-born Ms Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005.
She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as "the best thing to happen to Andy".
