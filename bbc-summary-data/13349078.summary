[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bordered by Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, it occupies a strategic area in the Horn of Africa but remains one of the most secretive states in the world.
Tensions with Ethiopia remain high across a closed and heavily fortified border. The perceived threat of war is said to have been used by the government to clamp down on society.
Eritrea is a one-party state, and its 1997 constitution - which provided for the existence of multi-party politics - has never been fully implemented. Military conscription is mandatory and indefinite, according to Amnesty International.
Prolonged periods of conflict and severe drought have adversely affected Eritrea's agriculture-based economy and it remains one of the poorest countries in Africa.
In a damning report into human rights abuses, the UN accused the government of crimes against humanity. By UN estimates, hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have fled the country in recent years, making the perilous journey across the Sahara and the Mediterranean to Europe.

President: Isaias Afewerki
President Isaias Afewerki has governed Eritrea since it became an independent country in 1993. His People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDF) is the sole political party.
Presidential elections planned for 1997 never took place and a constitution ratified in the same year has never been implemented.
Mr Isaias has been criticised for failing to introduce democratic reforms.
Born in 1946 in Asmara, Mr Isaias studied engineering at the University of Addis Ababa but left in 1966 to join the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF).
In 1970 he co-founded the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and in 1987 was elected its secretary-general. When the EPLF defeated Ethiopian forces in 1991, Mr Isaias was appointed head of a provisional government.
Following the 1993 vote on independence, he was elected president of Eritrea and chairman of the National Assembly, giving him control of both executive and legislative branches of government.
Media beyond the state-sanctioned newspapers and TV are non-existent. International journalists are routinely refused access. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in its 2015 World Press Freedom Index placed Eritrea last behind North Korea.
Outlets run by Eritreans overseas - mainly in Europe, North America and Australia - provide alternative sources of information but their reach and influence inside Eritrea are limited, not least because of very low levels of internet access.
Some key dates in Eritrea's history:
