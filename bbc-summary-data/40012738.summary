Philip Tron, 32, and his partner's daughter Courtney Boyle, 19, from Gateshead, were killed in the attack.
In a statement, Courtney's mum said: "My stunning, amazing, beautiful daughter, you were my rock, you made me so proud with all you had achieved.
"My gorgeous crazy Philip, you made my world a happy place, and now you are both my angels flying high in the sky."
Courtney's dad said he would "miss his baby girl" and her sister said she was "now a shining yellow star in the sky".
Her boyfriend also paid tribute to his "soulmate", adding: "No one had what that lass had, she was like no other. And she was on a path to fulfilment, and was happy when she passed."
Philip's mum paid tribute to her son, saying: "Philip was such a fun loving, energetic soul, he would light up the darkest room and lift your spirits with his infectious laugh, witty sense of humour and his beautiful smile."
She said she wanted to thank the emergency services and the people of Manchester for "their continued help and support which they have given us throughout this harrowing time".

"She was everyone's friend, thoughtful beyond belief with an effervescent and outgoing personality.
"She would have been devastated by the injuries sustained by her partner Paul, and we all wish him a speedy recovery.
"Elaine just loved life, and had a major love of music. Despite what has happened to her, she would want us all to carry on regardless and not be frightened by fear tactics, instead she regularly urged us all to rise up against it.
"Although we will all miss her beyond belief, we absolutely know she will live in our hearts forever."
