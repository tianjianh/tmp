The attorney general has rejected calls to increase the jail sentence of a speeding driver who killed a man in Greater Manchester.

Addil Haroon, 19, received a six-year sentence following the death of 25-year-old Joseph Brown-Lartey in Rochdale in November.
Haroon boasted of driving at up to 142mph on the M62.
The following day he killed Mr Brown-Lartey when he drove at 80mph through a red light in a residential area.
Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC decided not to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal because he said he did not believe judges would find it unduly lenient.
Amelia Drogan, the partner of Mr Brown-Lartey said the sentence was not strong enough for such a crime.
Her online petition calling for it to be increased attracted more than 17,000 signatures.
A spokesman from the attorney general's office said: "The unduly lenient sentence scheme is an exceptional remedy, reserved for cases where a sentence falls significantly below that which any judge could reasonably have passed.
"The Court of Appeal has made it clear that it will only increase a sentence where the judge has made a gross error.
"Jeremy Wright offers his sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Joseph Brown-Lartey for their tragic loss."
Haroon caused Mr Brown-Lartey's Audi A5 to split in half when he sped through a red light and crashed into him at the junction of Bury Road and Sandy Lane, Rochdale, at 04:40 GMT.
It happened hours after Haroon, of Essex Street, took a photograph of the speedometer at 142mph while speeding on the motorway in a hired Audi A6.
Haroon pleaded guilty in May to causing death by dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance.
