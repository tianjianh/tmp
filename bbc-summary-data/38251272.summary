Kieffer Moore: Torquay United boss 'grateful' for Forest Green striker's loan

Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says he is "grateful" to Kieffer Moore and Forest Green for the striker's month-long loan spell at Plainmoor.

Moore, 24, scored five goals in four National League games for the Gulls but has now returned to his parent club.
"It was one of those loans which worked for everybody," Nicholson said.
"Come January, when Mark Cooper sits down and sees what he needs and what he thinks he can tinker with, I'll go and ask that [Moore loan] question again."
Torquay picked up seven points from the four matches Moore played, which included a 3-0 win where the forward scored a hat-trick.
"I'm very grateful to Forest Green for letting us have Kieffer like that, and to Kieffer for coming in and setting a standard," added Nicholson to BBC Radio Devon.
"Honestly, if you send a player out on loan and he bangs in five goals in four games and your team, who's top of the league, finds themselves losing a couple, I think it's pretty obvious what was going to happen."
Meanwhile Torquay have signed Millwall centre-back Paul Rooney, 19, on a 28-day youth loan.
