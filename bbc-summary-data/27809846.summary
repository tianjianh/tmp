Robert Hart, 26, was knocked unconscious in front of the main stage at the Parklife Weekender Festival on Saturday.
Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to.
The attacker is described as a man in his late 20s, 6ft (1.8m) tall, with short, curly, black hair.
Greater Manchester Police described him as mixed-race with a muscular build, wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with the letter A in white on the front.
Det Insp Richard Eales said: "We believe a confrontation took place following an inflatable doll hitting Robert's girlfriend and I am specifically appealing for witnesses who recall seeing the inflatable doll and the attack on Robert immediately thereafter."
About 60,000 people attended the two-day festival in Heaton Park.
