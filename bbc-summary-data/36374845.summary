[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Hildreth battled to secure Somerset a draw after Middlesex came close to an unlikely victory at Lord's.

Middlesex were bowled out for 423, a lead of 47, before Ollie Rayner (4-56) put the visitors under pressure.
But Hildreth's unbeaten 85 steadied Somerset after they had lost three wickets for two runs.
Craig Overton added 44 runs with Hildreth before bad light ended play, resigning both teams to their sixth draw of the season.
Middlesex added just 16 runs to their overnight score before Jack Leach (5-77) bowled Tim Murtagh.
Somerset lost their openers cheaply under dark skies to Murtagh (2-33) before Rayner took a stunning one-handed catch at second slip to dismiss Jim Allenby.
There was a brief recovery from Somerset as Hildreth and Peter Trego put on 99 for the fifth wicket before Rayner dismissed the latter.
Lewis Gregory fell to Rayner's next ball to leave the Middlesex man on a hat-trick, but Somerset were able to make it to tea, before bad light ended play early.
