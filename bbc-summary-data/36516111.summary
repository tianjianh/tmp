Lyth's career-best 125 from 78 balls contained 10 fours and eight sixes.
The hosts slipped from 189-2 to 192-5, before Gary Ballance (80) and David Willey (26 not out) guided them to 314-8 with 15 balls to spare.
Earlier, Ben Duckett scored a 113-ball 121 and skipper Alex Wakely hit 71 from 79 balls as the visitors made 310-7.
Duckett's innings, which contained two sixes and 15 fours, was his first List A century in his 25th match.
Liam Plunkett (2-33) and Willey (2-55) - playing against his former club - took two wickets each for Yorkshire, before Steven Crook's unbeaten 46 from 41 deliveries pushed Northants past 300,
In reply, Whitby-born Lyth, who came through the youth system at Scarborough Cricket Club, scored 80 of Yorkshire's 97 in the opening 10 Powerplay overs and reached his century from 60 balls.
Lyth's dismissal was one of three wickets in nine balls, with Graeme White (3-45) getting rid of the opener, quickly followed by Adil Rashid for one.
But Ballance put on half-century partnerships with Tim Bresnan (38) and Willey, and despite two wickets for Azharullah (2-62) in one over, Willey hit his third six to win the game.
