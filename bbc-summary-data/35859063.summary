[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 3-2 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers slipped out of the League Two automatic promotion places after a late defeat at Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Kennedy's 85th-minute goal earned all three points for the hosts in a topsy-turvy match at Brunton Park.
The Cumbrians took an early lead via Jack Stacey's 20-yard shot before Billy Bodin brought the Pirates level.
Carlisle regained the lead through Charlie Wyke before Matty Taylor's turn and shot equalised before Kennedy's lifted finish over the keeper.
Plymouth's victory over York and Accrington's away win against Newport means the Pirates slip down to fifth and are now three points off the automatic promotion places.
Carlisle move to within four points of seventh-placed Wycombe who sit in the final play-off spot.
