Former Wigan boss Martinez, 39, has been appointed on a four-year contract at Goodison Park.
Age: 39
Playing career: Real Zaragoza (1993-94), Balaguer (1994-95), Wigan Athletic (1995-2001), Motherwell (2001-02), Walsall (2002-03), Swansea (2003-06), Chester City (2006-07)
Playing honours: Copa del Rey (1994), Football League Third Division title (1996-97), Football League Trophy (1998-99 & 2005-06)
Managerial career: Swansea City (2007-09) and Wigan Athletic (2009-13)
Managerial honours: League One title (2007-08) & FA Cup (2012-13)
"When David [Moyes] first came to see me, he sat down 11 years ago and we were in a bad state, and he said 'we're not going down'," said Kenwright.
"Roberto's first words were 'I'll get you in the Champions League'."
The Spaniard replaces David Moyes, who is taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Premier League champions Manchester United.
During the Scot's stay with the Toffees he was unable to lead them to the group stage of Europe's top club competition.
The closest he came was in 2005 when, after they finished fourth in the Premier League, Everton were beaten 4-2 on aggregate by Spanish side Villarreal in the qualifying round.
After Kenwright revealed what Martinez had told him about his ambitions for the club, the Spaniard said Everton needed "to keep building" on his predecessor's success.
"The chairman has not put any pressure on me," he said. "It is simple to take this job, really.
"The fans need to know they are the most important part of this club, and I will need them. What David Moyes has done is set a real high standard.
"We need to make sure we are a winning side and a strong side, who can carry on achieving more.
"Finishing in the top six was a magnificent achievement, and we need to keep building if we want to improve on that."
Martinez joined Wigan from Swansea in 2009, returning to the side he had played for during a six-year spell.
"Fans assembled outside the stadium warmly welcomed David Moyes's replacement on his arrival, saying they hoped he will employ a more attacking style of football.
"And as Martinez walked into Goodison Park for the first time as manager the club motto, inscribed above the front entrance, read 'nil satis nisi optimum'. Translation? 'Nothing but the best is good enough.'
"Martinez is now fully aware of the ambitions of his new employers."
He won the FA Cup this season when Wigan defeated Manchester City, but asked to leave after failing to keep them in the Premier League.
When asked why he had chosen to leave Wigan now, having been targeted by Aston Villa and Liverpool in previous summers, he added: "It is simple: it came in a natural way.
"It has been a phenomenal time at Wigan but after four seasons this was the right time and I knew Everton was the right club.
"It has been a natural transition to be involved in such an exciting club."
Martinez revealed he had been promised "a few quid to sign a few players" by Kenwright.
The Blues chairman also promised to try to resist offers for current members of his squad.
Martinez went on to name England centre-back Phil Jagielka as his new captain.
The 30-year-old defender replaces Phil Neville, whose eight-year stay on Merseyside ends at the end of this month.
