Ivanka Trump has found herself in the midst of a mini-scandal less than a week after her father was elected president.

Ms Trump landed in hot water after sending out a "style alert" to journalists around the world.
The problem? The alert focused on a $10,000 bracelet from her own range which she had worn during Donald Trump's 60 Minutes interview.
Critics saw the email as blurring the lines between business and politics.
The "alert" showed a picture of Ms Trump wearing the bracelet - described as her "favourite bangle" - during the CBS interview, which was watched by 20 million people.

People were quick to accuse her of cashing in on her father's position, while some social media users noted the bracelet's price tag of $10,800 (Â£8,670) - roughly a fifth of the average US annual income  - was at odds with Trump's man of the people image.
The Ivanka Trump brand was forced to apologise. Chief brand officer Abigail Klem told The New York Times that the "style alert" had been sent by "a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election".
It is not the first time Ms Trump has used her father's new political career to advertise her own business.
In July, Ms Trump raised eyebrows when she plugged a sleeveless sheath dress from her own collection that she wore to the Republican Party's national convention that nominated her father.
Immediately after the convention, Ms Trump sent a Twitter message with a link directing fans who wanted to "shop Ivanka's look" to retailer Macy's website where they could buy the same dress for $138.
However, being the daughter of a controversial candidate has not been entirely good news for the businesswoman.
The #grabyourwallets campaign, which calls on women to stop buying Ivanka brand luxury products from major US stores, including Macy's, Nordstrom and Amazon, began after Mr Trump was heard to boast "you can do anything" to women "when you're a star" and is heard saying "grab them by the pussy".
