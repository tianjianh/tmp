Mr Robinson, 66, was taken to the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, on Monday morning after he suffered a suspected heart attack.
He was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he underwent a procedure.
Mr McGuinness said he took Mr Robinson a bowl of fruit during his visit on Wednesday night.
"It was my bowl of fruit, because I hadn't eaten anything all day yesterday, so I sacrificed that in the interests of the first minister's health," he joked.
The deputy first minister said: "But hopefully he's on the mend, I would hope he will be out of hospital very shortly.
"I'm not going to speak about his physical condition. I think, knowing Peter, he will talk to the media about that whenever he's able to do so and I'll leave that to him.
"But I obviously felt it was important to go and see him and wish him well and his family well."
