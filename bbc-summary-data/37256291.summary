Two 16-year-olds, three men aged 19, 20 and 21, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs.
Their arrests follow a week long crackdown on drug dealing in Gloucestershire.
Police have charged six people with drug offences following earlier raids in Gloucester, Cheltenham and Crawley.
Supt Richard Cooper says the operation was aimed at disrupting some of the major supply lines into the county: "It will come as no surprise that many of the drugs sold in Gloucestershire are brought in by dealers from places like London.
"It's the culmination of months of work by officers and we hope it will reassure local residents that police are taking the issue seriously".
