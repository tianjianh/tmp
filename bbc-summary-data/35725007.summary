The staff at Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), an arms-length council body, want better pay for shift work.
The union Unison said 18 of its members - more than 90% of the staff - would take part in the action from 19:00 until 19:00 on Sunday.
CSG said it had "business continuity plans in place" to ensure monitoring of Glasgow's CCTV network.
Unison Glasgow branch secretary Brian Smith said: "These members work 12-hour shift patterns, providing a 24-hour service every day of the year.
"Other workers in CSG and Glasgow City Council on similar shift patterns receive an additional annual payment of Â£7,500. It is just a question of equality and fairness.
"We have given the employer years to sort this out through a promised job evaluation scheme which has now been shelved. Our members have been left with no option but to take strike action."
Another 48-hour strike has also been planned for Thursday 17 March until Saturday 19 March.
A spokesman for CSG said: "Public safety is paramount and we have business continuity plans in place to enable us to continue to monitor the city's CCTV network."
