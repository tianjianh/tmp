The child's mother, a US national, had taken a late flight from London to Alicante, airport sources said.
She placed the child inside a baby carrier on a stationary belt for heavy baggage, which is reported to have been activated by the weight.
The Spanish police said they were investigating, looking at CCTV footage "but it seems that it was an accident".
The tragedy is believed to have occurred at the Alicante-Elche airport on the Costa Blanca.
The infant was transported to where the bags emerge, becoming tangled and trapped in the rollers, reports said.
The mother's Canadian husband was reportedly waiting for the family in the arrivals zone. It is believed they were planning a family holiday in nearby Denia.
Medical workers tried to save the baby's life but he was declared dead at the scene.
A post-mortem examination is expected to take place later on Thursday or Friday.
