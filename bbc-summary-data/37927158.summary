The explosion was one of the deadliest industrial accidents in Chinese history and caused more than $1bn in estimated economic losses.
The Ruihai Logistics chairman was found guilty of paying bribes allowing his company to sidestep safety regulations when storing sodium cyanide and other dangerous chemicals.
Deadly disaster marked one year on
Others sentenced were found guilty on charges ranging from abuse of power to storing dangerous substances illegally.
An investigation found that stocks of flammable nitrocellulose  - a chemical used in nail polish - had caught fire and spread to illegal stores of the fertiliser ammonium nitrate.
The blasts that were triggered ripped through an industrial port area in the city, destroying buildings, shipping containers and thousands of new cars.
