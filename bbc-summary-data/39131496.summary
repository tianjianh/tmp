[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council's new Wick Joint Campus looks set to finally open after the Easter holidays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The school site was to be open by summer last year, but its completion by the local authority's contractor has been delayed several times.
The council said that the campus is to be operational on 26 April.
The campus includes a new Wick High School, new buildings for the town's Pulteneytown and South primaries and communities facilities.
Pupils are to get three days added to their Easter break to allow teachers and other staff to move materials to the new site.
Local councillor Willie Mackay said: "It is excellent news that the council can now positively state the intended opening date of the new facilities and I know that pupils, staff and the local community can't wait to get in following the Easter holidays."
In a separate development, Highland councillors have agreed that new school should be built on Skye to replace Dunvegan Primary.
The facilities of the existing school are deemed to be inadequate.
