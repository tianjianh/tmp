[SN]TITLE[SN]
Week ahead in the European Parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Although the EU referendum debate may be raging in the UK, MEPs have a fairly businesslike week in store when they return to Strasbourg on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a run of plenary sittings that have been rather light on lawmaking, a number of relatively inconspicuous measures await plenary approval.
The latest part of the Commission's "comprehensive" approach to solving the migration crisis will be unveiled on Tuesday, when MEPs will debate new measures to wrestle with the root causes of economic migration from Africa.
They will vote on whether to give the green light to an inquiry committee into the Panama Papers leaks, and review the state of the EU's main investment plan.
And on Wednesday they will hear a first-ever speech from a Bulgarian President, when Rosen Plevneliev comes to town.
Here are the main events in the week ahead...
The day's short sitting will kick off with a debate on the EU's role at a UN meeting this week on research into HIV/Aids.
This will be followed by a debate on how the EU co-ordinates its sustainable development policies.
After this, MEPs will discuss safety provisions in the construction of the Ostrovets nuclear power plant in Belarus.
The plant, which is being built near to the border of EU member Lithuania, is due to enter the first stage of operation this year and become fully operational in 2018.
The European Commission has played an observer role in the construction, to ensure that the plant complies with nuclear safety standards.
A group of MEPs want to ask the Commission how it hopes to make sure the plant undergoes proper stress tests before it becomes operational.
As has become the norm for recent plenary sessions, the sitting will end with short debates on six non-binding "own initiative" motions.
This week's batch include suggestions for EU action to clamp down on unfair trading practices in the food industry and promote the use of new farming technologies.
The morning begins with a debate on an anti-tax avoidance directive announced by the Commission in January.
After this, they will debate legislation that would delay implementation of new EU trading rules for the financial sector by one year.
The rules, known as 'MiFID II', were supposed to come into force in January next year - but EU and national regulators have said their IT systems are not ready to cope with the change.
The European Commission proposed the extension in February. It has already been approved by MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee and will be put to a final vote at lunchtime.
In the afternoon, the Commission will formally announce new proposals to tackle the "root causes" of migration to Europe from Africa.
The measures will likely call for EU funds to be used to boost private investment in African countries, in return for greater co-operation over migrant returns.
It remains to be seen whether the final proposal includes any of the more radical proposals suggested by Italy in a policy document in April.
The Commission will also be presenting a proposed revision to the blue card scheme for highly-skilled migrants from outside the EU.
The scheme allows people to apply for a pan-EU work permit - although it does not apply in the UK, Denmark or Ireland.
In the evening, MEPs will debate a co-operation agreement that the EU initially signed with the Philippines in July 2012.
The agreement contains a number of provisions to strengthen economic ties, as well as boosting co-operation over counter-terrorism, energy and organised crime.
They will vote on whether to ratify the agreement at lunchtime on Wednesday.
MEPs will also discuss what involvement EU states had in facilitating alleged human rights abuses by the CIA.
The allegations relate to interrogation techniques used by US security services between 2001 and 2006 at "secret prisons" situated in a number of EU states.
The alleged complicity of EU states in the CIA rendition programme has been the subject of several resolutions from MEPs, and an inquiry from the Civil Liberties Committee.
Investment Commissioner Jyrki Katainen is expected to join MEPs in the morning to debate a mid-term review of the EU's flagship investment plan.
The scheme - which was launched by Jean-Claude Juncker shortly after the present Commission team took office - aims to boost private investment in Europe's economy after the financial crisis.
MEPs will also debate whether to sign off on EU proposals to lend â‚¬500m to Tunisia to supplement medium-term loans from the IMF.
The country's economy has struggled since the Arab Spring in 2011, as well as following terror attacks which have hit its tourist industry.
At midday local time (11.00 BST) Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev will make his first speech to the Parliament, before the day's voting gets underway.
At the top of the voting list is a final confirmation vote on a proposal to set up an inquiry committee into the Panama Papers scandal.
The afternoon sitting will begin with a debate on new rules which would mean EU citizens would not have to get authenticated copies made of certain public documents - including birth certificates - when they move to another EU state.
The requirement to get official documents authenticated can incur large fees, particularly if the documents need to be translated.
After a debate on ways to improve the sharing of information between EU security authorities, MEPs will discuss the recent approval of a controversial bill in Turkey that will strip MPs of their immunity from prosecution.
The move has been seen as a first step to removing pro-Kurdish MPs from the Parliament - and another sign of increasing authoritarianism from the ruling AK party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The evening will also see a debate on EU action against Chinese steel that is "dumped" - sold at a loss - on the European market.
Some MEPs have accused national governments - including the UK - of blocking changes proposed by the European Commission in 2013 to improve the EU's trade defence instruments.
The final day of the week's session will begin with a debate on how the EU could protect Europe's rail supply industry from unfair competition from overseas.
The sector covers the manufacture of infrastructure such as rail lines, train carriages and signals.
MEPs on the Industry Committee will ask the Commission how it can promote investment and research to improve the competitiveness of the industry in Europe.
They will also ask for an initial assessment of how the sector would be affected if China gains market economy status at the World Trading Organisation (WTO) later this year.
Then follows the traditional final-day debates on human rights motions - which this week will focus on Cambodia, Tajikistan and Vietnam.
After the voting session, the sitting will end with a debate on whether the Commission has done enough to keep MEPs informed of negotiations on various international agreements.
Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.
