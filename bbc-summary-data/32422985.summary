The package includes a Â£250 Carer's Bonus for those looking after others for 35 hours a week or more.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called for a northern powerhouse for Wales in a speech at Bangor University.
Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visited Wales to meet business leaders.
Also on Thursday, Wales Green leader Pippa Bartolotti called for the legalisation of cannabis for medical use in a speech in Cardiff.
Speaking of the Lib Dems' plans, Mr Clegg said: "Our new Carer's Package will ensure society pays back the service that carers give to their loved ones and the community, easing the pressure they are under, and providing the support needed to live happier, more fulfilling lives."
As for Plaid Cymru's call for a northern powerhouse, Ms Wood told students: "Devolution from London cannot stop at Cardiff Bay - there must be a devolution dividend for all Wales, for all communities.
"This is especially the case for those furthest away from the capital. Wales is a community of communities."
