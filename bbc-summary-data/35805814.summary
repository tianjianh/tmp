Manchester City reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time despite a lethargic second leg goalless draw against Dynamo Kiev.

City, 3-1 up from the first leg, were in control of the tie but lost centre-backs Vincent Kompany and Nicolas Otamendi to injury early on.
In a slow-paced first half, neither side threatened a shot on target.
Jesus Navas hit the post with a low drive in the second half for City and Yaya Toure shot straight at the keeper.

Manuel Pellegrini - who will be replaced by Pep Guardiola as boss next season - wants to finish by making City champions of Europe for the first time.
After winning the League Cup last month, the Champions League remains City's only realistic hope of a second trophy this season, as they lie 12 points behind leaders Leicester in the Premier League.
Pellegrini has made history by taking City further in the competition than any other manager, but can he go all the way?
They will want to avoid Barcelona in the draw for the next round - should the holders complete the job against Arsenal on Wednesday - having been knocked out by the current Spanish champions in each of the last two seasons.
It was just as well that City had done the damage in the first leg, as this was a desperately poor performance against a Kiev side who have never won in England.
With the match feeling almost like a testimonial for long spells, neither striker Sergio Aguero nor midfielder Toure could exert their influence.
Injuries to both of City's first-choice centre-backs will be of big concern to the home supporters.
Kompany misjudged a long ball forward and pulled up after turning to retrieve the situation.
He slumped to the ground and knew straight away he had suffered another setback, with manager Pellegrini confirming his captain had picked up another calf injury - the 14th he has suffered since joining the club in 2008.
Kompany has played 19 of City's 46 matches this season, and the statistics show they are worse off when he is missing.
Across all competitions, they have conceded a goal every 156 minutes with him on the pitch - but one every 70 minutes without him.
Fellow centre-back Otamendi also went off in the first half, unable to continue after a collision with a visiting player.
The draw for the last eight takes place on Friday at 11:00 GMT. City will face any of the following teams: Atletico Madrid, Barcelona or Arsenal, Bayern Munich or Juventus, Benfica, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid, Wolfsburg.
Kompany has been ruled out "for at least a month" says Pellegrini so City must wait and see if Otamendi can recover in time for their Premier League game against rivals Manchester United on Sunday (kick-off 16:00 GMT).
