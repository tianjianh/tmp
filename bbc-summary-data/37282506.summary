[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Ward's goalkeeping error gifted Brighton victory as Championship leaders Huddersfield suffered their first defeat of the campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a low-key match, Anthony Knockaert's shot took a slight deflection, slipping through Ward's grasp at the near post.
The Terriers' keeper made a great one-on-one save from Jamie Murphy in the first half as the Seagulls were on top.
Bruno and Lewis Dunk had gone close before the goal, while Elias Kachunga spurned the visitors' best chance.
David Wagner's Huddersfield side had enjoyed their best start to a league season in their 108-year history, but their lead at the top is now only one point after Newcastle's thrashing of QPR.
Brighton were without a win in three league games but always looked most likely to break the deadlock, Dunk heading their best chance wide from only two yards out.
The visitors almost punished Chris Hughton's team when Jack Payne's cross evaded David Stockdale, but on-loan striker Kachunga could not make contact with the goal gaping.
That was the only real scare for the hosts, who kept their first clean sheet since a run of four shutouts at the start of the season.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"It was probably one of those games that gets the supporters a little frustrated.
"But, as a manager and a coach, you know you have to play that type of game.
"They are a good side. They give you a lot of possession, they drop back and they counter very quickly.
"If you don't play within a shape, they can punish you. We had to be patient. We created the two best chances in the game, one in each half.
"The bit of luck we got in the game, I thought we deserved. I thought we were the better team."
Huddersfield boss David Wagner on keeper Ward's mistake:
"I spoke to Danny and I told him there were no complaints from my side.
"Mistakes are part of this game.
"Unfortunately, if a goalkeeper makes a mistake, it's a goal. But he is strong enough and he knows that everyone backs him - that he will be fresh on Saturday and will help us get a better result than we had today."
