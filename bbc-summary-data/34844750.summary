[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A policeman stunned a man who had stabbed himself in the neck because he feared for his colleague's life, an inquest has heard.

PC Dave Giboney said moments after Arlindo Furtado stabbed himself in the throat, a colleague discharged his Taser, which missed.
Mr Furtado was later struck twice by Taser shots at his Cardiff home.
The inquest has heard Mr Furtado died from his neck wound, and not as a result of being stunned.
PC Giboney told Aberdare Coroner's Court his colleague and Mr Furtado fell on to the landing floor. He then discharged his Taser, which hit Mr Furtado's left side.
"I feared for my colleague. He was resisting, I did not know what he was going to do. I wanted to protect my colleague and prevent Mr Furtado from harming himself further," the officer said.
Mr Furtado died in hospital after armed police were called to his house in Adeline Street, Splott, on 11 October 2014, resulting in a stand-off lasting several hours.
Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbeatter found evidence of two Taser marks but said they were not the cause of death.
"The wound to the neck is sufficient to cause death," he said.
The inquest heard the day before his death, Mr Furtado told his partner Nicole Varela he would rather die than be without her and his children.
Reading a statement from Ms Varela, the coroner said she had been the victim of a "violent incident at his hands" the day before.
She said Mr Furtado "could be aggressive from time to time" but was also an "excellent father".
The inquest was told Mr Furtado was due to be arrested following allegations of domestic violence.
Police negotiator Det Chf Insp Brian Herd said he felt Mr Furtado was determined to end his life and became increasingly agitated as the afternoon wore on.
Ms Valera disagreed with negotiators who would not allow her to speak to him on a telephone link and believed she could have changed his mind.
DCI Herd said introducing a third person into the situation was a risk he could not take.
On the day before he died, Mr Furtado kept calling Ms Varela "asking for forgiveness" and had logged onto Facebook to say goodbye to family and friends.
The inquest also heard Mr Furtado's ex-partner in Portugal had called police in Cardiff on the day of his death to express concerns about his welfare.
The hearing continues.
