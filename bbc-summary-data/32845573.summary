A raven entangled in baling twine has been rescued from a 60ft (18m) cliff face in mid Wales.

The bird became entangled in the twine which was stuck on a nest in a remote area above Staylittle, near Llanbrynmair, in Powys.
A rope rescue team cut it free.
RSPCA inspector Phil Lewis said: "The twine was attached to the bird's leg which restricted movement. The bird's mate had been coming back and forth feeding it."
He said fellow inspector Andy Broadbent had abseiled onto a small ledge to cut the raven free.
"As soon as he cut the twine, the bird flew and went into a pine tree unharmed," he added.
He said it was not known if the raven had brought the twine back to the nest itself, or if it was the result of littering.
But the RSPCA issued a warning about the dangers of littering to wild birds and animals.
It said twine or fishing line can wrap around necks, causing deep wounds in flesh and cutting off the blood supply; hooks can pierce beaks or become embedded in skin; and litter like weights can also be swallowed, causing internal injuries and blockages.
