Police said four men slashed the man and his Staffordshire bull terrier with a "bladed weapon" at the property in Redford Close, off Marsden Road.
The man, 26, is in a serious but not life-threatening condition and the dog is recovering at a local veterinary surgery.
Detectives said they were unsure what the motive for the attack was.
Det Insp Mark O'Brien, of Eastbourne CID, said, "Four men in dark clothing forced their way into the house and slashed at the man with some sort of sharp instrument.
"It is possible that people in the vicinity may have seen or heard signs of a disturbance or noticed suspicious vehicles or people."
He appealed for anyone with information about the attack, which happened at about 22:00 BST on Thursday, to contact police.
