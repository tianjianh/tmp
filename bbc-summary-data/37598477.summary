Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness were amongst fans at the Northern Ireland v San Marino FIFA World Cup qualifying match on Saturday evening.
The IFA received Â£28.75m from the Northern Ireland Executive towards the stadium redevelopment.
The venue now has a seating capacity of 18,500.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino unveiled a plaque to mark its opening.
Speaking before the match, First Minister Arlene Foster described the transformation as "remarkable".
"Northern Ireland, along with first class fans, now has a truly first class venue as its home of football," said Mrs Foster.
"There is no doubt that the Euro 2016 finals were transformative for Northern Ireland football and this wonderful new facility is reflective of our pride and ambition to take [the team] to the next level."
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said: "In France this summer, Michael O'Neill and his team proved they were a class act both on and off the pitch and I'm delighted they now have a world class stadium to match.
"Sport has the ability to break down barriers on and off the pitch and the IFA deserves great credit for its tireless efforts to rid sport of sectarianism, racism and homophobia.  Their work goes beyond the gates of Windsor Park and ripples out into wider society building friendships and the community."
