Croatia country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Croatia's declaration of independence in 1991 was followed by four years of war and the best part of a decade of authoritarian nationalism under President Franjo Tudjman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
By early 2003 it had made enough progress in shaking off the legacy of those years to apply for EU membership, becoming the second former Yugoslav republic after Slovenia to do so.
Following protracted accession talks, Croatia took its place as the 28th member state of the EU on 1 July 2013.
A country of striking natural beauty with a stunning Adriatic coastline, Croatia is again very popular as a tourist destination.
Population 4.4 million
Area 56,594 sq km (21,851 sq miles)
Major language Croatian
Major religion Christianity
Life expectancy 73 years (men), 80 years (women)
Currency kuna
President: Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic
Moderate conservative Kolinda Grabar-Kiratovic was elected Croatia's first female president in January 2015, narrowly beating Social Democrat incumbent Ivo Josipovic in a run-off vote.
She pledged to kick-start the country's ailing economy.
She had previously served as foreign minister, ambassador to the United States and NATO assistant secretary-general.
The role of president is largely ceremonial. The president proposes the prime minister but it is for parliament to approve the nomination.
Prime Minister-designate: Andrej Plenkovic
Croatia's president named Andrej Plenkovic, head of the main conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party, as prime minister-designate in October 2016. 
The HDZ won 61 out of 151 seats in a snap election on 11 September and struck a fresh coalition deal with a small centre-right reformist party. The coalition also has support from ethnic minorities which won eight seats.
Mr Plenkovic, a 46-year-old former diplomat, has 30 days to win parliament's approval for his cabinet, which will need to urgently tackle a struggling economy.
The previous government under Tihomir Oreskovic was approved by parliament in January 2016, more than two months after a general election that failed to produce an outright winner.
However, after only five months in power, Mr Oreskovic's government was toppled in June following a quarrel between the main coalition partners. Parliament was dissolved in July and fresh elections were called. 
Croatia's media enjoy a high degree of independence. Croatian Radio-TV, HRT, is the state-owned public broadcaster and is financed by advertising and a licence fee.
Public TV is still the main source of news and information, but HRT is losing audience share and privately-owned Nova TV is now the top station.
National commercial networks and dozens of private local TV stations compete for viewers. The cable and satellite market is well developed.
There are three national public radio networks, four national commercial channels, regional public radios and more than 130 local and regional radios.
In the newspaper sector, there are six national and four regional dailies. Austrian and German concerns have large stakes in the print media.
