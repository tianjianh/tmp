Are you happy with Arsenal's squad?

Are you happy with Arsenal's squad, or do you think they should have strengthened further during the transfer window?

Use the team selector below to show your thoughts on each position - rather than choosing a starting 11, you will simply be putting a tick or a cross for every position.
Think your first-choice keeper is fine - put a tick there.
Worried about right-back? use a cross.
Think you've got one great striker but lack back-up or an alternative, put a tick in one attacking position, a cross in the other. You get the idea.
We will analyse the data to find out which fans are the most content, which would change great chunks of their squad and which individual positions are a cause for concern at clubs.
For each position, select whether you think Arsenal are sorted, or if a player is needed.
