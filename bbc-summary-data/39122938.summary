Exeter centre Henry Slade, who came off the bench in the 36-15 win over Italy, has been omitted from the 27-man squad.
Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins) and Anthony Watson (Bath) will rejoin their clubs this weekend.
So, too, will Northampton's Paul Hill, and the Leicester pair of Mike Williams and Ellis Genge.
