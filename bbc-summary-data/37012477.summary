The man was found by firefighters in the Studio 338 building in Boord Street, Greenwich, near the o2.
About 100 firefighters are tackling the fire and plumes of smoke can be seen for miles across the city.
London Fire Brigade said a large part of the ground floor of the nightclub and part of its first floor were alight.
An industrial warehouse nearby is also completely alight and a scrap paper processing yard, containing a number of outbuildings, is also partly alight.
A safety cordon was set up as gas cylinders were on site.
People in the area have been asked to keep doors and windows closed because of the smoke.
The southbound Blackwall Tunnel has been closed because of smoke blowing across the A102. Long traffic delays are reported in the area.
The cause of the fire is not yet known.
Station manager Winston Douglas said: "This is a large fire and the smoke could be seen from across London, meaning our 999 control officers took over 50 emergency calls.
"Our firefighters are making steady progress but they will be at the scene for the rest of the day, and possibly into the evening so please try and avoid the area if possible."
Emergency services received the first call at 11:43 BST.
