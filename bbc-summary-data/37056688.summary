Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.
"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.
"I couldn't help who was here. I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is."
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.
China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.
Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.
"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.
"It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth. I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.
"But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come."
"It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer."
Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.
Earlier this year she was given a provisional ban after testing positive for meldonium, but the International Swimming Federation lifted the suspension after advice from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned.
"Cas considered my appeal and I won. If someone dislikes it and has a different opinion, they can go to CAS," she explained.
"I am not for doping and I have never used it. The second case was completely not my fault. Everyone should have a second chance. When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no-one puts you in jail."
