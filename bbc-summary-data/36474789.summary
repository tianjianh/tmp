Chris Froome maintains third as Jesus Herrada wins Criterium du Dauphine stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome finished eighth on stage two of the Criterium du Dauphine on Tuesday to maintain third place in the overall standings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Team Sky rider, 31, was part of a group that finished two seconds behind Movistar stage winner Jesus Herrada.
Spaniard Herrada made a decisive break, accelerating up the final climb for victory at Chalmazel-Jeansagniere.
Spain's Alberto Contador is the overall leader, six seconds ahead of Richie Porte, having won Sunday's time trial.
Contador, a two-time Tour de France winner, is yet to win the eight-stage, week-long Dauphine, but has twice finished second - in 2010 and 2014.
Froome, also a two-time Tour winner, is 13 seconds off Tinkoff rider Contador heading into Wednesday's hilly third stage from Boen-sur-Lignon to Tournon-sur-Rhone.
The Kenya-born rider was not named by British Cycling on Tuesday in a list of athletes who will compete for the British Championships later this month, with team-mate Geraint Thomas also absent.
Froome will instead focus on the Tour de France, which begins on 2 July, ahead of his bid for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio in August.
