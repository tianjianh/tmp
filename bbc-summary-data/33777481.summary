All of the passengers had to be transferred from the ferry in Holyhead, Anglesey after the incident.
The Irish Ferries Jonathan Swift vessel was preparing to set off from Holyhead to Dublin before midday when heavy gusts pushed it into its berth.
No passengers were injured during the incident. Irish Ferries cancelled three Swift services following the incident.
A spokesman for Irish Ferries said the aluminium hull ferry was being inspected to assess damage to the body and a replacement services was taking passengers to Dublin.
He said: "Just as she was leaving the berth at Holyhead she was caught by a gust of wind and blown back in. She was only yards off the berth and the ropes had been loosened.
"We don't know if the hull has been punctured. We don't think that's likely, but if it has then I don't know if they can do the repair in Holyhead. It could need a dry dock."
