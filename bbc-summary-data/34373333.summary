Mr Jones, speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement, said the economy was buoyant and unemployment was falling.
He added that standards in education were on the rise and the NHS was improving.
"We've seen the best figures for inward investment for 30 years," Mr Jones said.
"We're seeing new confidence in our young people, unemployment is coming down, economic activity is increasing, education standards are going up, the health service is improving and this in the background of a 10% cut to our own budget from the UK government."
The autumn conference comes at a key time for the Labour Party, under the new leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.
It also comes ahead of elections for the Welsh assembly in May 2016.
"Our opponents will accuse us of having run out of steam," said the first minister.
"What we will do is show people that we have new ideas, that we have new ways of taking Wales forward, that we believe in Wales particularly and that we're really ready and up for governing for five years beyond this."
