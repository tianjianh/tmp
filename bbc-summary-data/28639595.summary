Council staff and contract workers have begun the huge operation to remove Games-related paraphernalia.
Some road restrictions remain in place for events to mark the centenary of the outbreak of World War One.
Routes to Glasgow Airport are expected to very busy as athletes and officials return home after the Games.
The Athletes' Village in Dalmarnock is due to close on Wednesday after which several weeks of work will begin to remove the security fence.
The village is due to be handed-back to City Legacy, the consortium that built it, on 21 November. Homes and flats in the village will then be sold.
Many roads in and around George Square and Glasgow Cathedral remain closed or have restrictions in place until 6 August for the World War One centenary events. Full details of the closures are on the Get Ready Glasgow Website.
Bus operator First Glasgow said that as a result of these road closures, some of its services would be diverted around the city centre.
Games restrictions have been removed from Aikenhead Road, in the city's south side, which were in place for the past two weeks to accommodate the athletics at Hampden.
Restrictions are also being lifted around other venues in the city.
Train operator ScotRail said its timetable was now back to normal, apart from longer and extra trains on Edinburgh lines for the festivals.
It has also ended the one-way system for passengers leaving Argyle Street and Glasgow Central low level stations.
A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said there was "no need for a major clean up operation" as cleansing staff had been "working hard every day" throughout the Games "to keep the city looking its best.
"Over the next few days we will be removing bins from venue locations and treating the grass surfaces at Glasgow Green," she said.
"The Commonwealth Games look and wayfinding will come down in the coming weeks, with banners on the route of the Team Scotland parade on Friday, 15 August staying up to provide a colourful host city backdrop to celebrate the success of our athletes."
