Singer Trevor Grills, 54, and tour manager Paul McMullen, 44, died after being hit by a falling metal door at G Live in Guildford on 9 February 2013.
David Naylor, 56, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, is facing two counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
He appeared at Guildford Crown Court and is due stand trial in September.
His lawyer have indicated he would enter not guilty pleas when he next appears at the same court on 11 March.
The company which manufactured the doors involved in the incident has been summonsed for breaches of duty imposed by the Health and Safety at Work Act.
Express Hi-Fold Doors Limited, of which Mr Naylor is a director, is accused of failing to ensure equipment was safe.
Mr Grills, from Port Isaac in Cornwall, and Mr McMullen, from Disley in Cheshire, were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group.
