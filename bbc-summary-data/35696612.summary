Up to 20,000 people are expected to attend the gig which is the first in the stadium since 1982.
Llandudno band and recent Brit Awards best breakthrough act, Catfish and the Bottlemen will support the Stereophonics.
Glyndwr University hopes it will be the first of many live shows at the stadium.
Lynda Powell, the university's director of operations, said it was a "major coup".
The last gig at the stadium, which is home of Wrexham FC, saw rock legends Motorhead perform along with Budgie, Tank, Raven, Orion and Twisted Sister.
