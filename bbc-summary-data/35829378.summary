The opener was struck on the hand by a bouncer from Shamilia Connell that then hit the grille of her helmet, and she was carried off on a stretcher.
The 27-year-old was discharged from hospital with a broken thumb and is awaiting further medical reports.
Pakistan have replaced her with 21-year-old right-hander Ayesha Zafar.
"We were really shocked by the incident," said West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor.
"We have now been told she is fine, and that gives us relief."
