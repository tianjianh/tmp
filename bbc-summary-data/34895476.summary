Kenya's Jacob Keli scored for the 2013 winners of the regional tournament in the 29th minute, before substitute Micheal Olunga made it 2-0 four minutes after the break.
The Group B victory was particularly sweet for Kenya's Scottish coach Bobby Williamson who formerly coached Uganda, and had previously won the Cecafa Cup with the Cranes.
It is good to start a tournament like this on a winning note
"It is good to start a tournament like this on a winning note," said Williamson after a victory against a Uganda team who last week qualified for the group phase of 2018 World Cup qualifying.
Kenya, who failed to make it to the next phase of World Cup qualifiers, were a more dominant side with a good tactical approach.
Keli's goal came off a well timed Eric Johanna cross that beat the Cranes defenders.
Uganda dominated play in the second half but missed key opportunities.
They proved costly as substitute Olunga - who replaced Keli - made no mistake with his finish.
The loss leaves Uganda, the record 13-time Cecafa Cup winners, bottom of Group B.
Kenya top the group, while Burundi - who beat Zanzibar 1-0 on Saturday - are second.
In an earlier game on Sunday, Tanzania humbled Somalia 4-0 in a Group A game.
John Bocco and Elias Maguli netted a brace each to make sure Tanzania top the group.
On Monday action shifts to Bahir Dar where fast improving South Sudan take on Djibouti and guest side Malawi battle Sudan in Group C ties.
