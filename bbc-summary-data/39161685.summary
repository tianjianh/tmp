The Northern Irishman is nine under after a round that included an eagle, as he holed out from 151 yards on the par-four 14th, and six birdies.
Americans Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas are tied for second with England's Ross Fisher.
Another Englishman, Andy Sullivan, is on five under after a 65.
He is tied for fifth with world number one Dustin Johnson, while England's Tyrell Hatton is a shot further back.
Hatton's compatriot Lee Westwood, the joint overnight leader, stayed at four under after a level-par 71 and is in a five-way tie for 14th that includes compatriot Matthew Fitzpatrick.
World number three McIlroy, 27, is playing his first tournament after seven weeks out with a rib injury.
His round could have been even better but he bogeyed the 12th and 17th.
"I'm in a great position, but I felt like I could have been a few more ahead," said McIlroy.
Olympic champion Justin Rose shot a 72 to move to level par, while American Jordan Spieth is one over and Masters champion Danny Willet is six over.
