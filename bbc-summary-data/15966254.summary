A north London council has begun fining bus and coach operators that allow their vehicles to idle for too long.

It is a move to stop the amount of emissions released by engines turning over at bus stands and coach parking bays.
Starting this week, bus operators that allow idling of more than four minutes in the borough can be fined Â£80.
Camden Council said that some areas in the borough were in breach of European and national air quality standards.
A spokeswoman said that engine idling increased levels of nitrogen dioxide and fine particles, two major air pollutants.
She added that "the lives of many who use or live alongside the capital's busiest roads are being shortened".
The fines were introduced on 29 November.
Sean Birch, Camden's cabinet member for sustainability and transport, said air quality in some locations was "in breach of European Commission standards and national objectives, which are there to protect the health of our residents, visitors and working population".
