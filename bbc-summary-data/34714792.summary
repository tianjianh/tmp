Kevin Pietersen: Batsman opposes day-night Test matches

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has derided the idea of day-night Test cricket, accusing administrators of "messing with the greatness" of the five-day game.

Australia and New Zealand will contest the first day-night Test under lights in Adelaide from 27 November to try out a concept designed to boost crowds.
Pietersen, 35, told the BBC World Service's Stumped he was "not a fan".
"Test cricket is the pinnacle. Wickets change at night," he said.
"Who wants to see a new ball at certain grounds around the world at 8 o'clock at night under lights. Are you mad?"
The Adelaide Test, the last of a three-match series starting in Brisbane on Thursday, will feature a pink ball, designed to be visible under floodlights, while still allowing players to wear traditional whites.
The Kookaburra ball has drawn mixed reviews from players, with claims it does not swing as much as its red or white counterpart and is difficult to see under the lights.
Pietersen, a freelance Twenty20 player having been discarded by England last year, is more concerned by the principle of disregarding the 138-year history of Test cricket.
"Don't mess with the greatness of Test match cricket," he said.
"I speak to a lot of players in all the tournaments I play in. Who wants to face a spinner at half 10 at night or half nine at night? It's not going to spin as much; it's going to skid on.
"You've got to change all the statistics. I don't even know how many runs I got in one-day cricket but I know how many runs I made in Tests and we've got to value that in Test match cricket."
