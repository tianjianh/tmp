The 10 acre (40,000 sq m) blade factory is part of a 133 acre (540,000 sq m) development.
The waterfront location in Alexandra Dock has been turned into a hub for wind power manufacturing, logistics and assembly.
In a to visit to see the 250ft (75m) blade at the site, Mr Clark said: "It's a huge day for Hull, for the Humber, but also for the country.
"Hull has established itself as an important manufacturing and engineering centre for this innovative and exciting new industry."
Juergen Maier, of Siemens, said: "I hope it will be a catalyst for further significant investments by our suppliers, customers and the industry at large."
