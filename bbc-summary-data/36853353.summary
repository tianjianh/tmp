New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury and Indiana Fever were fined $5,000 (£3,773) while their players each received a $500 (£377) fine.
The teams wore the #BlackLivesMatter shirts following the deaths of two men and five police officers on 7 July.
WNBA rules state that uniforms may not be altered in any way.
"Don't say we have a voice and then fine us because we use it," Phoenix Mercury forward Mistie Bass tweeted.
