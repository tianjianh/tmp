Plans to cope with increased demand for paediatric beds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan has been implemented to cope with an increased demand for paediatric intensive care beds in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12-bed unit at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children is currently full.
A theatre recovery unit is being converted to increase the number of beds.
The Belfast Trust says the measures are required due to the early onset of seasonal bronchiolitis.
Bronchiolitis is a respiratory condition which affects many infants, but can develop into a serious chest infection.
All paediatric elective surgery was cancelled on Friday, so 14 planned operations had to be postponed.
The Trust said the situation will be reviewed on a daily basis. It has restricted visiting to parents and guardians only.
A seriously ill child who could not be accommodated at the children's hospital in Belfast was transferred to Dublin on Thursday.
It is understood there is also a shortage of beds there.
It is not the first time the theatre recovery unit at the Children's Hospital has been used as an overflow for PICU.  It also happened over the Christmas and New Year period last year.
There are currently no plans to transfer children to intensive care beds in England.
