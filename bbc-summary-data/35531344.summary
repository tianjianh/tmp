[SN]TITLE[SN]
'No enthusiasm' for state funding of political parties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is "no enthusiasm" for political parties to ask the taxpayer to fund their activities, the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord Bew wrote to all the major parties about the issue after last year's election - but only the Conservatives and SNP replied, he said.
He argued that the public were also "not sympathetic" to state funding.
The committee has recommended parties get an extra Â£23m of state cash.
Its 2011 inquiry also recommended a Â£10,000 annual cap on individual donations from 2015 and the idea that union members should have to "opt in" to fees paid to Labour if donations were to be counted individually.
'Deeply rooted' perception
But during a Lords committee on trade union and political party funding, Lord Bew said: "The difficulty of the issues relates not just to the attitude of the parties."
In their letter back to him, the Conservatives pointed out that voters were also not sympathetic to state funding, he said.
While the public was in favour of electoral reform, there was also a "deeply rooted" perception that money was only given to political parties with the expectation of something like a peerage in return.
"All I can do is write to the parties, which I do periodically, and I have no reason to believe that there's any enthusiasm to address this," he said.
'Price worth paying?'
Sir Christopher Kelly, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said "it was wrong that any of the parties should be wholly reliant on significant sums from significant donors" whether from individuals, those donating through private companies or trade unions.
But Liberal Democrat treasurer Lord Wrigglesworth said: "I can't see a time when the political parties are going to be willing to go to the taxpayer and ask for money for their organisations."
Sir Christopher conceded that if members of a focus group were asked if more money should go to political parties, they would say "not on your Nelly".
But if they were pressed: "Do you think it's a price worth paying to... take big money out of politics?" They would say "of course", he said.
