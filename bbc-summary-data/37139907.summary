[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
However it was the Silkmen who harried their opponents from the get-go. David Fitzpatrick and Kingsley James both tested goalkeeper Paul Farman.
James found the breakthrough for John Askey's men on the stroke of half-time. Danny Rowe set up Chris Holroyd to hit a post, and the midfielder was first to the rebound.
The Imps turned it all around in the second half. Harry Anderson got on the end of a swift counter-attack and beat Richie Branagan with a low drive on the hour.
And substitute Adam Marriott then showed Lincoln's goalscoring depth by converting a Luke Waterfall knock down to complete the comeback.
