Judge Jonathan Bennett said he found it "difficult to comprehend" that someone could assault an ambulance crew who were sent to help them.
Mark Ward, assistant local security management specialist at EMAS, said: "Actions like this make their job even harder and we will always take action where we can.
"We have a zero-tolerance approach to any level of abuse or assault against our staff."
