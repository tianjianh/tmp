Pakistan 'jails Indian man for espionage'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Indian national who went missing in Pakistan more than three years ago has been jailed for espionage, reports say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hamid Nehal Ansari confessed to spying and was jailed for three years by a military court, a prison official, who asked not to be named, told the BBC.
There were no further details, and the military has not officially commented.
Ansari entered Pakistan's Kohat region illegally via Afghanistan in 2012, and was held by the army, media reports said.
His family, who struggled to determine his whereabouts until earlier this year, have told Indian media they believe he entered Pakistan to search for a woman he had befriended online.
Pakistan and India frequently arrest each other's citizens, often accusing them of being spies after they have strayed across the land or maritime border.
The two neighbours have a history of mistrust and have fought three wars.
