A girl has told a jury former Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson "made her out to be a liar" following a sexual encounter in his car.

Appearing via video-link, she told Bradford Crown Court about sex acts that allegedly took place in the winger's Range Rover when she was 15 years old.
Mr Johnson, 28, who has 12 England caps, is accused of two counts of sexual activity with a child.
The footballer denies the charges.
The girl, now aged 16, told the court she did not mention some of the more serious activity at first because she was trying to "protect the player".
She was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending Mr Johnson, whether she was still trying to protect him.
"No, because he did nothing to protect me and he made me out to be a liar," she said.
Mr Pownall asked the girl whether she "absolutely hated" Johnson now.
She said: "Yes, I do, after everything he's put us through.
"He told everyone he was innocent and he made people call me a liar.
"He let people cheer him on in matches and he let people call me all the names under the sun."

Speaking through tears for much of her evidence, the girl claimed she had been "bigging herself up" with some messages to friends on social media.
Referring to one Snapchat message which was pasted into Facebook, Mr Pownall asked about her saying: "He's picking me up this week and I'm riding him."
The teenager replied: "I was trying to big myself up as any 15-year-old girl would.
"When you idolise someone and that happens to you, you're not thinking at the time."
The girl wiped away tears as she told the jury she never thought she would end up explaining herself in court.
Mr Pownall again asked the girl whether she was just trying to protect herself.
She said: "I wasn't protecting myself. It made no difference to me whether they knew about me and Adam Johnson. It was him who was going to suffer for it."
The girl insisted to the court she never wanted to get Mr Johnson into trouble.
She said: "I didn't want that to happen to him. I saw myself as playing a part in it as well, I thought I'd done wrong too."
The girl began sobbing again and asked for a break.
Born in Sunderland, Mr Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.
The trial continues.
The footballer has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming. He was sacked by Sunderland as a result.
