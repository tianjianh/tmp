He won for his role as Scorpius Malfoy in 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' at London's Palace theatre.
The show, a sequel to JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels, has been a critical and commercial success.
The Olivier awards are the most prestigious awards in British theatre. Boyle, 22, is from west Belfast and his family still live in the area.
He is a former pupil of De La Salle College and St Louise's Comprehensive College.
His win was announced at the award ceremony in London's Royal Albert Hall.
Speaking immediately afterwards, Boyle thanked his family for their support.
"I didn't think I was going to win, so I didn't even write a speech!" He said.
Boyle won the coveted award ahead of nominees Rafe Spall, Brian J Smith and Freddie Fox.
