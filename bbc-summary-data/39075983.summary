An unnamed Tyrone footballer has claimed an "ongoing battle" with the county's GAA board over funding is hurting the team's All-Ireland chances.

The anger about the Red Hand squad's funding was aired in an email sent to Irish radio station Newstalk's Off the Ball programme.
"It's becoming impossible to prepare ourselves to win an All-Ireland," said the unnamed player.
"We are told that we need to tighten our belts."
A recent Irish Independent survey listed Tyrone as only being 25th in terms of spending on senior inter-county football teams in 2016.
The county's funding last year was reported to be £17,800 down on the 2015 figure.
Tyrone spent £408,000 on the team in 2016 with the highest spenders Mayo's figure said to be almost £1.4m.
"When we look at the money spent on the preparation of the county teams we are nowhere near the top spenders," continued the player's email.
"Most club people and fans will be sickened to hear this but it's time to call it out."
In response, Tyrone county chairman Roisin Jordan has insisted that the county's GAA board is fully behind the team's efforts to win another Sam Maguire Cup.
"In terms of finance, Tyrone are highly fortunate to have generous backers in the form of corporate sponsors and Club Tyrone," she said in a statement.
"It is incumbent upon Tyrone GAA to ensure their investment is properly applied to GAA purposes.
"Let there be no doubt that everyone within Tyrone GAA are fully behind Mickey Harte and his County team.
She added: "Within Tyrone GAA we avail of regular meetings between Executive officers, team management, and players liaison officers.
"It is at such meetings that we discuss a range of issues involving games, administration and finances.  I welcome such a forum to allow for an exchange of views, so that each can explain and understand any constraints which may apply.
"Any major decisions involving funding, or curbing expenditure, will ultimately be decisions for Tyrone County Committee and not individuals, nor private emails exchanged between individuals."
