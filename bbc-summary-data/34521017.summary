Essex and England all-rounder Ravi Bopara has signed a new two-year deal with the club.

The 30-year-old topped Essex's batting charts in the 2015 One-Day Cup, scoring 301 runs at an average of 75.25.
He also played 12 County Championship matches this summer and headed their bowling averages in the T20 Blast, with 19 wickets at a cost of 16.11 each.
Bopara played the most recent of his 120 one-day internationals in the 2015 World Cup against Afghanistan.
Essex finished third in Division Two of the Championship, but Bopara believes new cricket committee chairman Ronnie Irani can change the direction of the side.
"The club is making some changes with Ronnie on board," he told the club website.
"I've played a lot under Ronnie, I know him very well, and I'm trusting him to get things the way we all want here at Essex.
"We're a team that should be competing and performing at a higher level than we are. I think we can achieve that with a couple of new signings and I'm confident that the club will get that right."
