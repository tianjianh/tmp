Former Exeter player Pope, 26, can also play on the wing and joined the Championship club in 2013.
May, 22, has made 69 appearances for the Penzance-based side, and has been their top point-scorer for the past two seasons.
Moyle, 24, can play at full-back, wing or fly-half, and made his Pirates debut in 2012.
"All three individuals have developed as players, and Laurence is now one of the standout 10s in the Championship," said coach Gavin Cattle.
