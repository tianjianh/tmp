It comes after a year which has seen a number of terror attacks, such as the killing of 39 people at a Tunisian resort and mass shootings in Paris.
The Queen will describe the festive period as "a time to remember all that we have to be thankful for".
This year's message, produced by ITN, will be broadcast on television and radio at 15:00 GMT.
Her Majesty will say during her broadcast: "It is true that the world has had to confront moments of darkness this year, but the Gospel of John contains a verse of great hope, often read at Christmas carol services: 'The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it'."
This year marked the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two, and the Queen will again offer thanks for the service and sacrifice of those who took part in the conflict.
She will also give thanks to "the people who bring love and happiness into our own lives", starting with family.
The Queen recorded her Christmas message while at a desk in Buckingham Palace's 18th Century Room. She writes her own address, which is one of the rare occasions when she voices her own views.
She is seen wearing a tweed day dress in white and silver, which was part of an outfit worn for a Diamond Jubilee visit to Wales in 2012.
On her left shoulder is an art deco diamond and aquamarine brooch, previously owned by the Queen Mother.
Her broadcast will also be available on the Royal Channel on YouTube and will be shown in Commonwealth countries.
