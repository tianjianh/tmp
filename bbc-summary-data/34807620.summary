[SN]TITLE[SN]
Western Greyhound and Black Velvet Travel bus companies' licences revoked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two bus companies in Cornwall and Hampshire have had their licences revoked by the traffic commissioner and their director disqualified.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision comes after "unsatisfactory" vehicle maintenance at Western Greyhound Limited (WGL) and Black Velvet Travel Limited (BVTL).
In one case, a bus lost two wheels when in service on the M3, causing a crash.
Director Michael Bishop has been disqualified from holding or obtaining an operator's licence.
WGL, based near Newquay, is currently in administration and Eastleigh-based BVTL is in liquidation.
The written decision by traffic commissioner Sarah Bell follows a public inquiry on 10 September.
Mr Bishop has also been disqualified from being involved in the management, administration or control of a transport operation.
He became the director of BVTL in August 2014, having previously been the director of a company which went into liquidation owing in excess of Â£1m, Miss Bell said.
BVTL was placed in compulsory liquidation in June 2015.
In December 2014, two wheels came off a BVTL vehicle on the M3 and one struck an HGV.
The vehicle did not have an MOT, Miss Bell said.
That month, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) was also notified of a number of complaints about the reliability of the BVTL services, and Miss Bell said her office was also told of unsatisfactory maintenance issues at WGL.
WGL was sold to Mr Bishop in December 2014 and went into administration in March 2015.
