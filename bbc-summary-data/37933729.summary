[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health services in Somerset warn they face a budget deficit of £596m over the next five years if they "do nothing".

Saving suggestions include cuts to maternity services in the county and reducing beds in community hospitals.
The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said "things could not stay the same" and would have to be done "differently".
Trade union Unison South West said there was a "real urgency to deal with the problems facing our NHS".
Dr Matthew Dolman, of the Somerset CCG, said: "It's driven by the fact that people are having more complicated illnesses and those complicated illnesses come with an increased cost.
"So that is driving this really large figure if we do nothing - which is why things can't stay the same. We have to do things differently.
"Part of the problem is that health and care is fragmented. What we're doing is coming together to say, 'right we've got a real problem here, let's work together, let's do things differently'.
Helen Eccles, from Unison, said: "We want to work together with employers to deliver preventative, joined-up services to deal with the predicted 30% rise in the elderly population, public health problems and the challenges of a rural area."
