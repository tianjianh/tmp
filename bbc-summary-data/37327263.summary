An agreement to sell to a group led by Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li fell through amid reports that they did not meet the Premier League's owners' test.
But Li told the Daily Mail: "We still want Hull City and our ambition is to build the club and make it one of the strongest in England."
The consortium paid a seven-figure deposit before the deal collapsed.
The Hull Daily Mail reports the sum paid was around Â£6m and the consortium's period of exclusivity is now over. At least one other consortium is interested in opening negotiations, the newspaper adds.
Hull were put up for sale in 2014 after owner Assem Allam, who took charge of the club in 2010, was incensed by the FA's decision to reject his request to change the club's name to Hull Tigers.
The club have been without a permanent manager since Steve Bruce resigned in July following a fall-out with Allam's son, vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
Mike Phelan has been placed in caretaker charge and won the Premier League's manager of the month award for August after victories in their opening two league games.
