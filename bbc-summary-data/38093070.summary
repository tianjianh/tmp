[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors centre Ryan Mills has been given a two-week suspension for a dangerous tackle in last Friday's 18-17 home defeat by Northampton.

Mills was later yellow-carded following a second incident five minutes into the second half.
But he had already been cited for an earlier first-half incident involving Saints centre Rory Hutchinson.
Mills, 24, will miss Saturday's trip to Exeter and the home game with Wasps on Sunday, 4 December.
The Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel took into account that it was Mills' first game this season after coming back from injury.
"The panel found that the challenge was mistimed owing to a long lay-off and lack of match fitness and was therefore a low-end offence," said a RFU statement. "The panel were satisfied that the player did not intend to tackle his opponent dangerously but was reckless in the execution of the tackle."
Mills was dealt with by the same RFU disciplinary panel in Coventry on Wednesday which also handed out a three-week ban for Northampton flanker Calum Clark, who was also cited and yellow carded for separate incidents in the same match.
