National League side Boreham Wood have signed former Barnet and Cambridge United midfielder Tom Champion on a one-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old left the Bees at the end of the season after making 57 appearances across two seasons.
He had a brief five-game spell in non-league's top flight last season on loan at Lincoln City.
"The project that is going on at Boreham Wood is something that I really want to be a part of," he said.
"I think that the vision of Luke Garrard was a big part in me coming to the club, I have known Luke for a long time and kept up-to-date with how he was doing at Boreham Wood and how he's worked through the ranks there and how well he has done."
