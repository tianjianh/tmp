Mark Davey, 33, from Luton, had set up a fundraising page for Starlight, which grants wishes to seriously and terminally ill children.
Mr Davey, who died from severe head and brain injuries after crashing his Audi in September last year, had cancer as a child.
He had started fundraising on his 30th birthday.
His father Chris said Mr Davey had put on a boxing night and run the London Marathon to raise money.
At the time of his death in September he had raised £8,000 but since then that figure has increased to more than £58,000.
Mr Davey had told his parents he wanted to raise £30,000 for the charity.
Chris Davey said his son had been treated for cancer when he was 12.
"That drove Mark for the rest of his life," he said. "The fundraising was a lovely thought."
Mr Davey taught himself to box in order to hold a charity boxing night, before running the London Marathon.
"At the end of the race he said the only thing that kept him going was the thought of the children," his father said.
An inquest on Wednesday concluded Mr Davey died as a result of a road traffic collision on the A6 at Wixams, Bedfordshire.
He had been seen racing his Audi R8 against a black Porsche 911, with both cars reaching speeds of up to 80mph, at the time of the crash,
Mr Davey, who was a company director at Indigo Residential estate agents in Luton, played as a winger for Luton Rugby Club.
He was driving home after an away game against Bedford Swifts on 13 September when the crash happened.
