The Scottish golf club said a recent consultation found that admitting women members was supported by over three-quarters of those who participated.
Muirfield voted in May not to admit women members and lost its right to stage the Open Championship.
"We welcome this decision by Royal Troon and recognise its significance for the club," the R&A said.
"Our focus is very much on the 145th Open but we can now look forward to many more great Championships at Royal Troon in years to come."
Royal Troon, situated in South Ayrshire, is the host for this year's Open, which runs from 14-17 July.
In January it said it would review of its male-only membership policy.
Club captain Martin Cheyne said: "We have said a number of times recently that it is important for golf clubs to reflect the society in which we exist and the modern world that looks to us.
"Therefore, I am delighted with the decision taken by Members of Royal Troon this evening and look forward to welcoming women to our great Club.
"It is the right decision for the Club today, and for the generations of golfers that will follow."
Mr Cheyne added: "Tonight, we turn our attention to jointly hosting the 145th Open Championship with our great friends at The Ladies Golf Club, Troon.
"We can now all be focused on golf and showcasing this wonderful club and golf course to the huge global audience that this most prestigious Championship commands."
