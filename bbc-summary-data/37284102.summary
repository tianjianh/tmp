Yasmin Kauser, 46, hit the single decker, causing it to crash into a Guide Dogs UK shop on Broadway, Peterborough, on Christmas Eve.
She had earlier admitted one count of careless driving.
Peterborough magistrates heard she had a clean licence for 20 years and her husband, who has cancer, relied on her.
The court heard Kauser, of Park Road, Peterborough, was driving her Kia Sportage at about 11:45 GMT on 24 December when she hit the side of the bus after failing to stop at a junction.

"She pulled out without stopping or slowing," Graham Allen, prosecuting, said.
"This caused the bus to collide with the shop front, causing substantial damage."
The bus driver and several passengers were injured during the impact.
Kauser and her passenger also sustained minor injuries.
Although no-one inside the Guide Dogs UK shop was hurt, the front of the shop was destroyed and staff were forced to find a new office in the city.
At the time of the accident, Alex Caruso, a passenger on the bus, said: "We didn't see where the car was coming from.
"The bus driver started braking, veered away from other cars and came to a stop in the building, but to avoid any other people and cars was a miracle."
In mitigation, the court heard Kauser was normally a careful driver and needed her car to get to hospital appointments in Birmingham, where she was being treated for the autoimmune disease lupus.
Her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer, also relied heavily on her.
Chair of the magistrates' bench, Alan Jones, said: "It is an unfortunate offence where one mistake has caused both injury and significant damage.
"Your driving record suggests you're normally a careful driver and we are prepared to deal with this as a one-off incident rather than general bad driving."
As well as the points and fine, Kauser was ordered to pay £105 in costs.
