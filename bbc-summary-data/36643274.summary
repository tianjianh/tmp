Kevin Durant of Oklahoma City Thunder also made the 12-man team.
Thompson's Golden State Warriors team-mates Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green were also named, but Steph Curry, the NBA's most valuable player, had already ruled himself out.
Irving's Cleveland Cavaliers team-mate LeBron James also withdrew in June, explaining: "I could use the rest."
James led the Cavaliers to this season's NBA title as they became the first team to overturn a 3-1 deficit in the best-of-seven finals against the Warriors.
The US will be favourites to win a third consecutive Olympic gold under coach Mike Krzyzewski, who will leave after the games following a decade in the job.
Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs is set to replace him after Rio.
The Americans play five warm-up games before the start of the men's Olympic tournament on 6 August.
Carmelo Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Jimmy Butler, DeMarcus Cousins, DeMar DeRozan, Kevin Durant, Paul George,Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, Kyle Lowry, Klay Thompson.
