Walsall's League One promotion hopes took another blow as in-form Barnsley left them without a win in six games.

After Anthony Forde's free-kick had hit the post, the visitors went up the other end to seize a 17th-minute lead through Ash Fletcher's low effort.
Walsall top scorer Tom Bradshaw poked in to level by half-time for the hosts.
But Barnsley then scored twice in six minutes, Josh Brownhill's dipping drive beating Neil Etheridge before Harry Chapman sealed it with a low drive.
The Saddlers, who have now failed to win in six home games at Bescot since the turn of the year, sit fourth in the table, five points behind second-placed Wigan.
Barnsley's 11th win in 13 league games lifts them up into the play-off zone into sixth, after leapfrogging over Coventry City, who are three points behind.
Walsall head coach Sean O Driscoll told BBC WM:

"A disappointing result. They're a really good team. If you give them two goals it's going to be difficult for you.
"First half, we were excellent. We were the best team. Their goalkeeper's kept them in it and they scored against the run of play.
"We got back into the game, created chances and came in at half time extremely confident that we could go on and win."
