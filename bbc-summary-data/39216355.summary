Oliver Tetlow, 27, was murdered in Harlesden, north London, on 9 March 2016.
Making an appeal for witnesses his mother Pamela Humphrey said the family has "lived through a terrible year of grief and sadness".
Four people charged with his murder were acquitted last year.
Detectives have said they followed up on numerous leads, have spoken to in excess of 100 witnesses and have trawled through hours of CCTV footage.
"A significant amount of information has been obtained and passed to officers but they have yet to receive the vital piece of information that would finally put the killer or killers behind bars," a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.
Ms Humphrey said: "This appeal is not only for us, but for your family, your friends, innocent bystanders who could be murdered like Oliver was.
"We are searching for justice, to feel safe in the knowledge that whoever killed Oliver will be taken off our streets.
"We have lived through a terrible year of grief and sadness, having a talented young man with so much to look forward to in life torn from us.
"Every day I miss my son, my family miss him, Oliver's friends miss him, every day we think of him, every day we all grieve for him. Our pain goes on."
Appealing for witnesses, Det Ch Insp Mark Lawson said: "You may not have come forward at the time of the murder, now is the time to do so. Please do not remain silent.
"A year is a long time to go without answers and I would ask that you to take a moment and think about the devastation that has been caused to Oliver's family."
The Â£10,000 reward has been offered by Crimestoppers.
