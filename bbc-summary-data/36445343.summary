The 26-year-old made 122 appearances for the Devon club in his first spell and played in their League Two play-off final defeat against Stevenage in 2011.
He was asked to prove his fitness to earn a new deal at Aldershot, but will join their National League rivals.
"He's an excellent footballer that can play off both feet," said Torquay player-boss Kevin Nicholson.
"I see Damon coming back and filling the role in midfield that Danny Racchi played last season."
