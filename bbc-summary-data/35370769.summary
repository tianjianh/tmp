School closures in Dumfries education overhaul agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The closure and relocation of five Dumfries schools has been agreed as part of an education overhaul.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Learning Town project includes the creation of a Lochside campus to serve the north west of the town.
Maxwelltown High, St Ninian's and Lochside primaries and Langlands school for children with complex needs would relocate to the new campus.
The Elmbank Centre for secondary pupils with behavioural difficulties would also shut under the proposals.
It would be replaced with a new support service which would operate in existing schools and also from a proposed new learning hub.
