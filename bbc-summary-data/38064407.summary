Jo Cox case: Thomas Mair will not offer court defence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man accused of murdering MP Jo Cox will not give evidence in his defence, the Old Bailey has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Mair, 53, is accused of murdering the Labour politician in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June, a week before the EU referendum vote.
The 41-year-old was shot and stabbed outside a constituency surgery.
Jurors heard that Mr Mair, who denies murder, said in his first court appearance "death to traitors - freedom for Britain" when asked his name.
He also denies grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger.
His defence, Simon Russell Flint QC, said Mr Mair had no previous convictions or cautions.
The court also heard from Mrs Cox's close friend and colleague Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who said it had been a dream come true for Mrs Cox - MP for Batley and Spen - to stand for her local area.
In a statement read out in court, he said she would talk about the joy of representing a diverse community.
He described her as an internationalist, who saw the world as being very small.
Her priority was the poor and dispossessed, he said, and she had no interest in party political point scoring.
The last time he saw her was a week before her death at a party on her houseboat, the court heard.
She was incredibly well-liked and popular, and always found time for people, he added.
In his closing speech, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said the evidence was compelling that Mr Mair had murdered Mrs Cox outside Birstall library as constituents waited to speak to her.
He said she was most likely shot once in the head with a sawn-off rifle, then stabbed with a dagger.
Despite having the "element of surprise", Mr Mair failed in his first attempt and returned to shoot and stab Mrs Cox once more, the court heard.
Mr Whittam said: "Perhaps he underestimated Jo Cox's tenacity and courage."
Mr Whittam returned to evidence from one of Mrs Cox's aides, Fazila Aswat, who told the trial the man had said "Britain first" as he carried out the attack.
She described cradling the MP's head in her lap, as she urged her and another colleague to "get away - let him hurt me, not you".
Mr Whittam told the jury: "The sheer barbarity of her murder and the utter cowardice of her murder bring the two extremities of humanity face to face."
He said the attack had brought out the best in people, including a 77-year-old man who was wounded trying to help Mrs Cox and people in a cake shop who attempted CPR to try to save her.
He submitted that Mr Mair's defence counsel did not have enough substance to dent the prosecution case.
A blood spot from Jo Cox was found on the gun, he said, and the dagger also had DNA associated with Mr Mair and Mrs Cox on it.
