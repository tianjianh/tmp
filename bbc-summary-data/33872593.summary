A quarterback for the New York Jets will not be able to play for at least six weeks after a team-mate "sucker-punched" him and broke his jaw.

Geno Smith and linebacker Ikemefuna Enemkpali got into an altercation inside the locker room on Tuesday, Jets Coach Todd Bowles said.
"It had nothing to do with football," Bowles said of the fight. "It was something very childish."
Enemkpali, a relative newcomer, lost his job after landing the punch.
"You don't walk up to another man and punch him in the face," Bowles said.
The team was training for the upcoming American football season, which begins later this month. Smith is expected to miss several games.
Smith, who was competing to become the team's starting quarterback, will need surgery to fix his jaw.
With Smith sidelined, the team's other quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick is likely to assume the starting role.
Later on Tuesday, Smith posted a closed-mouthed photo on Instagram with the caption "I'll be back".
